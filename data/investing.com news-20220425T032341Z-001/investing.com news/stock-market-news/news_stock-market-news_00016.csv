By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) stock fell by 2% in Friday’s premarket after two guests on board its Celebrity Millennium cruise tested positive for Covid-19.
The guests are asymptomatic and in isolation, and the cruise operator said it was conducting contact tracing and expediting testing for all those in close contact with the individuals.
Celebrity Millennium was one of the first cruises in North America to restart sailing last week.
Cruise operators are among the last companies to return to operations as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laid out strict guidelines for their resumption after some ships were discovered to be hotbeds for the virus last year.
CDC’s guidelines included a fully vaccinated crew and everyone over 16 presenting proof of being vaccinated against the virus."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has asked  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) a number of times in recent months to name a successor to chairman Paul Achleitner as the end of his term nears, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Achleitner is due to retire next May after 10 difficult years in office that saw two changes of CEO, billions of euros of losses and huge fines. 
The 64-year-old has survived three shareholder votes on whether to oust him but said he will go next year.
With less than a year to go, the bank's supervisor, the ECB, is still waiting for Deutsche to identify a successor and has ratcheted up pressure on Germany's biggest bank and its chairman in recent months, the people said.
The ECB's chief supervisor Andrea Enria has addressed this question multiple times in ongoing high-level communication with the bank, said one of the people, who is an official with direct knowledge of the matter.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
Deutsche has recently returned to profit but remains under the close watch of regulators who guard the health of the global financial system, of which the bank, as one of the world's biggest lenders, is a critical part.
In particular, they have been concerned by lapses in Deutsche's money laundering controls - a problem that extends back throughout Achleitner's tenure.
In a major setback for Deutsche, Germany's financial watchdog BaFin in April ordered it to enact further money laundering safeguards and extended a mandate for a special monitor to keep track of progress.
The ECB is making the repeated demands because it wants Achleitner to leave in an orderly fashion, with the central bank having enough time to vet the candidate to replace him, the people said.
Three people familiar with the bank's search for a successor said there was a shortlist of three German men, with one adding that Deutsche would be ready to announce a successor by February or March next year. Such a late date would leave little room for manoeuvre should the candidate fall through.
If the men remain the frontrunners, it may also spark questions about lack of diversity as Deutsche seeks to install more female leaders. [nL2N2NJ0F6]
German stock exchange chief Theodor Weimer was the preferred candidate, the three people said.
Weimer, however, has publicly dismissed the idea saying earlier this year that his taking the post was ""not at all a topic of discussion"". A spokesperson for Weimer declined to comment further.
It is unclear whether Weimer could change his mind. His contract as CEO of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) was extended last year to 2024. Regulators would not approve his keeping both posts, the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Furthermore, accepting the position at Deutsche Bank would require him to resign from a job that paid him 6 million euros last year - a multiple of Achleitner's earnings.
Also in the running, the three people said, are Norbert Winkeljohann, an accountant and chair of Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), and Frank Witter, a new board member who was until recently Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s finance chief. 
Winkeljohann did not respond to a request for comment and Witter declined to comment.
Achleitner has privately sought to reassure investors that the search is underway. In recent weeks, he told investors that the new chair's name will very likely begin with the letter 'W', according to one person with knowledge of the matter.
But the vague nature of his plans has left regulators, and some investors, frustrated. 
""The quicker we have clarity over a successor the better,"" said Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Rothacker of Union Investment, a shareholder in the group.
Regulators have struggled for years to rein in Deutsche Bank following numerous scandals and governance issues. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has investigated the lender's role https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-exclus-idUSKBN1Y60ED in the 200 billion euro ($220 billion) Danske Bank money laundering scandal, people familiar with the inquiry have told Reuters.
Deutsche has also had to pay nearly $700 million in fines by U.S. and British regulators in a separate money laundering case involving $10 billion in so-called mirror trades from Russia.
The bank has said it has significantly improved controls in recent years. 

Earlier this year, the ECB clashed with CEO Christian Sewing, demanding he relinquish day-to-day oversight of Deutsche's sprawling investment bank, fearing he had too much on his plate.
Sewing, who eventually complied, for his part has sharply criticised the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy that has required lenders to pay to deposit money with the central bank and eroded profits.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The auto financing arms of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plan to stop giving new credit to car buyers and dealers in India and will exit from the country, sources aware of the development told Reuters. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Finance Private Ltd, the German carmaker's finance arm, stopped giving loans to car buyers in India last year and in May told dealers of all VW brands, which includes Volkswagen, Skoda and Audi, to find other financing, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks said. 
As some customers failed to make repayments, the finance unit has suffered losses, and will close for business by Dec. 31, the sources said.
More than 50% of Volkswagen group dealers use credit from the finance arm, they said. 
Volkswagen Finance Private Ltd said in a statement that it had acquired a major stake in Indian loan brokerage portal KUWY Technologies to service its retail customers. 
It is in talks with dealers and will review its business strategy by the end of the year, the company said.
The auto finance arms are classified as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and they compete with banks for providing credit. But banks have access to cheaper funding so can offer loans at lower rates than those offered by NBFCs or shadow lenders.
To offset the disadvantage, Volkswagen and Ford would offer incentives to those dealers who have used their credit finance, the sources said.
Dealers typically need credit to buy cars from automakers which they then sell on to customers. 
Volkswagen's plan to exit the financing business has surprised dealers, coming weeks ahead of the launch of Skoda's new sport-utility vehicle (SUV) to boost sales in India, the two sources said.
Skoda dealers have been asked to find new financing by the end of the month - a tight deadline ahead of a new model launch, one source said. 
Ford Credit, the automaker's financing arm, stopped lending to car buyers at the end of last year and will cease credit to dealers by June 30, two separate sources said.
The decision to exit the financing business comes at a time when Ford is finalising a new strategy for India after ending ties with Mahindra & Mahindra on Dec. 31.

A Ford Motor India spokesperson said the company regularly assesses market conditions for its credit business and the decision to discontinue was conveyed to dealers in October - before it made any announcement on the Mahindra partnership.
""We are confident the auto financing sector in India can support Ford customer and dealer new financing needs. Our team continues to service our existing book of business,"" the spokesperson said, adding that 25%-30% of its dealers do business with Ford Credit.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc delivered a high-performance version of its Model S on Thursday, aiming to reignite interest in the nearly decade-old sedan and fend off rivals such as Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Lucid Motors in the luxury electric vehicle market.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) redefined electric cars in 2012 when it launched its high-end Model S with a sleek design and long driving range, and Chief Executive Elon Musk said the new version was designed for a future where cars drove themselves.
""This car crushes,"" Musk said at an evening delivery event held at Tesla's U.S. factory in Fremont, California. 
""It's like, man, this is, just, sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, be the safest cars, gonna be the most kick-ass cars in every way.""
Musk's irreverent attitude and speeches peppered with engineering terms, have given him a star power he uses to draw attention to the brand, allowing Tesla to avoid advertising.
The model is ""faster than any Porsche, safer than any Volvo,"" said Musk, wearing a black leather jacket, after he drove the Model S Plaid down a test track onto the stage. 
He said he expects to produce 1,000 a week next quarter.
Ahead of the event, Tesla raised the price by $10,000 to $129,990 against $79,990 for a long-range Model S.
""The Model S has not been changing a lot in terms of looks over the past almost decade,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director at car information provider Edmunds. ""I think Tesla has to offer consumers something more ... like new and fun things.""
The launch of the Model S Plaid, which has already been showcased online, has faced delay and some controversy over an expected airplane-style yoke steering wheel. Musk canceled another variant, Model S Plaid+, which would have had a 33% higher driving range than the Model S Plaid and used advanced battery technology, known as 4680 cells. 
""The Model S Plaid is definitely intended to help reduce the migration of current Tesla owners out of Tesla,"" said Ed Kim, vice president at consultancy AutoPacific. ""I think what we're seeing now is that Tesla can no longer operate in a vacuum."" 
He said Model S Plaid is a low-volume, halo model aimed at showcasing the automaker and generating excitement around the sedan, with Tesla needing to successfully roll out new models like Cybertruck and Semi trucks to expand its customer base. 
Musk has called the Model S Plaid ""the fastest accelerating car ever.""
The more powerful sports sedan goes from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in 1.99 seconds and has an estimated driving range of 390 miles (627.6 km).
While it offers little change in body style, the Plaid charges faster at Tesla supercharger stations, has a roomier back seat and an improved entertainment system, including what he said was the ""level of a PlayStation five."" 
""If we're thinking about the future where the car is often in autopilot to full self driving mode, then entertainment is going to become increasingly important. So you're going to want to watch movies, play games, use the internet..."" 
Tesla delivered only 2,020 Model S/Xs in the first quarter, down from 18,920 the previous quarter, hampered by production delays. 

Musk said in April that production of its new Model S and X would be ""contingent on global supply chain issues.""
Tesla shares rose 1.9% on Thursday ahead of the evening event.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock fell almost 4% premarket Friday a day after providing investors with an ambitious long term goal.
At its Investor Day on Thursday, the company laid its plan to reach $10 billion in product revenue by the end of 2028 (FY29), a sharp rise from fiscal 2021’s $554 million, with a long-term operating margin target of 10%.
“The new product revenue guide underscores management’s confidence in its ability to continue to grow at elevated rates for many years. In addition, it's important to note that this long-term guide doesn't even include any of this week's product announcements,”  Mizuho  's (NYSE:MFG) Gregg Moskowitz said in a note, according to StreetInsider.
Investors may have wanted even more even, Moskowitz added, as he remains bullish on the stock.
That said, the stock is up 30% in the last month, and investors may have wanted to bank some profits.
Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) analyst Ittai Kidron is also positive on the company's platform direction and growth prospects. He has an outperform rating, with a price target of $320 per share, a premium of almost 30% to Thursday’s closing price of $248.80."

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, global equity funds faced net outflows of $12.8 billion, the biggest since the week ended April 28. 
Graphic: Fund flows into global equities bonds and money markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgkmampq/Fund%20flows%20into%20global%20equities%20bonds%20and%20money%20markets.jpg 
However, the outflows were mainly focussed on U.S. equity funds, which witnessed net sales of $17.5 billion, while Europe and Asian equity funds obtained inflows of $4.2 billion and $1.9 billion respectively.
Data released on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in May, leading to the biggest annual increase in 13 years.
However, the jump was seen as not enough to change the Federal Reserve's view that rising consumer prices will be transitory or alter its easy monetary policy. 
Graphic: Global fund flows into equity sectors - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbrbdwvq/Global%20fund%20flows%20into%20equity%20sectors.jpg 
Investors sold $575 million in consumer discretionary sector funds and $288 million in utilities sector funds. Tech sector funds faced their first outflow in three weeks, the data showed. 
However, financial sector funds had net purchases worth $1.5 billion, which was its second straight week of inflows.
In Asia, South Korean equity funds faced $2.2 billion worth of outflows on concerns that its central bank might tighten its monetary policy earlier than expected.
Meanwhile, global bond funds attracted $12.2 billion worth of net buying, despite worries over higher inflation levels. 
Global money market funds also witnessed purchases worth a net $8.1 billion, recording inflows for the fifth straight week.

An analysis of 23,721 emerging-market funds showed equity funds had outflows worth $207 million, while bond funds attracted $1.2 billion, marking a second straight week of inflows.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>",Germany passes law on tougher oversight of supply chains,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's parliament on Friday passed a supply chain act, paving the way for stricter regulation that will force large companies to pay fines of up to 2% of their annual global turnover if they violate the rules.
Under the act, companies in Germany above a certain size must establish due diligence procedures that prevent human rights and environmental abuses within their global supply chains and take action if they find violations at their foreign suppliers.
From 2023, only companies with more than 3,000 employees in Germany will be affected. From 2024, this expands to companies with more than 1,000 employees.
This means that in the first stage more than 900 companies would be affected, and in the second stage around 4,800.
According to the law, a fine of up to 2% of worldwide turnover would be possible in certain cases.
The bill enables the government to temporarily exclude from public tenders companies which received fines of 175,000 euros or more based on the new law.
Industry lobby groups and wholesale businesses have said the new law increases bureaucracy and have warned that it might result in rising prices. 
""Incalculable risks arise for companies,"" said Joachim Lang, general manager at the Federation of German Industry.

Non-government organisation Oxfam were critical that companies would only have to take care of their immediate suppliers and that there was no possibility for forced labourers to file for damages in German courts.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, remaining near record levels, with investors seemingly unconcerned about soaring inflation ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 95 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
The three major indices closed higher Thursday, with the broad-based S&P 500 ending 0.5% higher, hitting a new record during regular trading, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8% higher.
These gains occurred despite U.S. consumer prices rising 5% year-on-year in May, the biggest jump in nearly 13 years, following on from April’s sharp 4.2% climb.
Investors appear to have looked through this release, as the makeup of the index supported Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's repeated assertion that higher inflation will be transitory.
At the same time the recovery in the labor market continued as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 15 months.
Friday's economic data slate is largely confined to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), and so attention will turn to next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. 
That “looks to be one of the big, final event risks before the market shuts up shop for the summer,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The consensus clearly seems to be that though the Fed may hint that a tapering discussion may be closer than before, it will not be rushed into anything.” 
In corporate news, the so-called meme stocks are likely to remain in the spotlight Friday after they all ran into hefty selling during the previous session.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) all suffered double-digit losses on Thursday, pulling back from their recent explosive rallies.
Crude oil prices edged higher Friday, set for their third weekly rise on expectations for a recovery in fuel demand as the global economy bounces back from the pandemic.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.6% at $70.74 a barrel, after climbing Thursday to its highest close since October 2018. Brent was up 0.5% at $72.88, after closing at its highest since May 2019 on Thursday. 
The globe’s top oil producers will need to boost their output in order to meet demand set to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.
""OPEC+ needs to open the taps to keep the world oil markets adequately supplied,"" the Paris-based energy watchdog said in its monthly report. 
""In 2022 there is scope for the 24-member OPEC+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to ramp up crude supply by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) above its July 2021-March 2022 target.”
Later Friday, traders will focus on the latest weekly update from Baker Hughes of the number of oil rigs, while the CFTC will release its weekly commitments of traders report. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,892.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2147.

By Yousef Saba and Scott Murdoch
DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco locked in another $6 billion on Wednesday to help fund a large dividend as it returned to the international debt markets with its first U.S. dollar-denominated sukuk sale, a document showed.
The debt issuance, which will help fund a $75 billion dividend commitment that will mostly go to the government, comprises tranches of three, five and 10 years, a document from one of the banks arranging the deal and seen by Reuters showed.
Aramco sold $1 billion in the three-year tranche at 65 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries (UST), $2 billion in the five-year portion at 85 bps over UST and $3 billion in 10-year paper at 120 bps over UST.
Initial price guidance was around 105 bps over UST for the three-year bonds, around 125 bps over UST for the five-year notes and around 160 bps over UST for the 10-year tranche.
The spreads were tightened after the deal attracted combined orders of more than $60 billion.
Aramco last year maintained its promised $75 billion annual dividend to shareholders despite lower oil prices, and is expected to shoulder significant domestic investments in Saudi Arabia's plans to transform the economy.
Moody's assigned Aramco's sukuk issuance programme an A1 rating with a negative outlook, in line with the negative outlook on existing Aramco ratings and tracking a change in Saudi Arabia's sovereign outlook to negative in May last year.
""The company has displayed a strong commitment to pay $75 billion in annual dividends, which in Moody's view is not sustainable should oil prices fall and remain significantly below $60/bbl,"" Moody's said.
""Interlinkages between Saudi Arabia and the company imply that any change in rating outlook on the government of Saudi Arabia would be mirrored on  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s rating outlook.""
The company chose to issue Islamic bonds over conventional ones due to high demand for the instrument as a result of the low number of dollar sukuk sales in the Gulf this year, a source told Reuters on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY).
Aramco has been widely expected to become a regular bond issuer after its debut $12 billion issuance in 2019 was followed by an $8 billion, five-part transaction in November last year, also used to fund its dividend.

A source had told Reuters that Aramco was expected to raise up to $5 billion with the deal, which had 29 active and passive bookrunners working on it.
Active bookrunners on the deal included Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), NCB Capital and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank. Passive bookrunners included BOC International and Dubai Islamic Bank.

Global shares have pushed to record highs as economic activity begins to scale up after the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged equity markets and the global economy last year.
A recent Reuters poll of analysts found that most expected the rise in stocks to continue this year. Consistent with that view, a total of 68% of respondents to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) second quarter survey predicted a rise in earnings by at least 10% in the next year.
But the greatest threat to financial market stability was a rise in interest rates, according to survey respondents, who included investment professionals in the pension and sovereign wealth fund industry.
A total of 32% of respondents worried about interest rates, more than other concerns such as geopolitics or credit default risk. 
Interest rate rises can be a potential drag on equity earnings and stock prices by raising costs for businesses, while weighing on consumer demand.
The U.S. consumer price index posted on Thursday its biggest year-on-year gain since August 2008.

But the U.S. Federal Reserve has repeatedly said that it expects any rise in inflation to be temporary and that it is too soon to be discussing reducing its monetary stimulus.
Central bank policy will likely be the biggest driver of listed equities in the next six months, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the SWFI survey found.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock plunged 12% in Friday’s premarket trading after the company decided not to go ahead with its attempt to develop a drug for a rare liver disorder.
The is a setback to the biotech’s attempt to broaden its offerings beyond cystic fibrosis drugs.
After reporting results from a mid-stage trial, Vertex said the treatment, VX-864, isn’t likely to substantially benefit patients. This is the second time the company has called off development of a similar compound due to safety issues.
The two attempts were aimed at developing a treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. It’s an inherited disease where the patient’s liver doesn’t make a protein needed to protect itself and the lungs.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Congestion at container shipping ports in southern China is worsening as authorities step up disinfection measures amid a flare-up in COVID-19 cases, causing the biggest backlog since at least 2019. 
More than 150 coronavirus cases have been reported in Guangdong province, a key manufacturing and exporting hub in southern China, since the latest wave of cases struck in late May, triggering local governments to step up prevention and control efforts that have curbed port processing capacity.
Ports in Guangdong, including Yantian https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pNvd8FG-_kBPa1jz4HBj_w, Shekou, Chiwan and Nansha, have issued notices this week suspending vessels from entering ports without advance reservations and will only accept bookings for export-bound containers within three to seven days prior to the arrival of vessels.
Major shipping companies have warned clients of vessel delays, changes to port call schedules, and the possibility of skipping some ports altogether.
Ocean Network Express (ONE) said in a notice on Wednesday that Yantian International Container Terminal continues to operate below capacity because of COVID-related work restrictions while congestion at container terminals at Shekou and Chiwan has surged to over 90% of capacity.
The world's leading container line Maersk on Thursday increased the duration of expected delays at Yantian to 16 days from 14 days previously.
As of Friday, more than 50 container vessels are waiting to dock in the Outer Pearl River Delta, where the ports are located, according to Refinitiv data. 
That compares to around 20 vessels in the same period last year and more than in February 2020 when ports were paralysed because of China's initial COVID-19 outbreak.
Exporters said the impact has been limited so far, as loading delays and slow deliveries have hampered logistics chains since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Basically we had a similar experience last year so we have experience in responding, only the increase in transport costs are getting really astonishing. The freight fees are reflected in the increase in material costs which are up by around 15%-30% already,"" said a sales manager at an electronics cable manufacturer in Shenzhen, a large manufacturing city in Guangdong near Hong Kong.

The sales manager's company had to pay extra fees to deliver products to ports near Shanghai to meet a client deadline. 
Container freight rates from China to Europe [FREIGHTOS-CN-EU] rose to a record of $11,037 per 40-foot container this week, caused by supply chain bottlenecks from a surge in consumer goods demand and some knock-on effects from when a container ship blocked the Suez Canal in March.

PARIS (Reuters) - French billionaire Vincent Bollore's family-owned group has pledged to media giant Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) that it will not request an exemption to file a tender offer on Vivendi's shares if it crosses the 30% threshold in capital ownership or voting rights, Vivendi said.
Vivendi's June 22 annual shareholders' meeting will have a resolution giving Vivendi the possibility of buying back and cancelling up to 50% of its capital, prompting some investors to question the rationale of such a proposition. 
Bollore is Vivendi's top shareholder with a 27% stake in the company. The tycoon effectively controls the Paris-based group. 
Bollore's group said in a letter to Vivendi that it could also sell some of its Vivendi shares if were to participate in the share capital reduction by tendering its shares.
Glass Lewis and ISS, the world's two biggest proxy advisers, have recommended investors vote against the share buy-back and cancellation resolutions, saying it was not in shareholders' best interests.
Glass Lewis cited concerns expressed by activist fund Bluebell that Bollore could use this tool to increase his stake in the media group without making a tender offer.
Vivendi is in the process of spinning off its Universal Music Group (UMG) division, which is the music label behind artists such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.
Glass Lewis and ISS have recommended Vivendi shareholders vote in favour of the spin-off plans, which would see Universal being listed in Amsterdam. The deal includes the distribution of 60% of Universal's shares to Vivendi shareholders. 

Universal is valued at roughly 35 billion euros ($43 billion), including debt, according to Vivendi.

Naked Wines, which sells to its 300,000 customer base via a subscription model, said its advertising costs more than doubled to 42.3 million pounds, or about 12% of total sales, for the year ended March 29, up from 19.8 million pounds a year earlier as it chased new customers in the U.S. and UK.
That paid off, with the Norwich-based company reporting a 53% surge in total customers and a 78% growth in U.S. sales, now its largest market.
However, its shares fell 1.5% to 782 pence by 0729 GMT as its loss before tax nearly doubled to 10.7 million pounds ($15.15 million). Analysts had estimated a loss of 10.4 million pounds, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
""Stay-at-home trends have driven a step-change in volumes for the online wine sector, which Naked is capitalising on – with some encouraging signs of a permanent channel shift from offline to online,"" Stifel analysts said.
However, it is uncertain if the trends would hold up in a post-COVID world, they added.
Naked said its strong performance has continued in the new fiscal year, and estimated an investment of 40-50 million pounds in new customers.

(Reuters) - Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, on Thursday made public the filing for its long-anticipated U.S. stock market listing, setting the stage for what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering this year.
The company - backed by Asia's largest technology investment firms, SoftBank,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent - did not reveal the size of the offering, but sources familiar with the matter had previously told Reuters that it could raise around $10 billion and seek a valuation of close to $100 billion. 
At that valuation, Didi's listing would be the biggest Chinese share offering in the United States since Alibaba raised $25 billion in 2014. 
In its filing on Thursday, Didi revealed slower revenue growth in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hammered ride-hailing companies including Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) as lockdowns were enforced all over the globe. 
Revenue of 141.7 billion yuan ($22.17 billion) was down from 154.8 billion yuan a year earlier, while net loss was 10.6 billion yuan, compared with 9.7 billion yuan a year earlier. 
However, Didi started 2021 strongly, as businesses reopened in China. Revenue more than doubled to 42.2 billion yuan for the three months ended March 31 from 20.5 billion yuan a year earlier. 
CHINESE IPO GOLD RUSH 
Didi confidentially filed for its IPO in April. Two people familiar with the matter on Thursday said Didi was aiming to go public in July. 
The mega IPO highlights the lucrative business opportunity presented by Asian tech giants for Wall Street's big investment banks. 
Earlier this year, Singapore's biggest ride-hailing firm, Grab, struck a $40 billion deal with a special purpose acquisition company to go public in the United States. 
Last year, Chinese companies raised $12 billion from U.S. listings, more than triple the fundraising amount in 2019, according to Refinitiv data. This year is expected to comfortably surpass last year's tally. 
Didi, which merged with then main rival Kuaidi in 2015 to create a smartphone-based transport services giant, counts as its core business a mobile app, where users can hail taxis, privately owned cars, car-pool options and even buses in some cities.
Didi plans to list American Depositary Shares (ADSs) on either Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""DIDI"", the company said. 
Didi Chief Executive Cheng Wei said last year the firm aims to have 800 million monthly active users globally and complete 100 million orders a day by 2022, including ride-sharing, bike and food delivery orders.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P.Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering. 
EXPANDING BUSINESS
In addition to ride-sharing, Didi operates different businesses around mobility, including electric vehicle charging networks, fleet management, car making and autonomous driving. 
Last year it and electric vehicle maker BYD launched a purpose-built van model for ride-hailing services. In May it said would develop autonomous driving cars with GAC. It is testing autonomous vehicles in several cities in China and is expanding fleets.

Transportation regulators in China, however, have been pressing Didi to improve safety standards after two cases of rape and murder in 2018 involving Didi drivers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will continue to press for a waiver of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments even as it and other Group of Seven rich nations sharply expand donations of vaccines to poorer countries.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Thursday the Biden administration was working on multiple fronts to end the pandemic.
""Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures,"" Tai told a virtual town hall for union members hosted by the AFL-CIO trade federation.
That effort included donations of 80 million vaccine doses by the end of June, additional donations of 500 million doses announced on Thursday by President Joe Biden, and negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to secure a limited waiver of intellectual property (IP) rights for vaccines, she said.
""And this may take time, given the complexity of the issues involved, but our goal remains to get vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,"" Tai said, adding that the pandemic would not be over until it was contained everywhere.
Biden's plan to donate 500 million more doses - a key element in the G7's plan for 1 billion donations - raised some questions about whether Washington could drop its support for an IP waiver at the WTO. 
The waiver is opposed by Germany, Britain and some other U.S. allies, as well the U.S. business community.
But Biden administration officials say the waiver will help boost global production of coronavirus vaccines.
Biden on Thursday said the crisis, like the earlier AIDS epidemic, demands a global response and that failing to halt the pandemic would restrain global growth and could increase instability in some countries.
""We’re going to keep manufacturing doses, donating doses, getting 'jabs' - as they say here in the UK - in arms, until the world has beaten this virus,"" he said.
Sean Flynn, an expert on intellectual property at American University Washington, said he expects the WTO to reach a deal on a waiver during a ministerial meeting later this year.
He welcomed the U.S. ""ideological flexibility"" of pursuing both a waiver and taking steps to boost donations of vaccines, and said new virus mutations underscored the need for production of vaccines by more than the few players in rich countries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday some two dozen low-income countries had only vaccinated 1% of their population. ""America is better off in a wealthier, vaccinated world than a poorer, unvaccinated one,"" she said. 
The pharmaceutical industry argues that companies invested their own funds to develop vaccines and waiving their IP rights will undermine such work in the future.

Robert Grant,  senior director of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Innovation Policy Center, said there was ""no evidence"" that waiving intellectual property rights would boost vaccine production.
""The concern is that countries all around the world will just start saying, 'Well, we're not going to implement or enforce IP laws',"" he said, adding that the result would be a chaotic patchwork of laws that would ""undermine the rationale for investment in these places for years.""

By Mei Mei Chu
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Industrial Court has ruled in favor of dozens of migrant workers in a labor dispute against American tire manufacturer Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co, court documents showed on Thursday, amid accusations of unpaid wages and employee mistreatment at the firm's Malaysian factory.
A total of 184 migrant workers had filed five complaints against Goodyear Malaysia in 2019 and 2020 over non-compliance with a collective labor agreement, and are claiming about 5 million ringgit ($1.21 million) in unpaid wages.
The workers allege that Goodyear, one of the world's largest tire makers, did not give them shift allowances, annual bonuses and pay increases even though these benefits were available to local staff, who are represented by a labour union.
Goodyear Malaysia argued that the migrant workers did not have legal standing to file the complaint as they were not union members, according to the court documents. The workers are from Nepal, Myanmar and India. 
In three rulings dated June 9 and published on Thursday, Industrial Court President Rasidah Chik dismissed Goodyear's argument, ordering the firm to pay back wages owed to 65 workers and comply with the collective agreement. 
""It is clear that the complainants have proved that all of them are covered within the scope of the collective agreement and thus they are eligible to receive the benefits provided,"" Rasidah said. 
Goodyear was not immediately available for comment.
""This is just the tip of the iceberg albeit a significant milestone in the treatment of migrant workers in this company,"" said the workers' lawyer Chandra Segaran Rajandran.
They will look to pursue other benefits in the collective agreement that have been denied to the workers, including arrears in overtime payment and other allowances, he added. 
The court has already ruled in favor of the foreign workers in two of the cases last year. Goodyear has challenged both verdicts at the High Court.

Goodyear is also facing accusations of unlawful overtime, wrongful salary deduction, denying workers full access to their passports, and threats to migrant workers, Reuters has reported.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Signa Sports United, owned by Austrian investor Rene Benko, has agreed to a U.S. listing through a blank-check merger that values the online sports goods retailer at $3.2 billion, the company said on Friday.
The deal will raise $645 million for Signa Sports United, with $345 million from special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Yucaipa Acquisition and $300 million from investors through private investment in public equity (PIPE).
Signa, the global no.1 pure play online sporting goods retailer, will use part of the proceeds to buy Britain-based bicycle goods store Wiggle, which has annual sales of about $500 million, the company said in a statement.
""Becoming a listed company allows us to continue capturing market share in Europe and to accelerate our U.S. and international expansion while scaling our platform solutions,"" CEO Stephan Zoll said in the statement.
The Wiggle deal will make Signa Sports United about four times larger in the sub-sector than runner-up Bike24, which is in the process of listing its shares in Frankfurt.
Wiggle's owner, private equity firm Bridgepoint, will become an investor in Signa Sports as part of the deal.
The SPAC listing values Signa Sports United at 1.6 times the $2 billion in revenue it expects to post in its 2021/22 fiscal year ending in September. That compares to a multiple of 2.7-6.5 times that online retail peers such as THG,  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX), MyTheresa and Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) trade at.
Signa explored a stock market listing in 2018 at a valuation of 1 billion euros ($1.22 billion) but then opted for a fundraising, bringing in Asian retailers Aeon Co Ltd and Central Group as well as German insurer R+V, which will remain shareholders after the listing.
SPACs raise funds in an initial public offering to buy a private firm, which then automatically gets a stock market listing.
Signa Sports United runs firms like bicycle online shops Fahrrad.de or Bikester, tennis platforms Tennis-Point or Tennis Express, outdoor gear retailers like Campz and team sport shops Outfitter and Stylefile.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>",Ferrari flaunts its latest models on the catwalk,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Giulia Segreti
MARANELLO, Italy (Reuters) - Talk about fast fashion. 
Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is racing through the gears to bring its Prancing Horse brand to the catwalk and fine dining in an attempt to woo wealthy customers beyond its faithful fans.
The Italian company renowned for its Formula One racing team and high-powered sports cars adorned with the Cavallino Rampante logo is launching a fashion collection on Sunday and reopening a restaurant in its hometown of Maranello two days later.
The clothing line comes from creative director and former Armani designer Rocco Iannone while Michelin-starred Italian chef Massimo Bottura is relaunching the restaurant where founder Enzo Ferrari once dined with friends and Formula One stars.
Nicola Boari, Ferrari's chief brand diversification officer, told Reuters the aim was to reach new clients ""in terms of both age and culture"" - beyond its racing fans and sports car clients who already covet its branded jackets, T-shirts and hats.
The customer base for Ferrari's cars is limited by design to under 10,000 vehicles a year - fewer clients than Bottura's new restaurant could serve in the same time - and the luxury carmaker has said it hoped its so-called brand extension strategy would account for 10% of profits within a decade.
Ferrari is far from the first luxury car brand to venture into lifestyle businesses. Others like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Lamborghini and Bentley, as well as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), have turned to clothing collections. Ferrari's foray into haute cuisine too follows in the steps of luxury fashion groups, including France's LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci, which also turned to Bottura for its first restaurant in Florence and a second in Beverly Hills.
""Ferrari is one of the strongest brands in the world and definitely the strongest brand in the luxury industry,"" said Massimo Pizzo of Brand Finance, a brand valuation consultancy.
""It has the potential to succeed even in the luxury apparel industry,"" he said.
LUXURY PROFITS
Ferrari's former chief executive Louis Camilleri unveiled the brand extension strategy, which includes fashion, restaurants and other luxury experiences, in 2019 just before the coronavirus pandemic struck and delayed the plans.
The launch now comes days after the appointment of new Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna, a 52-year-old physicist who has spent 26 years at semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics and is expected to drive Ferrari into the era of electric cars. 
Camilleri said Ferrari's brand spin-offs were too stretched and planned to cut about half of the carmaker's licence agreements and trim some 30% of its product categories.
Perfumes have since disappeared from the shelves of Ferrari's existing stores, for example, as have some low-end products with no real value beyond the logo.
Analysts said it would take time for Ferrari's new brand strategy to succeed, while some were cautious about its potential contribution to profitability.
""Given the kind of scale you need to be profitable in luxury, I don't think this will be accretive to Ferrari's margins, which are quite high already,"" said Susy Tibaldi, luxury analyst at Swiss bank UBS.
Last year, 11.3% of Ferrari's net revenue came from its sponsorship, commercial and brand category - which includes the Formula One team and revenue generated by the brand through merchandising, licensing and royalties - down from 14.3% in 2019.
Ferrari's direct rival Lamborghini offers several branded collections based on partnerships, including menswear, kids wear and living, while Bentley's brand extension strategy focuses on accessories and luxury furniture.
Both companies said their brand extension strategies made important, and growing, contributions but declined to detail how much revenue they generated.
Harley-Davidson has long profited from a wide range of branded lifestyle gear with its general merchandising accounting for 5.7% of the company's motorcycle division revenue last year.
RENEWING TRADITION
Ferrari, which plans initially to sell its fashion line through its stores and online, will be competing with luxury heavyweights in a market estimated to be worth some 280 billion euros ($341 billion) this year.
Ferrari's parent Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the investment company of Italy's Agnelli family, has also been moving into luxury.
It recently bought 24% of shoemaker Christian Louboutin and became the biggest investor in Chinese luxury group Shang Xia, which was co-founded by France's Hermes.
Ferrari declined to give details of its collection ahead of the big reveal on Sunday.
As it moves away from the licensed apparel it already sells, industry sources expect the clothing line to fall within a ""middle luxury"" category, a notch below top brands such as Gucci or Italy's Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Dolce & Gabbana.
The collection is expected to include ready-to-wear items made with high-end fabrics, rather than more relaxed streetwear looks, the sources said.
The creations could draw from Iannone's background at Italian fashion house Armani and tailor Pal Zileri, with clean-cut, elegant lines and subtle, minimalist details.
""Clearly there must be a narrative, with a focus on 'Made in Italy', they cannot just come out with a T-shirt with a logo,"" said Tibaldi at UBS.
As for the Il Cavallino restaurant in front of Ferrari's headquarters, staff are busily preparing for the opening next week in rooms decorated with a Formula One nose section, framed photos of Enzo with friends and Ferrari racing posters.
Standing near an old V12 engine and a more modern version used in one of Michael Schumacher's cars, Bottura told Reuters he plans to give local specialities such as tortellini and tagliatelle a fresh, contemporary look.

""I am looking at the past in a critical way, not in a nostalgic one, to bring the best of the past into the future, to renew tradition, exactly as Ferrari does,"" he said.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>",Analysis-Frequent run-ins with India gov't cloud U.S. tech expansion plans,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Another spat between India's government and U.S. big tech has exacerbated disillusion among firms which have spent billions to build hubs in their largest growth market, to the extent some are rethinking expansion plans, people close to the matter said.
The government on Saturday said  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) had not indicated compliance with new rules aimed at making social media firms more accountable to legal requests, and therefore risked losing liability exemptions for content posted on its platform.
Twitter joins compatriots Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Facebook-owned WhatsApp in long being at loggerheads with the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over data privacy bills and policies some executives have called protectionist, but tension has escalated in recent weeks.
Police visited Twitter last month to notify it of a probe into the tagging of a political tweet as ""manipulated media"", and in February interrogated an Amazon official about the potentially adverse social impact of a political drama. Meanwhile, WhatsApp is challenging the government in court over rules it said would force it to access encrypted data.
""The fear is there,"" said a senior tech industry executive in India. ""It weighs both strategically and operationally.""
There are no indications the increasing run-ins have led to the delay or cancellation of planned investment.
Still, three senior executives familiar with the thinking of major U.S. tech firms said perceptions of India being an alternative, more accessible growth market to China are changing, and that longstanding plans for India's role in their operations are being reviewed.
""There always used to be these discussions to make India a hub, but that is being thought through now,"" said one of the executives, who works at a U.S. tech firm. ""This feeling is across the board."" 
Four other executives and advisors also expressed concern about rising tension. All declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter and because discussions were private.
Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, WhatsApp and India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.
MISINFORMATION
The government has argued that its rules are needed to stem the spread of misinformation that can spark violence - such as in 2017 when kidnapping rumours shared on message apps including WhatsApp led to lynching. It also said the rules are necessary to hold large technology companies accountable for practices that hurt domestic businesses or compromise customer privacy.
India is a massive market for U.S. tech giants. It is the biggest market for both Facebook and WhatsApp by user numbers, showed data from Statista, and third for Twitter. Amazon has committed as much as $6.5 billion to invest in the country.
To attract small businesses through WhatsApp, Facebook last year invested $5.7 billion in Reliance Industries Ltd's media and telecommunications arm, Jio Platforms.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google also pumped $4.5 billion into Jio last year from a newly created $10 billion fund earmarked for investment in India over five to seven years.
COMPLIANCE
The government has tried to balance attracting high-tech investment with nationalist policies aimed at protecting local businesses and, critics say, advancing its political agenda.
A border confrontation with China prompted it to effectively ban Chinese social media apps, including TikTok and WeChat.
The government has also forced foreign firms to store data locally against fierce lobbying, and its promotion of a domestic payment card network prompted Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) to complain https://www.reuters.com/article/india-mastercard-idINKCN1N65IS to the U.S. government about the use of nationalism.
In 2019, compliance issues with new regulations saw Amazon remove thousands of products from its e-commerce platform. The e-tailer is separately facing scrutiny by the Competition Commission of India for its retailing practices.
Twitter publicly refused to comply with some government demands to remove content, a stance which some industry executives said may have aggravated its current situation.
WhatsApp has gone to court rather than comply with a new law requiring social media firms to trace the origin of dangerous or criminal posts on their platforms. The message app operator said it cannot comply without breaking encryption, while observers said yielding could prompt similar demands in other countries.
At the same time, WhatsApp has faced regulatory delays that have limited its payment service to just 4% of its 500 million customers. Nevertheless, it is pressing ahead with hiring for a service it has called a ""globally significant"" opportunity.
Government officials have shown little patience for objections. IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said any robust democracy must have accountability mechanisms, such as the ability to identify the originator of messages.
""A private company sitting in America should refrain from lecturing us on democracy when you are denying your users the right to effective redressal forum,"" Prasad said in an interview with the Hindu newspaper published on Sunday.

Still, continued antagonism could imperil Modi's ambition of making India a go-to investment destination.
""It's a question of what you would develop in a three-to-five-year horizon,"" said another executive familiar with the thinking of U.S. firms. ""Do you do that in India or do you do that in another country. That's where the conversation is.""

36,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 01:09AM ET</span>",Anglo’s Coal Retreat May Boost South African Fossil-Fuel Output,"(Bloomberg) -- Under pressure from investors and environmentalists,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc exited its South African coal business this week, but the spinoff could have an unforeseen outcome: higher output of the most polluting fuel.
Anglo’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani said it was a “responsible transition” from thermal coal, but July Ndlovu, the head of spinoff Thungela Resources Ltd., has a different perspective. Ndlovu wants South Africa’s biggest coal exporter, which began trading in Johannesburg and London on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY), to develop new resources and buy rivals.
“I didn’t take up this role to close these mines, to close this business,” Ndlovu said in a June 8 interview at Thungela’s new offices in Johannesburg’s Rosebank business district. “I took this role to do what is right for the people of this country.”
The CEO’s bullishness about an industry where prices are currently surging highlights the potentially unintended consequences of the world’s biggest mining companies stepping away from thermal coal. While Anglo’s exit burnishes its appeal to institutional investors with ambitious climate goals to meet, expansion at Thungela’s could mean the spinoff generates more greenhouse gases than had the mines been gradually run down by Anglo.
“Anglo was not going to invest in the future of these mines necessarily,” Ndlovu said. “We now are independent, where it makes sense we will absolutely invest in these mines. We know how to convert resources into production.”
The CEO expects seaborne coal demand to remain constant for at least a decade. Thungela’s annual exports total 16.5 million tons, most to Asian countries stretching from Pakistan to China and some to new markets in North Africa.
Still, embarking on expansion may put the company on a collision course with major investors such as Old Mutual Group, which manages about 380 billion rand ($28 billion) of assets. Jon Duncan, Old Mutual’s head of responsible investing, said the expectation is that the market for seaborne thermal coal will decline and players like Thungela will need to wind down over time as the world transitions to cleaner energy.
“We see local coal producers like Thungela as yield companies; they should align their production with the requirements of climate science and national decarbonization policy, and importantly, pay out dividends while properly provisioning for the necessary rehabilitation and remediation,” he said in an interview. “I expect they would have a lot of very unhappy shareholders if they withheld dividends and blew capital on projects which have no return path.”
That will no longer be Anglo’s concern, as it said Thungela will now make its “own decisions on its direction and growth.”
“For many countries, particularly in developing economies, access to reliable and affordable energy depends on access to thermal coal,” said Anglo, which still has coal assets in Colombia and Australia. “Many communities, and countries across the world benefit from thermal coal production through local economic development, employment, export earnings and the provision of essential services.”
Ndlovu is confident his company won’t struggle to find funding for expansion, saying lenders in coal-consuming countries in the Far East may fund new developments even if financial institutions in South Africa and Europe are reluctant to.
“If you have got good quality resource in the ground, I think it offers exciting opportunities,” he said.
For Anglo, that could risk reputational damage.
“Anglo was very clear that the demerger was all about ‘pursuing a responsible transition away from thermal coal as the world transitions toward a low-carbon economy,”’ said Tracey Davies, director of Cape Town-based shareholder activist organization, Just Share. “If Thungela now expands its operations, thereby increasing its carbon emissions, then Anglo’s claims ring hollow.”"
37,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 12:36AM ET</span>",Detroit becomes 'Jeep City' with first new auto plant in 30 years,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Inside the first new auto assembly plant built in the Motor City since 1991, the smell of hot metal hangs in the air as new Jeep Grand Cherokee L SUVs head down the welding line. 
For Stellantis NV, that is the smell of money. For the City of Detroit, it means nearly 5,000 jobs. 
Stellantis opened the doors of its new $1.6 billion Mack Avenue assembly complex on Thursday, showing off parts of a 3 million square foot complex completed and launched into production largely during the pandemic. 
The Grand Cherokee L vehicles on the assembly line are the first of a new generation of Jeep's best-selling model line, aimed at expanding the brand's sales to customers who want an SUV with three rows of seats. 
Until now, Grand Cherokees only offered seating for five. Now, with room for as many as seven passengers, Jeep can take on rivals such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Explorer, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s GMC Acadia and larger SUVs from European and Japanese brands.
The plant, which began building vehicles in March, now is operating three shifts a day, plant manager Michael Brieda said.
In a tight labor market, Brieda said the biggest challenge the plant had ""was finding people capable of working in a manufacturing environment."" Job applicants were given dexterity tests as part of their interviews, he said.
About 2,100 Detroit City residents have been hired at the plant, the company said. 
The new Jeep plant underscores the split personality of the United States vehicle market, where most of the vehicles coming down the Mack assembly line will be sold. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is the industry's most valuable automaker thanks to its lead in electric vehicle technology.
But for Detroit's automakers, demand for pickup trucks and decked-out gasoline-fueled SUVs still pays the bills.
As the Mack assembly complex accelerates, Stellantis will have two adjacent factories in Detroit capable of building 500,000 or more Grand Cherokee models a year. The nearby Jefferson North Jeep plant was built in 1991 - and until now was the Motor City's newest assembly plant.
Mario Holmes, the manager who oversaw the development of the Grand Cherokee L, said much effort went into designing a new, more efficient architecture that uses aluminum and high-strength steel to cut weight. Though the new model has three rows of seats, it's in the same weight class as five-passenger SUVs, he said.

There will be an electrified powertrain offered, but details on that will come later, he said. 
One sign of the importance of the Grand Cherokee L is that Brieda, the plant manager, said he has had no problems getting enough semiconductors for the new model, even as Stellantis is idling assembly lines for other vehicles amid a global shortage of the chips needed for modern motoring systems.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 11:07PM ET</span>",SoftBank's PayPay surges ahead in Japan's digital payments race,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - For six decades, shoppers at Mikawaya, a rice dealer in eastern Tokyo, paid in cash - until sales staff from payments app PayPay swept through the low-lying district, persuading the store to give their product a try.
With customers clamouring to use the service and nearby stores signing up, PayPay's offer of free installation and no handling fees was too good to refuse, the store's owners say. 
""We thought there could be no harm in trying it out,"" said Moeko Suzuki, who helps her father run the store, standing amid sacks of rice. ""The number of young people has really increased."" 
Owned by deep-pocketed SoftBank, PayPay has deployed a shoe-leather sales force of thousands to target restaurants, drugstores and supermarkets, attracting more than 3 million merchants, an industry-leading number in a country with about 5.3 million businesses, according to government data.
""We got rid of the reasons - like it being expensive or a hassle - to not introduce PayPay,"" Hajime Baba, PayPay's chief operating officer, said in an interview. 
PayPay is emerging as key driver of a government-supported consumer shift away from cash as Japan grapples with deepening labour shortages and the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Late to payments, SoftBank drove uptake of PayPay through cash-back campaigns. In one prominent example, it gave away 10 billion yen ($90 million) in 10 days.
Burning cash on such rebates and - for now - not charging smaller businesses for its payment service, PayPay is losing money. But the company also wants to funnel customers to loans, deposits and shares trading on the app, entailing increasing exposure to the highly regulated finance industry.
It has attracted more than 39 million users in the two and a half years since launch, and SoftBank completed a merger between its internet business and a major PayPay competitor - chat app Line - in March. Since then, PayPay has added millions of users. 
Merchant handling fees, which are set at zero for smaller firms, will rise this year. Baba said PayPay aims to set them as low as possible while covering costs.
How the core business fares at that point is crucial to the service's survival. Merchants such as rice dealer Mikawaya say the benefits of the app outweigh those costs.
""For retailers, not having a lot of cash on hand or having zero, which is the ideal, has huge benefits in terms of reducing administration,"" said Michael Causton, an analyst at JapanConsuming.
The model follows that of Ant Financial, an affiliate of SoftBank's most valuable investment,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), whose 730 million Alipay users in China can borrow money, check their credit score and buy wealth-management products through the app. 
""We're learning from Ant Financial how we can monetize (PayPay). They launch short term and basically they're able to monetize short term,"" Junichi Miyakawa, CEO of SoftBank Corp, said last month.
PayPay will hope to avoid the regulatory pushback Alipay faces in China, where it is being forced to restructure.
It also must continue to overcome the historic preference for cash or credit card transactions in Japan.
MADE IN JAPAN
By using QR codes, PayPay can process payments via smartphones and without the need for costly terminals, emulating frontrunners from markets lacking retail infrastructure. 
""They used to say 'Oh, QR codes, it's a technology for underdeveloped or developing countries,'"" said Aditya Mhatre, who was head of PayPay's product team before returning to India's Paytm. ""That myth is gone."" 
Japan had many of the building blocks of world-beating payments services early on. Both QR codes and Felica, the contactless technology powering East Japan Railway's payments system, were invented by local firms.
PayPay's rivals include Rakuten, which is targeting SoftBank's mobile users and has disrupted the credit card industry by simplifying applications. 
The railway's Felica-based Suica has 9 million users on mobile and 80 million smartcards issued. The tap-to-pay system is not used by many small businesses, but is favoured by QR code detractors who complain apps like PayPay are fiddly. 
PayPay is betting on scale to help it stand out and survive. Chat app operator Line merged with SoftBank's Z Holdings in March, giving PayPay access to Line's 88 million users, some 39 million of which use its payment features.
""Integration is the key to unlocking potential revenues for PayPay, and their history of integration at SoftBank and Z Holdings hasn't always been as fast and optimal as it could have been,"" Causton said. 
Baba said the profit from SoftBank's domestic units enabled PayPay's cash-burning expansion. Executives declined to provide a timeline for profitability but point to falling costs from cash-back campaigns with more funding from corporate partners and the government. 

The conglomerate hopes to list PayPay, which booked a $660 million loss in the year ended March. SoftBank plans to consolidate PayPay into its wireless unit after Paytm, which developed some of the technology powering the app, takes a small stake in the business.

LIMA (Reuters) -Socialist Pedro Castillo was closing in on victory in Peru's presidential election on Thursday, holding a slim lead of some 63,000 votes over conservative rival Keiko Fujimori, who has yet to concede and has alleged fraud despite scant evidence.
Castillo had some 50.2% of the vote and a 0.36 percentage point lead with 99.4% of ballots tallied, with only a small number of contested ballots still being scrutinized.
The school teacher and political novice has won widespread grassroots backing for pledges to rewrite the constitution and redistribute mining wealth, rattling the copper-rich Andean nation's traditionally political and business elite.
""The people have awakened,"" Castillo told supporters from a balcony in Lima late on Thursday, calling on citizens to recover the country for all Peruvians after a divisive election race.
Fujimori, facing her own renewed legal woes on Thursday, has not conceded, and is seeking to annul some 500,000 votes which she says are suspicious.
""We will continue to defend the legitimate right of millions of Peruvians until the last vote,"" she said on Twitter.
Castillo's Peru Libre party says there is no evidence of suspicious activity. Independent electoral observers say the vote was carried out cleanly.
The ethics tribunal of the National Jury of Elections (JNE), the body charged with overseeing the legality of the electoral process, said on Thursday that throwing doubt on the results without evidence was ""irresponsible."" 
Washington said that electoral authorities should be allowed to look into any fraud allegations.
""We look forward to working with the duly elected candidate,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.
Peru, which saw three presidents in a week last year amid political scandals and protests, has been hit by the world's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak by deaths per capita. The world no.2 copper producer posted its worst economic plunge in three decades last year.
PRESIDENT-ELECT?
In Latin America, though, many were already celebrating Castillo's victory.
Argentina's President Alfredo Fernandez was the first world leader to congratulate Castillo, saying on Twitter he had contacted the ""President-elect"" and expressed wishes to join forces for the benefit of Latin America. 
Peru's current interim government said in a statement it had filed a ""note of protest"" to Argentina over the comments, with the final results not yet formally announced by the country's electoral authority.
In Brazil, leftist former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is widely expected to challenge far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in next year's election, said Castillo had struck a blow against conservatism in the region. 
""The result of the Peruvian polls is symbolic and represents another advance in the popular struggle in our dear Latin America,"" he said.
Bolivia's former President Evo Morales also congratulated Castillo on his ""victory,"" calling him a ""soul brother and companion in struggle.""
LEGAL STAKES 
Castillo's thin lead over Fujimori is more sizeable than the 0.24% margin by which Fujimori lost to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in the 2016 presidential election.
""Then, Fujimori did not demand a recount, but given the political and legal stakes for her, she may do this time round,"" said Eileen Gavin, principal analyst of Global Markets and the Americas for risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
Fujimori spent over a year in jail pending a trial over accusations she accepted illegal campaign contributions when she first ran for the presidency in 2011. She has denied the allegations and called them political persecution.
On Thursday, prosecutor Jose Domingo Perez requested that Fujimori's bail be revoked and she be returned to custody pending the trial, arguing that she had been in contact with a witness.
The request will be heard by a judge in the coming days. A spokesman for Fujimori did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

""Prosecutors are entitled to seek her jailing, but it will be interpreted by people as an attempt to meddle with the electoral process,"" said Ernesto de la Jara, a Peruvian human rights lawyer who is critical of Fujimori. 
A victory in the presidential election would halt her case until the end of her administration.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Friday morning after the U.S. released higher-than-expected inflation data the day before. The data drove investor bets that price pressures will be temporary and that central banks will keep their stimulus measured unchanged for a while.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.08% by 10:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT) as a new analysis said that the country could be facing another COVID-19 surge, with or without the Olympic games due to open in July.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 inched up 0.11%.The country is currently working on a travel corridor with Singapore to allow quarantine-free travel between the two countries.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.33% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.17%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.53% while the SZSE Component was down 0.59%.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined to 1.43%, its lowest point since March 2021.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday said that the core consumer price index (CPI) increased 3.8% year-on-year in May, higher than the 3.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and 3.0% reading during the last session. It also grew by 0.7% month-on-month in May, above expectations but below April’s growth.
The CPI growth in May was mainly driven by sectors that were reopening businesses thanks to accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite prospective wider price pressures, investors eased their concerns that a spike in long-term borrowing costs could destabilize global markets.
It indicated that investors believed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s view that inflation will be transitory and that any changes in its current dovish monetary policy will likely happen gradually.
“The frothiness in CPI continues for now but between base effects and pent-up demand pressures, it is probably not giving a definite answer to the great inflation debate, and you need to read the bond market tea leaves,” said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network, told Bloomberg. “The bond market is falling in line with the Fed’s thinking that inflation is transitory and does not warrant tapering of monetary stimulus any time soon.”
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde on Thursday committed to delivering faster bond buying, although officials admitted for the first time since 2018 that the eurozone economy is no longer clouded by risks to its growth outlook.
“A sustained rise in market rates could translate into a tightening of wider financing conditions… such a tightening would be premature and would pose a risk to the ongoing economic recovery,” Lagarde said.
Investors will be monitoring the opening of the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in the U.K. on Friday.
On the data front, 376,000 filed for initial jobless claims in the U.S. during the previous week, above the 370,000 figure in forecasts prepared by investing.com but below the 405,000 during the previous week."

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks ended higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing above its prior record high set on May 7, as economic data appeared to support the Federal Reserve's assertion that the current wave of heightened inflation will be temporary.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with market-leading megacap stocks putting the Nasdaq out front. But economically sensitive transports and smallcaps ended the session in negative territory.
The Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) data came in above consensus and added fodder to the debate over whether current price spikes could transform into long-term inflation, despite the Fed's assurances to the contrary.
But a closer look showed that much of the price surge came from items such as commodities and airfares, and is therefore likely to be temporary.
""Earlier this week we had extremely boring market days as we all had our eyes on the bullseye of this CPI report,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But once people looked under the surface, the majority of the higher inflation is due to the reopening, and stocks had a relief rally.""
""The market is taking it in stride as it realizes the whole economy isn't overheating,"" Detrick added.
A U.S. House of Representatives committee passed a $547 billion infrastructure spending bill targeting surface transportation, adopting some of President Joe Biden's proposals as part of his broader $2.3 trillion infrastructure package.
Still, sectors that stand to benefit from infrastructure spending ended the session lower. Industrials and transports fell by 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.1 points, or 0.06%, to 34,466.24; the S&P 500 gained 19.63 points, or 0.47%, at 4,239.18; and the Nasdaq Composite added 108.58 points, or 0.78%, at 14,020.33.
Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, healthcare enjoyed the largest percentage gains.
But interest rate-sensitive financials fell the most, dropping 1.1% as easing U.S. Treasury yields weighed on the sector.

The move steps up the duration and depth of the regulatory scrutiny on Crown, at a time when it is trying to overturn a suspension of its new Sydney casino licence and is balancing buyout talks with suitor Star Entertainment Group. 
The Victorian government said it approved an extension to Oct. 15 from the initial Aug. 1 deadline, and an increase in the funding to A$19.75 million from A$10 million ($7.75 million).
The Royal Commission inquiry into Crown was appointed by the state in February to assess its fitness for holding a gambling licence, with other states also probing the company after media accused it of ties to money laundering.
A Royal Commission is Australia's most powerful type of public inquiry and has the power to compel witnesses.
Australian media reports accused the company, one-third owned by billionaire James Packer, of doing business with tour operators with ties to organised crime. Crown initially denied the allegations but admitted at the Sydney inquiry in 2020 that some of the claims were true.
Victoria also said the Royal Commission would also look deeper into the corporate culture of Crown Melbourne and claims brought forward in evidence so far that included allegations Crown Melbourne underpaid casino tax.

Crown said in a separate statement that it would continue to cooperate with the inquiry.

Merchandise in the online shop will be ""carefully selected high-quality apparel and lifestyle products,"" the company said.
Items debuting this month include streetwear and action figures based on anime series ""Yasuke"" and ""Eden,"" and apparel and decorative items inspired by French crime thriller ""Lupin,"" Netflix said. The ""Lupin"" products were developed with the Louvre museum.

CARBIS BAY, England (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that a donation of 500 million doses of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine to the world's poorest countries would supercharge the battle with the virus and comes with ""no strings attached.""
Biden, speaking alongside Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla in the English seaside resort of Carbis Bay ahead of a G7 summit, thanked other leaders for recognising their responsibility to vaccinate the world.
""The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached,"" Biden said. ""Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives.""
Biden, keen to burnish his multilateral credentials on his first foreign trip as leader, cast the donation as a bold move that showed America recognised its responsibility to the world and to its own citizens.
""America will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War Two,"" Biden said.
The largest ever vaccine donation by a single country will cost the United States $3.5 billion but will spur further donations from other G7 leaders - including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
G7 leaders want to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022 to try to halt the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 3.9 million people, devastated the global economy and upended the normal lives of billions of people. 
Vaccination efforts so far are heavily correlated with wealth: the United States, Europe, Israel and Bahrain are far ahead of other countries. A total of 2.2 billion people have been vaccinated so far out of a world population of nearly 8 billion, based on Johns Hopkins University data.
'SAVE LIVES'
U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have agreed to supply the U.S. with the vaccines, delivering 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022.
The shots, which will be produced at Pfizer's U.S. sites, will be supplied at a not-for-profit price. Around 100 countries will get the shots. 
Pfizer CEO Bourla said the eyes of the world were on the leaders of rich nations to see if they would act to solve the COVID-19 crisis and share with poorer nations.
""This announcement with the U.S. government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe,"" he said. 
While such a large donation of vaccines was welcomed by many, there were immediately calls for the richest nations of the world to open up more of their giant hoards of vaccines. 
Anti-poverty campaign group Oxfam called for more to be done to increase global production of vaccines.
""Surely, these 500 million vaccine doses are welcome as they will help more than 250 million people, but that’s still a drop in the bucket compared to the need across the world,"" said Niko Lusiani, Oxfam America’s vaccine lead.
""We need a transformation toward more distributed vaccine manufacturing so that qualified producers worldwide can produce billions more low-cost doses on their own terms, without intellectual property constraints,"" he said in a statement.
Another issue, especially in some poor countries, is the infrastructure for transporting the vaccines which often have to be stored at very cold temperatures.
IP WAIVER 
Biden has also backed calls for a waiver of some vaccine intellectual property rights but there is no international consensus yet on how to proceed.
The new vaccine donations come on top of 80 million doses Washington has already pledged to donate by the end of June. There is also $2 billion in funding earmarked for the COVAX programme led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the White House said.

GAVI and the WHO welcomed the initiative.
Washington is also taking steps to support local production of COVID-19 vaccines in other countries, including through its Quad initiative with Japan, India and Australia.

And oil’s upbeat prospects are helping the oil and gas industry reclaim investors’ attention. As such, we think popular oil and gas corporation  Exxon Mobil  (XOM), and China Petroleum & Chemical (NYSE:SNP), are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on.Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a multinational company that explores for, develops and distributes crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products, electric power generation, and coal and mine operations worldwide. The company also manufactures and markets petrochemicals, fuels, lubricants, and a range of specialty products.
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (SNP) is a China-based energy and chemical company that explores for and distributes crude oil and natural gas, and manages chemical operations. The company processes and refines crude oil and offers gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, ethylene, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, synthetic resins, and chemical fertilizers through wholesale and retail sales networks.
The rapid recovery of major economies combined with continued supply cuts by the world’s major oil producers have led to a boost in oil prices, which hit a $72.66 per barrel two-year high on Wednesday. As coronavirus infection rates in major oil consuming emerging markets such as India and Brazil decline, OPEC+ expects oil demand to rise by six million barrels per day in 2021. The global oil & gas upstream activities market is expected to grow 26.6% to reach $3.34 trillion in 2021. Consequently, we think both XOM and SNP should benefit substantially in the coming months.

(Reuters) - Shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) lost more than a quarter of their value on Thursday and other so-called meme stocks also declined in a sell-off that hit a broad range of names favored by retail investors.
The video game retailer’s shares closed down 27.16% at $220.39, their biggest one-day percentage loss in 11 weeks. The drop came a day after GameStop said in a quarterly report that it may sell up to 5 million new shares, sparking concerns of potential dilution for existing shareholders. 
""The threat of dilution from the five million-share sale is the dagger in the hearts of GameStop shareholders,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management. ""The meme trade is not working today, so logic for at least one day has returned.""
Soaring rallies in the shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings over the past month have helped reinvigorate the meme stock frenzy that began earlier this year and fueled big moves in a fresh crop of names popular with investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
Many of those names traded lower on Thursday, with shares of Clover Health Investments Corp down 15.2%, burger chain Wendy’s falling 3.1% and prison operator Geo Group (NYSE:GEO) Inc, one of the more recently minted meme stocks, down nearly 20% after surging more than 38% on Wednesday. AMC shares were off more than 13%.
Worries that other companies could leverage recent stock price gains by announcing share sales may be rippling out to the broader meme stock universe, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital.
AMC last week took advantage of a 400% surge in its share price since mid-May to announce a pair of stock offerings.
""It appears that other companies, like GameStop, are hoping to follow AMC’s lead by issuing shares and otherwise profit from the meme stocks run-up,” Ablin said. “Investors are taking a dim view of that strategy.""
Wedbush Securities on Thursday raised its price target on GameStop to $50, from $39. GameStop will likely sell all 5 million new shares but that amount only represents a “modest” dilution of 7%, Wedbush analysts wrote.
GameStop on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected earnings, and named the former head of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Australian business as its chief executive officer. 
GameStop's shares rallied more than 1,600% in January when a surge of buying forced bearish investors to unwind their bets in a phenomenon known as a short squeeze. 

The company on Wednesday said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had requested documents and information related to an investigation into that trading. 
In the past two weeks, the so-called ""meme stocks"" have received $1.27 billion of retail inflows, Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said on Wednesday, matching their January peak.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Eli Lilly memo says firm did not make false statements to FDA,"By Dan Levine and Marisa Taylor
(Reuters) - A week before Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) disclosed to regulators that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating its New Jersey factory, the drugmaker told employees that its own inquiry, led by an outside law firm, found no evidence of wrongdoing there, according to a company memo reviewed by Reuters.
On April 8, a group of employees filed an anonymous complaint internally alleging that an executive at its Branchburg, New Jersey, factory had altered documents required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
As Reuters reported last month, Lilly tapped the Washington D.C. law firm Covington & Burling LLP to investigate the alleged alterations, which the employees said were meant to downplay serious quality control problems at the plant producing the drugmaker's COVID-19 antibody treatment.
In a memo to Branchburg employees on May 20, Nellie Clark, head of the plant, summed up the outside lawyers’ findings: “In the end and very importantly, allegations that Lilly made false statements to the FDA were not substantiated.” 
A week after the memo was released to employees, Reuters reported that the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation focused on the Branchburg plant. That same day, May 27, Lilly reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had received a subpoena from the department seeking documents related to the factory.
The company reported that it was cooperating with the Justice Department probe and that an outside law firm was also “investigating these allegations thoroughly.”
It was not clear which inquiry - the company’s or the government’s - was launched first and to what extent the subjects coincide. However, as Reuters reported last month, based on three sources familiar with the matter, the Justice Department’s investigation into Lilly includes a review of alleged manufacturing irregularities and records-tampering.
Lilly spokesperson Kathryn Beiser and a Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Clark did not respond to a request for comment. A Covington spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment nor to a request for a copy of the firm’s report.
The Covington inquiry is significant because Lilly’s handling of any employee allegations is likely to be considered by U.S. prosecutors as they weigh whether there are grounds to pursue criminal charges, seek civil action, or decline to bring a case at all, several legal experts said. 
Government prosecutors often consider whether a corporation made a genuine effort to investigate and address potentially illegal activities once learning of them.
If the Justice Department concludes that an internal investigation was thorough, it can result in a non-prosecution agreement with few, if any, penalties, the experts said. However, a company-led investigation that appears to have been poorly handled could lead to harsher outcomes.
“Whenever a company hires outside counsel to conduct an inquiry, it’s taken extremely seriously by the Justice Department,” said Paul Pelletier, a former long-time federal prosecutor who used to oversee criminal investigations of corporations.
Covington has handled dozens of cases for Lilly over the past 20 years, according to the Westlaw database of legal cases and press releases, including intellectual property matters, personal injury lawsuits and class actions. 
The firm also has several lawyers whose reputations would carry weight with the Justice Department and the FDA, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, legal experts said. Gerald Masoudi, the Covington partner who handled the recent inquiry for Lilly, once served as the FDA’s chief counsel. Masoudi did not respond to requests for comment.
ANSWERING DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
The company-backed investigation was based on interviews with more than 100 people, the May 20 memo to Lilly employees said. However, the memo did not respond to all concerns employees raised in their April complaint, which Reuters reviewed.
The memo denies the company made false statements to the FDA. In their complaint, employees said they were broadly concerned that quality control documents the FDA requires companies to maintain had been rewritten or fabricated. The employees did not specify whether these materials had been shown to the FDA.
The company memo said Lilly couldn’t substantiate allegations that employees faced retaliation for refusing to make false statements. It did not address employees’ specific complaints that they faced retaliation for other reasons, other than to say it encouraged employees to “speak up.”
The Branchburg factory first came under FDA scrutiny in late 2019, when agency inspectors began to document numerous quality control problems. By March, 2020, the FDA had deemed the manufacturing issues as “Official Action Indicated,” its most serious category of violation. 
Lilly has pledged to address the problems, and said none of them affected drugs in the market. The FDA, which has taken no public action, did not respond to requests for comment.
In March 2021, Reuters reported that a former Lilly human resources officer, Amrit Mula, had identified internally some of the same violations later documented by the FDA. Mula was forced out of the company in early 2019 after Lilly executives sought to downplay her findings, according to a letter demanding compensation for damages that her attorneys sent to the company.
Lilly has denied retaliating against any employees, and no lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Mula.
In October 2020, the Trump administration ordered $375 million worth of Lilly’s COVID-19 antibody therapy bamlanivimab, which is manufactured at the Branchburg plant.

A U.S. Senator, New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, called allegations of manufacturing irregularities and records tampering at the Branchburg plant ""troubling."" Menendez has sponsored a bill calling for a non-partisan, independent COVID-19 Commission to examine the U.S. pandemic response, including government contracts with companies.
""These reports have raised serious questions that require answers,"" Menendez said of Reuters coverage. ""I expect that this Administration will coordinate across agencies to get to the bottom of this and that Eli Lilly will fully cooperate with any ongoing investigation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s top U.S. executive met with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to talk about electric vehicles and the push toward cleaner cars as the Biden administration works to revise vehicle emissions rules.
Scott Keogh, president and chief executive of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America, spoke with EPA Administrator Michael Regan and reaffirmed the company's support for an emissions deal with California.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, Volkswagen and BMW in July 2019 struck a voluntary agreement with California on reducing vehicle emissions through the 2026 model years which would allow them to meet a single nationwide standard. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday threw its support behind the overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal but asked the Biden administration to give automakers more flexibility to hit the carbon reduction target between now and 2026.
Regan has spoken with GM, Stellantis and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp executives this week as the EPA plans to announce a proposal to revise the Trump emissions rules.
""It’s clear more automakers now feel the same way and that’s a good thing. We welcome them to the table. Electric mobility for all will only take hold in this country when everyone is all in – industry, state and federal government, consumers,"" Keogh said in a statement to Reuters.
The Trump administration in 2020 finalized a rollback of vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama era rules it discarded.
The Center for Biological Diversity estimates the California deal will improve fuel economy 3.7% year over year between 2022 and 2026.

The largest German automaker has embraced electric vehicles after it came under fire for diesel emissions cheating. Volkswagen said in March it expects half of its U.S. sales by 2030 to be EVs and is spending tens of billions on EVs.
Volkswagen admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, allowing up to 40 times legally allowable emissions and in 2017 pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a $4.3 billion settlement reached with the Justice Department. The scandal has cost VW more than 32 billion euros ($39 billion) so far.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied to new highs and bond yields slid on Thursday after a jump in U.S. inflation was viewed as insufficient to alter the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy stance that rising consumer prices will be transitory.
MSCI's global benchmark, the S&P 500 and a pan-European stock index surged after the U.S. Labor Department said the consumer price index in the 12 months ended in May accelerated 5.0%, the biggest year-on-year increase since August 2008.
The report was largely in line with expectations, said Subadra Rajappa, head Of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in New York.
""The market is really buying into the narrative that the rise in inflation is in fact transient because you're not seeing that necessarily being priced into fears in the bond market,"" Rajappa said.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield fell to a three-month low of 1.440%. When investors were worried about inflation later in March, the yield had spiked to 1.776%.
Many now believe economic growth will slow and that any acceleration in inflation will be temporary, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis in New York.
""The (equity) market is going to ignore the data. It's going to rally regardless,"" LaVorgna said.
""If it turns out the economy is weaker in the next three to six months than people think, it won't even matter if inflation continues to surprise to the upside,"" he said.
MSCI's all-country world index rose 0.37% to 718.23, setting a record close and intraday high. The pan-European STOXX 600 scaled a new peak before closing slightly higher at 454.56. The European Central Bank raised its recovery outlook and pledged to keep stimulus flowing.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.06%, the S&P 500 gained 0.47%, climbing past its previous record, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.78%, spurred by growth stocks that thrive on low interest rates.
While wages are going up, prices for most commodities outside of energy have softened, as lumber, grains and meat have come down, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC. 
Inflation's ""rate of change had people very alarmed, particularly in the commodities basket. The softening has people a little bit more at ease,"" Hayes said. ""With the 10-year barely moving off this news, I'm inclined to start to put money to work."" 
Surprisingly strong U.S. inflation in April had rattled investors, prompting caution ahead of Thursday's May data. Yet risk assets have remained buoyant as central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic signaled willingness to keep monetary taps open until recovery takes hold. 
The ECB said it would buy bonds at a ""significantly higher"" pace than earlier this year, reaffirming its March pledge as most central bank watchers had expected. 
In the United States, data showed people filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly 15 months.
The dollar index fell 0.11% to 90.041, with the euro down 0.02% to $1.2176. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.29% versus the greenback at 109.30 per dollar.
Oil prices edged up to their highest in more than two years in volatile trade on optimism for strong economic demand after new U.S. unemployment claims fell to their lowest since the country's first wave of COVID-19 last year.

Brent futures settled up 30 cents at $72.52 a barrel by 1:24 p.m. EDT (1724 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 33 cents to settle at $70.29 a barrel.

Given this backdrop, we think reasonably priced Chinese stocks Viomi (VIOT), China Online Education (COE), LightInTheBox (LITB), and  China Automotive  (CAAS) are well-positioned to deliver significant returns in the near-term. Let’s discuss these names.China was the first country to recover from the COVID-19-pandemic-led recession, driven by a surge in retail sales, industrial production and investment in fixed assets. The country reported 18.3% GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021, its highest since 1992. As the world’s largest internet market, China has witnessed the rapid digitalization of various businesses during the pandemic. However, policy tensions between the U.S. and China have greatly affected the technology and supply chain sectors in China, and caused some Chinese stocks trading in U.S. markets to retreat.
However, in its five-year plan draft, China has announced a focus on its technology sector and plans to boost domestic production to combat competition from Western countries. This, combined with rising consumer demand, should keep driving China’s economic growth.
Given this backdrop, we believe small- and micro-cap Chinese stocks Viomi Technology Co., Ltd (NASDAQ:VIOT),  China Online Education Group  (NYSE:COE), LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs Thursday, shrugging off the hottest pace of inflation in decades as Treasury yields slipped on signs bond bears are caving in on bets against the Federal Reserve.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.47% to close at a record high of 4,239.42 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.06%, or 19 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.78%.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index  rose 0.6% last month after edging up 0.9% in April. The uptick in consumer prices in May lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 5% from 4.2% in April, the highest rate since the 1980s.
But Treasury yields fell as the hottest inflation report in decades failed to revive fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner.
The bond vigilantes -- who had been shorting bonds as a bet against the Federal Reserve view of transitory inflation – have been reining in their bearish bets on bonds on worries that the Fed may not be as behind the curve as feared.
""[I]f you're betting against the Fed you tend to not be accurate,"" Johan Grahn, Head of ETF Strategy at Allianz said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. ""If you are accurate and it's typically for a short, short moment, then everybody else would bet in the same direction so it's a really slippery slope to go down.""
There appears to be good reason to refrain from betting against the Fed's call on inflation. The economy is opening up, driving consumers back to areas that were shuttered during the pandemic such as restaurants and international travel, but this spike in prices doesn't matter yet as wages aren't rising.
""The decision making is happening at the consumer level, but it's not to spend more money necessarily, it's more about deciding where to spend the money, "" Grahn added. ""The consumer will have to decide whether they want to get on two flights for $300 apiece, for example, or if they want to get on one flight, which could now be $450 apiece instead.""

56,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>","U.S. senator slams Apple, Amazon, Nike, for enabling forced labor in China","By Michael Martina
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Thursday slammed American companies, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), for turning a blind eye to allegations of forced labor in China, arguing they were making American consumers complicit in Beijing's repressive policies. 
Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on China's crackdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in its western Xinjiang region, Republican Senator Marco Rubio said many U.S. companies had not woken up to the fact that they were ""profiting"" from the Chinese government's abuses. 
""For far too long companies like Nike and Apple and Amazon and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) were using forced labor. They were benefiting from forced labor or sourcing from suppliers that were suspected of using forced labor,"" Rubio said. ""These companies, sadly, were making all of us complicit in these crimes.""
Senator Ed Markey, who led the hearing with fellow Democrat Tim Kaine, said a number of U.S. technology companies had profited from the Chinese government's ""authoritarian surveillance industry,"" and that many of their products ""are being used in Xinjiang right now."" 
Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) said in 2019 it would stop selling genetic sequencing equipment into Xinjiang after rights groups and media documented how authorities there were building a DNA database for Uyghurs. But critics say the move didn't go far enough.
""All evidence is that they continue to provide these products which enabled these human rights abuses,"" Rubio said of Thermo Fisher, noting that he had written the Massachusetts-based company repeatedly about the matter.
""Whenever we receive proof of forced labor, we take action and suspend privileges to sell,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.
Coca-Cola declined to comment. The other companies mentioned did not respond immediately to Reuters' questions. 
U.S. lawmakers are seeking to pass legislation that would ban imports of goods made in Xinjiang over concerns about forced labor. 
Rights groups, researchers, former residents and some western lawmakers say Xinjiang authorities have facilitated forced labor by arbitrarily detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in a network of camps since 2016.
The United States government and parliaments in countries, including Britain and Canada, have described China's policies toward Uyghurs as genocide. China denies abuses, saying the camps are for vocational training and to counter religious extremism. 

Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch, told the Senate panel that Beijing's ""extreme repression and surveillance"" made human rights due diligence for companies impossible.
""Inspectors cannot visit facilities unannounced or speak to workers without fear of reprisal. Some companies seem unwilling or unable to ascertain precise information about their own supply chains,"" she said.

Investing.com -- Inflation, shminflation. Traders dismissed inflation data that came in above expectations to drive stocks higher on Thursday.
It was the data everyone had been eyeing this week. The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.6% last month after edging up 0.9% in April. The uptick in consumer prices in May lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 5% from 4.2% in April, the highest rate since the 1980s. Investors are going with the Fed's position that it's a passing phase.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) appears to be running out of supplies, like so many industries (chips!) out there (are we sure about that transitory inflation, Fed?), The New York Times reported.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) continued to do its meme thing, dropping 25% after saying it will sell yet millions more in shares, taking full advantage of retail investors.
Here's to another slow summer close to the week. Have a good one, people.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Let's chat
Leaders from the G-7 nations start their meeting in Cornwall, England. President Joe Biden is making his first trip to the U.K. during his administration. He and his counterparts are expected to discuss the economic rebound from the pandemic.
2. Feeling sentimental
After today's highly-anticipated inflation numbers, Friday's economic data release is the decidedly less sexy University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading. The initial June print is expected to come in at 84.2, a slight bump from the prior 82.9. The number will be released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
3. Another record?
U.S. stocks will look to close out the week on another high note. Investors shrugged off the latest signs of inflation to send the S&P 500 to a fresh record and the Nasdaq was near its April highs on Thursday.

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) can succeed without acquiring other businesses, IAC Chairman Barry Diller said during a Reuters Newsmaker event Thursday.
The media and Internet mogul, who helped found Fox Broadcasting Company, described competing with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which would require significant investment, a ""fool's errand"" at this point. “But can you do very well for yourself and for your shareholders if you simply have good ideas, execute them well?"" he said. ""There will be buyers, there will be an audience for those things. Absolutely.”
Diller’s comments came as media experts expect a fresh round of mergers following the recently announced deal between Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc and AT&T (NYSE:T), which will create a new company that combines Discovery and WarnerMedia assets. Soon after Discovery and AT&T revealed their plans for the proposed new company, Warner Brothers Discovery, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it will buy U.S. movie studio MGM.

Although conglomerate IAC is not currently weighted heavily toward media - with investments that include MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International and Care.com - Diller has a long history in the sector. He described Comcast as being in a “fantastic position” with a cable and broadband business that hedges against NBCUniversal. “I don’t think they have to do anything,” he said of whether Comcast needs to spin off a business or get bigger.
The Internet and media mogul brushed off concerns about Netflix’s debt burden. “Unless they do something just remarkably stupid, just declare them a winner and go home,” Diller said, speculating that subscriber revenue will eventually line up with production costs, delivering a “very nice return for investors.”

(Reuters) -A higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mRNA COVID-19 shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), according to data from two vaccine safety monitoring systems, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday.
The CDC and other health regulators have been investigating heart inflammation cases after Israel’s Health Ministry reported that it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. 
The agency said it is still assessing the risk from the condition and has not yet concluded that there was a causal relationship between the vaccines and cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.
While some patients required hospitalization, most have fully recovered from their symptoms, the CDC said.
More than half of the cases reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after people had received their second dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were in people between the ages of 12 and 24, the CDC said. Those age groups accounted for less than 9% of doses administered. 
""We clearly have an imbalance there,"" Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, said in a presentation https://www.fda.gov/media/150054/download to an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration meeting on Thursday.
The overwhelming majority of the cases have occurred within a week of vaccination, Shimabukuro said.
There were 283 observed cases of heart inflammation after the second vaccine dose in those aged 16 to 24 in the VAERS data. That compares with expectations of 10-to-102 cases for that age range based on U.S. population background incidence rates, the CDC said.
Shimabukuro said there was a predominance of males in younger age groups among the reported heart inflammation cases. 
The median age of patients who experienced the inflammation after a second vaccine dose was 24, according to the VAERS data. Just under 80% of the cases were in men.
Shimabukuro also said the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) - another safety monitoring system - showed an increased incidence of heart inflammation in 16 to 39 year olds after their second shot when compared to the rate observed after the first dose.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said it supports the CDC's assessment of the heart inflammation cases, noting that ""the number of reports is small given the number of doses administered.""
About 130 million people in the United States have received both doses of one of the mRNA vaccines. 
""It is important to understand that a careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause myocarditis or pericarditis,"" the company said in a statement. 

Moderna said it also has not established a causal association with the condition and its vaccine. It said it is actively working with public health and regulatory authorities to further assess the issue. 
The CDC said it will hold a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices next week to further evaluate the evidence and assess the risk of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination for COVID-19.

Adidas has agreed to subscribe for 3 million euros ($3.65 million) worth of shares in the company's planned initial public offering, bringing the total investment it has secured to 58 million euros, Spinnova said in a statement.
""We are an ideal match with the ambitious and pioneering Adidas sustainability strategy,"" Spinnova CEO and co-founder Janne Poranen said.
Spinnova is building its first commercial factory in Finland with strategic partner and wood raw material supplier Suzano, and is also building a pilot facility for fibre production out of leather waste.
It said Adidas wanted to secure access to ""significant volumes"" of its patented fibre in future.
A 500 million euro sustainability bond Adidas issued last September was five times oversubscribed, with proceeds earmarked for investing in renewable energy production and projects to promote recycled materials.
Adidas has pledged to shift to using only recycled polyester from 2024 and is also involved in research cooperation with another Finnish start-up, Infinite Fiber, to develop a process that can transform used clothes into a cotton-like material.

Activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners had already questioned Vivendi's plan to cash in on its prize asset - the music label behind artists such as Lady Gaga - through a distribution-in-kind to shareholders.
The deal - through which Vivendi aims to list Universal in Amsterdam and spin-off 60% to existing Vivendi shareholders - will be submitted to an investor vote on June 22. 
Artisan, which declined to comment on the size of its stake in Vivendi, echoed Bluebell's argument that the distribution structure was unfavourble to minority shareholders as it was not tax efficient. 
It said it also opposed Vivendi's plan to sell off chunks of UMG ahead of the listing, such as a 10% holding which William Ackman is in talks to acquire via his blank-cheque company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. 
""Selling off pieces of UMG to other investors in return for cash is a sub-optimal capital allocation decision,"" Artisan portfolio manager David Samra said in a statement. 
""We would prefer that Vivendi spin off its entire ownership of UMG to the shareholders in a tax efficient manner.""
Vivendi declined to comment. 
UMG is valued at roughly 35 billion euros ($43 billion), including debt, according to Vivendi.
Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, would still retain a slice of UMG after the spin-off. If it goes ahead, Vivendi would have 10%, Pershing Square 10%, Bollore 16% and a consortium led by Tencent 20%.
Glass Lewis and ISS, the world's two biggest proxy advisers, have recommended Vivendi shareholders vote in favour of the spin-off plans. But Glass Lewis said Bluebell's demand for a higher cash dividend to sweeten the deal for minority shareholders was ""reasonable"". 
The two firms also recommended investors vote against a resolution giving Vivendi the possibility of buying back and cancelling up to 50% of its capital, saying it was not in shareholders' best interests. 

Glass Lewis cited Bluebell's concerns that Bollore could use this tool to increase his stake in the media group without making a tender offer.

Sales at department stores this back-to-school season, which runs mid-July through early-September, are forecast to surge 25.3% from a year earlier, and 9.5% over 2019, according to Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) SpendingPulse data. Total retail sales, excluding auto and gas, are projected to rise 5.5%. 
After staying indoors for over a year due to the health crisis, Americans are more confident about venturing out and spending in stores, thanks to increased vaccinations, record savings and stimulus packages.
""The broader reopening brings an exciting wave of optimism as children prepare for another school year, and the grown-ups in their lives approach a similar 'return to office' scenario,"" senior advisor for Mastercard Steve Sadove said.
Apparel sales are expected to jump 78.2% from last year as shoppers will look to revamp their wardrobes, coming out of last year's casual athleisure styles, when they worked and studied from home. Electronics are projected to rise 13%.
The report also notes a 6.6% drop in e-commerce sales from a year earlier, when most people shopped online, but they are expected to jump 53.2% on a two-year basis.

The pandemic pushed department stores, such as Macy's (NYSE:M) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), to sell largely online and streamline their businesses at a time they were already facing intense competition and a shift in consumer preference.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, is pushing more aggressively into private market investments, the firm detailed at an investor presentation https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/BlackRock-Inc-2021-Investor-Day/default.aspx on Thursday. 
Since interest rates were slashed to near-zero across the globe at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, investors have sought out other sources of yield. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), in its investor day presentation on Thursday, said alternative investments - including private equity, real estate, hedge funds and venture capital - can offer a market-beating edge. Private market investments recorded 18% revenue growth for the company last year, twice the rate of the broader industry. 
BlackRock, which manages $279 billion in alternative assets, said its portfolio advisory business is moving away from the traditional model of a 60% equity, 40% fixed income breakdown in portfolios in favor of a 50% public equity, 30% bonds and 20% private markets split. 
The firm also outlined the opportunities for growth it sees in China. A spokesperson for BlackRock said this has picked up momentum since the firm in May received a license in China for a majority-owned wealth management venture, the country's fast-growing asset management market.

BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink told investors on Thursday that he has no plans to leave the firm anytime soon, but is confident that when he does it will be ""in good hands."" CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/biden-donors-float-elizabeth-warren-larry-fink-others-for-key-roles.html among other media outlets reported last year that top donors to then-candidate Joe Biden's campaign were floating Fink's name for possible roles in the administration. 
Fink founded BlackRock in 1988 along with seven partners, according to the firm's website https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/leadership/larry-fink.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>",Meatpacker JBS says it paid equivalent of $11 million in ransomware attack,"(Reuters) -Meatpacker JBS USA paid a ransom equivalent to $11 million following a cyberattack that disrupted its North American and Australian operations, the company's CEO said in a statement on Wednesday.
The subsidiary of Brazilian firm  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) halted cattle slaughtering at all of its U.S. plants for a day last week in response to the cyberattack, which threatened to disrupt food supply chains and further inflate already high food prices.
The cyberattack followed one last month on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States. It disrupted fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast.
Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data. Typically hackers will offer the victim a key in return for cryptocurrency payments that can run into hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. The FBI said earlier this month that the agency was investigating about 100 different types of ransomware.
The JBS meat plants, producing nearly a quarter of America's beef, recovered faster than some meat buyers and analysts expected.
""This was a very difficult decision to make for our company and for me personally,"" said Andre Nogueira, CEO of JBS USA on the ransom payment. ""However, we felt this decision had to be made to prevent any potential risk for our customers.""
The Brazilian meatpacker's arm in the United States and Pilgrims Pride Corp, a U.S. chicken company mostly owned by JBS, lost less than one day's worth of food production. JBS is the world's largest meat producer. 
Third parties are carrying out forensic investigations and no final determinations have been made, JBS said. Preliminary probe results show no company, customer or employee data was compromised in the attack, it said.
A Russia-linked hacking group is behind the cyberattack against JBS, a source familiar with the matter said last week. The Russia-linked cyber gang goes by the name REvil and Sodinokibi, the source said. 

A JBS spokesperson said the ransom payment was made in bitcoin. 
The Justice Department on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY) recovered some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline Co, cracking down on hackers who launched the attack.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>",Crisis-hit EU airlines seek 'more balanced' passenger rights,"PARIS (Reuters) - European airlines said on Thursday they will seek to weaken passenger compensation and refund rights in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which left the industry struggling to reimburse billions of euros in fares for grounded flights.
Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents the region's biggest carriers, said the so-called EU261 regulation had severely exacerbated the financial crisis for many airlines.
""We're looking for a more balanced approach to consumer protection,"" Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith said, adding that the European Union's passenger rights law was ""one of the most punitive"" in the world.
EU rules grant consumers immediate cash refunds for cancelled flights, plus compensation for those scrapped with less than two weeks' notice or for delays of over three hours. Multibillion-euro refund bills exacerbated the cash crunch for many airlines early in the pandemic.
""When events like mass cancellations get put in place this law is not flexible enough to handle such events,"" Smith said at an A4E virtual news conference, joined by the heads of easyJet (LON:EZJ), IAG (LON:ICAG), Lufthansa and Ryanair.
The European Commission indicated it was not ready to consider any weakening of passenger rights. 
""We have always tried to strike the right balance between consumer protection and the protection of the tourism and transport industry,"" an EU official said. ""The continued and improved protection of passenger rights is crucial to ensuring the necessary consumer trust in the transport sector.""

The airlines also indicated that they plan to contest air traffic control fee increases agreed by EU governments last month to make up the effective monopoly service providers' crisis shortfall, with easyJet's CEO hinting at legal action.
""We are going to legally try this,"" said Johan Lundgren, who is the current A4E chairman. ""Amazingly these monopoly air navigation service providers are being allowed to pass on 5.4 billion euros to airlines and to our customers,"" he said.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 01:37PM ET</span>","'Beat them up': Toshiba and Japan colluded against foreign investors, probe finds","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp and Japan's government colluded to lean on foreign investors to back company management in a key vote, according to an investigation which alleged one executive said they would ask the trade ministry to ""beat up"" a hedge fund.
The shareholder-commissioned report released on Thursday also said that Yoshihide Suga - then chief cabinet secretary and now prime minister - verbally encouraged the pressure on investors during a meeting with a senior Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) executive last year, an allegation Suga has denied.
Toshiba is of strategic importance to Tokyo as a maker of nuclear reactors and defence equipment. The probe's findings mark an explosive turn in a long battle between the Japanese company's management and foreign shareholders, which include activist investors and Harvard University's endowment fund.
The report, written by independent investigators, says Toshiba's management reached out to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) for support ahead of its annual general meeting last July, to counter activist investors.
The management ""worked closely"" with the ministry to exert ""undue influence on some shareholders"" including an attempt to force Effissimo Capital Management to withdraw its candidate nominations, according to the probe.
Singapore-based Effissimo, Toshiba's top shareholder, had nominated three candidates, including its own co-founder, as directors. Ultimately none were elected.
The investigators detailed one email among top Toshiba managers about Effissimo in which an executive said: ""We will ask METI to beat them up for a while.""
Contacted by Reuters, METI said it was aware of the report and was looking into its contents.
Toshiba said it would ""carefully review"" the report and comment at a later date.
An Effissimo spokesperson said it was looking at the report, but declined to comment further. 
SUGA UNDER MICROSCOPE
Once a crown jewel of corporate Japan, Toshiba was battered by accounting scandals that stretch back to 2015 and massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business as well as the sale of its semiconductor unit, leaving it a shadow of its former self.
The report was commissioned by shareholders, who voted in March for an independent investigation into allegations investors had come under pressure from the company. That vote was seen as a watershed moment for shareholder activism in Japan. 
The investigators also allege that Suga encouraged the pressure on Toshiba investors in a breakfast meeting with a senior company executive last July.
""If we are aggressive, we can get them"" with foreign ownership rules, Suga allegedly told the executive, referring to rules introduced in 2020 and designed to protect industries critical to Japan's national security.
Asked about his alleged comment, Suga told reporters: ""I am absolutely not aware of that. There was nothing of that sort."" 
The allegations of METI's intervention - previously reported by Reuters - are likely to raise doubts about Japan's commitment to improving governance and drawing more foreign investors, goals set by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
The probe found Toshiba had ""devised a plan to effectively prevent shareholders from exercising their shareholder proposal right and voting rights,"" by putting undue influence on Effissimo, the Harvard fund and another fund, 3D Investment Partners.
The ministry was said to have contacted Singapore-based 3D to warn it against ""barbecuing next to your neighbour when there is a big fire,"" in an apparent suggestion it should refrain from backing Effissimo's proposals, the report said.
A spokesperson for the Harvard fund declined to comment, while 3D did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some of the actions raised ""suspicions of violations of laws and regulations in many places"", the report said. Investigators later told a news conference that the violations may involve confidentiality requirements for bureaucrats.
'RAISES A HORNET'S NEST'
""The conclusions and facts in this report are very disturbing,"" said Nicholas Benes, head of the non-profit Board Director Training Institute of Japan.
""The report raises a hornet's nest of questions. Will an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) be called to elect the board again? Will directors or others be sued? Could Toshiba even be delisted?""
Following a 2017 capital raising, a number of foreign funds invested in Toshiba, making an uneasy marriage of activist investors and a key strategic asset.
Reuters previously reported https://jp.reuters.com/article/toshiba-board-idCNL1N2J4052 Harvard's endowment fund had been told by Hiromichi Mizuno, a METI adviser at the time, that it could be subject to a regulatory probe if the fund did not follow management's recommendations at the AGM last July.
The Harvard fund ultimately abstained from voting.
Based on that Reuters report, Toshiba's board launched its own investigation in January of this year on whether Harvard had come under pressure, the investigators said. Toshiba said at the time it was not involved in any efforts to pressure Harvard.
Since then, Toshiba has seen former CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani resign and the ensuing turmoil lead to a $20 billion bid for the conglomerate from CVC Capital.
CVC's offer to take the Japanese conglomerate private and retain incumbent management was perceived by some in the company as designed to shield Kurumatani from activist shareholders, Toshiba sources have said. 

While Toshiba has dismissed that bid, it has announced it will conduct a strategic review.
Activist investors are estimated to account for about 25% of Toshiba's shareholder base - an unusually large proportion after the company, on the verge of collapse, had to quickly issue some $5.5 billion worth of shares in 2017.

So, as direct beneficiaries of rising oil prices, we think Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ), Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV), Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), and Vermillion Energy (VET) should be highly rewarded by investors in the near term. Let’s evaluate these companies.Oil prices rallied on Wednesday to trade above $70 a barrel, representing a 32-month high. This can be attributed primarily to rising demand as the global economic recovery drives a revival of industrial activities and mobility. Continued supply cuts by the world's largest oil producers are also supporting the rally.
Because OPEC and its non-OPEC partners recently confirmed that they will ease production cuts gradually, oil prices should continue rallying. Based on this, and a strengthening demand outlook, analysts expect oil prices to hit $80 a barrel or more this summer. Investors’ interest in this sector is evident in the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF’s (XOP) 12.8% gains over the past month compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 0.1% loss.
So, we think it could be wise to buy shares of Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ), Ovintiv Inc. (OVV), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL), and  Vermilion Energy  Inc. (NYSE:VET) because they are expected to benefit significantly from the rising oil prices.

And investor enthusiasm for IPOs has helped recently listed stocks Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and C3.ai, Inc. (AI) soar. However, considering their limited growth prospects, we think these IPO stocks look extremely overvalued at their current price levels and are best avoided now.The opportunity to go public quicker and cheaper led to a record increase in IPOs in 2020. Total IPOs increased to 480 in 2020 from 233 in 2019. Historically low interest rates and an upbeat stock market have been motivating factors for companies to go public.
This trend has continued this year. As of March 2021, U.S. markets recorded nearly 400 IPOs. This compares to just 37 IPOs in the same period a year ago. However, concerns over rising inflation and investors’ rotation to cyclical stocks pose a threat to many recently listed stocks.
Investor optimism over the recently listed stocks of Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) and C3.ai, Inc. (AI) helped them hit price levels that are not justified by their recent financial performance and growth prospects. So, we think these stocks could continue retreating in the near term.

Investing.com – Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) shares rose more than 2% in Thursday’s trade following an upgrade by Argus that sees its high installed user base driving its growth.
Argus analyst Joseph Bonner upgraded the stock to buy with a $440 target, a 29% upside from the stock’s current level of $341.
At the end of April, Zoom had approximately 497,000 customers at companies with more than 10 employees. It had 1,999 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue.
Bonner believes Zoom continues to benefit from the high number of users that came to its platform during the pandemic.
As life returns to normal, there has been much debate about business moving away from companies that benefited from work-at-home conditions during the pandemic, Zoom notably. Many expect life will move back to a hybrid model where remote or work-from-home will co-exist with the conventional workplace ecosystem.

However, with the economy’s recovery so far this year, the demand for materials such as iron and steel is rising with the reopening of the industrial and construction sectors. An expected inflationary environment in the near term is also playing a role in boosting demand for materials.

(Reuters) -European stocks inched to fresh peaks on Thursday as the European Central Bank raised its recovery outlook and promised to keep ample stimulus flowing, while travel stocks fell after a recent run of gains. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up just 0.1%, but at a fresh record high of 455.76 points, while the narrower index of euro zone stocks fell 0.1%. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde said policymakers agreed to make further emergency purchases over the next quarter ""at a significantly higher pace"" than during the first months of the year"" but gave no further detail about the expected levels. 
The central bank now sees 2021 euro zone economic growth at 4.6%, above the 4% projected in March. Inflation projections were also raised, with the ECB expecting price growth at 1.9% this year, in line with its target and above its last projection for 1.2%. 
""The ECB's main mission today was to avoid any taper talk and not harm the still tentative economic recovery or allow bond yields to surge prematurely,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.
""It accomplished its mission: the ECB seems to have bought some time without starting the taper talk.""
Interest rate-sensitive banking stocks rose 0.4%, while tech stocks rose 0.9%. 
The meeting came as data from across the globe point to building inflationary pressures, particularly in commodities, as economies recover from long COVID-19 lockdowns.
That has raised fears that major central banks will start to pare back their massive stimulus programmes sooner than expected, even though policymakers have reaffirmed support until signs of a strong labour market recovery emerge. 
Euro zone inflation last month exceeded the central bank's target of just under 2%, a mark it has undershot for most of the last decade.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Shares of Oxford Industries (NYSE:OXM) jumped more than 11% in Thursday’s trade as the company raised its fiscal guidance, prompted by a record quarterly performance that exceeded its own expectations.
The company rode the consumer splurge on clothing and food as they stepped out after a year of the pandemic.
The company’s fiscal 2021 ends January 29, 2022.
The clothing retailer, which also operates the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, expects fiscal 2021 net sales in a range of $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion as compared to net sales of $749 million in fiscal 2020.
The company expects sales in Lanier Apparel to be lower as it exits the business.
It also raised the full-year EPS guidance to $4.85 to $5.15 on an adjusted basis.
Record first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.89 exceeded the high end of earnings guidance range, the company said. This was higher than company’s own guidance of 95 cents to $1.15.
Consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $266 million compared to $160 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in remarks aired on Thursday that the planemaker is looking at how to evolve existing models, and he also voiced optimism about long-term progress toward hydrogen-powered aviation technology.
""We have a good portfolio of platforms; we believe the evolution will be on those platforms, on systems, connectivity, energy management and decarbonisation,"" he told the A4E Aviation Summit, asked where Airbus' main product development focus lay.
""We think those platforms have the potential to embed those changes on different systems including propulsion systems. So we are more looking at how we are going to evolve those platforms over time, as we are doing with the A321XLR and other products, with new variants,"" he said in a pre-recorded interview.
Reuters reported in March that Airbus was studying a freighter version of its A350 jetliner.
Industry sources have said it also has studies codenamed ""A321neo-plus-plus"" or ""A321 Ultimate"" with more seats and new wings to defend its largest single-aisle model, whose success has prompted Boeing (NYSE:BA) to consider a 757 replacement.
Investors scrutinize comments from planemakers about the timing and scope of developments, especially the point at which they change generations of jets.
Analysts say that of the two planemakers, Airbus is most keen to maximise investment in the current generation of single aisle jets where it enjoys an upper hand against the Boeing 737 MAX, and to delay the start of a new industrial race until the 2030s.
Boeing is keeping options open. Last week, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told a Bernstein conference that ""it won't be all that long"" before it is ready to announce its intentions, which would go beyond tackling the A321XLR head-on and incorporate manufacturing improvements. 

Looking further ahead, Airbus has championed hydrogen technology with plans to produce the first zero-emission commercial airplane by 2035. 
""On the speed at which things are changing at the moment I am more and more optimistic every day,"" Faury told A4E.

And because analysts expect the demand for gold and its prices to continue rising in the near term, we think small-cap names Torex Gold Resources (OTC:TORXF) and Argonaut Gold (OTC:ARNGF) should deliver substantial returns. Read on for some details.Gold prices have been recovering over the past couple of weeks, driven primarily by increasing demand for it as a safe-haven investment. Increasing inflation in the United States, coupled with rising labor costs, has motivated many investors to hedge a proportion of their portfolios by investing in precious metals. Also, because analysts expect real interest rates to remain in historically low territory due to the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy, gold should continue benefiting.
The Fed’s continued dovish stance and proposed fiscal stimulus packages are also putting pressure on the Greenback, and investors have been rotating to gold to hedge their portfolios against market volatility. This is evidenced by SPDR Gold Minishares Trust’s (GLDM) 3.2% gains over the past month, compared to S&P 500 index’s marginal decline.

Support for marijuana legalization is at an all-time high now. Last month, Jerry Nadler, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman, reintroduced the MORE Act amid a strong cry for federal level reform from social justice advocacy groups and growing support for marijuana legalization at the state level. This, along with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administrations’ recent announcement that it would be issuing licenses to several cannabis growing facilities, has made analysts extremely optimistic about the industry’s growth prospects.
Furthermore, analysts recently upgraded the ratings of prominent cannabis players Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC) and Tilray, Inc. (TLRY). And we think their diverse product portfolios and expansive distribution networks should help the stocks to deliver solid returns in the near term.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 10:46AM ET</span>","Airbus, Air France want EU green funds used for jet incentives - documents","By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus and Air France-KLM have urged policymakers to use EU-backed green stimulus funds to support aircraft sales, according to documents released on Thursday by InfluenceMap, an investor-led climate lobbying watchdog.
In papers and presentations to officials including European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans' staff, the companies argued that taxpayer-funded incentives on current plane models could cut emissions by retiring more older, less efficient jets.
""Support could take the form of a 'green stimulus' subsidy scheme,"" according to an Air France-KLM ""key messages"" digest dated March 26. The airline group declined to comment.
The Airbus and Air France-KLM documents are part of a set including emails, letters and position papers obtained under freedom of information rules by InfluenceMap, which says they reveal resistance to European Union climate policies that is sometimes at odds with the industry's public pledges.
The region's aviation sector vowed in February to target net zero carbon emissions in 2050.
In the near term, an Airbus spokesperson told Reuters, emissions could be reduced with ""financing support for airlines to retire older, less environmentally friendly aircraft early and replace them with new fuel-efficient aircraft."" 
The disclosures come as investors increasingly press carbon-intensive industries for transparency about their lobbying on climate issues. InfluenceMap provides research to Climate Action 100+, whose 575 members manage $54 trillion in assets.
In a significant blow to Exxon (NYSE:XOM) management, shareholders last month appointed three activist directors to push energy transition goals and passed a BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) resolution ordering the oil giant to report on whether its lobbying aligned with the Paris Agreement.
Airlines are now in the line of fire. Another BNP-led demand for climate lobbying disclosures by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has been endorsed by influential proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis ahead of next Thursday's shareholder meeting.
Airbus pitched its ""green stimulus"" incentives to Brussels officials on Feb. 9, according to a redacted copy of the presentation - even suggesting they might apply to planes ordered before the pandemic, shoring up order books.
""The scheme would enable even higher CO2 savings if it can be used to secure aircraft replacements already planned before the crisis,"" it said.
Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr echoed the call for jet incentives on Thursday. Achieving net-zero requires ""that governments support industry investment, be it in fleet renewal (or) sustainable aviation fuels"", he said at an online event. 
The Commission is in ""regular contact with all stakeholders"" but had no immediate comment on the presentation, a spokesperson said. Any recourse to sales incentives could risk inflaming a 17-year-old dispute over support for aviation that the United States and Europe hope to resolve soon.
Industry groups including Airlines for Europe (A4E) and Airbus-backed ASD published their net-zero pledge earlier in February, while warning it was contingent on policy support for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), new aircraft technologies and an overhaul of the region's air traffic control system.
But the lobbying report details efforts by top EU airlines - also including Lufthansa, IAG (LON:ICAG) and Ryanair - to weaken plans to mandate SAF use, tax kerosene and bring more flights under the bloc's Emissions Trading System. Formal proposals are expected from the Commission next month. 
""The industry has communicated high-level support for net-zero EU aviation emissions by 2050 while opposing specific national and EU-level climate regulations to help deliver that target,"" InfluenceMap said.
Major carriers that received 30 billion euros in COVID-19 crisis bailouts are ""among the most significant opponents of ambitious climate policy in the region,"" it added.
Airlines criticised the report in a statement issued through their main regional body after a pre-publication version circulated.

""The idea that we have 'actively lobbied' against EU climate policies to reach these targets is false,"" A4E said. ""We are committed to accelerating our carbon emission reductions to reach net zero emissions by 2050.""

DETROIT (Reuters) -A former president of the United Auto Workers, Gary Jones, on Thursday was sentenced to 28 months in jail for embezzling union funds as part of a larger federal probe into corruption in the union.
Jones, who pleaded guilty last June to charges he embezzled more than $1 million, appeared in U.S. District Court in Detroit on Thursday. At last year's hearing, he apologized to UAW members ""for the betrayal of their trust"" and asked for forgiveness.
Jones also will make restitution of $550,000 to the UAW, $42,000 to the Internal Revenue Service, forfeit more than $151,000 and pay a $10,000 fine, prosecutors said.
On Thursday morning, Jones pleaded for mercy from Judge Paul Borman and again apologized to the union and its members.
""I failed the UAW,"" he said. ""I let my union down and I pray every day that no harm comes to the UAW.""
Jones, 63, of Corsicana, Texas, agreed to cooperate with the government in the prosecution of others, and as a result, prosecutors sought a lower prison sentence. Jones is one of 16 people convicted so far in a wide-ranging probe by the office for the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, which worked with current UAW leaders to reform the union. 
""The working men and women of the UAW can feel that justice was done, and that their union is on the road to reform,"" acting U.S. Attorney Saima Mohsin said in a statement.
In May, a former federal prosecutor was named an independent monitor to oversee the union for up to six years.
The UAW said Jones' sentencing brings to a close a ""very dark chapter"" in the union's history.

Jones' predecessor as head of the UAW, Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB), pleaded guilty to embezzlement of union funds in September and was sentenced to 21 months in prison last month.
Jones, a certified public accountant, was charged with conspiracy to embezzle funds from the UAW from 2010 through September 2019, and with conspiracy to defraud the United States by failing to pay taxes on the money prosecutors charge he stole. He resigned from the union last November.

There are many reasons to be bullish with increasing industrial demand as silver is used in solar panels and EV batteries. Taylor Dart provides an in-depth look at silver's fundamentals.While the S&P-500 (SPY) continues to get all the attention recently as value stocks come back into vogue, one asset class that continues to perform well with little attention paid to it is silver (SLV). As of Wednesday’s close, silver is up nearly 6% year-to-date, underperforming the SPY’s 12% return, but over the past year, SLV has easily outperformed the SPY, up 52% vs. the end of Q2 2020 vs. the S&P-500’s 36% return. This continued outperformance relative to both gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) and the S&P-500 is a very bullish sign for silver, given that this is when the precious metals complex performs its best. It certainly helps that we have sentiment that is nowhere near exuberant relative to other assets and a new multi-year high in inflation, emboldening the thesis for holding precious metals. With this backdrop, this is a clear buy-the-dip market. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
If we look at the chart above, we can see that silver (blue line) is not only outperforming the S&P-500 and has begun a new uptrend after a 10-year bear market vs. the S&P-500, but it’s also easily outperforming the GLD. This is although the S&P-500 has enjoyed one of its most impressive runs in history with a 93% return off the March 2020 lows. So, while the S&P-500 has outperformed silver this year, the bigger picture shows that silver has been outperforming recently, and this bullish trend should remain intact as long as silver holds above $24.00/oz. The outperformance vs. gold is also a very positive sign, given that silver underperforms gold massively when we are nearing the tail end of bull markets, with this occurring in late 2011 when gold made a new high above $1,900/oz, but silver did not. The fact that silver is making marginal new highs while gold is consolidating is a bullish setup, suggesting that it’s still massively leading the metal.

Because strong demand from key crop-growing regions and rising input costs are expected to continue driving fertilizer prices up, is MOS well positioned to move higher? Read on to learn more.As one of the world’s leading integrated producers of concentrated phosphate and potash, The Mosaic Company’s (MOS) shares have gained 142.6% over the past year and 55.5% year-to-date to close yesterday’s trading session at $34.95 on rising demand and pricing in the agricultural fertilizer market. However, the stock has declined 3.3% over the past month. The price retreat is due to investors’ concerns over reduced output owing to the company’s decision to shut down two mine shafts—K1 and K2—at its flagship potash mine at Esterhazy, Canada nine months ahead of schedule on a recent acceleration of brine inflows. 
However, the move is not expected to have a huge impact on MOS’ financials in the long run because MOS’ third Esterhazy mine—K3—will replace the two closed shafts in supplying potash to global customers.
Furthermore, in a major victory for the company, the U.S. International Trade Commission announced in March that it had completed its investigation and determined that subsidized phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia have materially injured the U.S. phosphate industry. Consequently, the department will issue countervailing duty orders on phosphate fertilizers from Russia and Morocco, which will remain in place for at least five years. This is expected to deliver MOS a significant competitive advantage.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The parts of Ireland's economy that rely on the continued success of its multinational jobs machine are betting the deep roots some of the world's biggest companies have laid down can see off the threat of a global corporate tax overhaul.
However a softening of Ireland's decades-long tax advantage will show up deficiencies elsewhere when competing for foreign direct investment, most notably a persistent dearth of affordable housing.
In a major step toward a global deal, Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed last weekend to squeeze more money out of multinational companies and reduce the allure of low-tax centres such as Ireland with its 12.5% corporate tax rate, backing a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.
Unlike in some other low-tax economies where companies also book large profits but have little presence, multinationals employ one in eight Irish workers. Some 10% of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s 60,000 workforce are based in its European headquarters in Ireland. 
For that reason Ireland's finance minister said on Saturday he remained confident the country would continue to attract investment and jobs even if its low tax rate loses its lustre. 
Executives routinely credit additional factors such as an English speaking, well educated workforce, membership of the European Union and a stable political environment in near weekly new job announcements in Ireland, a mantra that will be tested if the global tax deal is finalised. 
""Some people throw their eyes to heaven a little bit when you mention the benefits of Ireland other than tax,"" the Irish chief of Facebook, Gareth Lambe, told an American Chamber of Commerce Ireland event last month.
""Maybe each of those individually don't compare to the tax benefit but combined they are huge and overwhelming,"" said Lambe, currently the chamber's president, describing Ireland as being in an ""incredibly strong position"".
The finance ministry has forecast that corporate tax receipts are set to be around 20% or 2 billion euros lower than they otherwise would have been by 2025, due to the anticipated changes. 
The sustainability of the number of multinational jobs that have almost doubled to 257,000 in the last decade is what is really at stake. The finance ministry has warned that Ireland's attractiveness for inward investment could also be undermined.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also expanding into campus-style sites while Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which employs 8,000 people in Ireland, owns or leases nine buildings in the city.
Property consultants Knight Frank estimate Google, Facebook Microsoft and Amazon will occupy more space in Dublin by 2025 - 4.6 million square feet - than they currently do in London, even though the British capital has six times the population.
Ronan Group Real Estate, which is building Facebook's campus as well as a new office for the 3,000 people that U.S. cloud software maker Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) plans to employ in Ireland by 2023, remain ""very bullish on the Dublin market"" in the face of the tax challenge and the expected continuation of more working from home beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When you talk to the executives, tax is a factor but it's not the main factor. In terms of the demand for offices in Dublin, I don't think it will have a significant impact,"" Ronan Group Chief Executive Rory Williams (NYSE:WMB) told Reuters. 
The Ronan Group is currently locked in a battle with local planners in a bid to build taller office and residential blocks in Dublin, just one part of Ireland's myriad of housing problems that could scare off the next Facebook.
Ireland has fallen well short of meeting housing demand each year since an enormous property crash over a decade ago. The mismatch has made Dublin rents among the highest in Europe.
The country's main business lobby group, Ibec, has said the impending weakening of the tax advantage means the government must invest in areas Ireland is ""not as strong on,"" namely university funding, research and development and housing.

""I think tax was possibly a bigger issue for a lot of these companies coming to Ireland 15 or 20 years ago,"" Kevin Nowlan, the head of Ireland's largest stock market-listed office landlord Hibernia REIT, told Reuters.
""The biggest issue is the housing situation,"" said Nowlan, whose tenants include Twitter and U.S. software company HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) Inc. ""We really need to get on top of resolving that.""

103,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 10:27AM ET</span>",Billionaire's Altice group buys 12% BT stake in support of fibre plans,"By Paul Sandle and Mathieu Rosemain
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi has bought a 12.1% stake worth about 2.2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) in BT Group (LON:BT), backing its ambition to build a nationwide fibre broadband network.
Drahi's newly-created vehicle Altice UK announced the holding in a statement on Thursday which drove BT's shares to a 17-month high. They were trading up 7.7% at 197 pence at 1422 GMT.
Altice UK is owned by Next Alt, dealmaker Drahi's private holding, which also controls SFR, the second largest telecoms operator in France behind Orange.
""Altice holds the board and management team of BT in high regard and is supportive of their strategy,"" Altice UK, a company formed for the purpose of holding the BT stake, said.
""Altice UK has informed the BT board that it does not intend to make a takeover offer for BT,"" it added.
BT, Britain's biggest broadband and mobile operator, is recasting itself as the British national champion to upgrade the country's broadband network which lags other markets such as Spain.
It plans to extend fibre broadband to 25 million homes and businesses by 2026, and it is seeking a partner to help fund the work. It is also considering selling a stake in its sports TV operation.
Drahi, known for buying undervalued telecoms assets, said BT had a significant opportunity to upgrade and extend its full-fibre broadband network.
""We understand that the expansion of the broadband network is one of the UK Government's most important policy objectives and a core part of its levelling up agenda,"" he said.
The stake makes Altice BT's largest shareholder, ahead of Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) which owned 12.06% of BT based on recent filings, Refinitiv data shows.
BT noted Altice's statement of support for its management and strategy. It said it welcomed all investors who recognised the long-term value of its business and the important role it plays in the UK. 
""We are making good progress in delivering our strategy and plan,"" it said.
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said the investment was a ""signal of confidence"" in BT's strategy.
""A key issue now is how Altice intends to unlock value,"" they said, adding that encouraging BT to spin off its independently operated Openreach network seemed most likely.
Altice UK has ruled itself out of making a full takeover offer for six months by virtue of its statement.
Drahi, who lives between Switzerland, the United States and Israel, bought cable company Numericable in the early 2000s, and later acquired SFR from Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). He recently took SFR's parent company Altice Europe private in a buyout.
He also controls France's most-watched news channel BFM TV, and owns the largest telecoms firm in Portugal and the second largest operators in both Israel and the Dominican Republic. 
Praised for his financial acumen, he suffered a fall from grace in 2017 when Altice Europe's shares plummeted after a report signalled it would not grow in France, fuelling fears that his group would not be able to pay its huge debts. 
Drahi responded to investor concerns by ousting the chief executive and spinning off Altice's U.S. arm.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) advised Drahi.

Supersonic passenger travel died out with the retirement of Concorde in 2003, but United said earlier in June it agreed to buy 15 ultra-fast jets from Boom Supersonic.
""We'll watch with interest but no, I wouldn't be buying it,"" Walsh told an airlines conference on Thursday. ""I'm not convinced that supersonic transport is the right move going forward.""

106,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",Analysis: G7 global tax plan may hit corporate titans unevenly,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - An agreement by wealthy nations aimed at squeezing more tax out of large multinational companies could hit some firms hard while leaving others - including some of the most frequent targets of lawmakers’ ire - relatively unscathed, according to a Reuters analysis.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading nations on Saturday agreed on proposals aimed at ensuring that companies pay tax in each country in which they operate rather than shifting profits to low-tax havens elsewhere.
One proposed measure would allow countries where customers are based to tax a greater share of a multinational company’s profits above a certain threshold. The ministers also agreed to a second proposal, which would levy a minimum tax rate of 15% of profits in each overseas country where companies operate, regardless of profit margin.
The Reuters review of corporate filings by Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc suggests the company could see its taxes increase by less than $600 million, or about 7% more than its $7.8 billion global tax bill in 2020, if both proposed measures were applied. Google is among the companies that some lawmakers have criticized as paying too little tax. 
Meanwhile, medical group Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which is also U.S.-based, could see its tax bill jump by $1 billion, a more than 50% rise over its $1.78 billion global tax expense last year, according to Reuters’ calculations.
Both Google and J&J declined to comment on the calculations.
In a statement Saturday following the G7’s agreement, Google spokesman José Castañeda said: ""We strongly support the work being done to update international tax rules. We hope countries continue to work together to ensure a balanced and durable agreement will be finalized soon.""
Determining the exact impact the new rules will have on companies is difficult, in part because companies don’t typically disclose their revenues and tax payments by country. And key details about how the rules would be implemented are still pending, tax specialists say, including to which countries profits would be reallocated and to what degree taxes generated by the new measures would offset taxes owed under the current system.
The proposed rules themselves also face hurdles. In the United States, several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal. Details of the agreement are also due to be discussed by the wider Group of 20 countries next month.
Four tax specialists concurred with Reuters’ methodology but noted that there is still uncertainty about how the measures would be applied, including which tax breaks are included in the 15% minimum overseas tax.
The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
“The deal makes sure that the system is fair, so that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places,” said a spokesperson for the UK Treasury, which hosted the G7 meeting. “The final design details and parameters of the rules still need to be worked through.”
SHARING PROFITS
The first proposed measure focuses on large global firms that report at least a 10% profit margin globally. Countries in which the companies operate would have the right to tax 20% of global profits above that threshold in an effort to stop companies reporting profits in tax havens where they do little business.
Applying that formula to Google could result in as much as $540 million in additional taxes, according to the Reuters analysis.
Based on Google’s 2020 global profits of $48 billion, Reuters calculated what portion of that income could be reallocated based on the G7’s proposed formula. Reuters then calculated how much more the company would pay if tax was levied on that portion of income at the rate of 23% - which is the average tax rate for developed nations as identified by Paris-based research body the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - rather than the average overseas tax rate of 14% that Google said it paid last year.
Applying the same methodology to J&J, and its 2020 global profits of $16.5 billion, the healthcare company would see its global tax bill rise by about $270 million as a result of the first measure.
The exact impact on each company’s tax bill would depend on how much income is actually reallocated. Also at issue is which country the profit is moved from and to - and therefore what the increase in tax rate is. If all the reallocated profit comes out of zero-tax jurisdictions, the impact could be greater.
MINIMUM TAX OVERSEAS
U.S. and UK officials say the other measure, involving a 15% global minimum tax, will have a bigger total impact on how much in taxes governments collect. But its effect on companies will vary widely. In recent years, Google-parent Alphabet, like some other targets of tax campaigners, has reorganized its international tax structures and last year reported over three-quarters of its global income in the United States compared to less than half in each of the previous three years, according to its corporate filings.
Google reported $10.5 billion of dollars of earnings from outside the United States last year and an average overseas tax rate of 14%, which is one percentage point below the G7’s proposed minimum tax.
If Google’s overseas earnings were all taxed at 15%, the additional tax due would be $100 million. The impact could be higher if a large proportion of the money is earned in zero-tax jurisdictions like Bermuda, where Google used to report over $10 billion a year in income. Conversely, the impact of the minimum tax would be reduced if the first measure prompted Google to reallocate some of its non-U.S. earnings out of tax havens.
Excluding the impact of the first proposed measure, increasing the tax rate on overseas income to 15% would mean $45 million of additional tax.
The situation for J&J would be very different. It earned 76% of its 2020 income outside of the United States and paid 7% tax on average on that overseas profit. Applying a 15% tax rate to that overseas income figure would result in $990 million in additional taxes, according to Reuters’ calculations.

While the reallocation of profit under the first measure would reduce this impact, the combined result of the two measures would be more than $1 billion.
Academics say businesses are adept at mitigating the impact of measures that are designed to reduce tax avoidance and therefore could re-organize in order to limit the impact of the proposed measures. And, in reality, tax incentives offered by governments mean companies may end up paying less in practice.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish payments firm Klarna has raised $639 million from a group of investors led by SoftBank's Vision Fund II, lifting its valuation to about $46 billion - higher than several of the region's major banks. 
Klarna, which allows shoppers to buy online through its merchant partners and settle their dues in instalments via ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL), became Europe's most valuable startup in March when a $1 billion fundraising valued it at $31 billion. 
The current round was led by SoftBank, joined by existing investors such as Adit Ventures, Honeycomb Asset Management and WestCap Group.
Klarna's other investors include Sequoia Capital, NorthZone, Silver Lake, Dragoneer, Permira, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), Bestseller Group, Ant Group, rapper Snoop Dogg, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC.
Reuters reported last month that Klarna was close to raising a new round of funding at a valuation close to $50 billion. 
The company, whose chief executive is Sebastian Siemiatkowski, is among the largest players in the global BNPL sector with over 90 million global active users, and processes 2 million transactions a day. 
The company is expected to make a stock market debut either later this year or next year. Siemiatkowski told Reuters earlier that he prefers direct listing as done by companies like Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) to take their companies public. 
""We are very happy shareholders, and we could sell our shares tomorrow if we wish, so we don't have any stress to take the company public,"" said Hans Otterling, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone, an early investor in Klarna.

Klarna, founded in 2005, took eight years to reach a valuation of $1 billion, but less than 12 months to go from being valued at $5.5 billion to within touching distance of $50 billion. 
Along with rivals such as Affirm and Afterpay, it has seen a surge in demand as the coronavirus pandemic drives a shift in consumer spending online.

The company is the second drugmaker to seek regulatory nod for use of its vaccine in the age group, as the U.S. tries to vaccinate more young people.
Vaccinating children has been considered key to achieving ""herd immunity"" and while they mostly develop only mild COVID-19 symptoms or no symptoms, younger people still remain at risk of becoming seriously ill, and can spread the virus.
Moderna's vaccine is already being used in the United States, the European Union and Canada for anyone over 18. The drugmaker said it has also submitted applications to European and Canadian regulators seeking authorization for the shot's use in adolescents.
Last month, Moderna's two-shot vaccine was shown to be effective in adolescents aged 12-17 and showed no new or major safety problems in a clinical trial which evaluated the vaccine in 3,732 teenagers.

The U.S. has already authorized  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s COVID-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12.
More than 7 million teens have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said on Thursday it was working with global TV manufacturers so that gamers can play Xbox games through internet-connected televisions without any extra hardware other than a controller.
Xbox is also building its own streaming devices for cloud gaming to reach gamers on any TV or monitor without the need for a console.
The company, which launched two models of its Xbox gaming consoles last year, has also been focusing on developing its cloud gaming service to attract casual gamers with the promise of cutting ties to the living room.
Game Pass, a $9.99 per month subscription service with titles such as ""Alien Isolation"" and ""Gears 5"", can be played on Xbox consoles, Android devices and PCs, and is seen as a weapon for cutting into the dominance of rival  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation platform. 
""With Game Pass coming to the browser, the value of the subscription is going to transcend from the console to the PC to mobile,"" Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a pre-recorded video. 
""I am looking forward to how we continue to invest in Game Pass, to add more content and bring the service to even more geographies,"" he said.
Cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, available in dozens of countries, will be launched in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan later this year.
Xbox, which is exploring new subscription offerings for Game Pass, is also working with telecom companies to allow consumers to buy both a console and Game Pass for a low monthly price, rather than spending money up front. 
Gaming has received a boost since the beginning of the pandemic as over half of gamers in North America and Western Europe spent more time gaming, according to a report by gaming analysis firm Newzoo.

Xbox plans to release at least one new, first party game into Game Pass every quarter, as more than 23 studios worldwide are creating games for the platform.

By Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Verizon Business on Thursday launched its first commercially available private 5G network in the U.S. to offer businesses and government departments high-speed indoor or outdoor connectivity.
Private 5G networks remove the need for businesses to jostle for speed with others on a public network and help enable data-intensive applications that use computer vision, augmented reality and machine learning to increase productivity.
""You can go up to four or five gigabit (per second) speed easily today, but what is interesting is that you have four or five gigabits consistently,"" Sowmyanarayan Sampath, chief revenue officer of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Business, said in an interview. 
Verizon has been trialing private 5G with several customers and has partnered with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
The private 5G network, managed by Verizon, would keep all cellular traffic on the premises of the customer to increase security, while authorised remote users can still access applications. 
Verizon has been working with Corning (NYSE:GLW), WeWork, Tyndall Air Force Base and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, where the iconic ""Top Gun"" movie was filmed.
The company is using Corning radios and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs)'s core equipment for the initial deployment, and would be open to using gear from Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Samsung (KS:005930) at a later stage, Sampath said.
The current networks are built on existing 4G networks to account for backward and forward compatibility for devices. 

Verizon is seeing a lot of demand from financial institutions to increase speed of trading flows using 5G, and warehouses, which are planning to use robots and autonomous vehicles, Sampath said.
Ahead of the employees returning to work, several companies are also turning to 5G to upgrade their office networks to increase speeds and rearrange conference rooms to account for more video calls while maintaining social distancing.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering issuing a business improvement order to the bank as soon as next week, the newspaper said, adding the bank's parent Mizuho Financial Group Inc was also considering a pay cut for its chief executive, Tatsufumi Sakai.
A spokesperson for Mizuho said nothing had been decided. The FSA was not immediately available for comment outside of regular working hours.
Mizuho reported a large-scale systems breakdown on Feb. 28, affecting 4,318 automated teller machines (ATMs) out of 5,395 nationwide, leaving thousands of bank cards and passbooks stuck inside the devices. The bank also suffered two minor systems glitches at ATMs on March 3 and 7.
The issue on March 11 was a hardware problem at its data centre, which delayed 263 foreign currency-denominated remittances for corporate clients, worth 50 billion yen ($456 million).
The lender has set up a third-party panel to investigate the problems.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Online trading group CMC plans expansion into wealth management,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Muvija M
(Reuters) -British online trading group CMC Markets on Thursday set out plans to launch a wealth management platform, going head to head with existing players such as Hargreaves and AJ Bell, after reporting a doubling in annual profits.
Peter Cruddas, Chief Executive of the London-listed company, told Reuters he expects the new platform to be live by this time next year.
""We are going to disrupt the market, we are going to push down commissions and execution costs,"" he said.
CMC, which facilitates the trade of complex financial instruments, raised its outlook multiple times this year as a retail trading boom fuelled volumes. 
The company's active clients in contracts for difference (CFD) surged by 19,389 to 76,591, while pretax profit more than doubled to 224 million pounds ($315.80 million) for the year ended March 31.
""We have been encouraged by the growing interest in equities, not just because of the 'meme' stocks, also because of the drive towards tech stocks as well,"" CMC deputy CEO David Fineberg told Reuters. 
Rivals IG and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) have also reported strong results, powered partly by the ""GameStonk"" retail trading phenomenon. Gamestonk is named after U.S. video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) which is believed to have been the starting point for the trend.
'UNDERCUT THE MARKET'
The GameStonk effect has been most visible in the United States, where online brokers such as Robinhood have thrived on the back of a retail trading boom.
CMC pointed towards a moderation in client trading activity, but also said existing active client levels were likely to be sustainable. 
The company did not disclose further details on its planned wealth platform, first reported by Sky News, but Cruddas was confident of its prospects.

""We know what competitors charge. We are definitely going to undercut the market."" he said.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",El Salvador's bitcoin push: What does it mean for cryptocurrency?,"By Tom Wilson and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, with President Nayib Bukele touting its use for its potential to help Salvadorans living abroad to send remittances back home.
Here's what the move means for bitcoin as a mainstream currency - and emerging markets such as El Salvador:
WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?
El Salvador's law means bitcoin will have equal footing with the dollar, which became its official currency 20 years ago. 
Making bitcoin ""legal tender"" means shops and businesses must accept it for goods and services, and they can choose to express prices in the currency. 
Taxes can also be paid using bitcoin, though its use will be optional. 
SO BITCOIN WILL BE USED LIKE DOLLARS?
It's too soon to tell. 
Bitcoin's value has fluctuated wildly through its 12-year life, with regular daily double digit price moves rendering it impractical for commerce. 
It remains little used for buying goods and services across the world, despite a growing number of major companies accepting it as payment. 
El Salvador said the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate will be set by markets. Yet no detail has been given on how this will work in practice and whether and how vendors and businesses will reflect pricing in real-time or maybe through other mechanisms.
The government is guaranteeing convertibility to dollars at the time of transaction through a $150 million trust created at the country's development bank.
IS BITCOIN REALLY A CURRENCY NOW? 
Bitcoin was designed as a currency, yet many investors see it as an asset more akin to gold than a replacement for dollars, euros or yen. Financial regulators and law enforcement worldwide are debating the status of cryptocurrencies, and how they should be regulated. 
The jury is still out on whether the introduction of bitcoin to El Salvador will see it become more a transaction mechanism or take over the function of a currency in its own right. 
IS IT THE START OF A WIDER TREND? 
In theory, bitcoin offers a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional financial firms such as banks and remittance companies. 
Backers say it could catch on in emerging markets particularly, where people lack access to traditional financial services and have to pay costly fees for sending and receiving money. 
Yet converting bitcoin to and from local currencies in such economies tends to rely on informal brokers, requires know-how and is fraught with risk of scams and price fluctuations. 
Analysts say it is too soon to tell whether El Salvador's move would start a wider trend of bitcoin adoption. 
HOW WILL IT PLAY OUT IN EMERGING MARKETS?
El Salvador's experiment will provide the first opportunity for analysts to gauge the cryptocurrency impact on an economy.
Some warn the increased usage of cryptocurrencies will reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy. 
While El Salvador is already using the greenback as its legal tender, other emerging economies who are on the cusp of dollarisation might find cryptocurrency use can amplify this, dampening the ability of central banks to act as lender of last resort. 

Inflation is also in focus. 
Bitcoin - like many other cryptocurrencies - has limited supply designed to mitigate inflationary effects. But experts predict any increasing business case for cryptocurrencies could spur the creation of new ones, which means overall supply is not limited and potentially proving inflationary.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Airbus tells EU hydrogen won't be widely used in planes before 2050,"By Tim Hepher and Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) -Most airliners will rely on traditional jet engines until at least 2050, Airbus told European Union officials in a briefing released on Thursday on its research into creating zero-emissions hydrogen fuelled planes.
The planemaker says it plans to develop the world's first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035, but has not publicly said whether the technology will be ready for the replacement for the medium-haul A320, due to be rolled out in the 2030s.
February's briefing to EU officials appeared to rule this out.
""Zero-emission hydrogen aircraft will be primarily focused on regional and shorter-range aircraft from 2035. Which means that current and future iterations of highly efficient gas turbines will still be required as we move towards 2050, especially for long-haul operations,"" the presentation said.
It did not give any details on how the technology, which is still on the drawing board, would be introduced into the smaller planes. Airbus says it is still studying various concepts. 
Slides from the presentation to the office of European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans were released by InfluenceMap, an investor-led climate lobbying watchdog which said it obtained them through a freedom of information request.
They were part of a wider set of documents issued by the watchdog, which said airlines and manufacturers had urged policymakers to use EU-backed green stimulus funds to support aviation.
Airbus declined detailed comment on the February meeting.
Although research remains at an early stage, possible paths to replacement of the A320 are already a major focus of debate as rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) ponders how to shore up the competing 737 MAX and engine makers focus on evolving gas turbines.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun last week ruled out using hydrogen on a significant scale before 2050.
Hydrogen has also taken centre-stage in talks over European government support for aviation during the COVID-19 crisis.
In June last year, France announced an increase in funding for the CORAC aviation research body including 1.5 billion euros over three years for technology such as hydrogen, rescuing 500 out of 15,000 jobs threatened by an Airbus restructuring.
In briefing notes, the finance ministry listed targets for investment including hydrogen as a primary energy source for a successor to the A320 that could enter service in 2033-2035.
TOO EARLY TO DECIDE
Industry officials have played down the prospect of a switch to hydrogen for the A320 family's replacement because of the aircraft's size and range, and infrastructure needed globally. Airbus says an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds.
Airbus officials say the research will, in any event, seed disruptive technology likely to play a role in the next generation of airplanes.
Airbus engineering chief Jean-Brice Dumont told the French AJPAE media association on Thursday that hydrogen was one of several paths towards the decarbonisation of aviation and it was too early to say in what part of the market it would be used.
""We are potentially slicing up the market in a different way but it is far too early to talk about it,"" he said.
As an interim step, Airbus and others have called for more use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in existing planes. Airbus said on Thursday it would test-fly an A320 with 100% SAF by the end of this year. Current regulations allow a 50% mix.
In February's presentation, Airbus displayed industry forecasts suggesting the A320's medium-haul category of 150-250 seats would be powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) first, and ""potentially some hydrogen"" from 2050.
A smaller niche between 100-150 seats, which includes its A220 and Embraer E2, would use electric power, hydrogen and/or SAF from 2040, while only regional 50-100 seaters would be ready for hydrogen in the 2030s.
Airbus currently serves that market through its 50-70-seat ATR turboprop co-venture with Italy's Leonardo.

In September last year, Airbus presented three concepts for a hydrogen plane to enter service in 2035 including a turboprop, a traditional-looking twin-engined plane powered by hybrid-hydrogen engines and a more radical blended-wing body aircraft.
Airbus has said it will choose the final product for a new decarbonised plane in 2025. The briefing said it would also narrow down the choice of concept as early as mid-2022.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 07:56AM ET</span>","United to split 200-jet order between Boeing, Airbus -sources","(Reuters) -United Airlines is in talks to buy around 200 single-aisle jets in a multibillion-dollar revamp set to benefit both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, industry sources said.
If confirmed, the deal could include over 100 of Boeing's 737 MAX 8 and several dozen larger Airbus A321neo jets, they said, asking not to be identified.
The carrier is looking to upgrade its fleet at a time when travel is surging in the United States, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the Boeing negotiations. That portion of the order could include 150 MAX aircraft, it said.
""We do not currently have a deal in place with Boeing or Airbus to purchase new aircraft and do not comment on speculative aircraft orders,"" United spokesperson Luke Punzenberger said in response to the earlier report. 
Boeing and Airbus both said they do not comment on customer discussions. 
In March, United ordered 25 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, as it prepares to replace aging jets and meet post-pandemic demand growth.
Bookings for U.S. airlines are expected to rebound this year on the back of COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions after the pandemic caused the industry's worst downturn.
A deal split between the 168-seat Boeing 737 MAX 8 and the roughly 200-seat A321neo would deliver a broad boost to the aerospace sector as it clambers out of the COVID-19 crisis.

It would bolster Boeing's main cash cow, the MAX 8, after a safety grounding while reinforcing a trend towards Airbus at the higher end of the busy single-aisle segment that threatens to alter the product line-up in their transatlantic duopoly.
Airbus' A321neo has snapped up a dominant share of orders in the recently booming large single-aisle segment, prompting Boeing to weigh a replacement for its out-of-production 757, which overlaps with the A321neo in size and range.

125,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>",ECB Renews Pledge on Faster Bond-Buying to Ensure Crisis Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank renewed its pledge to maintain faster emergency bond-buying to sustain the euro-area’s rebound from more than a year of debilitating economic crisis.
“The Governing Council expects net purchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year,” President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues said in a statement on Thursday. They left interest rates, long-term loans to banks, and an older bond-buying program unchanged.
Lagarde will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Frankfurt time (8:30 AM ET) to explain the announcement in full, where she will also unveil the institution’s latest macroeconomic projections.
The decision underscores the ECB’s determination to allow no let-up in stimulus even as the region’s vaccination campaign and looser lockdown restrictions pave the way for a rebound. Policy makers accelerate the pace of their 1.85 trillion euro ($2.25 trillion) bond-buying program three months ago to rein in rising borrowing costs, and several have argued since then that the economy isn’t ready for a withdrawal of support.
The ECB’s continued emergency easing is likely to presage a similar move by the Federal Reserve next week not to start winding down stimulus, in a two-pronged policy push to ensure recoveries from the pandemic can be assured.
ECB purchases have been conducted at a pace of roughly 19 billion euros per week since March, up from 14 billion euros earlier in the year. Thursday’s decision suggests they are likely to continue at or close to that higher clip until the recovery firms. Most economists don’t expect a reduction until September.
The ECB’s decision will probably be paired with a more optimistic outlook for growth in 2021, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts, while inflation forecasts are also likely to have been revised higher. Policy makers both in the euro zone and in the U.S. argue that prices are being driven by temporary factors including higher fuel costs and manufacturing bottlenecks that will be resolved before too long.
In the euro area, inflation climbed to 2% in May, technically above the ECB’s target. The institution’s last forecasts, however, showed the institution missing its goal both next year and in 2023.
Officials have repeatedly warned that it is too early for a debate around winding down pandemic measures. The ECB’s emergency program is currently set to run through March 2022, and most economists don’t expect it to be extended.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Sandvik expects bigger market for battery-driven mining gear in 2-3 years,"By Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sandvik expects the market for battery-electric underground mining equipment to hit a higher gear in 2-3 years, as mining companies attempt to lower emissions and cut costs. 
With an electrification boom looming, Sandvik, whose competitors include Epiroc and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), could sell more electric than diesel-driven underground mining kit in 10 years, its mining business head said. 
Although Sandvik has some 30 battery-electric loaders and trucks in underground mine production, which it says is more than any competitor, these make up less than 0.5% of its total fleet of loaders and trucks. 
But while the market is still limited, it is gaining pace, said Henrik Ager, head of Sandvik Mining and Rock Solutions. 
""In the past two years we have gone from thinking that electrification might turn into a great technology shift to becoming certain that's where we're heading,"" he said.
Around 60% of an underground mine's energy consumption is for infrastructure, which is mainly electrified, but loaders and trucks, carrying up to 65 tonnes of rock, still run on diesel. 
Ager said electric machines should be fully proven to work in mines and be discussed in all procurement in 2-3 years.
Investment bank UBS said electrification will bring lower emissions and savings for mining companies.
""In the years to come we shall see an accelerated replacement cycle for especially underground mining equipment, although surface equipment will also benefit from solid growth rates,"" analyst Guillermo Peigneux Lojo said. 
Battery-driven machines are more expensive to buy, but savings on ventilation and cooling, big costs in underground mines, makes it beneficial to go electric already, Ager said. 
It could take time, however, before fully electrified mines. 
""Let's say we start selling more electric than diesel in 10 years ... before most diesel has been swapped for electricity, it's been more like 15-20 years,"" Ager said, adding Canada has moved farthest due to tough diesel rules.
Sites which use Sandvik's battery-electric equipment include Newmont's Borden gold mine and New Gold (NYSE:NGD)'s New Afton mine in Canada. 

The Swedish firm, whose equipment uses lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, expects to offer a full range of underground electric loaders and haul trucks by 2022.
Sandvik, which has automation installed in some 65 mines, estimates that around 1,000 underground mines have a strong business case for automation. Ager said Sandvik's ambition is the same as U.S carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s - to build around the battery, rather than starting with the vehicle itself. ""It's the Tesla parallel. That is what they have done, and it's much better,"" Ager added.

LONDON (Reuters) -Banks must set aside enough capital to cover losses on any bitcoin holdings in full, global regulators proposed on Thursday, in a ""conservative"" step that could prevent widescale use of the cryptocurrency by big lenders. 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, made up of regulators from the world's leading financial centres, proposed a twin approach to capital requirements for cryptoassets held by banks in its first bespoke rule for the nascent sector.
El Salvador has become the world's first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender even though central banks globally have repeatedly warned that investors in the cryptocurrency must be ready to lose all their money. 
Major economies including China and the United States have signalled in recent weeks a tougher approach, while developing plans to develop their own central bank digital currencies. 
The Swiss-based Basel committee said in a consultation paper that while bank exposures to cryptoassets are limited, their continued growth could increase risks to global financial stability from fraud, cyber attacks, money laundering and terrorist finance if capital requirements are not introduced.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently worth around $1.6 trillion globally, which is still tiny compared with bank holdings of loans, derivatives and other major assets.
Basel's rules require banks to assign ""risk weightings"" to different types of assets on their books, with these totted up to determine overall capital requirements.
For cryptoassets, Basel is proposing two broad groups.
The first includes certain tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins which would come under existing rules and treated in the same way as bonds, loans, deposits, equities or commodities.
This means the weighting could range between 0% for a tokenised sovereign bond to 1,250% or full value of asset covered by capital.
The value of stablecoins and other group 1 crypto-assets are tied to a traditional asset, such as the dollar in the case of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s proposed Diem stablecoin.
Nevertheless, given cryptoassets are based on new and rapidly evolving technology like blockchain, this poses a potentially increased likelihood of operational risks which need an ""add-on"" capital charge for all types, Basel said.
'UNIQUE RISKS'
The second group includes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that would be subject to a new ""conservative prudential treatment"" with a risk-weighting of 1,250% because of their ""unique risks"".
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not linked to any underlying asset.
Under Basel rules, a 1,250% risk weight translates into banks having to hold capital at least equal in value to their exposures to bitcoin or other group 2 cryptoassets.
""The capital will be sufficient to absorb a full write-off of the cryptoasset exposures without exposing depositors and other senior creditors of the banks to a loss,"" it added.
Joseph Edwards, head of research at crypto brokerage Enigma Securities, said a global regulatory framework for cryptoassets is a positive given that banks in Europe are divided over involvement in the sector.
""If something is to be treated as an universal asset, it effectively needs to meet quorum with regards to how many parties will handle it. This should move the needle somewhat on that,"" Edwards said.
Bitcoin gained after Basel's announcement, trading up 1.5% at $37,962 at 1053 GMT.
Few other assets that have such conservative treatment under Basel's existing rules, and include investments in funds or securitisations where banks do not have sufficient information about their underlying exposures.
The value of bitcoin has swung wildly, hitting a record high of around $64,895 in mid-April, before slumping to around $36,834 on Thursday.
Banks' appetite for cryptocurrencies varies, with HSBC saying it has no plans for a cryptocurrency trading desk because the digital coins are too volatile. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) restarted its crypto trading desk in March.

Basel said that given the rapidly evolving nature of cryptoassets, a further public consultation on capital requirements is likely before final rules are published.
Central bank digital currencies are not included in its proposals.

129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 07:18AM ET</span>",G-7 Debates Cutting Gas and Diesel Car Sales to Minority by 2030,"(Bloomberg) -- Group of Seven leaders are discussing ambitious plans to shift the balance of car buying away from gasoline to greener vehicles by the end of the decade, as part of a package of measures to combat climate change.
Under one proposal contained in a document seen by Bloomberg, G-7 governments would “strive” to ensure that the majority of all new passenger car sales are not petrol or diesel-powered “by 2030 or sooner.” Countries are divided on how specific the measures should be.
All seven national leaders gathering for their summit in Cornwall, southwestern England, are also set to promise more funding to help the developing world cut carbon emissions, though details of how much are not clear.
The commitments have not yet been agreed to by G-7 officials who are drafting the conclusions of this weekend’s summit. But setting the goal for moving away from gasoline could represent a turning point in efforts to reduce global oil consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
With a day to go before the summit begins, the plans are still in draft form and it’s not clear yet that leaders – crucially including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will endorse the proposed wording on moving away from polluting cars.
A U.S. official declined to say whether the White House supports the drafting under discussion, including whether to set a goal that more than half of vehicles sold in 2030 are non-emitting.
The official said Biden believes in strong investment in electric vehicle markets and the supply chain as a way to tackle climate change and create jobs. But the U.S.’s domestic plan doesn’t go as far as to call for a ban on combustion engine cars.
The biggest U.S. automakers have recently set targets for greener vehicle production. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). announced in January that it aspired to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. pledged last month that four of every 10 vehicles Ford sells would be battery powered by 2030.
Japan also issued a green strategy plan in December to make all new cars hybrid or electric by the mid-2030s, despite  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. President Akio Toyoda warning days before that governments announcing combustion-car bans were overlooking risks to jobs.
In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the G-7 leaders’ gathering, will ban the sale of new cars running entirely on petrol or diesel from 2030, though the other nations are not likely to back such a dramatic step. At the moment, only a fraction of new vehicles sold in the U.K. are fully electric, with costs putting most consumers off.
According to proposed wording in the draft summit communique, leaders would commit to decarbonise their transport sectors throughout the 2020s by accelerating the spread of electric vehicles, and the development of zero carbon trains, buses, shipping and aviation.
On other climate change measures, the draft agreement include:"
130,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 07:17AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bank of America leaves Wall Street wondering about next CEO,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Brian Moynihan took the reins at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) in 2010, the U.S. bank was reeling.
Its former CEO suddenly left as scandals and probes related to a major acquisition unfurled. Its stock price was tanking, and the global financial crisis was still going strong.
Since then, Moynihan, 61, has not just righted the ship, but transformed Bank of America, leaving analysts, industry people and some investors wondering what - and who - comes next.
Moynihan has no imminent plans to leave, but as his tenure continues, so does the mystery of who will replace him. Candidates who were clear front-runners have grown too old, while those recently promoted to Bank of America's management committee are too fresh-faced.
That leaves Moynihan with a new challenge over the next few years: determining who would best replace him, and marketing that person to the world without alienating other senior executives.
""Who becomes CEO is not a minor thing,"" said Sydney Finkelstein, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.
Moynihan's predecessor, Ken Lewis, left after months of public drama and decisions that resulted in criticism from lawmakers, regulators and investors, Finkelstein noted. Although Moynihan has the bank on much steadier footing, he has been there long enough for constituents to want a road map for the future, Finkelstein said.
""You're not going to leave the bank in that same mess,"" he said. ""OK, well, what are you going to do?”
Moynihan was not available for an interview, said a spokesperson, who declined to comment for this story.
LAST ONE STANDING
It is not unusual to have leadership voids at companies with relatively fresh CEOs who want to groom deputies over 5-10 years. The situation is less common at companies with CEOs who have been in place for a long time, and have effectively executed their visions, sources said.
Of the six biggest U.S. banks, Bank of America is the only one not to have changed CEOs in recent years or outlined a relatively clear succession plan lately.
Circumstances are different at each institution. Yet it leaves Moynihan as the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street who has not offered a crisp idea of who is next, analysts said.
""Up until now, Brian Moynihan has wanted to see through the changes that he spearheaded,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Jeffery Harte. ""But now he has done that.""
The perfect successor would be about 45-50 years old now, have experience leading different parts of Bank of America's eight businesses, be comfortable with regulators and understand the bank's social-purpose agenda, said several recruiters.
That leaves no obvious internal candidate to succeed him.
""Now that he has four or five years of runway left, investors should be rightfully saying, 'Hmmm,'"" said one former bank employee.
Bank of America's board takes succession planning seriously and has the topic on its agenda, said a different person who was familiar with the board's thinking. The board met twice last year to discuss the topic.
They both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters or avoid professional consequences for speaking to the press.
Headhunters mentioned seven Bank of America executives as contenders: Raul Anaya, Dean Athanasia, Cathy Bessant, Steve Boland, Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare and Andy Seig. PNC’s Mike Lyons and former SunTrust executive Mark Chancy are also possibilities, they said.
Moynihan’s No. 2, Tom Montag, could take charge if his boss had to leave immediately. But at 64, Montag is not viewed as a long-term CEO candidate.
'RESPONSIBLE GROWTH' Few expect Bank of America to outline a detailed succession plan any time soon, but a prolonged search can be risky because the best people may grow impatient and leave, sources said.
Moynihan won his own succession battle partly because of his legal expertise. He spent years resolving hairy regulatory probes and lawsuits, including a $17 billion settlement with the Justice Department in 2014.
He also set his sights on cost-cutting and integrating a tangle of businesses that created Bank of America from deals spanning two decades.
Moynihan’s strategy helped Bank of America produce a $16.5 billion profit and 6.8% return on equity last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, compared with a $6.8 billion profit and 0.3% return on equity in 2009. Its share price is now about $43, compared with $16 when Moynihan took charge.

As the global economy heals from COVID-19 and business picks up, analysts expect the bank to do even better.
Investors like Warren Buffett have embraced Moynihan's mantra of ""responsible growth."" Buffett has accumulated nearly 12% of Bank of America shares, while selling stock in rivals.

The proximity of the latest U.S. consumer price release, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), has stifled activity, with investors fretting that a sharp spike in inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to curb the pace of its asset purchases or begin to signal an increase to interest rates.
Consumer prices are rising quickly as the economy reopens after the pandemic, and this report is expected to show prices rose another 0.4% in May, pushing annual inflation above April’s 4.2%, already the highest in more than a decade, to 4.7%.
“Although this should be a peak in U.S. prices, inflation should remain elevated and above the target throughout the year.” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Additionally, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week is seen dropping by 15,000 to 370,000 from 385,000 the previous week, in a further sign of economic reopening. 
In corporate news, retail favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) is likely to be in focus Thursday, trading around 6% lower premarket, after the struggling video games retailer said after the close Wednesday that it planned to offer more shares and disclosed that regulators are investigating trading of its stock.
The meme stock also announced it has appointed new chief executive and chief financial officers from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while reporting first-quarter earnings that beat estimates.
Crude oil prices edged higher Thursday, struggling to add to the substantial gains the market has posted this year as increased U.S. gasoline stocks punctured optimism for rising demand during the U.S. driving season.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.3% at $70.14 a barrel, after earlier this week closing above the $70 mark for the first time since October 2018. Brent was up 0.4% at $72.48, still below the highest level since May 2019. 
On Wednesday, crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a draw, for the third straight week, of just over 5 million barrels for the week ending June 4. 
However, U.S. gasoline inventories increased the most since April 2020, rising by more than 7 million barrels for a second weekly gain, suggesting weaker-than-expected fuel demand at the start of summer, the country's peak season for motoring.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Lakeland Industries  (NASDAQ:LAKE) stock fell more than 7% in Thursday’s premarket trading a day after the company reported weaker than expected quarterly results.
The maker of personal protective equipment saw Covid-related demand tapering off as the pandemic came off its peak globally, with the share of revenues in net sales attributable to Covid almost halving to 13% in the quarter ended April 30 from 25% in the same quarter of the last fiscal year. 
Lakeland President and Chief Executive Officer Charles D. Roberson warned supply now exceeds demand in the protective clothing market. Inventory levels throughout the supply chain have gone up, he said.
“In Q1FY21 we also saw a significant decline in our direct container sales which further reinforces this belief,” Roberson said.
Lakeland’s net sales fell by a quarter to $34.1 million, and diluted EPS fell to 57 cents from $1.07 in the first quarter of the last fiscal year.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 06:57AM ET</span>","Google, Facebook pledged millions for local news. Was it enough?","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Facing regulatory and political pressure, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google in recent years committed a combined $600 million to support news outlets globally - many of them local or regional enterprises foundering in a digital age.
Thousands of media outlets received financial and other support for everything from fact checking and reporting to training, according to the tech giants’ announcements. Some publishers express gratitude for contributions they say are essential as advertising revenue has plunged.
But several media analysts and news business executives told Reuters that the funding - set to last three years - does not nearly compensate for the tens of billions of dollars publishers lost as the tech companies gobbled up the digital advertising market. Google and Facebook accounted for 54% of U.S. digital advertising revenue in 2020, according to eMarketer, a market research company.
Some critics dismissed the projects, including contributions of $300 million from each company, as a way to blunt complaints from publishers and generate good PR. Both tech companies face battles over compensation for news content worldwide, as well as antitrust lawsuits from regulators and publishers.
This “occasional benevolence” is “a drop in the bucket,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, publisher of Gannett’s USA Today and president of USA Today Network, which participates in a fact-checking program sponsored by Facebook. “News publishers are not looking for charity. We're simply requesting a fair shot and a level playing field.”
Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, said the money is vital to newsrooms in the short-term. “But they're not given at a level which really has a lasting effect on the field, and it isn't really changing anything.”
The tech giants told Reuters that they are genuinely committed to helping local and regional outlets, and both will continue to offer support after the $600 million initiatives expire in coming months.
The goal of the Facebook Journalism Project, as it is known, is to help publishers “effectively transition to and prosper in today's digital world where they have to find a very specific audience in order to be successful,” said Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook.
Google is “oriented around making sure that there's a healthy and vibrant ecosystem of quality journalism,” said Ben Monnie, the company’s director of global partnerships.
Reuters participates in initiatives funded by both Google and Facebook. Under the Facebook Journalism Project, for instance, Reuters received funding to develop a digital media training course for journalists. Neither Facebook nor Reuters would disclose the amount of money allocated.
Both Facebook and Google have made contributions to the news industry apart from the $600 million. For instance, the companies dedicated $1 billion each last year in grants and deals to pay a range of media worldwide for content. As part of that commitment, Google pays publishers such as Reuters to create and curate content for its News Showcase - snippets for its News and Discover apps.
The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which is largely funded by the corporate foundation of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), announced in 2020 that it received about $19 million in grants from Google and $4 million from Facebook.
Both Facebook and Google say publishers benefit just from using their platforms, which deliver traffic that helps drive advertising revenue and subscriptions.
“We are a free service that is available to anyone to post content,” Brown said. Publishers’ participation “suggests they are getting value from the platform without us making these additional investments.”
WHERE DID THE MONEY GO?
Facebook, a social media goliath, and Google, by far the world’s most popular search engine, generated $607 billion in advertising revenue during the last three years, according to company filings. The companies are among the biggest corporate funders of the global news industry.
The two platforms have released limited information so far about how the $600 million in grants and services has been spent, often offering broad descriptions or examples without financial details.
Google has publicly identified buckets of spending worth about $198 million - including $81 million aimed at “elevating quality journalism” such as training on how to use Google products in reporting. The company, which said it expects to spend the full $300 million by year’s end, lists over 6,250 “news partners” in the project, ranging from the Associated Press and BuzzFeed News to the Cook Islands News in the South Pacific.
Facebook has said that its $300 million has been fully spent, more than half of it in support of local news. The company’s public announcements account for $80.3 million, a quarter of which went to a program that helps local newsrooms attract more digital subscribers. A company spokesperson, Adam Isserlis, said the project also includes proprietary deals with publishers, the details of which are confidential.
Several news executives said they are prodding the tech giants to pay more for content and to further prioritize original reporting. Facebook and Google say they have already changed their algorithms to do just that.
Meanwhile, some publishers see a lifeline. An executive at the Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina, said a Google-funded training “lab” helped the paper determine the volume and price of digital subscribers that would cover expenses.
At Cityside, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, co-founder Lance Knobel said he used $1.56 million from Google to help launch and support an online local news website, Oaklandside.
“I honestly think their big interest is that they want a healthy news environment,” he said.
FRIEND AND FOE
Other publishers are dissatisfied or ambivalent, viewing the tech goliaths as both friend and foe.
The companies have a huge impact on outlets’ advertising revenues because their algorithms determine whether an article shows up prominently in a Google search or on Facebook’s news feed.
Google runs one of the largest online advertising exchanges for digital ads that are bought and sold automatically via software programs. Since Google competes as both the biggest buyer and seller on that exchange, it can steer business to itself, some publishers and other critics have alleged.
In the United States alone, digital and print ad revenue for newspapers fell to $14.3 billion in 2018 from $49.4 billion in 2005.
On June 7, under a settlement with France’s antitrust watchdog https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-watchdog-fines-google-220-mln-euros-abuse-market-power-ad-business-2021-06-07, Google agreed to share more data with ad buyers broadly - therefore reducing some of its competitive advantage over publishers.
Google and Facebook face other legal challenges https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-antitrust-google-facts-factbox-int/factbox-big-tech-comes-under-rapid-fire-from-five-u-s-lawsuits-more-probes-underway-idUSKBN28R39Q. The Nation, a progressive U.S. news website, and West Virginia-based newspaper company HD Media are among publishers https://www.reuters.com/technology/daily-mail-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-2021-04-20 to file antitrust lawsuits against one or both tech giants in recent months. U.S. authorities have filed antitrust suits against both as well, and some states https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google/texas-nine-u-s-states-accuse-google-of-working-with-facebook-to-break-antitrust-law-idUSKBN28Q2RL have accused Google of unlawfully dominating the process of placing ads online. 
In responses to some of the suits, the companies dismissed claims that their business practices hurt publishers. Google said people use the company because they choose to, not because they’re forced to.

Frank Blethen sees things differently.
The Seattle Times publisher said his paper has participated in programs backed by Google and Facebook. But “if they hadn’t monopolized advertising and gamed search the way they have, newspapers would still be making money,” he said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy aims to spur total investments of more than one billion euros ($1.22 billion) to build an electric car battery factory with car maker Stellantis expected to play a leading role, three government sources told Reuters.
In the plan it sent Brussels in April to access EU Recovery Funds, Rome has earmarked around 600 million euros of public money for the project to build a gigafactory in Italy.
But it is confident this could trigger further investments from industrial and financial partners to bring the total to more than one billion euros, the sources said.
Rome's plan is to set up a large public-private partnership (PPP) scheme with a stake held by Stellantis even though other options are also being considered, one of the sources said.
A second source said Stellantis had offered to play a leading role in implementing the plan.
Stellantis, formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA, declined to comment.
Stellantis top management have met Energy Transition minister Roberto Cingolani five times in recent months, a ministry source said, adding one meeting also included managers from ACC, the battery joint venture between PSA and TotalEnergies.
The sources cautioned any plan would need the green light from Brussels to make sure it is compliant with competition and state aid rules.
Italy's Recovery Plan envisages a 37 gigawatt hours (GWH) battery factory employing up to 500 new workers by 2030. The document targets some 1.8 billion euros in funding by that date though one ministry source said this was unlikely.
Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, currently has two gigafactory projects in Europe, in France and in Germany, with overall investments of 5 billion euros.
It has said additional factories in Europe and in the United States will be decided in 2021 to support its shift to electric mobility. 
Rome could face stiff competition from other EU countries, including Spain which is moving aggressively to land new battery and electric vehicle plants using billions of EU pandemic relief funds. 

""There's a lot of competition... we'll have to offer a strong strategy and a credible team,"" the ministry source said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union decided not to take up an option to buy 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine and is considering donating another 100 million optional shots, if ordered, European officials said.
The discussions show a drop in confidence in the one-dose shot, which was initially touted as crucial for a successful vaccination drive in Europe, but has been largely relegated to a back-up choice after safety and supply problems.
The EU at the end of March let the term to order 100 million extra doses lapse, three European officials with direct knowledge of contracts with vaccine makers told Reuters, revealing a confidential clause of the contract with J&J which had not been previously disclosed.
Under the contract, the EU ordered 200 million doses of the vaccine, and had options to buy another 200 million in two separate tranches.
The deadline for the second option for the remaining 100 million doses expires at the end of June but no decision has yet been made about whether to exercise it, the officials said.
A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on the matter.
The company's supply problems might play a role in the decision.
As part of the initial order, J&J committed to delivering 55 million doses to the EU by the end of June, but has so far shipped only about 12 million, according to an EU Commission official with access to the latest delivery figures.
EU governments ""have voiced their concerns at the current delays"", the EU spokesman said.
Two U.S.-made batches with millions of vaccines have been on hold for weeks as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) assesses their safety after cases of contaminations at a factory run by J&J subcontractor Emergent in the United States. 
In another hiccup, Johnson & Johnson also briefly suspended deliveries to the EU just after it began them in April over health concerns. The vaccine has been linked to very rare but serious cases of blood clots.
J&J declined to comment on supply issues and EU's optional orders but reiterated its commitment to supplying the bloc with 200 million doses. 
DONATIONS?
The EU has secured enough vaccines from other suppliers to immunize its adult population in the summer, internal estimates show, and has also a large contract with Pfizer/BioNTech for the next years, should boosters be needed.
However, the EU is still considering the possible order of optional J&J doses, mostly with the intent of donating them to poorer countries, the officials said.
The EU has so far pledged to donate at least 100 million excess doses by the end of the year.
COVAX, a vaccine programme co-led by the World Health Organization, has so far delivered only about 80 million doses to nearly 130 countries with a combined population of billions.

Before it faced supply problems, COVAX planned to ship at least 2 billion doses by the end of the year. It now relies largely on donations to meet that target.
Some of the EU's extra doses from J&J, if ordered, could be offered to COVAX, the officials said. But some EU countries may also decide to keep some for their own populations.

Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock dropped by more than 7% in Thursday’s premarket trading, hit by a lack of guidance from the company even as its first quarter numbers, disclosed a day earlier, provided some hope for the struggling retailer.
Fear of earnings dilution because of the company’s plans to issue 5 million shares from “time to time” added to the negative sentiment.
The earnings of the video games retailer have been keenly awaited the last few quarters given the craze for the stock among the retail investors.
The company said its second quarter sales trends, the only indicator it provided for the ongoing quarter, continue to reflect momentum, with May total sales increasing approximately 27% compared with last year.
It also reported an adjusted net loss for the quarter ended May 1 of $29.4 million or 45 cents per diluted share, compared with a $157.6-million loss or $2.44 per diluted share in the fiscal 2020 first quarter.
Net sales rose by more than a quarter from a year ago period to $1.27 billion, overcoming a nearly 12% reduction in the company’s global store base due to strategic reasons and continued store closures across Europe because of the pandemic.
The company has additionally appointed a new CEO and a CFO, both of whom are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) veterans.

(Reuters) - Eightfold AI, a talent matching platform, said on Thursday it raised $220 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 2 that doubled the company's valuation since the previous funding round to over $2 billion.
Eightfold AI helps companies evaluate talent by scraping data from company sources such as sales and customer management or human resources platforms along with public data from patents, publications or design portfolios.
“We will integrate with all those systems and bring the employee data all in one place and use that to build what we call a 360 degree profile of each and every employee,” said Ashutosh Garg, founder and CEO at Eightfold AI. 
The profile will help employees find other suitable jobs within the company or help managers identify them for promotions or new jobs. The tool can also be used when recruiting new employees and suggesting new courses that employees can take to advance their careers, said Garg.
He said over 100 companies and some U.S. states are customers, and that Eightfold AI is used in over 110 countries and available in 15 languages. 
In March, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development announced it was offering Eightfold AI to help unemployed workers find jobs, and Garg said some other states will announce that people collecting unemployment benefits must use Eightfold AI.

Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said Eightfold AI took a more holistic approach than other companies offering solutions to recruitment and career management. He siad he expected it could grow to be “bigger than all of them combined”.

A ruling by Germany's high court at the end of April makes it harder for banks to change terms and conditions with their customers, meaning clients may claw back past price increases and changing the way banks operate in the future.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of WeChat and TikTok, and ordered a Commerce Department review of security concerns posed by those apps and others. 
The administration of former President Donald Trump had attempted to block new users from downloading the apps and ban other technical transactions that Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok and WeChat both said would effectively block the apps' use in the United States. 
The courts blocked those orders, which never took effect.
A separate U.S. national security review of TikTok launched in late 2019 remains active and ongoing, a White House official said, declining to offer any details. The White House remains very concerned about the data risks of TikTok users, another administration official told reporters. 
The Biden order directs the Commerce Department to monitor software applications like TikTok that could affect U.S. national security, as well as to make recommendations within 120 days to protect U.S. data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries.
TikTok declined to comment. WeChat did not immediately comment.
""This is a positive step in the right direction,"" said Gao Feng, spokesperson at the Chinese commerce ministry, at a regular press conference on Thursday. Gao added that China had noticed that the United States requires a new security review of the apps, and hopes that ""the U.S. will treat Chinese companies fairly and avoid politicizing economic and trade issues.""
WeChat, which has been downloaded at least 19 million times by U.S. users, is widely used as a medium for services, games and payments. 
Michael Bien, the lead lawyer for the WeChat Users Alliance, which had sued to block the Trump order, praised the Biden administration for revoking the ""wrong-headed ban on WeChat that ... would have led to the unprecedented shutdown of a major platform for communications relied on by millions of people in the United States.""
Biden's new executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders Trump issued in August, along with another in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.
The January Trump order directed officials to ban transactions with eight Chinese apps including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's QQ Wallet and WeChat pay; no bans have been issued to date.
The Trump administration contended that WeChat and TikTok posed national security concerns because sensitive personal data of U.S. users could be collected by China’s government.
Both TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, and WeChat have denied posing national security concerns. 
In February, Reuters reported corporate sponsors raced back to TikTok after some had paused or delayed efforts following Trump's August announcement. General Motors (NYSE:GM)' flagship Chevrolet brand began advertising on TikTok in February through its own channel.
The Trump administration had appealed judicial orders blocking the bans on TikTok and WeChat, but after Biden took office in January, the U.S. Justice Department asked to pause the appeals.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Status reports are due in the appeals cases on Friday.
Biden's order says collecting of data from Americans ""threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information."" 
The order directs the Commerce Department to ""evaluate on a continuing basis"" any transactions that ""pose an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of the critical infrastructure or digital economy of the United States."" 
Biden's executive order requires within 60 days that U.S. intelligence and Homeland Security agencies provide vulnerability and threat assessments on U.S. data controlled by foreign adversaries to the Commerce Department as it conducts its review. 

Republican Senator Josh Hawley said on Twitter the withdrawal of the Trump orders are ""a major mistake - shows alarming complacency regarding #China’s access to Americans’ personal information, as well as #China’s growing corporate influence.""
Last week, Biden signed an executive order that bans U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies in the defense and surveillance technology sectors. The order replaced a similar Trump-era order that did not withstand legal scrutiny.

The consultants include Kantar Group from Britain and two Japan-based firms, Macromill Inc and Intage Holdings, the FT said, citing unidentified people.

More than 60 Japanese companies, such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and and beverage maker Asahi Holdings, have together paid more than $3 billion to sponsor the Tokyo Games.
Most Japanese want the games canceled or delayed again, amid concern that tens of thousands of foreign athletes and Olympic officials could bring new coronavirus variants and further pressure on an already stretched medical system.

Contemporary Amperex Technology, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) supplier, jumped as much as 8.6% in Shenzhen, taking its gains from a low in March to more than 50%. CATL led advances in not just in EVs but green energy-related stocks as well. A BloombergNEF outlook report and China’s moves to boost the sector including People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang pledging increased support spurred the gains.
Investor appetite is growing for the Chinese company that’s been a beneficiary of a worldwide push toward curbing carbon emissions. BloombergNEF analysts expect global annual passenger EV sales rising to 14 million in 2025 from 3.1 million in 2020 and lithium-battery demand growing rapidly to approach 4.5TWh annually by 2035.
This year “marks the first major increase to our EV adoption outlook in the last five years,” driven by factors like rising policy support, accelerated investments and rising consumer adoption, BloombergNEF analysts wrote in a report. “Meeting this demand requires unprecedented but achievable increases in materials, components and cell production.”

LONDON (Reuters) -Morrisons on Thursday became the latest British supermarket group to be targeted by activist shareholders over the amount of unhealthy food it sells.
Responsible investment group ShareAction said it, along with seven institutional investors managing $1.1 trillion between them, had written to Morrisons Chairman Andrew Higginson ahead of the grocer's annual shareholders' meeting calling on it to boost sales of healthier food and drink products.
Last month market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) agreed to increase healthy food options at operations in Europe and Britain to appease investors co-ordinated by ShareAction who had filed a landmark shareholder resolution to force the issue.
ShareAction has also previously targeted  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and HSBC on the issue of climate change. 
The Morrisons investors signing the letter included NEST, Guy’s & St Thomas’ Foundation, JO Hambro Capital Management and Castlefield Investment Partners.
They noted that Morrisons has a target to increase the number of healthier own-brand products to 65% of all own-brand products by 2025 but said this did not go far enough.
“While Morrisons has made significant progress in reducing the calorie, salt and sugar content of its own-brand products, questions remain about the company’s strategy and overall exposure to growing regulatory pressure and consumer trends supporting healthier diets,"" said Ignacio Vazquez, senior manager at ShareAction, which co-ordinated the letter.
The investors want Morrisons to disclose the share of total food and non-alcoholic drink annual sales by volume made up of healthier products, and to publish a long-term target to significantly increase that share.
They also want Morrisons to update on its progress towards targets in its annual reports from 2022 onwards.
They noted that of Britain's listed supermarket groups - Tesco, No. 2 Sainsbury's and No. 4 Morrisons - Morrisons is the only one yet to set sales-based health targets.

""We are committed to helping our customers make healthier choices and we are supportive of measuring performance and setting meaningful targets,"" said a Morrisons spokesperson.
""We already publish the proportion of our own brand products which are classed as healthy and have a commitment to increase this.""

Investing.com – China Three Gorges Renewables Group Co. was up 44.15% in its trading debut on the Shanghai stock exchange as investors bet on gaining from China’s push toward cleaner energy.
Shares of the company surged up to 3.82 yuan apiece in early trading, surpassing its IPO price of 2.65 yuan.
The renewables unit of China Three Gorges Corp raised 22.7 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in May, becoming the largest listing in 2021 so far in China. The parent company said proceeds from the listing would be used to invest in offshore wind power projects and replenish liquidity.
As the world’s largest hydropower company, the total assets of China Three Gorges Corp’s renewables unit are valued at more than 140 billion yuan, according to the company website.
The IPO comes as China is pushing for renewable energy, aiming to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.
“The open reflects the investor appetite that we are seeing for new energy stocks such as hydropower and wind power, which have a very positive outlook…ESG, social and environment stocks will be the main trend for the next decade,” Emperor Securities research director Stanley Chan told Bloomberg.
The listing follows a slew of other energy companies’ IPOs recently, including Shanghai Electric Wind Power Group’s 2.9 billion yuan offering in May, which is now trading 68% above its IPO price.
China Three Gorges said earlier this week that it had completed the construction of China’s first floating offshore wind project."

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of 79 company bosses and investors managing $41 trillion issued separate calls on Thursday for world leaders to accelerate action on climate change by enacting more ambitious policies in areas including carbon pricing.
In an open letter to all governments as leaders of the G7 group of industrialised nations meet in Britain, and ahead of a global climate summit in November, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders called for ""bold action"" now to meet future emissions targets.
To force corporate action, governments needed to change the rules of the game, they said, including by developing a market-based carbon pricing mechanism.
Countries should also force all businesses to establish ""credible"" decarbonisation targets, plus disclose emissions across all parts of their business, said the CEOs who include Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY)'s Christian Mumenthaler, Boston Consulting Group's Rich Lesser and Royal DSM's Feike Sijbesma.
The bosses also backed an elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, cuts on tariffs for climate-friendly goods, a boost in research and development funding for green technologies.
A separate statement backed by 457 investors warned governments that those countries to take the lead would become ""increasingly attractive"" investment destinations, while laggards would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
Key to that was for countries to commit to tougher emissions reduction cuts by 2030 and implement the domestic policies necessary to become net zero by 2050, added the investors, who include the likes of New York State, Fidelity International and Legal & General Investment Management. 
""Strong policies, in line with limiting global warming to no more than 1.5-degrees Celsius, can accelerate and scale up private capital flows towards the net-zero transition,"" said the 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis. 
Founded in 2014 and hosted by the World Economic Forum, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders aims to help drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Ahead of the COP26 climate summit on Glasgow, governments need to publish plans to halve emissions by 2030, commit to net-zero emissions by 2050 and put in place ""robust"" policy roadmaps and interim targets, the CEOs said. 
Developed countries also needed to exceed their $100 billion commitment to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change, and ensure development finance bodies commit to science-based targets across their lending portfolios.

The economy is operating within a reasonable range close to the potential output level, and prices are overall manageable, Yi said at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai. The interest rate is kept at an appropriate level, and it’s still relatively low compared with rates in other developing markets, he said.
“There are still uncertainties with the overseas pandemic situation, economic recovery and macro policies, and we must not lower our guard regarding inflation and deflation pressures from all sides,” the governor said.
Consumer inflation accelerated to 1.3% in May, government data showed Wednesday, below economists estimates of 1.6%. Producer prices have been surging at a faster pace though, largely due to commodity prices, fueling concerns that inflation pressures could spread more broadly in the economy. So far, there’s little evidence of that happening as factories have been absorbing rising costs.
Yi also said the surge in producer prices this year is partially due to a low base from last year.
China’s potential economic growth will slow, as the economy shifts toward high-quality development from high-speed growth, while the comparison base gets bigger, Yi said. The aging population will help curb inflation, while the economy’s transition toward green energy might add to price pressures.
China will keep the exchange rate of yuan basically stable, and encourage financial institutions to use monetary policy tools to help the nation achieve the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2060, according to Yi.

The unit of China Three Gorges Corp. saw its shares climb to as high as 3.82 yuan apiece on the Shanghai stock exchange in early trading Thursday, from its IPO price of 2.65 yuan.
The company’s listing, the year’s biggest in China, has been eagerly awaited. It raised 22.7 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in a May offering that was 78 times oversubscribed. China Three Gorges said proceeds from the offering would be used to help fund offshore wind power projects and replenish liquidity.
The parent is the world’s largest hydropower company, and its renewables unit’s total assets are valued at more than 140 billion yuan, according to the company website.
The listing comes amid a concerted push for renewable energy in Asia’s largest economy. China’s aim to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 has fueled a surge in installations of wind and solar capacity. Still, challenges in the wind sector include rising domestic competition and the lapsing of subsides that have helped accelerate the industry’s growth.
“The open reflects the investor appetite that we are seeing for new energy stocks such as hydropower and wind power, which have a very positive outlook,” Emperor Securities research director Stanley Chan said by phone. “ESG, social and environment stocks will be the main trend for the next decade.”
China Three Gorges Renewables joins a spate of other energy companies going public recently. Among them was Shanghai Electric Wind Power Group’s 2.9 billion yuan offering last month. The stock is now trading 68% above its IPO price.
China Three Gorges announced this week that it had completed the construction of China’s first floating offshore wind project. While wind installations doubled to a record in 2020, the focus has been on onshore projects.
Prior to trading, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said that the China Three Gorges Renewables listing supported a “stable outlook” on the company and that it is credit positive.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Thursday morning as investors await U.S. inflation data to be released later in the day to get hints of the possibility of tapering asset purchases.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.5% for the first time in a month.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.30% by 10:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT) while the SZSE Component rose 0.41%. U.S.-China tensions are on investors’ radar. U.S. president Joe Biden signed an order on Wednesday to revoke bans imposed by former President Donald Trump on TikTok and WeChat. Instead, the US Department of Commerce will now review apps with ties to foreign adversaries that may pose a security risk to American data privacy or national security.
Meanwhile, data released on Wednesday said the Chinese consumer price index (CPI) for May contracted 0.2% month-on-month and grew 1.3% year-on-year, missing forecasts. However, the producer price index (PPI) exceeded expectations, growing 9% year on year.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.45%, with industrial production data in April to be released later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.35% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.34%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.41% after the country released the Housing Industry Association (HIA) New Home Sales data earlier in the day.
On the data front, investors now await the U.S. CPI for May and initial jobless claims, due later in the day to get further clues on the direction of U.S. monetary policy.
""A significant upside surprise in inflation could tilt the U.S. Federal Reserve taper discussion to sooner rather than later, though the majority would still be looking for substantial progress toward maximum employment before considering tapering,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note.
So far though, ""the market is buying into the Fed's view that the rise in prices is transitory and the Fed will not alter its policy guidance at next week’s FOMC meeting,"" they added.
Some investors are reportedly less concerned about the upcoming U.S. print and the possibility that the Fed will start talking about tapering asset purchases later in the week.
“Even if inflation comes out a little higher than Street expectations tomorrow, the Fed isn’t going to change its path,” Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, told Bloomberg. “There’s a lot of wait-and-see going on and really just thinking it would take a lot to really surprise markets.”
Across the Atlantic, investors are focusing on the European Central Bank’s policy decision due to be handed down later in the day.

The Judicial Court of Paris has also ordered Citroen and FCA Italy, two other Stellantis units, to appear in court over the coming weeks as part of the same investigation, the company said on Wednesday.
The Peugeot investigation focuses on older diesel vehicles sold in France between 2009 and 2015 and stems from a wider probe French authorities launched in 2017 over alleged emissions test cheating by diesel vehicle manufacturers.
Stellantis in a statement said Peugeot was assessing its defense options in the case. 
""The companies firmly believe that their emission control systems met all applicable requirements at the relevant times and continue to do so and look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate that,"" said Stellantis, which was formed earlier this year after a merger between Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group.
Several European carmarkers have come under scrutiny since the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) ""dieselgate"" scandal which erupted in 2015 over test cheating in the United States.
A French court on Tuesday charged carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) with alleged deception and test manipulation of some of its older diesel vehicles.
French prosecutors looking in to Renault and Peugeot said they had found that some of the cars produced on-the-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times regulatory limits for some models, according to reports of the investigation from 2019.

Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had rigged engine software with ""defeat devices"" to cheat U.S. diesel tests, a scandal that has since cost the group more than 32 billion euros in fines, refits and legal costs and reverberated across the industry.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Steelworkers union (USW) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) will meet on Thursday for the first time since a May 1 lockout of Beaumont, Texas, refinery workers.
A contract covering 650 union workers expired earlier this year and Exxon locked out workers, citing its fear of a sudden walkout. The 2,700-acre complex, Exxon's third-largest U.S. refinery, continues to operate with managers and replacement workers producing gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil.
“We will be trying to resolve the open issues,” USW Staff Representative Hoot Landry told Reuters on Wednesday. The union has proposed a six-year contract covering the refinery and lubricants plant and would continue existing seniority protections. 
""We continue to engage in good-faith negotiations with the union until a contract is ratified,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. 
The two sides have communicated on proposal terms but have not formally negotiated, according to people familiar with the matter. Landry and another staff representative met with Exxon officials on May 12 to clarify terms of each other's proposals. 
The company has insisted USW Local 13-243 call a vote on its proposal that would create separate contracts for refinery and lubricant plant workers, and give the company control over which employees move up to senior posts. 

Exxon's proposal would give the 369,024 barrel-per-day refinery flexibility to be profitable in even low-margin environments, the company has said.
The USW’s last proposal, made on April 30, sought a six-year contract with no pay raise in the first year. It would match pay raises in the second through sixth years to those set by national labor negotiations that have yet to be held.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors on Wednesday threw its support behind the overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with other major automakers, but asked the Biden administration to give automakers more flexibility to hit the carbon reduction target between now and 2026.
GM's position, outlined in a letter from Chief Executive Mary Barra to Environmental Protection Agency head Michael Regan, represented the latest shift on vehicle emissions policy by the No. 1 U.S. automaker.
Until November, GM backed the Trump administration's effort to block California from setting tougher emissions standards than the federal government. Wednesday's letter followed a call between Barra and Regan on Tuesday.
The major automakers in the United States all face the challenge of protecting petroleum-fueled truck and SUV profits without clashing with an administration committed to stronger climate policy, or investors who are demanding that companies do more to cut emissions. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and BMW in July 2019 struck a voluntary agreement with California on reducing vehicle emissions through the 2026 model years that would allow them to meet a single nationwide standard. 
Under the California standard, GM and other automakers would be out of compliance for the current 2021 model year and 2022. Industry vehicle lineups locked in for production had aimed to comply with less demanding Trump administration targets. 
GM proposes that automakers ramp up to the California greenhouse gas standards by 2023 and then go beyond the proposed California emissions targets for 2024-2026 to reduce overall emissions for the 2020-2026 period by the same amount.
Companies could ""comply with higher-level performance standards in the later part of the program through increased sales of pure EV vehicles,"" Barra wrote in her letter.
The industry would then be set up for regulations for the 2027-2035 period that ""will need to focus on full battery electric vehicle deployment,"" Barra wrote.
President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging infrastructure, including $100 billion in rebates. A Senate panel voted May 26 to lift the cap on EV tax credits and hike it to as much as $12,5000 per vehicle for union-built vehicles in U.S. factories. Republicans have expressed opposition to giving subsidies for electric vehicles.
Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp praised GM's announcement saying it ""is a signal that progress towards that cleaner future is becoming unstoppable.""
""A ZERO-EMISSIONS FUTURE""
GM has outlined ambitious plans to expand its electric vehicle offerings, investing $27 billion to field 30 new electric vehicles worldwide by 2025 and has said it aspires to end the sale of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035.
""We believe an electric vehicle compliance pathway is a key component to setting the industry on an irreversible path towards a zero-emissions future, which can only be achieved with a tailpipe-free light duty fleet,"" Barra wrote. 
In the near term, GM, like rivals  Ford Motor Co  and Stellantis NV, will make most of its profits selling large, petroleum-fueled pickup trucks and sport utilities in the United States. 
GM last week announced plans to expand production of its largest pickup trucks by 1,000 vehicles a month to meet demand.
The average greenhouse gas emissions of new vehicles sold in the United States rose in 2019 because of the consumer shift to pickups and larger SUVs https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-vehicle-fleet-fuel-efficiency-fell-2019-249-mpg-epa-2021-01-06. 
The Trump administration in 2020 finalized a rollback of U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama administration rules it discarded.
The Center for Biological Diversity estimates the California deal will improve fuel economy 3.7% year over year between 2022-2026.
The Biden administration plans to announce by July proposed revisions to U.S. vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions requirements. Some Democrats want Biden to reinstate the tougher Obama-era rules.

EPA Administrator Regan also spoke on Monday with senior executives from Stellantis and Toyota.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 08:31PM ET</span>",U.S. to donate 500 million Pfizer vaccine doses to the world -sources,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Carl O'Donnell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration plans to donate 500 million  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) coronavirus vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries over the next two years, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The United States is likely to distribute 200 million shots this year and another 300 million in the first half of next year to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union, they said.
The donations will go through the COVAX vaccine program that distributes COVID-19 shots to low- and middle-income countries. The program is led by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
GAVI did not respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. President Joe Biden will announce the deal on Thursday at the Group of Seven meeting of the world's wealthiest countries in Britain, one of the people said.
The deal was negotiated over the past four weeks by White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients and the coronavirus task force team, one of the sources said. 
CNBC reported on Wednesday that the United States is also talking with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc about buying some of its shots to donate to other countries.
A Moderna spokesperson said the company is interested in possibly providing the U.S. government with COVID-19 shots to give to low- and middle-income countries but declined to comment on any discussions. 
The White House and Pfizer declined to comment. 
The U.S. president told reporters before boarding Air Force One for Britain that he had a global vaccine strategy and would be announcing it but did not offer details.
The White House has been under mounting pressure to boost donations of COVID-19 shots to other countries.
The United States has given at least one shot to around 64% of its adult population and has begun vaccinating adolescents, while other countries like Brazil and India are struggling to get desperately needed doses. 
""This action sends an incredibly powerful message about America’s commitment to helping the world fight this pandemic,"" said Tom Hart, acting chief executive of The ONE Campaign, a nonprofit working to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030. 
The administration is also using the U.S. vaccine supply as a tool to counter Chinese and Russian vaccine diplomacy. 
The Biden administration had said it would share 80 million vaccine doses worldwide by the end of June. The White House earlier this year also pledged $4 billion to COVAX and urged other countries to boost donations as well.
Pfizer has said it expects to produce as many as 3 billion COVID-19 shots in 2021 and upwards of 4 billion next year. 

The New York Times reported that the United States will buy the doses at a ""not-for-profit"" price, citing people familiar with the deal. They also reported that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla will accompany Biden during the announcement. 
The agreement is in addition to the 300 million shots the United States has already purchased from Pfizer and brings the total number of Pfizer/BioNTech shots purchased by the United States to 800 million, the Times said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has reached a proposed settlement with a group of indigenous survivors of the now-defunct residential schools for the abuse they suffered, a federal minister said on Wednesday, ending a 14-year fight for justice.
The settlement comes as the government is scrambling to deal with a national outcry after the remains of 215 indigenous children were discovered at a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia. The government has been under pressure to stop legally opposing indigenous people's requests for compensation and acknowledgement in court following the discovery. 
Under the latest agreement, the government will provide C$10,000 ($8,259.00) to each survivor involved in the class action lawsuit and create a C$50 million indigenous-led nonprofit to support wellbeing and cultural learning. 
The settlement does not include an explicit admission of wrongdoing by the government. Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the plaintiffs had hoped for an official apology and ""while this is not part of a settlement agreement, we will be listening to their concerns, as we work together on this request.""
The estimated 12,000 to 20,000 survivors in the lawsuit attended residential schools during the day and went home at night. Because of this, they were not included in a previous settlement for residential school survivors. 
Between 1831 and 1996, Canada's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 indigenous children from their parents, bringing them to institutions with the stated purpose of assimilation. They were malnourished, beaten and sexually abused in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission called cultural genocide in its landmark 2015 report.
The proposal is open for comments from plaintiffs until August 2021, and will be presented along with the comments to the court in September for approval.
Bennett told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that the government will continue to work with survivors and their families and others to resolve remaining childhood claims. 
""Together we will move forward on the path to reconciliation,"" she said.
CANADA IS A ""REPEAT OFFENDER""
Several plaintiffs spoke at the conference, describing the pain the residential schools and the years-long lawsuit brought them.
""This has been a really long process, 14 years, returning to court, regurgitating trauma,"" Charlotte Gilbert, a representative for the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit, said.
A separate class action, still ongoing, deals with residential schools' cultural damage and involves 105 indigenous bands.
""No amount of compensation can change the legacy of residential schools,"" Diena Jules, a survivor of the schools, said. ""Nothing can restore us to being whole.""
The government remains embroiled in several ongoing lawsuits involving indigenous people in Canada. A Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case involving discrimination through the systemic under-funding of child and family services against indigenous children - resulting in a disproportionate number of indigenous children in foster care - has a hearing next week.
The Canadian government has admitted its child and family services funding system ""was broken and needed immediate and substantial reform."" But in its most recent filings it argued the tribunal was the wrong venue for this dispute and that individual compensation was not appropriate in this instance. 
""It's a really dangerous argument,"" said Cindy Blackstock, a member of the Gitxsan nation and executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, which brought the legal action.

Canada is ""a repeat offender"" when it comes to abrogating the rights of indigenous children, she said. ""It needs a heavy hand for deterrence.""

(Reuters) - A shareholder proposal for  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp to review human rights issues emerging from its U.S. government contracts gained increased investor support but failed to win approval at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
Thomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News, has contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) worth at least $17.4 million, public records show. Company spokesman Dave Moran declined to say what the contracts were for. Moran said a contract to provide the CLEAR online investigation software to ICE had expired in February. The software aggregates billions of data points and public records information for law enforcement agencies and financial services firms, according to a company website.
The shareholder proposal came from a British Columbia labor union and focused on Thomson Reuters work with government agencies including ICE. 
The proposal won the support of 19% of the votes, Thomson Reuters Chairman David Thomson said at the meeting, which was webcast, more than double the 7.6% share that a similar resolution received last year. 
The tally potentially represented a majority of support from outside investors. The Woodbridge Co, representing the Thomson Reuters controlling Thomson family, owns two-thirds of the company shares and had planned to vote against the resolution, according to a securities filing. Final voting figures had yet to be filed and Moran did not provide additional details.
Wednesday's resolution called for the company's board to produce a ""human rights risk report"" describing potential issues it faces and comparing risk-control procedures against those of other technology companies.
Under the Trump administration that ended in January, ICE played a leading role in sweeping raids and deportation of undocumented immigrants.
Stephanie Smith, president of the union that sponsored the resolution, said in a statement the result showed ""Thomson Reuters is failing to tackle very serious and concerning human rights risks related to contracts with agencies like ICE, and shareholders aren’t buying their excuses.""
The company had opposed the resolution as unnecessary given existing internal controls. 

Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Officer Steve Hasker said at the meeting: ""We continue to see a net societal benefit to providing CLEAR and similar products to law enforcement,"" provided they are used as permitted by regulations.
Asked about the vote result, Thomson Reuters' Moran said that ""As we review best practices for identifying and mitigating human rights risks, we always welcome feedback from our shareholders and will continue in our dialogue with our investors as part of our shared commitment to human rights.""

164,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",Britain's airlines say extra support needed if travel stays shut,"LONDON (Reuters) - Airlines based in Britain have told the government they will need industry-specific support to help them survive if COVID-19 rules continue to keep travel markets shut. 
Companies including British Airways, easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Ryanair are in a deepening crisis after Britain's plans to restart travel on May 17 following a 4-1/2 month ban on foreign holidays fell far short of their hopes. 
Britons are still discouraged from travelling to most countries, and since the May reopening, the government has tightened the rules, removing one of the few destinations that was open, Portugal, from a safe travel list. 
As July and August approach, the months when airlines make most of their profits, there are worries the summer season may be lost for a second year in a row, risking airline viability and jobs. 
""If a meaningful reopening is not possible during the summer ... then targeted economic support will be essential to ensure UK airlines are able to reach the point when a restart is possible, in order to protect many tens of thousands of jobs,"" industry lobby Airlines UK said in a letter to finance minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday. 
Come the end of September, government support schemes to protect jobs are also due to end, a worry for airlines that might still be grounded due to foreign travel restrictions. 
Airlines UK said it wanted Sunak to extend furlough for aviation workers to the end of April 2022, give airlines longer to repay COVID-19 government loans, and launch a ""restart grant"" scheme to help airlines pay to maintain planes they cannot use. 

In the letter, the airlines said their preference would be for travel to restart and be unrestricted for vaccinated people. But recent government policy and comments suggest this is unlikely.
That puts UK airlines at a disadvantage to peers in Europe, as countries there begin to allow more travel, while Britain sticks with its 10 day quarantine and testing requirements.

(Reuters) - Two former employees of Balfour Beatty (OTC:BAFYY) Communities, one of the U.S. military’s largest private landlords, have pleaded guilty to fraud for helping the company secure millions in bonuses while covering up poor housing conditions at several Air Force bases, the Department of Justice announced.
Two years ago Reuters reports described how Balfour Beatty employees falsified maintenance documents at Air Force bases to help the company qualify for incentive fee payments, citing five former employees who said they falsified records, company emails and internal Air Force communications. Service members and their families were left exposed to asbestos, vermin, mold and raw sewage.
The reports prompted an investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service. It remains ongoing.

Stacy Cabrera, a former housing manager at Texas’s Lackland Air Force Base who told Reuters she felt pressure to manipulate records to meet the bonus goals, pleaded guilty to major fraud in April and faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
“You either make these numbers match so we can get the incentive fees, or you may not have a job tomorrow,” Cabrera, whose name was Stacy Nelson when she worked for the company, told Reuters in 2019. Reached Wednesday, Cabrera said she could not comment.
Rick Cunefare, a former Balfour Beatty regional manager who oversaw bases in Oklahoma, Texas and other states, pleaded guilty earlier this year to major fraud and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
The DOJ said Cunefare directed underlings to make the company’s maintenance performance appear stronger than it was. “Cunefare admitted that the false information deceived the U.S. Air Force,” the DOJ said.
“The defendants defrauded the U.S. Air Force and put corporate profits ahead of the well-being of servicemembers and their families,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.

Balfour Beatty Communities, a unit of British infrastructure conglomerate Balfour Beatty plc, told Reuters it never sanctioned the doctoring of records and that it has instituted internal controls to ensure the practice is not repeated.
“The company is continuing to work with the Department of Justice to resolve the matter,” a spokesman said Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are expected to agree to work to open up travel between the two countries ""as soon as possible,"" the British government said in a statement late on Wednesday.
Biden, who arrived in England on Wednesday for his first overseas trip as president, will meet with Johnson in Cornwall on Thursday ahead of a meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies that begins Friday, the statement said.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration was forming expert working groups with Britain, Canada, Mexico and the European Union to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions.
U.S. and UK airline officials said they do not expect Washington to lift restrictions until around July 4 at the earliest.
Airlines and others have pressed the administration to lift the restrictions on most non-U.S. citizens who have been in Britain, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.
The two leaders are expected to agree on an ambitious new ""Atlantic Charter"" modeled on the one signed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941 that set out their goals for the post-war world.
The new charter maps out plans for close cooperation in eight areas, including ""defending democracy, building a fair and sustainable trading system, dealing with cyber attacks, combating climate change and ending the coronavirus pandemic.
One key goal will be resuming safe travel, the UK statement said. Before the pandemic, more than 5 million Britons visited the United States and more than 4.5 million Americans visited Britain every year - more than any other country.

A new travel task force would make recommendations on safely reopening travel and ensuring that Britain and the United States work closely on international travel policy going forward.
""Links between the UK and US are not only crucial for our people, they create and sustain jobs across and throughout our two countries,"" the statement said.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>","GameStop taps Amazon Australia chief as CEO, may sell shares","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Noel Randewich and Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -GameStop on Wednesday named the head of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Australian business as its CEO and said the struggling videogame retailer may sell new shares, sending its volatile stock down 7% in extended trade and disappointing some of its ardent fan base of individual investors.
In a quarterly report that was stronger than analysts forecast, GameStop (NYSE:GME) said it may sell up to 5 million new shares, which would be worth $1.4 billion based on its latest share price.
Matt Furlong, a nine-year Amazon veteran, will succeed George Sherman as chief executive officer. GameStop said Mike Recupero, who spent over 17 years at Amazon, will succeed Jim Bell as chief financial officer.
Furlong will join on June 21, while Recupero, who was chief financial officer of Amazon's North American consumer business, will come on board on July 12, the company said.
GameStop's shares have almost doubled in the past month, approaching their January high. That was when a massive surge driven by investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum made the stock the most traded on the U.S. market for several days. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission requested documents and information related to an investigation into that trading, GameStop disclosed, along with trading in shares of other companies.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Blackberry (TSX:BB), Clover Health Investments and other recently surging so-called ""meme"" stocks fell more than 4% in extended trade on Wednesday. 
Even after falling late on Wednesday, GameStop's stock has gained more than 1,300% in 2021.
Earlier, shareholders elected billionaire investor Ryan Cohen, the company's biggest stockholder and co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), as its chairman.
He warned shareholders of more volatility ahead. ""As my dad would say, buckle up,"" Cohen said.
Taking advantage of GameStop's recently rising stock price, Wednesday's announcement of a potential share sale follows the issue of 3.5 million shares in April, which raised about $550 million.
Some on wallstreetbets forum were disappointed with GameStop's latest share-sale plan. 
""Guys why didn’t Cohen and his NEW CFO just go to the damn bank and get a 2-3% loan to fund their new plans?,"" one commenter posted on the site.
Furlong oversaw a small but growing part of Amazon's business as the country head for Australia, a role his LinkedIn profile said he assumed in May 2019. Under Furlong, net sales for the unit that operates Amazon's Australia e-commerce site roughly doubled in 2020 to A$1.12 billion ($867 million) from the year prior, according to a securities filing.
""These appointments reflect the refreshed Board’s focus on building a technology company and investing in growth,"" GameStop said in the statement. 
While the recent rollout of new videogame consoles is likely to benefit GameStop, analysts warned that its soaring stock price has become disconnected from the company's day-to-day business. At least two Wall Street analysts recently dropped coverage of the company.
CORE BUSINESS SHRINKING
Video games are a massive industry that rivals Hollywood by some measures, but GameStop's core business of selling new and pre-owned videogame discs is shrinking as consumers move to downloading games digitally or streaming. The company has lost money for the past three years. 
Cohen hopes to transition GameStop into an e-commerce business that can take on big-box retailers. He told shareholders at Wednesday's meeting in Grapevine, Texas that they had ""ushered in a whole new era at GameStop,"" but he declined to provide a detailed plan.
He has said that changes at GameStop should speak for themselves, including hiring new employees from Amazon, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Chewy. 
""What retail investors were looking for was a glimpse into the strategy that Ryan Cohen promised in January,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. ""Every day he doesn't reveal his strategy weakens the meme. That's what I think has spooked investors.""
GameStop said its net sales for the quarter ending May 1 jumped 25% to $1.28 billion, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $1.16 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 

Its adjusted loss per share was 45 cents, beating expectations of an 84 cent loss per share.
In a brief conference call, Sherman gave a summary of GameStop quarterly results and did not take questions from analysts as companies normally do.

The Medicare-backed insurance seller's shares were recently down around 13% at $19.20 after climbing to nearly $29. 
Clover Health has been among the most visible of the new meme stocks to enthrall investors following forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets. The fresh crop shot higher in recent days following a resurgence in shares of video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and movie theater company AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings. 
Many of the shares have taken a wild ride, with daily gains or losses in double-digit percentages.
""There are plenty of people making money, but there are plenty of people getting their heads handed to them,"" said Ken Polcari, founder and managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors. ""These names are risky because they're ripping all over the place.""
One fresh name joining the rally was prison operator Geo Group (NYSE:GEO), whose shares jumped as much as 70% and were recently up 56% on the day.
AMC shares were down about 11% while security solutions provider BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)'s U.S.-listing edged 1% higher.
In the past two weeks, meme stocks have received $1.27 billion of retail inflows, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. That matched their peak in January, when a surge in shares of video game retailer GameStop pushed bearish investors to unwind short positions, further boosting the stock price.
The group has seen larger inflows than any other sector, including the S&P tech sector, Vanda's data showed.
Shares of GameStop were up 4% ahead of quarterly results due after the bell, with a cult following of investors looking for progress in a turnaround at the retailer.
At a brief annual shareholders meeting ahead of the report, GameStop top shareholder Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), was elected chairman. GameStop announced his nomination in April.
Lordstown Motors Corp's shares reversed losses and were recently up nearly 4%. A day earlier they tumbled 16.3% after a ""going concern"" warning.

Surging meme stock prices have spurred some hedge funds into using options to bet against them while capping risk, seeking to avoid the fate of Melvin Capital, which was hit with a short squeeze after betting against GameStop.
Clover's stock has climbed about 14% year-to-date. By contrast, AMC shares are up around 2,235% while GameStop's have gained some 1,560%.

However, other meme stocks such as Clover Health, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) closed lower.
Retail volume has returned to its January peak, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, as social media forums scramble to identify the next  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), the stock that kicked off the phenomenon.

El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after its Congress approved Bukele's proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency.
""This is going to evolve fast!"" Bukele said on Twitter.
The Central American leader's announcement has put a spotlight on the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, which are virtual coins exchanged without middlemen, such as central banks, to purchase goods and services. 
The process of extracting the currency from cyberspace, however, requires vast amounts of energy.
The global bitcoin industry's overall C02 emissions have risen to 60 million tons, equal to the exhaust from about 9 million cars, according to a March report by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts.
Later on Wednesday, Bukele shared a video on his Twitter account showing a powerful plume of what he said was pure water vapor projected into the air from a pipeline.

Bukele also changed his Twitter profile photo to an edited image of himself with blue laser eyes, a popular internet fad among supporters of cryptocurrency.
His previous photo, updated when he announced his intention to send a bill to make bitcoin legal, featured him with red laser eyes.

The joint statement from the UAW and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV said it was continuing the requirements ""out of an abundance of caution."" 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in May that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks in most instances, including at work. The UAW and the automakers said temperature screening upon entering facilities is expected to be phased out.

This has helped the prices of many stocks skyrocket. But while the industry has witnessed decent growth, its short-term growth prospects look bleak because most countries are currently focusing on their economic revival from the 2020 recession at the expense of many other considerations. Hence, we think overvalued clean energy stocks NextEra (NEE),  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Enphase (ENPH) are best avoided now. Read on.Growing concerns about global warming have compelled many countries to set sustainability goals and implement initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality over the next few decades. However, as many countries focus now on their economic revival from last year's pandemic-led recession, climate change actions are to a degree on hold.
Though most of the developed countries plan to curb carbon emissions over the next several decades, only a handful of policies dedicated toward climate change have been passed into law globally. For example, even negotiations regarding President Biden’s proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, which contains many climate change elements, have come to a halt in the U.S. Senate for now after Senate Republicans delivered a $928 billion counter offer to Biden’s proposal.
Given this backdrop, renewable stocks NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Plug Power, Inc. (PLUG), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), prices for which skyrocketed over the past year on investor optimism, look extremely overvalued at their current levels. So, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

They pared losses to trade down 4.6% at $200.19 on Wednesday afternoon after falling as low as $197. That came as analysts pressed executives on how UPS will maintain momentum as demand moderates, pandemic surcharges roll off, and competitors - including its No. 1 customer, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) - rise.
During the company's analyst and investor day webcast on Wednesday, UPS forecast U.S. domestic adjusted operating margins of 10.5% to 12% in 2023 - below what some analysts expected. It put overall margins at 12.7% to 13.7% for the same period. 
Rate hikes and increased business from SMBs will generate about half of the margin in the company's core U.S. market, executives said.
The world's largest parcel delivery firm is prioritizing lucrative deliveries over volume under new Chief Executive Carol Tome's ""better not bigger"" strategy. 
To that end, UPS is fighting to win more contracts with healthcare firms and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). 
""Not all packages are attractive to us,"" Tome said. 
Healthcare deliveries, including temperature-monitored shipments from companies like vaccine maker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), are among the most profitable in the business. SMBs are more attractive because clients can require a higher level of service and tend to lack the muscle of large firms like Amazon to negotiate volume discounts.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta-based firm is corralling costs on key projects, including expanding Saturday deliveries across the United States. 

Executives said its weekend delivery push uses existing infrastructure. The company also is ""looking"" in to a same-day delivery service. 
UPS forecast revenue between $98 billion and $102 billion for 2023, compared with the average analyst estimate of $100.19 billion, according to Refinitiv data. It reported full-year revenue of $84.6 billion in 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the House of Representatives are working on drafts of five antitrust bills, four of them aimed directly at reining in Big Tech, and may introduce them within days, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
Reuters has read discussion drafts of five measures. Sources familiar with the process say they may be changed before they are introduced. They may be introduced this week but that may be delayed, two sources said.
Among the five bills being considered, two address the problems of platforms, like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), creating a space for businesses to sell products and then competing against those products.
One of the two would make it illegal in most cases for a platform to advantage its own products on its platform with potentially a fine of 30% of the U.S. revenues of the affected business if they violate the measure. A second requires platforms to sell any business if owning it creates an incentive for the platform to advantage its own products or lines of business.
A third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in.

A fourth would require platforms to set up a way for users to transfer data if they desire, including to a competing business. A fifth is similar to a Senate measure that would raise what the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charge to assess the biggest companies to ensure their mergers are legal and increase the budget of the agencies.
The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel wrote a report that was issued in October 2020 that spelled out abuses by four big technology companies, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The report -- which was scathing -- suggested expansive changes to antitrust law.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",Stocks close near highs as bond yields dip,"By Herbert Lash and Tom Arnold
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets closed near record highs and U.S. bond yields fell on Wednesday as some of U.S. President Joe Biden's stimulus efforts appeared to be on the rocks, boosting the appeal of technology stocks as inflation pressures ease.
A little-noticed ruling by Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough in May said Democrats can only use ""reconciliation"" once in a fiscal year to circumvent legislation that requires 60 votes. Democrats passed Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in March through reconciliation.
Democratic fiscal packages in Congress are rapidly shrinking, leading to a net outcome that inflationary pressures are set to recede, said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 3.9 basis points to 1.4891%, down from 1.528% late on Tuesday.
Yields plunged as traders in part were forced to unwind short positions in Treasuries, said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist of the Americas at Natixis. 
""More importantly, the economy is at its peak growth and a lot of what the (Biden) administration wants to do in terms of fiscal stimulus may not be met because of the parliamentarian ruling,"" LaVorgna said. 
MSCI's all-country world index, a U.S.-centric benchmark for global equity markets, closed down 0.2% at 715.57, less than 3 points from its record peak on Tuesday.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 came within 1 point of its all-time high set in May as big tech rallied along with healthcare stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.44%, the S&P 500 shed 0.18% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.09%, as growth stocks closed slightly higher and underpriced value stocks fell.
The market is on hold as everybody wants to trade ""meme stocks,"" which are not part of the major indexes, said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.
""Why is somebody going to trade Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , trying to make 10% a year, when they can make 10% in five minutes in GameStop?"" Dick said.
Attention remained focused on Thursday's release of U.S. consumer price data and a European Central Bank meeting that could reveal how soon policymakers will begin to withdraw support for Europe's economy as the COVID-19 crisis subsides.
The pan-regional STOXX Europe 600 index rose 0.1% to a new record close, but shy of all-time peak on Tuesday. Britain's FTSE fell 0.2% as UK-listed miners slipped under pressure from lower base metal prices.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY), Lufthansa and British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) climbed about 3% each after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was easing travel recommendations on 110 countries and territories.
Overnight in Asia, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.4% lower, as did Japan's Nikkei average.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield, which is closely correlated with U.S. Treasuries, extended Tuesday's decline to -0.247%, the lowest since late April, as investors continued to price in a dovish outcome to the ECB policy meeting on Thursday.
Thursday's U.S. consumer price data is expected to show the overall annual inflation rate spiking to 4.7%, worrying many investors who are not persuaded by the Federal Reserves's insistence the spike in prices will be transitory.
CURRENCIES STEADY 
Inflation data from China showed its producer price index jumped 9.0% from a year earlier, the highest in over 12 years, on surging commodity prices.
The rise in consumer prices, however, was softer than expected, helping to mitigate concerns. While China's central bank is slowly scaling back pandemic-driven stimulus, top leaders have vowed to avoid any sharp policy turns and keep borrowing costs low.
The Chinese yuan, whose rally to a three-year high last week was propelled in part by speculation Beijing may want a stronger yuan to tame inflationary pressure, ticked up slightly to 6.3869 per dollar.
The dollar held at the lower end of recent gains, with the U.S. dollar index up slightly at 90.148.
The euro nudged higher to $1.2175, while the dollar rose to 109.61 yen.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Currency Volatility Index hit its lowest level since February 2020 on Tuesday, and sank even further on Wednesday.
Oil prices continued to rally on signs of strong fuel demand in Western economies. 

Brent crude futures settled unchanged at 72.22 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures fell 9 cents to $69.96 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% up at $1,895.50 an ounce.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC chair signals sweeping review of exchange, broker rules","By Katanga Johnson and John McCrank
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. markets watchdog, has asked his staff to recommend rules for ensuring fair competition between exchanges and brokers, signaling a potentially major shake-up for the U.S. equities markets.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules would address ""payment-for-order-flow,"" ""best execution"" and the ""national best bid and offer,"" among other structural issues, he told a virtual conference on financial technology and global markets at Piper Sandler on Wednesday.
The aim was to make markets as efficient as possible, Gensler said.
Payment-for-order flow, whereby wholesale market makers pay broker-dealers to send them client orders which they execute on their own trading platform or a third-party platform, raises a number of conflict-of-interest questions, he said. 
Critics say it creates an incentive for brokers to send orders to whichever market-maker pays them the highest fees, rather than the venue that might get the best deal for customers, also known as ""best execution.""
Market-makers say the business model has increased liquidity and reduced costs for average investors. 
""Are customers getting best execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in those customers’ best interest?"" Gensler asked during his speech.
The SEC review follows January's Reddit rally during which retail investors coordinating on Reddit and trading through low-cost brokerages drove up GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other ""meme stocks.""
Amid the intense volatility, several retail brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks, which took the steam out of the rally, causing an uproar among retail traders.
Robinhood, an online retail brokerage, said on Wednesday that it looks forward ""to engaging"" with SEC as the agency considers changes to equity market structure.
The saga also highlighted the small number of market-makers that dominate the retail market, with Citadel Securities executing roughly 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, according to its own data. That could pose competition issues, said Gensler.
""Market concentration can deter healthy competition and limit innovation. It also can increase potential system-wide risks, should any single incumbent with significant size or market share fail,"" he said.
Gensler's planned review would see the new chair wade into the fraught issue of off-exchange trading and whether these so-called dark pools are distorting the overall price discovery mechanism, a question the SEC has grappled with in the past.
With nearly half of trading happening away from traditional exchanges or ""lit markets,"" the national mechanism for establishing the best price for a stock, also known as the ""national best bid and offer,"" may have been distorted, he said. 
That migration to off-exchange markets has been driven in part by market-makers' ability to offer fractional sub-penny price improvement on bids and offers, whereas exchanges have to trade in pennies -- creating an unleveled playing field, he said.

""The current market structure has created a limited set of middlemen through whom a significant amount of volume flows,"" said Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR). 
""It is not clear to Mr. Gensler that the evolution has all been favorable to investors.""

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",Gig companies' push for state-level worker laws faces divided labor movement,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -Uber and other gig economy companies are trying a new approach to ending their battles with unions, and getting ahead of possible federal regulation that could upend their business based on classifying workers as independent contractors.
In New York, for example, gig economy companies are working with several unions including the Machinists and Transport Workers Union to strike a compromise that would allow drivers and food delivery workers to organize in a union and negotiate minimum pay and other benefits without being reclassified as employees. 
With the support of the unions, the gig economy companies are pushing state lawmakers in Albany to pass a bill that would allow workers to negotiate wages and caps on company commission fees, and provide unemployment insurance in some circumstances.
Among the most vocal opponents of a proposed bill to achieve that goal is the Service Employees International Union's (SEIU) northeastern Local 32BJ, which says the compromise would enshrine gig workers' misclassified status and create a company-sanctioned union that would only further erode workers' rights by setting no floor for the negotiations.
""This legislation moves workers backwards,"" Kyle Bragg, 32BJ's president said. ""There's too much company manipulation.""
Amid the controversy, efforts to have the bill introduced before the end of the state's legislative session this week failed.
New York is just one of several states where gig economy companies led by Uber (NYSE:UBER), Doordash,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Instacart are courting unions and state officials in an effort to cement their workers' status as independent contractors across the United States. 
FAULT LINES
The push by the gig economy companies has exposed divisions within organized labor over whether to bargain with the companies, or insist on workers being reclassified as employees with full protection of U.S. labor standards - and a clear legal right to join unions.
The rifts at times also run within the same union. For example, while 32BJ rejects the New York bill, SEIU President Mary Kay Henry in the past said she would back workers' demands in reaching a deal with companies. The SEIU declined to comment for this story. 
Similarly, the New York chapter of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation, backs the compromise proposal, while members of its Colorado chapter said they were opposed to bargaining agreements with the gig companies.
According to a Reuters review, the companies over the past few months set up lobbying groups in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Colorado and Washington to push for laws that declare app-based ride-hail and food delivery drivers independent contractors, while proposing to offer them some benefits. In some states the companies hope for buy-in from labor groups, company and union officials said.
The companies are trying to build on their success in California, where voters approved an industry-backed ballot measure that exempts ride-hail and food delivery workers from rules that require other types of contractors to be classified as employees, and provides them with limited benefits.
The companies say they pursue tailored policies for each state to combine flexibility for their mostly part-time workers with benefits and protections. They have yet to offer concrete proposals in most states.
Some executives hope state-based independent contractor laws can also forestall federal action by the labor-friendly Biden administration, which has vowed to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors.
""The models that are developed at the state level can be given a framework at the federal level,"" Lyft President John Zimmer said during an interview last month.
While any state law could be superseded by federal rules, Zimmer's calculation assumes that the U.S. Labor Department is less likely to act once facts on the ground are established.
The companies' race for state backing runs counter to the labor movement's single biggest legislative priority, the passage of a far-reaching labor reform bill known as the PRO Act in Congress. The bill would make worker organizing easier and among other things reclassify most independent contractors as employees for the purpose of collective bargaining, though not for wage laws and benefits.
The bill is unlikely to pass the Republican-led U.S. Senate, but even if it did, several years of regulatory and court wrangling would ensue, a time during which gig workers' rights would remain unchanged, said Wilma Liebman, former chair of the National Labor Relations Board.
SKEPTICS ON BOTH SIDES 
Some union figures have therefore taken a more pragmatic approach. Andy Stern, former president of the SEIU and at the time one of the most politically influential labor leaders, for the past six years has been trying to strike deals between the gig companies and unions, including failed attempts in California to ward off the ballot measure.
The California referendum, a costly victory for the gig companies, was also a cautionary tale for unions, as well as for drivers, who are now left without any avenues to organize or object to the terms stipulated by the companies.
Stern said internal union surveys in New York had repeatedly shown that a majority of drivers did not want to be employees and said debates focused solely on reclassification were based on unrealistic and purist sentiments.
Stern instead advocates for drivers' rights to organize in unions and negotiate their own contracts.
""Give a worker a union and collective bargaining and they'll decide themselves what kind of status, wages and benefits they want. People who believe litigation and legislation are the solution have failed these workers,"" Stern said.
Stern and others dubious of reclassification point to Seattle and New York City, where years of union efforts to organize drivers have led to the only driver minimum wage laws in the country.
Uber and Lyft have rocky histories with unions and workers who want to organize. The companies in 2015 enlisted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for a years-long court battle against a Seattle law spearheaded by the Teamsters union that would have allowed ride-hail drivers to bargain collectively.
Uber more recently appears to have opened up to such agreements, however. The company last month recognized Britain's GMB union as the collective bargaining unit of its 70,000 British drivers. Lyft's Zimmer said the company was having constructive conversations with labor leaders.

Many union officials remain skeptical about basing workers' fate on the goodwill of companies.
""You never get everything you want out of collective bargaining...and it would be better to give drivers more options and protections under the law,"" said Kjersten Forseth, political and legislative director for the Colorado AFL-CIO, which plans to make state-based gig worker policy solutions its focus over the next two years.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday appointed development finance executive Mimi Alemayehou to its board of directors to replace Elliott Management partner Jesse Cohn, after the activist hedge fund helped create a blueprint for changes that led to a doubling of the social media firm's share price.
Alemayehou will join the board immediately and Cohn will step down, the company said in a release. Elliott, one of Twitter's top 20 investors, will continue to engage with senior management and the board through an ""information sharing and engagement agreement,"" Twitter said.
Cohn, who runs the $40 billion hedge fund’s U.S. activism practice, was appointed to the Twitter board in March 2020, as part of a deal with the social media company to let Chief Executive Jack Dorsey keep his job and allow Elliott to take a board seat.
Cohn joined the board alongside Silicon Valley tech investor Egon Durban, co-chief of private equity company Silver Lake.
Elliott had previously pushed to remove Dorsey after criticizing him for holding the CEO position at both Twitter and mobile payments company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). 

After a long period of languishing performance, in which Dorsey admitted Twitter had been slow to innovate and introduce new features, the platform has more recently made a slew of announcements to attract more users and advertisers.
It has committed to doubling its annual revenue by 2023, and last week introduced its first subscription product, Twitter Blue, which lets users edit tweets and customize their app.

However, investor optimism over the industry’s solid growth prospects has led to valuations that in some cases are inconsistent with companies’ growth potential.
In considering the current financials and growth prospects of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), and Zscaler, Inc. (ZS), we think their shares look extremely overvalued at the current price levels. So, these stocks are best avoided now.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell slightly Wednesday as tech lost some of its gains, while financials were dragged lower by falling rates as investors appear to be buying into the Federal Reserve's view that inflation is transitory ahead of Thursday’s consumer price report.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4%, or 152 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
Easing worries that runaway inflation is on the horizon prompted investors to scale back their bearish bets on Treasuries, forcing yields, which trade inversely to price, to move to levels not seen in a month.
The short-covering in Treasuries comes just a day ahead of the consumer inflation data, with economists expecting headline inflation at the fastest pace since 2008. But the sluggish action in bond yields suggests the market is betting that the Federal Reserve's inflation narrative could be the right call.
"" [T]he bond market is signaling this [inflation] is all very transitory and has been quite supportive of what Fed chairman Jerome Powell, and most of the other fed governors have said,"" Rhys Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief investment officer of the Opportunistic All Cap Equity Strategy at Spouting Rock Asset Management, said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday.
""With the 10-year Treasury yield at about 1.50% … clearly the market doesn't seem very nervous about this print as much as maybe individual portfolio managers are,"" Williams added.
Tech has found its footing, attracting bids from investors who had ditched the sector when fears on valuation ran deep following a jump in the Treasury yields early this year.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were mostly higher.
These cohort of megacap growth stocks, which have lagged the broader market for months, now offer ""a very good risk to reward because the chances of losing all your money in these names in the event of a disastrous outcome for your portfolio is low,"" according to Williams. 
Falling yields, however, were not welcomed in financials as regional and large bank stocks came under pressure amid concerns about lower net interest margin.
 Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) was down 3%, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) fell 1% and  Citizens Financial Group Inc  (NYSE:CFG) slipped 2%.  
Energy stocks ended above the flatline even as oil prices dropped after U.S. weekly crude inventories fell more than expected amid optimism that energy demand is set to pick up over the summer months as international travel activity heats up. 
In industrials,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) slipped 4% after issuing guidance that failed to live up to market expectations.

(Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME)'s stock jumped 7% on Wednesday before the company was due to release its quarterly results, which a cult following of individual investors will scrutinize for progress in the videogame retailer's turnaround amid this year's rally in its shares.
The stock extended gains and was on track to end the session at its highest closing price since January. 
Top shareholder Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), was elected chairman at a brief annual shareholders meeting ahead of the report. GameStop previously announced his nomination. 
""As my dad would say, buckle up,” Cohen told shareholders.
GameStop's volatile shares have doubled in the past month, and they are now just 7% below their closing high in January. That was when a massive surge driven by investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum made the stock the most traded on the U.S. market for several days. 
A recent rally in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings has attracted increased attention from individual investors and commenters on wallstreetbets, but GameStop remains one of the most discussed stocks on the forum.
AMC tumbled 8%, and it remains up over 2,200% year to date, compared to a rise of over 1,600% in GameStop.
Options prices imply GameStop's stock could swing 24% in either direction by Friday, according to Trade Alert data.

While the recent rollout of new videogame consoles is likely to benefit GameStop, analysts warn that its soaring stock price has become disconnected from the company's day-to-day business. At least two Wall Street analysts recently dropped coverage of the company.
GameStop's core business of selling new and pre-owned videogame disks is shrinking as consumers move to downloading games digitally or streaming, and it has lost money for the past three years. 
Cohen hopes to transition GameStop into an ecommerce business that can take on big-box retailers. He told shareholders at Wednesday's meeting in Grapevine, Texas that they had ""ushered in a whole new era at GameStop,"" but he declined to provide a detailed plan.
The company has yet to announce a replacement for Chief Executive George Sherman, who it has said will step down by July 31.
""The bullish views of retail investors and GameStop’s long-awaited transformation strategy continue to overshadow actual results,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter warned in a preview note.

GameStop short sellers currently have $3 billion at stake, up from $1.3 billion at the end of 2020, according to S3 Partners, a financial data firm.
Analysts on average expect revenue of $1.16 billion for the quarter ending in April, up 14% from the year before, when the coronavirus economic lockdown crippled sales of brick and mortar stores. Analysts expect an adjusted quarterly loss of 84 cents per share.

Investing.com -- Investors stayed on the sidelines Wednesday as they have for the last few sessions, awaiting key inflation data that is scheduled for release Thursday.
Already there are signs investors are buying into the Federal Reserve’s view that any inflation as the economy reopens is merely transitory. Bond yields dipped, supporting the tech trade but dinging financials.  
The short-covering in Treasuries comes just a day ahead of the consumer inflation data, with economists expecting to see the fastest annual pace since 2008.
The dip in rates helped tech find its footing, attracting bids from investors who had ditched the sector when fears on valuation ran deep.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Consumer price data
Economists expect inflation in the U.S., as measured by the Consumer Price Index, to rise 4.7% from a year earlier. It rose 4.2% in April, the fastest rise since 2008. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Jobless claims
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending June 5 is seen dropping by 15,000 to 370,000 from 385,000 in the week ending May 29 in a further sign of economic reopening. This report is also out at 8:30 AM.
Continuing jobless claims by individuals qualifying for unemployment insurance in the U.S. for the week ending June 5 are seen falling by 169,000 to 3.602 million from 3.771 million at the end of May 29.
3. Meme earnings

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has decided to temporarily remove its branding from the Copa America amid criticism over a last-minute decision to host the soccer tournament in Brazil, which is struggling with one of the world's worst COVID-19 outbreaks.
In a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, Mastercard said it has decided not to ""activate"" its sponsorship of Copa America in Brazil after a thorough analysis. The payments company remains a sponsor of the tournament, as it has been since 1992.
Last week organizers of the Copa America, which kicks off on Sunday, unexpectedly relocated the tournament to Brazil after co-hosts Colombia were dropped due to civil unrest and Argentina withdrew following a surge in COVID-19 cases.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has played down the severity of the coronavirus and fought against lockdowns, threw his support behind the move. But public health experts, Supreme Court justices and Brazilian footballers questioned the wisdom of hosting the tournament with a pandemic raging.

More than 475,000 Brazilians have died from COVID-19, the world's worst official death toll outside the United States, and experts warn of a third wave approaching along with winter in the southern hemisphere.
The Brazilian soccer team cited ""humanitarian"" concerns in a statement criticizing the organization of the Copa America on Wednesday, but they committed to participating in the tournament after rumours of a potential boycott.

""We wish Carolyn the best as she moves into a new chapter. We are grateful for her contributions,"" a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Everson, who had been at Facebook more than a decade, was vice president of Facebook's Global Business Group. She was a key spokesperson for the company when more than 1,000 advertisers joined a Facebook boycott last summer over concerns it was not doing enough to combat hate speech on the platform.
The company said Nicola Mendelsohn, who runs the Europe, Middle East and Africa region of this division and has been at the company eight years, will be the new interim leader of the Global Business Group.
Mendelsohn and the team will have the challenge of bringing innovation to Facebook's ad business, which is being outdone by short-form video app TikTok, known for its focus on serving content creators, and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)'s Snapchat, which is investing in augmented reality technology, said Darren D'Altorio, head of social at digital marketing agency Wpromote, which works with brands like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Samsung (KS:005930). 
Facebook continues to be a top platform for advertisers because of its large size and audience reach, but ""you can only rest on your laurels for so long,"" he said.

The news is one more shake-up in leadership at the world's largest social network, which last week announced that its vice president of global partnerships, Marne Levine, would be its first chief business officer. 
Earlier this year, Everson's boss and Facebook's chief revenue officer, David Fischer, who oversees its advertising business and manages its sales and marketing teams worldwide, said he would leave the company toward the end of 2021.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group, the region's largest carrier, said on Wednesday that it had sought to extend until September the deadline to present its restructuring plan as part of the bankruptcy protection process initiated in 2020.
LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States in May of last year, hammered by the world travel crisis generated by the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, it was the world's largest airline to take such action due to COVID-19.
A judge had previously ordered the company deliver its restructuring plan by the end of June, and the company has said it hopes to wrap up the process in 2021.
""The extension request is a common alternative contemplated within the process and does not modify the intention of the LATAM group to exit Chapter 11 by the end of this year,"" the firm said in a statement.
Latam also told Chilean securities regulators it has requested a second disbursement for $500 million under the DIP Credit Agreement (Debtor-In-Possession). The airline said the additional funds were necessary given ""the extension of the health and mobility restrictions imposed by the authorities in the different countries in that the Company operates, as well as the analysis of the Company's liquidity projection "".
The company also received a $1.15 billion debtor-in-possession loan in October last year.
Earlier on Wednesday Latam said it expects to ramp up its June operations to 36% of their pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, bolstered by the quickening pace of vaccination in some countries in the region.

""All markets show projections higher than those of the previous month,"" the company said in the statement.
LATAM, headquartered in Santiago, also operates in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, as well as international operations throughout Latin America, Europe, the United States and the Caribbean.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 02:55PM ET</span>",Lordstown shares reverse losses after company says it is in talks for additional funds,"By Ben Klayman and Chris Prentice
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp shares rallied to positive territory on Wednesday afternoon after the electric truck maker said it was in talks with multiple parties to raise funds.
The disclosure came a day after Lordstown warned in a U.S. regulatory filing that there was ""substantial doubt"" about its ability to continue as a going concern in the next year due to problems in funding production of its vehicle.
Shares of Lordstown were up 2% on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day they plunged as much as 20% as investors awoke to a vastly different financial picture than Lordstown faced last August when it announced it would go public through a reverse merger with a blank-check company.
Lordstown in a Wednesday statement reaffirmed it has ""adequate capital to continue operations, meet supplier obligations and begin limited production,"" but will need to raise additional funds and was in talks to do that.
""We are debt free, have significant tangible assets and multiple viable avenues to raise capital including asset-backed financing, equity, equity-related or debt financing, loans, as well as potential strategic investments over the longer term,"" the company said. ""We are already in active conversations with multiple parties to do so.""
Last month, Chief Executive Steve Burns on an earnings conference call said the Ohio company needed more capital to launch its Endurance pickup truck and production this year would be half of prior expectations.
Lordstown's situation has raised doubts about forecasts the company made on Aug. 3, 2020, when it announced its deal to go public through a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) DiamondPeak Holdings. The deal closed in October.
In March, Lordstown's shares slumped after Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position on the stock, saying the company had misled consumers and investors on demand for its vehicle.
Short sellers bet the price of a stock will fall by borrowing and selling shares in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference. 
Lordstown subsequently said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked for information related to its SPAC merger and preorders of its vehicles. Burns said Lordstown was cooperating with the investigation. 
SEC officials did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The company is also facing class actions stemming from the Hindenburg report. 
On Wednesday, Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson said in an email: ""After months of denials and obfuscation, Lordstown is finally beginning to acknowledge its precarious financial state and its unrealistic production projections.""
RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak initiated coverage on Tuesday of Lordstown with an ""underperform"" rating and $5 price target. He believes Lordstown will need an additional $2.25 billion in capital through 2025 to remain solvent and will not break even until 2025, three years after company projections.
WORKING ON ENERGY DEPT LOAN
In alerting investors last month it would need more money, Lordstown blamed COVID-19 and industry-wide related issues for higher spending on parts, shipping and third-party engineering resources. 
Lordstown said options to raise money could include asset-backed financing and investments from strategic partners like other automakers. However, Burns, the company's largest shareholder, said Lordstown was not for sale.
Lordstown also is hoping to close a deal with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for a $200 million loan to help pay for the costs of retooling its factory. Winning the approval of Energy officials could be key to assuaging some investors' concerns.
Lordstown has been touting the prospect of the loan since last August and Burns said last month he hopes to complete that process in the next few months. DOE officials declined to comment. 
When Lordstown announced the SPAC deal, it boasted its electric truck would be first to market to serve commercial fleet customers. It has affirmed its September launch timeline, but the lower production forecast undercuts the head start Lordstown has on Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which will launch an electric version of its top-selling full-sized pickup, the F-150 Lightning, next spring.
At the time of the SPAC announcement, Lordstown said it had 27,000 preorders for the Endurance worth $1.4 billion, and it subsequently raised that total to more than 100,000. After Hindenburg's report, Lordstown said the orders were nonbinding and on Tuesday it said it had no binding purchase orders.
Ford, which is aiming for the same commercial customers, has said it has 70,000 reservations that require a $100 deposit for its truck.

Lordstown said the Endurance will have a starting price of $52,500 before federal EV tax incentives. The price for Ford's F-150 Lightning will start at just under $40,000.
Investors in the initial SPAC deal included Fidelity Management & Research Co, Wellington Management Co, Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Kaufmann Small Cap Fund and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). BlackRock declined to comment on Wednesday, and officials with the other companies could not be reached to comment.

So, we think it could be wise to now bet on automobile manufacturers NIO (NIO) and Ford Motor (F) because they recently received upgrades from analysts and are favorably positioned to gain from the industry tailwinds. Read on to learn more.The COVID-19 pandemic-led restrictions wreaked havoc on the automotive industry last year as demand fell off a cliff. Global semiconductor supply constraints have also been negatively impacting the industry. However, according to Goldman Sachs’ (GS) chief Asia economist, the chip shortage should decline later this year as chip shipments improve and plants return to full working capacity. Huge government and private investments to boost semiconductor production should address the supply concern significantly in the coming months. This, along with the fast-paced economic reopening, should drive the automotive industry’s recovery.
Investors’ increasing interest in the automotive space is evident in the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 10.1% returns over the past month versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 1.6% gains.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 was flat Wednesday, as a slip in U.S. bond yields supported tech but hurt bank stocks amid signs that investors are buying into the Federal Reserve's view that inflation is transitory ahead of Thursday’s consumer price report.
The short-covering in Treasuries comes just a day ahead of the consumer inflation data, with economists expecting headline inflation at the fastest pace since 2008. But the sluggish action in bond yields suggests the market is betting that the Federal Reserve's inflation narrative could be the right call.
"" [T]he bond market is signaling this [inflation] is all very transitory and has been quite supportive of what Fed chairman Jerome Powell, and most of the other fed governors have said,"" Rhys Williams (NYSE:WMB), Chief Investment Officer of the Opportunistic All Cap Equity Strategy at Spouting Rock Asset Management, said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday.
""With the 10-year Treasury yield at about 1.50% … clearly the market doesn't seem very nervous about this print as much as maybe individual portfolio managers are,"" Williams added.
Tech has found its footing, attracting bids from investors who had ditched the sector when fears on valuation ran deep following a jump in the Treasury yields early this year.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were mostly higher.
These cohort of megacap growth, which have lagged the broader market for months, now offer ""a very good risk to reward because the chances of losing all your money in these names in the event of a disastrous outcome for your portfolio is low,"" according to Williams. 
Falling yields, however, were not welcomed in financials as regional and large bank stocks came under pressure amid concerns about lower net interest margin.
 Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) was down 3%, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) fell 1% and  Citizens Financial Group Inc  (NYSE:CFG) slipped 2%.  
Energy stocks were pushed higher as oil prices moved off their lows after U.S. weekly crude inventories fell more than expected, strengthening optimism that energy demand is set to pick up over the summer months as international travel activity heats up. 
In industrials,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) slipped 5% after issuing guidance that failed to live up to market expectations.
There was shake up in the meme trade, with Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE), and Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) were talked up on Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Clover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV), pared some of its gains from a surge a day earlier.

(Reuters) -Shares of Marqeta Inc, which provides payments services to customers including Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and DoorDash Inc (N:DASH), rose more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut, giving the firm a market capitalization of over $17.2 billion.
The financial technology startup's stock opened at $32.50 on Wednesday, compared with its initial public offering (IPO) price of $27 per share. Marqeta's IPO was priced well above its target price range of $20 to $24 per share. 
The Oakland, California-based company sold 45.45 million shares in its IPO, raising about $1.2 billion. It had previously been backed by investors including Uber,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V).
""This is a generational company and we wanted to have a more traditional process of going public,"" said Jason Gardner, founder and chief executive of Marqeta, adding the company never considered going public through a direct listing or a SPAC merger.
Payments companies that facilitate virtual transactions have benefited immensely during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has lifted online shopping and spending on food deliveries. A number of payments startups, such as Flywire Corp and Paymentus Holdings Inc , have gone public in recent weeks. 
Another payments provider, Uruguay's DLocal Ltd, saw it shares jump nearly 48% in its U.S. market debut last week.
Founded in 2010, Marqeta has also grown significantly. It previously disclosed that its revenue rose more than two-fold to $290.3 million in 2020 as homebound customers shopped more online. This helped boost its valuation from $4.3 billion in May 2020, when it last raised cash from private investors.
""Many of our customers have become essential services during the pandemic. Their success is our success,"" said Gardner.
""I believe that ordering through on-demand services apps and buy-now-pay-later companies, we are still in the early innings. These are young businesses in a massive market.""
The majority of Marqeta's revenue comes from interchange fees generated from transactions through its platform. A fraction of such fees, generated per card swipe, goes to the company.
Marqeta had issued more than 320 million cards through its platform as of March 31, 2021 and processed roughly $60 billion in volume last year.

The company expects to hire more people as it grows but could also pursue acquisition opportunities, especially outside of the United States, Gardner said. Marqeta currently operates in 36 countries. 
Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for the offering.

Analyst Philip Cusick lowered the rating to a sell-equivalent from neutral with a price target of $45, up from $38, StreetInsider reported.""We believe Dish has the opportunity to disrupt the wireless ecosystem through its next-generation 5G network over the next several years, leveraging its MVNO with the New TMobile. However, we expect some near-term execution challenges,"" Cusick wrote in a note. ""While the PayTV ecosystem remains pressured, Dish has posted solid results that we attribute to its disciplined acquisition and retention strategy.""”
The company's unlikely to participate in any mergers or acquisitions in the near future, but a combination of Dish and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)’s video operations over the next several years given the structural disadvantages for satellite video could be possible.Cusick's is one of two sell ratings on the company, which also has four buys and four holds, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Last month, Benchmark initiated coverage with a buy rating.
Analyst Matt Harrigan noted that the new network is more cost efficient as it does not have to support legacy 3G/4G infrastructure, StreetInsider reported. 
Dish is collaborating with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and has access to its advanced cloud capabilities, making it able to offer superior data capacity with significantly better pricing compared to the Big Three U.S. wireless carriers, Harrigan wrote in a note.

The omnichannel retailer of video games is seen reporting a loss of 67 cents a share on revenue of $1.13 billion for the first quarter. It had reported net sales of $1.02 billion for the same quarter ended May 2 last year and a loss per share of $2.57.

Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS), one of the new recruits, was up 4%.

Many believe that this positive momentum can continue, which is why today we’re going to analyze these two companies to see which is a better buy now.In the last two years, Canadian cannabis stocks have trailed the broader markets by a significant margin. These “north of the border” pot stocks were impacted by lower-than-expected demand, resulting in oversupply, high inventory levels, low profit margins and billion-dollar write-downs.

(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit accusing McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) of racial discrimination for steering Black franchise owners to underperforming stores.
In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said the plaintiffs did not show that McDonald's executives or managers treated Black store owners differently from non-Black owners, or when this might have occurred.
""The court does not mean to imply that McDonald's operations over the years have not been tainted by the brush of racism,"" but historical discrimination did not justify the lawsuit, the Chicago-based judge wrote.
James and Darrell Byrd, brothers with four McDonald's restaurants in Tennessee, accused the company of placing Black franchisees in economically undesirable inner-city locations with high security and insurance costs and below-average sales.
They also said the Chicago-based fast-food chain denied Black owners the same opportunities for growth and financial assistance that it offered white owners.
Leinenweber said the Byrds could amend their complaint, but dismissed their steering claims for good because the statute of limitations had run out.
The Byrds' lawyer Jim Ferraro said on Wednesday they will amend their complaint.
He also said McDonald's has lowered rents for many Black store owners since the lawsuit was filed in October.
McDonald's did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. It has denied treating Black owners differently from other owners, and has repeatedly pledged its commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Ferraro has a similar lawsuit pending in Chicago on behalf of Black former franchisees. The two lawsuits sought damages that together could reach $4 billion.
The case is Byrd et al v McDonald's USA LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 20-06447.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) set a goal on Wednesday to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions globally by 2050, after missing a deadline to improve U.S. farming practices as part of an earlier effort to cut emissions. 
The new target by the biggest U.S. meatpacker by sales expands a previous goal of reducing emissions by 30% by 2030. 
To achieve net-zero emissions, Tyson said it will plan for U.S. operations to use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and extend a program to verify sustainable production practices for cattle, among other steps.
""We believe progress requires accountability and transparency,"" said John Tyson, chief sustainability officer.
Three years ago, Tyson Foods pledged to improve environmental practices on two million acres (809,370 hectares)of U.S. farmland by 2020. So far, though, it has enrolled just 408,000 acres, according to the company.
Tyson said it now plans to meet its two-million-acre target by 2025.
The company does not own grain farms but has influence over farming as the U.S. meat industry's largest buyer of feed corn. Two million acres is enough land to grow corn to feed all Tyson chickens for a year.
The 408,000 acres represent land enrolled in a 2019 pilot program by Farmers Business Network, which sells agricultural supplies online, according to Tyson.
A pilot program run by another company, MyFarms, enrolled 11,000 acres in 2019, Tyson said. However, Tyson removed these acres last year due to a lack of data and discontinued MyFarms' pilot in 2021, according to the meatpacker.
For Tyson Foods, it was a big learning experience to determine how to obtain ""high-quality information about what's going on at the farm in a way that is as frictionless as possible for all parties,"" John Tyson said.

Interruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic also hindered land stewardship work last year, Tyson said in a sustainability report. 
Meatpackers including Tyson came under fire in 2020 as COVID-19 infections tore through slaughterhouses.

Yields on U.S. Treasury debt fell to their lowest in more than a month, while euro zone bond yields nudged down with markets in a wait-and-see mood ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting and U.S. inflation data, both due on Thursday.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 3.4 basis points to 1.5364%, suggesting bond investors do not see a spike in inflation despite nagging jitters over the Federal Reserve's insistence a likely jump in consumer prices will be transient.
Markets have been quiet before the release of second-quarter earnings in July when very strong results will be reported as a year ago they were so dismal, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
""Knowing there's a strong earnings season coming takes away some worry,"" Tuz said, keeping share prices from falling. ""The markets are about as flat and quiet as they can be today.""
MSCI's all-country world index, a U.S.-centric benchmark for global equity markets, closed down 0.01% at 716.96 after earlier scaling a fresh intraday high of 718.19.
In Europe, the pan FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.08% to close at a new record high, while the STOXX 600 index rose 0.15% to also set a new closing high. 
Telecoms, travel and real estate shares in Europe led equity markets higher, but weak German industrial output data and doubts that Britain will lift remaining pandemic restrictions later this month capped gains. 
The travel and leisure index rose 1.8%, supported largely by gains in low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to ""buy.""
The three major Wall Street indexes rose, with the big tech FAANG stocks leading shares higher as the outlook for lower inflation makes their long-term earnings more valuable.
""We've seen the FAANGs creep their way back in reaction to people buying into the inflation-is-transitory story,"" said Simon Maughan, head of trading alpha at Liquidnet, an alternative trading venue. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose while Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) fell. 
Advancing shares outnumbered declining shares on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, while growth-oriented shares slightly outpaced the gains of underpriced value stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.09%, the S&P 500 gained 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.31%. 
Shares in electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) retreated 0.3% after rising earlier on data from Beijing that showed its Chinese sales - which comprise a third of the firm's total sales - had seen a 29% leap last month. 
The data had also showed China's overall new electric vehicle sales had surged 177% compared with a year ago.
In a sign of investor complacency, the equity market's so-called ""fear gauge,"" the VIX, fell to as low as 15.15, a level not seen since February 2020.
Sterling was under pressure as the British government considered whether to delay removing most of its remaining coronavirus restrictions and oil was in the doldrums, but both looked like being temporary phenomena at worst.
Recent comments suggested the European Central Bank has no plans to reel in its mass stimulus program any time soon.
""I would expect the ECB to maintain a dovish stance as they would not be want to be seen as moving towards tapering at the moment,"" said Lombard Odier, head of FX strategy at Vasileios Gkionakis.

207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",Memo to Meme Raiders: Squeezable Stock Shorts Are Taking Cover,"(Bloomberg) -- It doesn’t seem like it, with bear raids breaking out everywhere and hoisting names like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. and Clover Health Investments Corp. to the moon and beyond, but the opposition is getting wise to the ploy.
While dismantling positions that may have taken years to build takes time, data show the number of extremely ripe targets for short squeezes has fallen precipitously in the U.S. stock market since winter.
The number of companies with bearish bets equating to at least 30% of their shares has shrunk to 18 from 43, according to data from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. The drop was more pronounced in dollar terms: an 80% plunge to $5 billion.
Part of it may be that the general direction of the market remains up, but it’s hard not to see the pullback as a direct reaction to the success of meme-stock raiders aiming their crowd-sourced campaigns directly at bear-trader favorites.
In conversation with hedge-fund clients,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. strategist Chris Harvey has noted growing angst over getting squeezed amid the retail-driven rally in smaller firms. Some, he says, have shifted their short book to exchange-traded funds and large companies.
“Many have taken their ball and gone home or elsewhere,” Harvey said in an interview. “For now, it’s not a worthwhile fight.”
The frenzy among day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum to band together and take on professional short sellers has forged ahead this week, with ContextLogic Inc. and Wendy’s Co. becoming the latest targets. The craze started with  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). in January, and at that time, it forced hedge funds to yank money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record.
But bearish positions have since fallen dramatically, indicating a low risk of spillover, according to Barclays strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande.
This time, hedge funds appear to be in no rush to buy back shares and cover their shorts. Take last Wednesday, for instance, when the top 10 most-shorted stocks handed $4.5 billion in unrealized losses to bears, short covering among hedge funds was less than one-fifth the pace seen in late January, according to prime-broker data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“The current short squeeze is more localized probably because the number of stocks with high short-interest has come down dramatically,” Deshpande wrote in a note to clients. “Given the low risk of a broad contagion, we view the fallout of the recent short squeeze to be limited.”
By Barclays’s tally, short sales across the board amounted to $900 billion, or 1.9% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves. While the overall pool of bearish bets has stayed roughly the same as January, those heavily shorted have dwindled to less than 1% of the total from 2.8%.
“Everybody talks about whatever you do, don’t short any of these meme stocks,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. said in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Alix Steel. “I totally agree because you can lose more than 100% of your money.”

208,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>","The crypto-space needs more regulation to grow, Novogratz says","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More regulation of the cryptocurrency space is needed to help institutional investors become more comfortable with digital assets and have the burgeoning asset class really take off, Mike Novogratz, founder of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital said on Wednesday.
""We need some regulation,"" he said at a conference held by Piper Sandler. ""That's an unpopular opinion in crypto circles, but if you want to have institutions join the revolution, you need some regulation."" 
Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, surged to almost $65,000 in April, but has since lost around half of its value.
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who taught a course on blockchain - the technology underpinning bitcoin - at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has said he would like to see more regulation around cryptocurrency exchanges. 
The more clarity around cryptocurrencies, the better, said Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner. 
""We have a lot of non-bank banks in the space that if I was the head of the SEC, I would regulate,"" he said. ""They take in deposits, they have huge leverage, they have an asset-liability mismatch.""
He also said he would like to see the approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, and for the SEC to create a ""regulatory sandbox"" - a testing ground for business models not protected by current regulation - where smaller companies could experiment with initial coin offerings, or fundraising.

The SEC has taken the position that initial coin offerings are securities offerings and therefore subject to the agency's offering rules, which require companies to file registration and disclosure documents.
""They regulate by litigation,"" Novogratz said of the SEC, ""and that's not a great way to regulate and so my pitch would be clarity, clarity, clarity.""

(Reuters) -Campbell Soup Co on Wednesday slashed its forecast for annual earnings after the company's quarterly results fell short of estimates, hurt by higher costs related to raw materials and transportation.
The canned soupmaker's shares fell about 6% to $46.30.
Campbell, known for Swanson broth, Prego pasta sauces and Pepperidge Farm cookies, expects higher costs to hurt margins even as it plans price hikes for later this year.
Shipping logjams globally and surging demand on the back of a resurgent U.S. economy have led food manufacturers to sacrifice their profit margin as costs rose for items across the board.
""We expected this to be a challenging quarter ... but it was made even tougher by several additional factors,"" Campbell Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said, adding that he expects price price increases to offset some margin pressures.
Campbell also struggled with production and supply disruptions due to the winter storms in Texas earlier this year.
Price hikes are a ""cold comfort"" and expect investors to view food companies with a skeptical eye in the next few quarters, J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Campbell forecast fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $2.93 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $3.03 to $3.11 per share. It expects sales to fall at least 3.0%, compared with the minimum 2.5% fall projected earlier.

The company, which saw an uptick in demand during peak pandemic from consumers staying at home, said sales of snacks fell 8% in the third quarter, while sales of its soups and pasta sauces fell 14%.
On an adjusted basis, Campbell earned 57 cents per share, missing estimates of 66 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales fell about 11% to $1.98 billion, compared with estimates of $2.00 billion.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco locked in another $6 billion on Wednesday to help fund a large dividend as it returned to the international debt markets with its first U.S. dollar-denominated sukuk sale, a document showed.
The debt issuance, which will help fund a $75 billion dividend commitment that will mostly go to the government, comprises tranches of three, five and 10 years, a document from one of the banks arranging the deal and seen by Reuters showed.
Aramco sold $1 billion in the three-year tranche at 65 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries (UST), $2 billion in the five-year portion at 85 bps over UST and $3 billion in 10-year paper at 120 bps over UST.
Initial price guidance was around 105 bps over UST for the three-year bonds, around 125 bps over UST for the five-year notes and around 160 bps over UST for the 10-year tranche.
The spreads were tightened after the deal attracted combined orders of more than $60 billion.
Aramco last year maintained its promised $75 billion annual dividend to shareholders despite lower oil prices, and is expected to shoulder significant domestic investments in Saudi Arabia's plans to transform the economy.
Fitch assigned Aramco's sukuk issuance programme an A1 rating with a negative outlook, in line with the negative outlook on existing Aramco ratings and tracking a change in Saudi Arabia's sovereign outlook to negative in May last year.
""The company has displayed a strong commitment to pay $75 billion in annual dividends, which in Moody's (NYSE:MCO) view is not sustainable should oil prices fall and remain significantly below $60/bbl,"" Fitch said.
""Interlinkages between Saudi Arabia and the company imply that any change in rating outlook on the government of Saudi Arabia would be mirrored on  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s rating outlook.""
The company chose to issue Islamic bonds over conventional ones due to high demand for the instrument as a result of the low number of dollar sukuk sales in the Gulf this year, a source told Reuters on Monday.
Aramco has been widely expected to become a regular bond issuer after its debut $12 billion issuance in 2019 was followed by an $8 billion, five-part transaction in November last year, also used to fund its dividend.

A source had told Reuters that Aramco was expected to raise up to $5 billion with the deal, which had 29 active and passive bookrunners working on it.
Active bookrunners on the deal included Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), NCB Capital and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank. Passive bookrunners included BOC International and Dubai Islamic Bank.

The rally can be attributed to a spectacular rise in steel prices on robust demand as manufacturing and construction sectors ramp up their operations.
However, the stock may now have limited upside because the heightened steel prices are not expected to be sustainable. Furthermore, since President Biden’s infrastructure plan—which is expected to boost the steel industry demand—could face an uphill battle for passage, the industry’s growth prospects remain uncertain.
Although X has been benefitting significantly from its strategic acquisition of the remaining stake in Big River Steel, which delivered 32% EBITDA margins in the first quarter of 2021, its increasing expenses and decreasing cash equivalents could be a cause of concern.

As such, we think it is wise to bet on fundamentally sound auto parts companies Bridgestone (BRDCY),  LKQ  (NASDAQ:LKQ), Gates Industrial (NYSE:GTES), and Standard Motor (SMP). Let’s discuss.The automotive sector suffered a major setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic as the global production of vehicles plunged. In fact, new car production enabled with the latest technologies continues to be impacted by the global semiconductor chip shortage. This has led to an increase in demand for auto parts because consumers are extending the use of their old cars or buying used cars, in lieu of purchasing brand new vehicles.
Most people are still wary of using mass transportation services due to public health concerns. This is driving the demand for personal cars. And because old cars are meeting the demand for private transportation, the auto-parts industry is benefiting. According to Grand View Research, the global automotive aftermarket is expected to reach $529.25 billion by 2028, growing at a 3.8% CAGR of 3.8%.

214,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 12:27PM ET</span>","As Retail Prices Rise, Companies Try Not to Say It Out Loud","(Bloomberg) -- From clothing to cereal to trash bags, prices are going up fast. But many companies aren’t saying that, at least not in language most shoppers would recognize.
If you ask Pampers maker Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co., it’s not raising prices, it’s “taking pricing.” Rival Unilever (NYSE:UL), known for Dove soap and Axe body spray, says it’s been “very active with pricing.” The prize for creativity -- so far at least -- has been home-improvement retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) Cos., whose finance chief told investors Wednesday that it was “elevating our pricing ecosystem.”The euphemisms illustrate the rhetorical backflips companies perform to avoid saying what they’re actually doing -- responding to soaring input and transportation costs, and protecting their profit margins, by making their products more expensive. The makers and sellers of consumer staples notched big stock gains last year thanks to pandemic stockpiling and are now under pressure to maintain that performance even as costs go up, labor markets tighten and they face extremely tough comparisons with last year’s growth.
Those headwinds have cooled their shares somewhat in 2021, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Consumer Staples Index up just 4.1% this year through Tuesday, and the S&P’s primary retail index up 7%. Those both trail the benchmark S&P 500’s 13% gain.
The price tags consumers see on shelves or online are the result of a complex series of negotiations between vendors and retailers, done behind closed doors, with neither side wanting to sacrifice too much. Retailers sometimes absorb some of the price increases manufacturers demand, and the rest is passed onto shoppers. When prices do inevitably rise, as they’re doing now, manufacturers and retailers both take cover behind neologisms that Wall Street understands, but Main Street sometimes doesn’t.
Package Sizes
Take French yogurt maker Danone, which said it “managed to pass some price” when inflation accelerated.  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co. said Wednesday that it expects “pricing actions” to take hold early in the next fiscal year.
Then there’s cereal maker  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS)., whose jargon includes arcane phrases like “strategic revenue management” and “holistic margin management,” which is not language you’d ever find on the back of a box of Lucky Charms. The company uses those terms so often, in fact, that its CEO now just refers to them by the acronyms SRM and HMM. The result is yet another euphemism: “Net price realization,” a term for hiking prices used by many food companies.
Another stealth tactic manufacturers employ is to keep the price of a given product stable, but reduce the package size slightly, thereby increasing the price per ounce.
Corporate doublespeak is not new, of course. For years, layoffs have been referred to as “right-sizing,” “headcount rationalization” or “reductions in force,” and businesses provide “synergy” and “solutions,” not products or services.
Customers, though, might respond to higher prices with a few choice words of their own.

 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) both rose 2%. The former’s vaccine is based on German company BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology. The two have a tie-up to make and market the vaccine in geographies mutually distributed between the two.

CEO Alex Gorsky has spoken about there likely being a need for an annual jab, much like the flu shot.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 11:47AM ET</span>",Ferrari turns to tech industry for its electric era leader,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) has turned to technology industry veteran Benedetto Vigna to drive the luxury sports car maker known for its roaring, high-octane engines into a new era of silent, electric powertrains.
Vigna, 52, currently runs the biggest division of semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics (ST), where he has worked since 1995 and helped pioneer the sensors first used in iPhones to rotate the screen by turning the handset.
Vigna's appointment announced on Wednesday shows Ferrari's development strategy remains firmly anchored in manufacturing cutting-edge, high-end sports cars for an electric era, rather than repositioning itself as a pure luxury goods company.
It also highlights the challenges facing carmakers as they adapt to the green revolution forcing the industry to move away from combustion engines and embrace new technologies from batteries to connectivity to autonomous driving.
""A semis guy who did his thesis on quantum quarks and has hundreds of patents to his name ... running Ferrari? We live in extraordinary times,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Over the years, Vigna's business division at ST has led the Franco-Italian company's moves into environmental, industrial and automotive sensors among other things.
""His unique knowledge gained over 26 years working at the heart of the semiconductor industry that is rapidly transforming the automotive sector, will accelerate Ferrari's ability to pioneer the application of next generation technologies,"" Ferrari said.
With cars starting at over 200,000 euros ($244,000), investors often look at Ferrari as more of a luxury firm than automotive specialist and there had been some speculation its next CEO might come from the world of consumer goods. 
(Graphic: Ferrari multiples - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbrqyavq/ferrari.png) 
Vigna's appointment fills a six-month vacancy at the helm of after former Chief Executive Louis Camilleri retired nearly two and a half years into the job in December for personal reasons. 
Chairman John Elkann, the scion of Agnelli family which controls Ferrari through its investment firm Exor (OTC:EXXRF), said Vigna's deep understanding of the technologies driving much of the change in the car industry would strengthen Ferrari.
Morgan Stanley analysts said the choice of Vigna showed Ferrari's board and management were aware of the ""existential risks"" facing the company and their commitment to transforming it into the ""the electric/connected/software defined car"".
ELECTRIC DEADLINE
During his temporary tenure at Ferrari, Elkann has accelerated its electric plans after a more cautious stance by Camilleri. Shortly before departing, Camilleri said he did not expect Ferrari to be 50% electric in his lifetime and it would never be fully electric.
Elkann said in April the new CEO would need the right technological capabilities, adding last month that sustainable mobility had become central.
Ferrari, which already sells hybrid vehicles, has promised to deliver its first electric car by 2025.
Pietro Solidoro, an analyst at Bestinver, said Vigna's appointment should reduce market concerns about Ferrari's future and its path towards electric vehicles.
By 1424 GMT Ferrari shares were down 2.2%, underperforming a 0.3% drop in the Italian blue-chip index.
Vigna, now president of ST's Analog, Micro-electromechanical Systems and Sensors group, will leave his job on Aug. 31, the chipmaker said, and start at Ferrari the next day.
Despite pushing back its 2022 financial targets by a year due to the pandemic, Ferrari booked a profit last year and has pressed ahead with rolling out new models.
Vigna faces several challenges on top of leading Ferrari into an age of electric mobility. He will have to revive its Formula One fortunes after its worst season in 40 years in 2020. 

He will also have to manage the company's new brand extension strategy without undermining the exclusivity that has supported its premium pricing and profit.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Private equity vows to help the world. Lenders want proof,"By Yoruk Bahceli and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Words can be cheap in the market for loans, now some lenders want to change that.
In recent years, borrowers have been able to get a reduction in their interest costs in return for meeting targets linked to environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. That trend has been turbocharged this year by private equity firms seeking a piece of the action.
ESG-linked loan issuance hit $87 billion during the first quarter, triple the amount over the same period last year, according to data provider Refinitiv.
As billions pour into the market, some lenders are wary about relying on the word of borrowers that they are meeting targets on everything from reducing food waste to promoting more women. 
""The burden of proof is going to rise. Be prepared for it,"" said Mark Wade, head of sustainability research and stewardship at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. Three industry associations that represent underwriters, law firms and asset managers in Europe, the United States and Asia revised their sustainability-linked loan principles last month. 
They now say borrowers must obtain independent, external verification of their performance against the targets, a change driven primarily by the investors who buy the loans and the lenders who arrange them, according to the London-based Loan Market Association.
The changed guidance was prompted by developments across the wider loans market but it has coincided with private equity's move into sustainability-linked loans.
Under pressure from their investors to show that their leveraged buyouts are not just about juicing returns, private equity firms, which often use leveraged loans rated below investment grade to finance the buyouts, have been responsible for 95% of the ESG-linked issuance in Europe's junk-rated loan market so far this year, according to financial intelligence provider Reorg Research.
Disclosure has always been a challenge for loan investors and, in particular, creditors of private equity portfolio companies. Many are private companies, and, unlike bonds or stocks, loans are not public securities, so they are not bound by the same disclosure requirements.
""The biggest criticism we hear is the problem of having data to assess the situation,"" said Armin Peter, head of sustainable banking and global head of debt capital markets syndicate at UBS. 
ESG-linked loan issuance in 2021 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgkwzjvq/0F9Fx-esg-linked-loan-issuance-booms-in-2021.png 
LEVERAGED LOAN BOOM
It is unclear how widely, and how quickly, the voluntary guidelines will be adopted.
Some market observers expect it to be an evolution, with independent verification of ESG targets eventually becoming the norm as it has in the public bond markets.
But in the short-term, the high demand for leveraged loans outstripping supply, on top of booming demand for ESG products, mean that borrowers often have the upper hand, enabling them to avoid third-party oversight.
Issuance of ESG-linked leveraged loans this year was up 14-fold to 19 billion euros by May compared to 2020, according to Reorg. 
""The sheer amount of liquidity on offer as compared to the number of high quality opportunities for deployment, does have an influence on terms being achieved,"" said Murad Khaled, head of EMEA leveraged finance capital markets at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which has arranged sustainability-linked loans for companies backed by the likes of Carlyle and CVC.
ESG-linked leveraged loans allow savings on the cost of borrowing between 0.05 and 0.15 percentage points if the targets are met, while costs rise similarly if the target is missed, according to Reorg. 
Nearly two thirds of the deals do not require a third-party to verify that ESG targets have been reached, Reorg data showed.
To be sure, not all targets may need external verification if the data is readily available in a company's regular disclosures, investors and bankers say. But even within the private equity industry, demand is growing for oversight. 
Four months since buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) negotiated a CHF413.5 million ($452 million) financing package for its acquisition of Swiss watch industry supplier Acrotec, it is still negotiating how to show key lender Blackstone that it is meeting its sustainability targets, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Carlyle was offered a loan by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc's lending arm in which the interest rate drops if Acrotec hits sustainability targets such as limiting its energy usage and recycling more. 
It also negotiated a revolving facility whose borrowing costs are reduced if the funds are used for a project that has a ""measurable environmental benefit"". 
Blackstone wants an independent party to verify that Carlyle is meeting its targets, according to a source familiar with its stance. Carlyle, on the other hand, wants the third party involved only in the setting of the targets, and expects Acrotec's management to certify its compliance, another source familiar said. 

Carlyle's global head of impact Megan Starr said that its companies' self-reporting on sustainability targets was no different to how they report other data related to their debt covenants to creditors.
""They have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the data is accurate,"" she said.

However, with the economy’s reopening and with it an uptick in financial transactions this year, many financial services companies are experiencing a solid recovery. This, coupled with improving odds that the Fed will raise interest rates soon in response to rising inflation, is helping the shares of  Capital One  (COF), Synchrony (SYF), and OneMain (OMF) climb to fresh highs. Despite hitting their 52-week highs recently, we think these stocks appear to have plenty of remaining upside. Read on.
The financial sector suffered a major setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic last year thanks to the Federal Reserve's decision to keep benchmark interest rates near zero to help buoy the economy and lower financial transactions amid the recession. However, with the economy now reopening quickly, the sector is attracting a lot of investor attention given its recovery potential. This is evidenced by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLF) 29.3% gains year-to-date compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 13% returns.
During an interview with Bloomberg News this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled that a slightly higher interest rate environment would be a plus for the economy. Such a development is expected to be a boon for the financial sector. Furthermore, the industry is expected to grow in the coming months with the integration of more advanced technologies in financial transactions. According to Globe Newswire, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to hit $22.5 trillion in 2021.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:OMF). The shares of these companies have been hitting new price highs recently. And, based on their fundamental strength, we think their shares could ascend higher in the coming months.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Fox Corp  (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares rose more than 3% in Wednesday’s trading, reacting positively to  Wells Fargo  's (NYSE:WFC)’s upgrade of the stock to ‘overweight’.
Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall says the stock could benefit from Fox’s presence in sports gambling, pointing out investments such as Credible Labs and Fox Bet as proof of the Murdoch company pivoting toward sports betting.
Sports gambling is a rapidly-emerging opportunity in the U.S. as more and more states lift restrictions to increase their tax collections.
Cahall has raised his target for the stock to $47, an upside of almost 24% from its current level of $37.86.
He believes the real opportunity would lie in Fox and London-listed Flutter (OTC:PDYPY) building a new company longer term by combining FanDuel U.S. and Fox's non-news network assets.
Fox and Flutter are currently locked in a legal battle over the value of former’s stake in FanDuel.

Meme stocks have received $1.27 billion of retail inflows in the past fortnight, matching the peak in January, when retail traders piled into video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in an attempt to drive up the share price and punish short sellers by forcing them to cover their positions at big losses.
Meme stocks are companies that see their value fueled by social media attention.
At the height of the trading mania, several retail brokers restricted the buying of GameStop after collateral requirements needed to clear the trades spiked, angering many traders and spurring congressional hearings and regulatory probes.
The latest surge comes as individual traders in online discussion forums, such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, have pumped up shares of companies including Clover Health Investments Corp, GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings.
The amount of cash flowing into meme stocks has been larger than any single sector or industry, even surpassing the S&P tech sector, according to Vanda, which tracks retail flows. 

What sets these meme stocks apart, ""is that they are absolutely hated by the hedge fund community, who have been piling into short bets for some time,"" Vanda researchers said. 
Sectors currently seeing higher retail participation include cannabis stocks and gaming stocks, while electric vehicle and space exploration companies, as well as cryptocurrencies have seen waning retail interest, Vanda said.

Nevertheless, HPQ reported impressive financials in its fiscal second quarter, which ended April 30, 2021. And in June, HPQ acquired HyperX, the gaming division of Kingston Technology Company. So, is the stock’s current price level a good entry point? Let’s find out.HP Inc.’s (NYSE:HPQ) broad product portfolio includes personal computing devices, and imaging and printing products. It also offers 3D printing solutions. The stock has lost 14.5% over the past month and is currently trading 15.5% below its $36 all-time high, which it hit on May 10. The price decline can be attributed primarily to investors’ speculation that the growth of personal computers, which has peaked amid the COVID-19 pandemic, could be slowed by the global semiconductor chip shortage, which could be detrimental to HPQ’s growth.
Even though HPQ may experience a temporary slowdown due to the chip shortage, its fundamentals are strong, and the company has a strong foothold in the computer hardware space. It had a stellar performance in its fiscal second quarter (ended April 30, 2021) with double-digit top- and bottom-line growth.
The company also completed the acquisition of HyperX on June 1, which is expected to drive growth in its Personal Systems business, where gaming and peripherals are fast-growing segments. HyperX’s award-winning product portfolio spans a range of gaming peripherals, including headsets, keyboards, mice, mouse pads, USB microphones, and console accessories. The acquisition supports HP’s strategy to drive growth in its Personal Systems business, where gaming and peripherals are attractive segments.

Investing.com --  Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) rose more than 2% after announcing a $1.2 billion deal with the U.S. government for a Covid-19 treatment.
If molnupiravir receives Emergency Use Authorization or approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Merck will receive approximately $1.2 billion to supply 1.7 million courses of the drug to the U.S. government. Merck has been investing at risk to support development and scale-up production of molnupiravir and expects to have more than 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021.
 “In addition to this agreement with the U.S. government, we are actively engaged in numerous efforts to make molnupiravir available globally to fulfill Merck’s commitment to widespread access,"" said Merck President Rob Davis. 
Merck also plans to submit applications for emergency use or approval to regulatory bodies outside of the U.S. and is currently in discussions with other countries interested in advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir. 
As part of its access strategy, Merck has also entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in 104 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies.

(Reuters) - Strong cash flow and growth will enable GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s consumer products business to cope with a higher debt load after its planned separation next year, the division's head of marketing told Reuters.
Tamara Rogers (NYSE:ROG), Chief Marketing Officer for GSK Consumer Healthcare, said in an interview for the Reuters Marketing Interactive Week that the business would take the increased debt in its stride because of its cash flow prospects.
""As a consumer business we have a very good cash flow, so we're expecting - with the growth rates that we are anticipating - to be able to manage that burden,"" Rogers said.
This would enable the division to ""make the choices we want to make around where to play. We are in sectors that are very high growth,"" Rogers added.
GSK is due to update investors on plans to split into two listed groups, one for pharmaceuticals and vaccines and another for consumer remedies, on June 23.
The consumer group has 10 billion pounds ($14.2 billion) in sales, about 30% of the group total, and as part of the separation slated for next year, GSK has said the unit will take on net debt worth 3.5 to 4 times its annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
That is up from 2 times for all of GSK currently. 
The proceeds from recapitalising the consumer division will be paid out to help GSK's remaining pharmaceuticals and vaccines business cut net debt to a ratio below 2, as well as to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which owns 32% of the entity.
Rogers said there was ample room for the consumer health business to grow from its number one position in the industry. Though ahead of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), it only commands a share of about 7% in the global market for over-the-counter remedies and vitamins.
For now, the group will focus on opportunities to grow in its established categories including oral care, pain killers as well as sprays and creams for allergy relief, both organically and via takeovers.
""It's a market that is more fragmented and we believe there is plenty of headroom for growth in the categories that we already play in,"" Rogers said.
""We are always looking at M&A opportunities but they have to be ones that are going to really align, augment and have a really strong fit with our business,"" said Rogers.Its vitamins and minerals for preventative healthcare, such as the Centrum brand, have seen a surge in demand during the coronavirus pandemic and Rogers said she expects preventative care to become an enduring trend even as COVID-19 cases drop.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>","Market power of Siri, Alexa, Google a concern, EU regulators say","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The market dominance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Alexa, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Siri and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Assistant has triggered concerns of potential anti-competitive practices, EU antitrust regulators said on Wednesday.
The comments from the European Commission come after a year-long inquiry into voice assistants and other internet-connected devices and responses from more than 200 companies.
Similar inquiries in the past into sectors such as e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, financial services and energy have led to cases against companies and hefty fines.
Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant are the most popular voice- assistant devices in Europe, with the global market expected to double to 8.4 billion devices from 4.2 billion between 2020 and 2024, according to Statista.
""We saw indications that some practices that we know too well may lead to tipping and to the emergence of gatekeepers,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters.
""And from the preliminary results published today, it appears that our concerns are shared by many players,"" she said.
Vestager said it was too early to say if the inquiry would lead to cases against companies which will be decided after a 12-week long public consultation ending Sept. 1 and a final report due in the first half of 2022. 
The EU antitrust watchdog said respondents cited worries over certain exclusivity and tying practices related to voice assistants such as producers of smart devices being prevented from installing a second voice assistant on a device.
A second concern was about voice assistant providers promoting their own services or those of third parties via default settings on devices, thus restricting rivals.
A third concern focused on the troves of data available to providers of voice assistants and smart devices, while a fourth worry was about the lack of inter-operability between devices.
Amazon said there was intense competition in the smart home market.
""There will not, and should not, be one winner. Today, Alexa is compatible with over 140,000 smart home products, and we make it easy for device makers to integrate Alexa directly into their own products,"" a spokesperson said.
Amazon went on to say it has signed up 80 companies to its Voice Interoperability Initiative which gives customers the ability to access multiple voice services on a device.

Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Vestager has proposed tough new rules known as the Digital Markets Act which targets a number of these practices. The draft needs to be thrashed out with EU lawmakers and EU countries before it can be implemented, likely next year.

OSLO (Reuters) - The Nord Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) exchange has received an operating license to host day-ahead power trading auctions for the first electricity cable linking Norway and Britain from this autumn, Norway's Energy Regulatory Authority (NVE-RME) said on Wednesday.
The concession allows Nord Pool to run auctions for delivery over the new 1,400 megawatt (MW) North Sea Link cable once trial operations begin on Oct. 1, the regulator said.
On Tuesday, the operators of North Sea Link, transmission system operators (TSOs) Statnett and  National Grid  (LON:NG), announced testing of the subsea cable would commence on June 15.
Nord Pool will be running an implicit auction, meaning capacity on the cable and production traded on the exchange are auctioned together. 
This ensures that electrical energy flows from areas with a surplus of power and lower prices to areas with a deficit and higher prices.
The cable connects Norway's southern price zone NO2 with the British power market. Nord Pool already operates in both markets.
Initially, Nord Pool is the only platform to offer trading on the new connection though others may be allowed to do so in the future, for example via shared order books, NVE-RME said.
""Nord Pool is happy to receive this positive news from RME (NVE) today - and we appreciate the focus RME has put on securing an efficient go-live of the trading solution,"" the exchange said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Ryanair on Wednesday won its challenge against state aid granted to German charter airline Condor, a third victory in its fight against billions of euros in pandemic support granted to its rivals.
The Luxembourg-based General Court annulled regulators' decision approving the measure but said Condor would not be required to repay the aid for now due to the COVID-19 pandemic and pending a new decision by the European Commission.
""The General Court annuls the Commission decision approving the state aid granted by Germany to the airline Condor Flugdienst on the ground of an inadequate statement of reasons,"" Europe's second-top court said.
Judges said the EU competition enforcer had provided inadequate reasons regarding the direct causal link between the costs resulting from the extension of Condor's insolvency period and the cancellation and rescheduling of its flights as a result of travel restrictions related to the pandemic.
The EU executive last year cleared a 550-million-euro ($670 million) German state-guaranteed loan to Condor, a former unit of collapsed holiday company Thomas Cook which operated a fleet of more than 50 aircraft before the pandemic, saying the measure complied with the bloc's state aid rules.
Ryanair hailed Wednesday's judgment.
""If Europe is to emerge from this crisis with a functioning single market, the European Commission must stand up to national governments and stop rubberstamping discriminatory State aid to inefficient national airlines,"" Europe's biggest budget airline said in a statement.
The Commission said it would study the judgment before taking the next steps.
Condor, in which investment fund Attestor has acquired a 51% stake from the German state, said the ruling would not affect the company for now.
""Today's decision of the European court has no impact on the entry of Attestor as new majority owner of Condor. As the ruling suspends the implementation … it has no impact on Condor's liquidity,"" the company said in a statement.
The German government said the Commission's decision could be fixed relatively quickly as it was only the reasoning which was found to be wrong.
Ryanair, which has filed 16 lawsuits against the Commission for allowing state aid to Lufthansa, Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) and other rivals as well as national schemes benefiting flag carriers, scored its first victories last month when the same court rejected aid given to KLM and Portugal's TAP.

The case is T-665/20 Ryanair v Commission.

The oral antiviral treatment, molnupiravir, aims to stop COVID-19 from progressing and can be given early in the course of the disease, similar to Tamiflu to treat influenza.
The treatment course being tested in the trial is an oral dose given every 12 hours for five days.
Merck expects to have more than 10 million courses of the therapy available by the end of this year and said it was in discussions with other countries interested in advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir.
The company, which is developing the drug with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is assessing the treatment in a late-stage trial in non-hospitalized patients to see if it reduces the risk of hospitalization or death.
Data from the trial, which plans to enroll a total of 1,850 patients globally, are expected in the fall of 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Other antiviral drugs also contending to be the first treatment aimed at the cause of COVID-19 include  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s PF-07321332 and Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF)'s AT-527.
If successful, Merck said it expects to file for the emergency use authorization of molnupiravir in the second half of 2021 at the earliest.

Merck has focused on its treatment after two COVID-19 vaccines it was developing failed to generate the necessary immune responses in early testing, prompting it to abandon them in January.
The drugmaker announced a change of plans and said in April it would no longer pursue use of molnupiravir in hospitalized patients.

The world’s third-biggest wealth fund, known as ADIA, will back the takeover of Medline by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc.,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc. and Hellman & Friedman, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. Singapore’s state-owned investor GIC Pte is also investing in the deal, which values Medline at more than $30 billion.
A spokesperson for ADIA confirmed the investment in response to Bloomberg queries. Abu Dhabi’s rainy-day fund has amassed just under $700 billion in assets, according to estimates from Global SWF and the SWF Institute, with a mandate to funnel the government’s oil surplus into foreign holdings.
Medline is the biggest private U.S. manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies like gloves, gowns and exam tables to hospitals and doctor’s offices. The private equity consortium beat out Canadian investment giant Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which was bidding on its own, to acquire the business.
ADIA has been seeking to take advantage of the relationship it enjoys as a backer of some of the world’s larger buyout firms and join in on more deals. Last year, it agreed to invest along with Advent International and Cinven on their $19 billion buyout of Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) AG’s elevator unit. The fund was part of a consortium that bought Nestle SA’s $10 billion skincare business in 2019.
It’s also ADIA’s second health-care deal in quick succession. In May it took a minority stake in health-care software provider Dedalus Holding from private equity company Ardian.
The sovereign fund has been building out its own team of private equity professionals, which allows it to make more of its own direct investments. This month, it added another senior hire to its in-house data analysis and artificial intelligence team, set up to develop new investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) plunged by more than 7% in Wednesday’s premarket trade as inflation ate into its quarterly profits forcing it to lower its guidance for the full year.
The company warned of “continued margin pressure related to its transition out of the COVID-19 environment.”
Expensive raw material and higher supply chain costs pulled down Campbell’s profit for the third quarter ended May 2 by nearly 5% from a year ago to $160 million.
Net sales were also lower, by 11.3% at $1.98 billion.
The company now expects its net sales for fiscal 2021 to fall by 3.5% to 3% as against the 3.5% to 2.5% fall forecast earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share is seen between $2.90 and $2.93 per share, down from the previously estimated $3.03-$3.11 range earlier."
252,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 08:18AM ET</span>","Treasury Yields Slip Below 1.5% Ahead of Auction, Inflation Data","(Bloomberg) -- The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.5% for the first time since May 7 as traders appeared to continue an unwind of short positions.
The benchmark retreated before an auction of notes at the tenor, falling as much as 4 basis points to 1.494%, and ahead of key U.S. inflation data due Thursday.
There was no clear catalyst for the latest move lower, suggesting a potential shift by the market’s large short base ahead of the U.S. data and a European Central Bank meeting Thursday.
Positioning for higher yields based on expectations for an inflationary economic recovery has been unprofitable over the past two months. The 10-year note’s yield peaked at about 1.77% in March and fell as low as 1.46% on May 7 after the release of weaker-than-forecast employment data.
The drop in yields, which has come in the face of signs that the Federal Reserve is moving toward tapering its asset purchases, comes before a policy meeting next week. Before that though, the market has to navigate the May Consumer Price Index, which economists expect to show an acceleration.
“I don’t think even a slightly stronger number changes the narrative too much for the June Fed meeting, which is one where they will start to talk about talking about tapering,” wrote NatWest Markets strategist John Briggs in a note this week about the upcoming data.
The drop in yields is not confined to the U.S., with those in Germany the most negative in a month.
“Rates markets appear remarkably robust,” said ING strategists including Antoine Bouvet. “It is clear that the market is pricing in the extension of the ECB’s accelerated asset purchase pace as a base case.” The ECB’s pandemic bond-buying program targets around 20 billion euros ($24 billion) a week.

Tuesday's outage raised questions about the reliance of the internet on a few infrastructure companies. Fastly https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/fastly-cloud-company-behind-global-internet-outage-2021-06-08's issue knocked out high traffic sites including news providers such as The Guardian and New York Times, as well as British government sites, Reddit and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""This outage was broad and severe, and we're truly sorry for the impact to our customers and everyone who relies on them,"" the company said in a blog post authored by Nick Rockwell, its senior engineering and infrastructure executive.
He said the problem should have been anticipated.
Fastly operates a group of servers strategically placed around the world to help customers move and store content close to their end users quickly and safely.
The company post gave a timeline of events and promised to examine and explain why Fastly had failed to detect the software bug during its own testing process.
Fastly said the bug was in a software update shipped to customers on May 12 but was not triggered until one unidentified customer carried out settings changes that triggered the problem ""which caused 85% of our network to return errors.""
Fastly noticed the outage within a minute it occurring at 0947 GMT, and engineers worked out the cause at 1027 GMT. Once they disabled the settings that triggered the problem, most of the company's network quickly recovered.

""Within 49 minutes, 95% of our network was operating as normal,"" the company said.
Its networks were fully recovered at 1235 GMT and it began rolling out a permanent software fix at 1725 GMT, Fastly said.

The settlement comes as Winterkorn was charged by Berlin prosecutors with giving false testimony to the German parliament when he said he was unaware of the carmaker's diesel emissions cheating before it became public.
Winterkorn stepped down as Volkswagen CEO in September 2015, a week after the scandal, in which the company admitted using illegal software to rig U.S. diesel engine tests, broke.
The settlement, which consists mainly of a 270 million euro payment from directors' and officers' liability (D&O) insurances, also includes a settlement with former Audi boss Rupert Stadler.

It still needs to be approved at the company's annual general meeting on July 22.

Oil sands producers, which extract some of the world's most carbon-intense crude, face investor pressure to reduce their environmental impact.

The alliance, which includes Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources, Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE), Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO), MEG Energy (OTC:MEGEF) and Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), will work with federal and Alberta governments to help Canada meet its climate goals, the companies said.
The country's oil sands producers are generating billions more in free cash flow in a faster-than-expected pandemic rebound, but have taken a cautious approach to spending it that is disappointing environment-minded investors.

The companies said they would look to link oil sands facilities in the Fort McMurray and Cold Lake regions to a carbon sequestration hub, use carbon capture and storage technology, as well as clean hydrogen, fuel switching and other methods to reduce emissions.
The companies will also tap into emerging emissions-reducing technologies including direct air capture and small modular nuclear reactors, among others.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>",Armani's future in focus as group denies any interest in Ferrari tie-up,"MILAN (Reuters) - Speculation over the future of Italian fashion group Armani came to the fore on Wednesday after the Milanese brand said it had no interest in a tie-up with luxury sports car maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), as proposed in a plan by investment banks.
Succession plans at the firm founded by 86-year-old designer Giorgio Armani, known as King Giorgio in the fashion world, have long been the subject of speculation.
In an interview with Vogue magazine in April Armani opened itself up to the possibility of joining forces with an Italian partner, having previously insisted the group should remain independent.
On Wednesday, Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper said investments banks, which it did not name, had pitched a plan envisaging a merger of Armani and Ferrari to Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family and the main investor in Ferrari.
Under the scheme Armani, by merging his company into Ferrari, would become the second-largest investor in the Formula 1 car maker. The paper said both Armani and Exor had ruled out such a plan.
A spokesperson for Armani contacted by Reuters said that project had not been presented to the fashion group which anyway had no interest in it.
Armani's comments to Vogue fuelled speculation about possible interest from Exor, which recently took stakes in shoe maker Christian Louboutin and Chinese luxury group Shang Xia, which was co-founded by France's Hermes. Analysts dismiss the possibility of a merger between Ferrari and Armani but they do not rule out interest from Exor in the fashion brand.

A Milan-based analyst said a valuation of between 5 and 6 billion euros for Armani would entail a 1.0-1.8 billion euro investment by Exor for a stake of 20-30%.
Armani and Exor declined to comment on the market speculation.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Prosecutors have charged former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) chief executive Martin Winterkorn with giving false testimony to the German parliament when he said he was unaware of the carmaker's diesel emissions cheating before it became public.
Volkswagen is struggling to draw a line under its biggest ever corporate crisis in which it admitted using illegal software to rig U.S. diesel engine tests. The ""dieselgate"" scandal has cost the German carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($39 billion) in fines, refits and legal costs.
""In his testimony, the accused falsely claimed to have been informed of the defeat devices only in September 2015,"" Berlin prosecutors said in a statement on Wednesday, confirming an earlier report in Bild newspaper.
""According to the indictment, he had since May 2015 been aware that the engine control software of some VW vehicles had been equipped with a function to manipulate the exhaust values in testing,"" the prosecutors added.
A spokesman for Winterkorn, who was Volkswagen CEO between 2007 and 2015 when he left the company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Volkswagen said in late March said it would claim damages from Winterkorn for breaching his duty of care by failing to fully and swiftly clarify circumstances behind the use of unlawful software functions in some diesel engines.

Winterkorn resigned as CEO on Sept. 23, 2015, a week after the scandal was uncovered.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, with investors treading water ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data later in the week.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 20 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%.
The proximity to Thursday’s U.S. inflation numbers is limiting activity as investors fret that a strong number will pile pressure on the Federal Reserve to start reining in its very accommodative monetary policy stance.
Economists are expecting May's  CPI to rise 4.7% from a year earlier, a jump from April’s 4.2%, which was the fastest rise since 2008.
“While on the CPI side all the focus will be on the U.S. prices tomorrow, the China May PPI data overnight underlined the clear global trend of building price prices,” said ING analysts, in a note.
Earlier Wednesday, China's factory gate prices rose at their fastest annual pace in over 12 years, with May PPI increasing 9.0% on the year, a significant jump from April’s 6.8% increase.
In corporate news, the meme stocks frenzy looks set to continue, with a new favorite emerging. Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) stock traded up over 20% premarket, a day after demand from retail investors sent its stock 86% higher to a record level.
Another retail pick GameStop (NYSE:GME) is also likely to be in the spotlight as it reports after the close on Wednesday. It’s expected to post a loss on $1.2 billion in revenue.
Similarly, Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) is due to release earnings Wednesday, and the maker of Jack Daniels and Chambord is expected to post gains in both sales and profit.
Crude oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by growing confidence about the outlook of fuel demand as the global economy recovers, particularly in the U.S., the largest consumer in the world.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.5% at $68.87 a barrel, after closing Tuesday above the $70 mark for the first time since October 2018. Brent was up 0.6% at $71.09, after earlier reaching $72.83, the highest since May 20, 2019.
On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude stocks fell by 2.1 million barrels in the week ended June 4. If confirmed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the day, this would be the third straight weekly decline in inventories as the U.S. driving season kicks into gear.
Additionally, the EIA lifted its forecast for fuel consumption this year in the United States to 1.49 million barrels per day, up from a previous forecast of 1.39 million barrels per day.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>","China tells banks, insurers to prepare 'living wills' to deal with potential risks","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's banking and insurance watchdog issued rules on Wednesday requiring sizable banks and insurers to prepare recovery plans in the unlikely event that they run into financial trouble, as the regulator seeks to strengthen the safety net of the country's financial sector.
The goal for such plans, which are commonly known as ""living wills"" for financial institutions in some developed economies, is to make sure China's financial institutions don't end up needing costly bailouts in the wake of risk events without contingency plans, and to maintain financial stability, the watchdog said. 
Banks, rural credit cooperative and other deposit-taking institutions with consolidated assets at home and abroad of no less than 300 billion yuan ($46.96 billion) should prepare such recovery and resolution plans, the China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a statement on its website.
Insurers with no less than 200 billion yuan of total on-book assets at home and abroad should also prepare such plans, it added.
The regulator added that eligible financial institutions should first make use of their own assets and ask for help from their own shareholders before turning to the government for support when running into trouble.
""They should prevent aggressive behaviour to shoulder too much risks, and prevent the moral hazard of over-relying on public rescues and support,"" according to the statement.
A grace period will be given for the implementation of the rules, the CBIRC said, without stating specific deadlines.
In early stage trials, the CBIRC has already asked the country's largest state banks including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF), and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) to set up such plans.

Insurance giant Ping An Insurance Group has been required to take similar action.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Top Glove Corp Bhd, the subject of a U.S. import ban over concerns about forced labour, is waiting for customs authorities there to verify remedial action it has taken on workers' recruitment fees, the Malaysian firm said on Wednesday.
The world's largest maker of medical gloves did not know when U.S. customs might lift the ban on its goods, but verification of the remediation payments is underway, said Managing Director Lee Kim Meow.
""We have no timeline given, but we have tried our best,"" he told a results briefing, adding that Top Glove was liaising closely with customs, and hoped there were no further issues.
In April, Top Glove said it had resolved all signs of forced labour in its operations, a step verified by London-based ethical trade consultant Impactt Limited.
The company said removal of the ban would boost sales, which have suffered since shipments to the United States halted temporarily in its financial third quarter.
A 68% reduction in sales to North America was the main reason for volumes easing from the preceding quarter, it said. 
The North American market accounted for just 8% of sales during the March-May quarter, down from 23% in the previous period. Total sales volume dropped 9% from a year ago, the firm added.
""Nonetheless, global glove demand remains resilient as usage continues to rise, driven by the ongoing pandemic,"" it said.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told the country's ports to seize Top Glove's goods in March, after having barred import of its products last July, citing evidence of forced labour practices at production facilities across Malaysia.
Top Glove shares closed 1.3% higher on Wednesday. They have slumped more than 20% this year.

STALLED LISTING
The U.S. action has also stalled Top Glove's pursuit of a $1 billion listing in Hong Kong, as potential investors raised concerns about the impact, Reuters has reported.
Top Glove, which has net cash of 4.23 billion ringgit, has said regulators were reviewing its listing process and it was working closely with advisers.
""Listing in Hong Kong is for the longer term,"" said Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai. ""(The CBP ban) caused us a delay in Hong Kong, (but it) is only temporary."" 
On Wednesday, Top Glove reported a jump of 485% in third-quarter net profit benefiting from strong demand for gloves during the pandemic.
It had posted record profit for the four straight quarters prior, bolstered by greater use of gloves over hygiene concerns.
A stock exchange filing showed net profit for the period jumped to 2.04 billion ringgit ($495.63 million) from 347.9 million a year ago. UBS had forecast a profit of 2.54 billion ringgit, according to Refinitiv data.

Its revenue rose 147% to 4.16 billion ringgit.
Top Glove, which produces 100 billion pieces of gloves a year, said average selling prices declined during the period from February's peak, and it had made adjustments in line with market pricing trends.

Renault said creating the single plant, known as Renault ElectriCity, would lead to the creation of 700 jobs spread across the various sites, which currently employ nearly 5,000 people, by 2025.
The company, which is looking to produce fewer and more profitable cars under boss Luca de Meo, faces strong competition in the electric car market, an area in which it had an early lead but where bigger rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is is catching up.
Its French plan to create a new legal entity and combine the workforce from the three sites has backing from all the company's unions, Renault said, and will entail further labour negotiations as it overhauls previous work agreements.
Talks will include reviewing gaps between some older contracts for 35-hour weeks that were paid at 39 hours and newer ones without that status, said Luciano Biondo, the head of the new industrial hub. 
Changes such as these ""will contribute to reaching the necessary competitiveness to produce B segment cars in France"", Biondo said, referring to smaller passenger vehicles.
Of the three plants affected, Douai is a car assembly site, Maubeuge a commercial vehicles assembly plant and the Ruitz site, which manufactures gear boxes, will be assigned a new electrical components manufacturing role, Renault said.
It will shrink the size of some of the factories and also aims to produce some its future electric models, like the Megane and next generation R5, on one assembly line. 

Loss-making Renault has been looking to slash costs, including through redundancies, as it tries to lift its profitability under De Meo. 
Electric cars are still more expensive to produce than traditional ones, adding to the cost equation. Renault wanted to nudge manufacturing costs to between 3% and 4% of the cars' selling price, but was still far from these levels, Biondo said.

LISBON (Reuters) -Spanish fast fashion giant  Inditex  (MC:ITX) said sales in May and so far in June were twice as high as in the same period last year as customers splashed out on post-lockdown shopping sprees.
The strong sales for May 1 to June 6 for the owner of brands including Zara, Bershka and Stradivarius came despite stores operating with 10% less trading hours due to pandemic-related limitations.
""Week after week we are seeing store traffic recovering,"" Chairman Pablo Isla said during a conference call, adding: ""We are seeing a progressive recovery.""
The post-lockdown spike mirrored results from rivals including Next and Abercrombie & Fitch Co., although some industry analysts have forecast that the uplift could be temporary as high savings rates may dampen spending.
National statistics agencies data showed retail sales in Europe, China and the United States surged in March, but stalled in April as a burst of activity after the easing of restrictions was stymied by rising prices and COVID-19 uncertainty.
Inditex saw a two-thirds increase in online sales in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020, with store traffic also up as COVID-19 related restrictions in key markets including Britain, Germany and France were loosened.
Isla did not give an estimate for how he expected online sales to evolve as shops opened fully, instead emphasising the long-term balance between online and in-store.
""You cannot expect for the full year these rates of growth for online. We believe very much in this fully integrated approach between stores and online much more than focusing on the specific rate of growth of any of the two areas,"" he said.
Inditex, which in June last year announced plans to close hundreds of stores, is currently operating 6,758 stores worldwide, compared to 7,412 last April.
PROFIT BEATS FORECASTS
Inditex's net profit for its first quarter period of February to April was better than expected at 421 million euros ($513 million), but still down on last year's fourth quarter profit and a third below pre-pandemic levels.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were down 27% on 2019, but Inditex beat expectations of analysts' polled by Refinitiv, who had estimated a net profit of 359.29 million euros and EBITDA of 1.17 billion euros.
While revenue for the quarter reached 4.9 billion euros, 48% more than the same period in 2020 when Inditex booked its first ever quarterly loss, it was still well short of 2019.
Shares in Inditex, which this month regained February 2020 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic, fell slightly to 31.67 euros at 1058 GMT.

Inditex said its tagging system for stock helped keep inventory 5% below 2019 levels and gross margin high at 59.9%, enabling it to sell nearly all items at full-price, Isla said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. casino giant  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) is facing a $12 billion lawsuit from a former partner in a Macau court, in a case set to shine a light over how coveted casino licenses were awarded in the world's biggest gambling hub two decades ago.
Former partner Asian American Entertainment Corporation, headed by Taiwanese businessman Marshall Hao, is seeking damages of around 70% of Sands’ Macau profits from 2004 to 2022. Reuters calculations puts the figure at around $12 billion.
The trial, starting June 16, alleges that Sands breached its contract with Asian American for a casino license in Macau, the only legal gambling destination in China. 
It comes as the casino titan faces plummeting gambling revenues due to coronavirus travel and health restrictions, and a few months ahead of the expiration of Sands' casino license in Macau. The operator needs to re-bid for a license via a public tender in 2022. 
Sands, which also runs a casino in Singapore, has been battling the claims from Asian American since 2007 when the case was first launched in the United States. 
The case was lodged in Macau in 2012 after the U.S. case was dismissed for statute of limitations and procedural reasons.
It dates to 2001 when Sands and Asian American jointly submitted a bid for a gaming concession. During the process, Sands switched partners, teaming up instead with Hong Kong group Galaxy Entertainment, according to the lawsuit.
The Sands-Galaxy combination went on to win a license in the former Portuguese colony over a decade ago.
Marshall Hao told Reuters that Sands terminated its joint venture with Asian American and then submitted a near identical replica of its previous submission with new partner Galaxy. 
""Asian American has been winning all major legal battles in the Macau lawsuit since we filed it in 2012...we are confident."" 
Sands has sought to avoid the trial by lodging legal action in Nevada and Macau. The company declined to comment, but said in 2019 it ""has consistently maintained that this case has no merit. We have confidence that ultimately the Macao judicial process will reach the same conclusion."" 

In its latest annual report, Sands said its management was “currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any.”
Sands, founded by late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, has faced several lawsuits over its earlier dealings in Macau, including over its securing of the lucrative casino license. (This story adds dropped letter in paragraph 6)

Contextlogic Inc. (NASDAQ:WISH) soared 33% and Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) rose 18% as of 5:21 a.m. in New York, both extending huge gains on Tuesday. Fast-food restaurant chain Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN). climbed 4.3%, extending Tuesday’s 26% advance and brushing aside a downgrade from Stifel.
Gains for ContextLogic, the operator of discount online retailer Wish.com, follow discussion of a potential short squeeze on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Clover, a health insurer backed by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, is in demand after retail traders realized that short sellers had been swelling their bets against the stock.
Chatter has built on WallStreetBets this week on the potential for short squeezes, following similar successful ploys on meme stocks including Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ:WKHS) and Richard Branson’s space exploration company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE).
Wendy’s was downgraded to hold from buy at Stifel, which said the stock’s valuation now fully reflects the growth it had been assuming to reach its target price of $25. Analyst Chris O’Cull said in a note that he’s still “constructive toward the company’s fundamental outlook.”

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it will exclude Huawei's dollar bonds from some its most influential investment indices from the end of next month, following the latest ratcheting up of U.S. sanctions on Chinese technology firms.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration issued a new executive order https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/07/2021-12019/addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples last week banning U.S. entities from buying or selling the publicly-traded securities of 59 Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance.
""Huawei USD-denominated bonds will be excluded from J.P. Morgan fixed income indices (including the CEMBI and JACI families) since the issuing entities for these securities (Proven Glory Capital Ltd. and Proven Honour Capital Ltd.) are explicitly named and in scope of the Amended Order,"" JPMorgan said in a note to index users late on Tuesday.
It added that the exclusion would happen on July 30. Huawei's bonds currently have a 9 basis points weight in the widely-tracked CEMBI Broad Diversified index of emerging market companies, 36 bps in the Asia-focused JACI index and 38bps in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) version of the JACI.
The U.S. investment bank estimates the CEMBI and JACI index groups have more than $140 billion and $80 billion in assets benchmarked to them respectively - money which relates to the global investment funds that use these kind of indices as a shopping list of what to buy. 
Huawei, which is China's leading telecommunications equipment maker, was first put on a U.S. trade blacklist in May 2019 due to national security concerns. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is a risk.
The ban put Huawei's handset business under immense pressure. Once the world's biggest smartphone maker, Huawei is now ranked sixth, with a 4% market share in the first quarter.

JPMorgan said new and existing bonds from Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp will remain excluded from the indices. 
Those of China National Chemical and Sinochem will remain in, meanwhile, after they were not included in last week's new sanctions list.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",Pandemic seen driving southeastern Europe warehouse boom,"By Michael Kahn and Jason Hovet
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Logistics and warehouse companies are accelerating expansion plans in southeastern Europe where business is expected to boom as the pandemic spurs manufacturers to relocate operations close to main markets.
Like others in the sector, Dutch group Raben has seen increasing interest from firms looking to establish supply chains near core Western European markets to avoid costly disruptions such as those caused by COVID-19. 
Privately-held Raben Group-- which operates in 13 European countries serving industries including retail and automotive -- expects rising costs elsewhere in emerging Europe to drive growth in southeastern states and the Balkans.
Raben and other industrial warehouse firms said they were in talks with companies looking to shift some operations from Asia and elsewhere but it was too early to share details.
""Companies will return to Europe from Asia. We need to be ready to take over when this happens,"" Raben CEE director Tomasz Niezwicki told Reuters. 
He said the company would open three new warehouse locations in Romania this year to add to its portfolio of seven as it speeds up its expansion plans.
Setting up in European Union nations Romania and Bulgaria represents a big selling point for these and neighbouring countries like Serbia where it is often cheaper and easier to get projects running, company officials and analysts say.
The region's deep pool of skilled labour and less burdensome permit requirements to build new facilities are helping to lure manufacturers away from more established bases like the Czech Republic, warehouse and logistic operators say.
Improved roads and other infrastructure in Romania and surrounding countries as well as developments like Britain's exit from the EU and shifting relations with China have boosted their prospects, they add.
""These have the potential to bring in some manufacturing or logistics activities in Romania, particularly if we regard that labour costs in manufacturing, for instance, are comparable between Romania and China,"" real estate company Colliers International said in its 2021 outlook for the market.
Foreign investors have also been drawn by yields on industrial and logistics properties that hovered in 2020 between 8-10% for Romania and Bulgaria and 5-7% in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, Colliers said, compared with 4.5% in Germany or France. Graphic: Prime yields in the CEE industrial real estate sector: https://graphics.reuters.com/EASTEUROPE-REALESTATE/INDUSTRIAL/bdwvkxkerpm/chart.png 
Wages around three times less in Serbia and about half as much in Romania and Bulgaria compared with the Czech Republic are helping to attract manufacturers, JLL real estate consultancy's Andrew Peirson said.
""The big manufacturing requirements are moving south,"" Peirson, the consultancy's general manager for the Czech Republic told Reuters. ""Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia - they will impact the whole of the region."" 
While central Europe remains attractive for retail logistics and warehouse businesses due to proximity to bigger markets like Germany, growth from online retailers such as Romania's eMAG are also helping to boost warehouse demand. 
Poland and the Czech Republic represent the biggest markets in the industrial and logistics warehouse sector in emerging Europe with 20 million metres and 9 million square metres of warehouse space -- equivalent to about 1,300 football pitches -- compared to 5 million square metres in Romania.
However, southeastern Europe is growing at a faster clip and closing the gap. This has pushed industrial property developer CTP to expand in the region. The company -- which posted a 73% year-on-year rise in first quarter profit to 98.5 million euros ($120 million)-- acquired 95,000 square metres of buildings from Australia's Cromwell Property Group last November in the biggest deal in the Romanian logistics market in 2020. CTP Chief Financial Officer Richard Wilkinson said the company planned to boost its holdings in Romania to near 2 million square metres by the end of 2021, part of an effort to grow its whole portfolio to 7.5 million metres this year, from just under 6 million held at the end of 2020.
""We see strong demand in (Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia),"" he said. ""We are starting to see companies looking to come back from Asia and I expect that trend to continue."" Graphic: Romania's modern industrial stock: https://graphics.reuters.com/EASTEUROPE-REALESTATE/INDUSTRIAL/yzdpxmqnxvx/chart.png
The industrial and logistics sector in Romania -- southeastern Europe's biggest economy -- grew by 43% in the first quarter from a year earlier with 264,000 square metres of new space leased to total 5.16 million square metres, according to real estate consultancy CBRE.
Dacia's deal to renew a 68,000 square metre warehouse lease marked Romania's biggest deal of the first quarter. Another 600,000 square metres of industrial space are expected to be built in what is shaping up to be a record year, said CBRE Romania Managing Director Razvan Iorgu.
""Going forward we will see more manufacturing relocated to Romania,"" he told Reuters, pointing out India-based car parts maker Sandhar Technologies' March arrival in Romania. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co also confirmed in April it would invest $300 million to build a new light commercial vehicle starting at its Craiova plant as evidence of growing manufacturing demand.

""Last year retail drove the market and this year we are betting on manufacturing,"" he added.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) received a $3.9-billion contract in July 2018 to build two 747-8 aircraft for use as Air Force One, set for delivery by December 2024.
Boeing said it wanted extra time of about a year to deliver, however, Darlene Costello, the air force's acting assistant secretary for Acquisition, told a panel of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives.
The planemaker also sent the Air Force a letter beginning the process to negotiate a price adjustment for the jets, Costello added.

Investing.com -- Asia Pacific stocks were broadly lower Wednesday morning but moves remained small. Investors digested mixed inflation data from China while also awaiting inflation data from the U.S later in the week.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield steadied from a fall to an intraday one-month low. Yields eased for a third consecutive week.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.13% by 10:22 PM ET (2:22 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.29%. The Chinese consumer price index (CPI) for May, released earlier in the day, missed forecasts, contracting 0.2% month-on-month and growing 1.3% year-on-year. However, the producer price index (PPI) exceeded expectations, growing 9% year-on-year.
U.S.-China relations are also back in the spotlight as the U.S. Senate passed a bill to counter the perceived economic and strategic challenge from China. The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 bill to invest almost $250 billion in bolstering U.S. manufacturing and technology passed on Tuesday by a 68-32 vote.
Although the bill’s passage was a rare show of bipartisanship in a chamber that remains divided on other issues, it remains to be seen if the House of Representatives will also pass the bill.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.01%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.21%. Earlier Wednesday data showed that the country’s GDP grew by a stronger-than-forecast 7% in the first quarter of 2021, accelerating from the prior quarter's 1.2% growth.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.25% and In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.09%.
On the data front, the U.S. will release CPI data for May on Thursday. The report will be closely watched amid concerns over whether rising price pressures will affect the path of monetary policy in the U.S.
“The tight trading ranges seen so far this month reflect the cautious mood in the market ahead of the inflation numbers,” City Index senior financial markets analyst Fiona Cincotta told Bloomberg.
“Whilst the Fed reassures that this spike in inflation is temporary, policymakers will need to be out in their droves to calm the market,” Cincotta added.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate passes bill to raise fees on biggest mergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would increase fees that companies planning the biggest mergers pay to government antitrust agencies and give those agencies bigger budgets.
The bill - co-sponsored by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, the top antitrust senator, and Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee - would lower the fee for smaller mergers under $161.5 million to $30,000 from $45,000. But for deals worth $5 billion or more, the fee would rise to $2.25 million from $280,000.
""Now that my bill with Senator Grassley passed the Senate, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice's Antitrust Division are one step closer to having additional resources to conduct rigorous reviews of large mergers,"" Klobuchar said in a statement.
The antitrust measure was included in a Senate package aimed at boosting the country's ability to compete with Chinese technology. The bill must pass the House of Representatives to be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's Antitrust Division assess mergers to ensure that they comply with antitrust law.
The measure would increase authorizations to each, giving the FTC a budget of $418 million, while the Antitrust Division would receive $252 million.
Under a budget proposed by the Biden administration, the FTC would get $389.8 million for the next fiscal year. That is an increase from $351 million this year, or about 11%. Also under Biden's plan, the Antitrust Division would see its budget increase to $201 million from $185 million, an increase of 8.6%.

Grassley said in a statement that the current system of assessing mergers and working to stop anti-competitive practices was ""outdated"" and ""not getting the job done.""
""I'm glad to see my colleagues in the Senate also recognize this issue and support it (the bill) today,” he said.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 08:51PM ET</span>",Google loosens its search engine grip on Android devices in Europe,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Google has bowed to pressure from rivals and will let them compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe, widening a pledge to EU antitrust regulators two years ago.
The move by the world's most popular internet search engine comes as the 27-country bloc considers rules that could be introduced next year to force Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to ensure a level playing field for competitors.
Google's Android mobile operating system runs on about four-fifths of the world's smartphones. The U.S. tech giant said in 2019 that rivals would have to pay via an auction for appearing on a choice screen on new Android devices in Europe from which users select their preferred search engine. 
Google's change of heart followed a 4.24 billion euro ($5.16 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission, the EU antitrust authority, in 2018 for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine. 
""We are now making some final changes to the Choice Screen including making participation free for eligible search providers. We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen,"" Google director Oliver Bethell wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
The changes will come into effect in September, the blog added.
The Commission said it had discussed possible changes with Google following concerns raised by a number of its rivals, adding that those announced were positive developments.
Google said the five most popular eligible search engines in each EU country according to StatCounter, including Google, would be displayed in random order at the top of the screen while up to seven will be shown at the bottom.
It had previously only allowed four competitors, chosen in separate auctions for each EU country, to be displayed on Android screens. 
However DuckDuckGo, a rival search engine that has long complained about the auction process, said Google should go further.
""Google is now doing what it should have done three years ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU,"" CEO Gabriel Weinberg tweeted. 
""However, it should be on all platforms, eg also desktop Chrome, accessible at all times, ie not just on factory reset, and in all countries.""
Search engine Ecosia, which together with four other rivals complained about Google's initial proposal to the Commission last year, welcomed the changes.
""With this, we have something that resembles a level playing field in the market,"" its CEO Christian Kroll said in a statement.

""Search providers now have a chance to compete more fairly in the Android market, based on the appeal of their product, rather than being shut out by monopolistic behaviour.""

Its shares, which have been rising slowly since late May, were among the most shorted across U.S. exchanges, after being the target of a report by short seller Hindenburg in February, which took a position in the company.
The ""meme stock"" phenomenon, which began with video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in January and spread to cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc in May, has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation.
The stocks have been at the center of buying by retail investors who hyped the shares in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.
""Shorts have been building their position in (Clover Health) as its stock price has been rallying,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said.
Clover Health shares shorted increased by 4.5 million shares, worth $54 million, over the last week, based on research from S3 Partners. By comparison, Clover Health shares shorted increased by 9.7 million shares, worth $115 million, over the last 30 days.
Short interest in Clover Health is at $585 million, with 49.10 million shares shorted, or 43.5% of Clover's float, he said.
Clover's backer, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, took the company public through a $3.7 billion reverse merger with his blank check firm in October 2020.
Clover's options have drawn a surge of bullish action in recent days with trading volume surging to 587,000 contracts on Monday, compared with an average daily volume of under 50,000 contracts for the month of May, Trade Alert data showed.
Call options speculating on the stock climbing all the way to $30 were among some of the most heavily traded contracts in recent days.
'GAMMA CALL LADDER'
Clover's 30-day implied volatility, an options-based measure of how much traders' expect the stock to gyrate in the near term, was at 176%, up from 93% at the end of May, according to Trade Alert data.
The massive jump in Clover shares on Monday was aided by an options ""gamma call ladder"" - a situation where market makers have sold a large number of call options on a string of adjacent strike prices, said Jay Wolberg, founder of Trading Volatility, a data and analytics provider focused on financial derivatives.
With the stock price creeping closer to those sold contracts, market makers are left with little choice but to buy up the stock to offset their options exposure, thereby pushing the stock higher, in what is termed a ""gamma squeeze."" 
""Clover was in a gamma call ladder yesterday with peak gamma at $12. Today' peak gamma is at $16 and there isn't much gamma between $16 and $20 to drive it higher,"" Wolberg said.
With Clover options trading in heavy volume, the gamma picture can quickly change as investors take new positions.
Among other big movers on Tuesday, shares of Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) soared 26%, with commenters on wallstreetbets praising the hamburger seller's often sassy Twitter profile https://twitter.com/Wendys.
""Their Twitter has a reputation for meming. And we meme,"" read https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv5vmd/wen_a_good_buy_and_a_good_meme one post on the stock trading forum. ""It's a match made in heaven.""

Shorts have been covering their short exposure in Wendy's recently, with 1.4 million shares covered, worth $32 million, over the last month, Dusaniwsky wrote in a report on Tuesday.
GameStop, which holds its annual shareholder meeting and reports quarterly results on Wednesday, was up 7.1%. AMC was up just 0.1%.

David Cohne believes this is temporary and is suggesting investors consider top pharma stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO).In 2020, pharmaceutical stocks came to the forefront as healthcare companies were searching for treatments for COVID-19. As represented by the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH), the pharmaceutical industry gained 75% from March 23, 2020, to February 8, 2021. It has since leveled off a bit as the ETF is down 7% since then. But this provides us a buying opportunity to pick up some shares on the dip. 
Much like technology companies, healthcare companies, and pharmaceutical companies, in particular, represent the future, as an aging boomer population will start requiring more medications and healthcare needs. A large percentage of the population is already heavily medicated, so imagine what it will be like in twenty to thirty years. That's why adding pharmaceutical companies to your portfolio now isn't a bad idea. 
The key is finding companies with solid fundamentals and consistent growth, which our proprietary POWR Ratings system can help you with. So, I ran a screen for three top pharmaceutical companies in our database that also had notable growth drivers expected to drive their share prices up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said on Tuesday.
Another U.S. official said the administration will not move quickly to lift orders that bar people from much of the world from entering the United States because of the time it will take for the groups to do their work. The White House informed airlines and others in the travel industry about the groups, the official said.
""While we are not reopening travel today, we hope that these expert working groups will help us use our collective expertise to chart a path forward, with a goal of reopening international travel with our key partners when it is determined that it is safe to do so,"" the White House official said, adding ""any decisions will be fully guided by the objective analysis and recommendations by public health and medical experts.""
The groups will be led by the White House COVID Response Team and the National Security Council and include the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other U.S. agencies.
The CDC said on Tuesday it was easing travel recommendations on 110 countries and territories, including Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Africa and Iran, but has declined to lift any COVID-19 travel restrictions.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the U.S. travel restrictions in place since 2020 are subject to ""an interagency conversation, and we are looking at the data in real time as to how we should move forward with that.""
The Biden administration has faced pressure from some lawmakers who said U.S. communities along the Canadian border have faced economic hardship because of land border restrictions.
Airlines and others have pressed the administration to lift the restrictions that prevent most non-U.S. citizens who have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil from traveling to the United States. The United States also bars most non-essential travel at its land borders with Mexico and Canada.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and others, praised the working groups but the group believes ""these working groups should act quickly to endorse a policy backed by science that will allow travelers who are fully vaccinated to travel to the U.S. Quickly is the key – we believe the science is there.""
United Airlines said it was encouraged the White House was prioritizing a plan to reopen air travel to international markets and requested urgency, given the typically busy impending summer travel season. ""Now is the time to implement a reopening strategy for the benefit of both the economy and the traveling public.""
On Monday, the heads of all passenger airlines flying between Britain and the United States called on both countries to lift limits on trans-Atlantic travel restrictions.
U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet at the G7 meeting of advanced economies this week in Cornwall, England. 

U.S. and UK airline officials said they do not expect Washington to lift restrictions until around July 4 at the earliest as the administration aims to get more Americans vaccinated.
The U.S. Travel Association welcomed the working groups, saying ""a public-private task force can quickly develop a blueprint to reopen international inbound travel and jumpstart a sustained jobs and economic recovery.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks struggled to eke out closing gains on Tuesday as a lack of clear market catalysts kept institutional investors on the sidelines, while retail traders fueled the ongoing meme stocks rally.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the range-bound session near flat or higher, with the S&P 500 and the Dow closing within about 0.5% of record highs.
The tech-laded Nasdaq Composite fared best, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) providing the biggest boost.
""We're waiting for inflation numbers, waiting for more from the (Federal Reserve), waiting for earnings season,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There's not a lot motivating the market today.""
""We're in this twilight zone until probably right after the Fourth of July, when we see earnings season kick in,"" Nolte added.
The CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, touched its lowest level in over a year.
Smallcaps, once again buoyed by the ongoing meme stock retail frenzy, were outperforming their larger counterparts.
Clover Health Investments seized top billing among meme stocks, surging 85.8%, the biggest percentage winner in the Nasdaq.
Other stocks whose recent explosive trading volumes have been attributed to social media buzz, including  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME),  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY), Workhorse Group and others, ended the session between 7% and 12% higher.
""(Meme stocks) are where the action is, but you flip it over and look crypto and that's a mess,"" Nolte said. ""Now the meme stocks are taking over from crypto as the place to be and it's all a consequence of very easy monetary policy."" 
Reports from the U.S. Labor Department and National Federation of Independent Business appeared to confirm a labor shortage even as demand roars back to life, which could put upward pressure on wages, a precursor to wider inflation.
Market participants look to Thursday's consumer price index data for further clues regarding inflation, and how it could influence the Federal Reserve's timetable for tightening its monetary policy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.42 points, or 0.09%, to 34,599.82; the S&P 500 gained 0.74 points, or 0.02%, at 4,227.26; and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.19 points, or 0.31%, at 13,924.91.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, consumer discretionary enjoyed the biggest percentage gain, and utilities suffered the largest loss. 
Sales of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's China-made electric cars jumped in May by 29%, marking a 177% year-on-year increase, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The stock erased initial gains on the news to close down 0.3%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares were boosted by Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)' announcement that it had ordered 34 new 737 MAX aircraft, but the planemaker's shares pared gains to end the session flat.
GameStop, the company most closely associated with the Reddit-driven short squeeze phenomenon, is expected to report quarterly results after markets close on Wednesday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 172 new highs and 16 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.82 billion shares, compared with the 10.75 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 07:05PM ET</span>",Palihapitiya's $16 million bet on Clover worth $682 million on Reddit rally,"By Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Serial dealmaker Chamath Palihapitiya's $16 million investment in the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that took Clover Health Investments Corp public was worth $682 million on Tuesday after a Reddit-fueled rally in the health insurer's shares.
Clover shares ended trading up 86% on Tuesday as it became the latest 'meme stock' to capture the imagination of amateur investors on Reddit and other social media platforms. 
The shares had deeply underperformed the wider market and traded below the SPAC's IPO price since February, when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Clover of concealing from investors a U.S. Department of Justice enquiry into its business. 
Clover has said the enquiry was routine and not financially material to disclose. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into Hindenburg's claims. 
Palihapitiya, one of the most prolific SPAC sponsors, is now sitting on a paper profit of more than 4,000% after Clover shares close to doubled on Tuesday, giving the company a market value of $9 billion and boosting the value of his 21.3% stake in the company, according to Reuters calculations. 
A Palihapitiya spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
A third of Palihapitiya's stake in Clover is pledged as collateral to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) for a loan, a regulatory filing shows. A six-month lock-up that would prevent him from cashing out on his stake expired earlier this month.
Palihapitiya's windfall is not just down to the Reddit rally. SPAC managers are awarded warrants and founder shares that result in them owning a much bigger chunk of the combined company that their investment would otherwise entitle them to. 

Palihapitiya took Clover Health public through a $3.7 billion merger that closed in January. He has launched several so-called blank check firms that have merged with a wide range of companies, including fintech startup Social Finance Technologies (SoFi), space tourism firm Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and home-selling platform Opendoor Technologies Inc.
Earlier in June, Palihapitiya launched four new, warrant-less SPACs that are looking to raise a total of $800 million through IPOs, with a focus on buying biotech firms.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. to work with allies to secure electric vehicle metals,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Ernest Scheyder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States must work with allies to secure the minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries and process them domestically in light of environmental and other competing interests, the White House said on Tuesday.
The strategy, first reported by Reuters in late May, will include new funding to expand international investments in electric vehicles (EV) metal projects through the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, as well as new efforts to boost supply from recycling batteries.
The U.S. has been working to secure minerals from allied countries, including Canada and Finland. The 250-page report outlining policy recommendations mentioned large lithium supplies in Chile and Australia, the world's two largest producers of the white battery metal.
President Joe Biden's administration will also launch a working group to identify where minerals used in EV batteries and other technologies can be produced and processed domestically. 
Securing enough copper, lithium and other raw materials to make EV batteries is a major obstacle to Biden's aggressive EV adoption plans, with domestic mines facing extensive regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition.
The White House acknowledged China's role as the world's largest processor of EV metals and said it would expand efforts to lessen that dependency.
""The United States cannot and does not need to mine and process all critical battery inputs at home. It can and should work with allies and partners to expand global production and to ensure secure global supplies,"" it said in the report. 
The White House also said the Department of the Interior and others agencies will work to identify gaps in mine permitting laws to ensure any new production ""meets strong standards"" in terms of both the environment and community input.
The report noted Native American opposition to Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp's Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, as well as plans by automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to produce its own lithium.
The steps come after Biden, who has made fighting climate change and competing with China centerpieces of his agenda, ordered a 100-day review of gaps in supply chains in key areas, including EVs.
Democrats are pushing aggressive climate goals to have a majority of U.S.-manufactured cars be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be electric by 2040. 
As part of the recommendations from four executive branch agencies, Biden is being advised to take steps to restore the country's strategic mineral stockpile and expand funding to map the mineral resources available domestically.
Some of those steps would require the support of Congress, where Biden's fellow Democrats have only slim majorities.

The Energy Department already has $17 billion in authority through its Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan program to fund some investments.
The program's administrators will focus on financing battery manufacturers and companies that refine, recycle and process critical minerals, the White House said.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Tuesday it will begin testing its COVID-19 vaccine in a larger group of children under age 12 after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial.
The study will enroll up to 4,500 children at more than 90 clinical sites in the United States, Finland, Poland and Spain, the company said.
Based on safety, tolerability and the immune response generated by 144 children in a phase I study of the two-dose shot, Pfizer said it will test a dose of 10 micrograms in children between 5 and 11 years of age, and 3 micrograms for the age group of 6 months to 5.
A Pfizer spokesperson said the company expects data from 5- to 11-year-olds in September and would likely ask regulators for emergency use authorization later that month. Data for children 2 to 5 years old could arrive soon after that, he said.
Pfizer expects to have data from the 6-month to 2-year-old age group sometime in October or November. 
The vaccine - made by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SA - has been authorized for use in children as young as 12 in Europe, the United States and Canada. They receive the same dose as adults: 30 micrograms.
Nearly 7 million teens have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching ""herd immunity"" and taming the COVID-19 pandemic.
Still, scientists in the United States and elsewhere are studying the possibility of a link between heart inflammation and mRNA vaccines, particularly in young men. Both Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's vaccines are mRNA shots.

Israel's Health Ministry said last week it had found the small number of myocarditis cases observed mainly in young men who received the Pfizer vaccine there were probably linked to their vaccination. The cases were generally mild and did not last long.
Pfizer has said it is aware of the Israeli observations of myocarditis and that no causal link to its vaccine has been established.

(Reuters) - Thousands of government, news and social media websites across the globe were coming back online on Tuesday after getting hit by a widespread hour-long outage linked to U.S.-based cloud company Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) Inc.
High-traffic sites including Reddit, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), CNN, PayPal, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Al Jazeera Media Network and the New York Times went down, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. They came back after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour early in the morning in the United States but middle of the day in Europe.
""Our global network is coming back online,"" Fastly said.
One of the world's most widely-used cloud-based content delivery network providers, the company earlier reported a disruption from a ""service configuration"" and did not explain.
""Incidents like this underline the fragility of the internet and its dependence on a patchwork of fragmented technology. Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said.
""The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is.""
Typical service configurations for a cloud service provider can include updating security rules to protect information, or instructing a server to refresh the contents of a news site before serving it to a customer, said Andy Champagne, senior vice president at Akamai, a cloud service company.
A simple typo can be propagated to thousands of servers and cause disruptions, he said. 
Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of under $6 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. The company's content delivery network (CDN) helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.
""In the grand scheme of things, we actually think that this is a little bit of a positive for other CDNs and also just shows how difficult managing a CDN can be,"" said James Fish, analyst at Piper Sandler & Co. 
Apart from Fastly, the other main CDN providers include Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) and AWS.
""It certainly reminds us just how crucial so few sites and services are to our digital lives,"" said Neil Campling, global TMT analyst at Mirabaud Securities.
Users received error messages quickly when they visited affected websites on Tuesday, which is an indication Fastly was not a victim of a DDoS attack, or a type of cyber-attack in which a bad actor overwhelms a network with a flood of internet traffic, Champagne said.
The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.
The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking COVID-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.
Websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg News also faced outages. 
Many of the websites affected earn revenue from digital advertising. Worldwide, websites lost over $29 million in digital ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to back-of-the-envelope estimates from media measurement firm Kantar.
News publishers came up with inventive workarounds to report about the outage when their websites failed to load.
Popular tech website the Verge used Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Docs to report news, while UK Technology Editor at the Guardian started a Twitter thread to report on the problems.
At the onset of the outage, nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to Downdetector.com.
Twitter users quickly reacted to the outage, creating the #InternetShutdown hashtag with KITKAT's official handle telling its 441,500 followers ""Guess (NYSE:GES) it's time to Have A Break.""

""We were offline for a few minutes because the whole internet broke down,"" tweeted Jitse Groen, chief executive of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com. 
Shares of New York-listed Fastly were up 7.7% after being down nearly 4% in pre-market trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lower prices for growth stocks as a result of the inflation-driven selloff that began in February should mean that Ark Investment's portfolios should see a ""more than tripling"" over the next five years, star fund manager and firm founder Cathie Wood said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
Wood, who became the face of the outsized rally in technology stocks such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc during the coronavirus pandemic last year, said that falling lumber and copper prices signal that the market is ""beginning to see signs that the risks are overblown” from inflation. 
Lumber prices are down approximately 30% from their May 7 highs, while copper prices are down nearly 6% over the same time. 
""We know it's been a difficult time in the market for innovation strategies,"" she said. As a result, Wood has moved into what she called ""opportunistic"" investment plays such as special-purpose acquisition companies that have badly underperformed the benchmark S&P 500. 
Inflation fears have weighed heavily on growth stocks since the beginning of the year, prompting investors to rotate into so-called value stocks in sectors such as energy and financials that benefit from rising prices. The Russell 1000 Value index is up nearly 18% for the year to date, while the Russell 1000 Growth index is up nearly 7% over the same time. 
Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing actively managed U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar last year, has seen her performance stagnate along with the slowdown in growth stocks. Her flagship fund is down nearly 28% from its early February high.
The fund rose 0.1% in afternoon trading on Tuesday. 

The market focus on Wood's portfolio has largely been replaced this year by an emphasis on so-called meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) which have skyrocketed more than 1,000% since the start of January thanks to individual investors who frequent social media sites like Reddit. 
When asked, Wood said ARK does not search Reddit for stock ideas but does monitor it for the ""great conversation"" about the companies the firm holds.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",Biogen to start shipping Alzheimer's drug in about two weeks,"(Reuters) -Biogen Inc said on Tuesday it expects to begin shipping its newly approved Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm in about two weeks and has prepared more than 900 healthcare centers for the intravenous infusion treatment.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Aduhelm as the first treatment to target a likely underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease, sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid-beta.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said on a call with analysts that the sites include clinical trial centers with currently confirmed amyloid-beta positive patients, as well as other locations with infrastructure to diagnose and treat patients.
The company priced the drug at $56,000 per year and patients who are prescribed it need to undergo additional testing in the form of either a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) test, or a PET scan to confirm the presence of amyloid-beta in the brain.
Biogen CFO Michael McDonnell said on the call there are about one to two million Americans who have been diagnosed with mild dementia or cognitive impairment, who would be amyloid-beta positive if tested.
The need for PET or CSF tests and the limited availability of specialists to oversee patients taking the drug could limit Aduhelm's use in these patients, McDonnell said.
""We believe the majority of diagnosed patients are not currently under the care of a specialist, and as a result we expect gradual uptake over time,"" he added.

Revenue from Aduhelm could start ramping up in 2022 and beyond, but could be low in 2021 due to the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients, and the time that it will take to secure insurance coverage for the drug, McDonnell said.
Guggenheim analysts on Monday estimated sales from the drug could be over $1.3 billion in 2022. Biogen shares were down about 3% at $384.87.

Robinhood generated $682 million in payment for order flow in 2020, a 514% increase year-on-year.
While U.S.' accelerated recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue over the coming months, rising geopolitical tensions amid surging inflation and increasing Treasury yields have been causing volatility in the stock markets. Consequently, many stocks that are popular with Robinhood investors that gained primarily based on market hype are currently suffering selloffs. Their lofty valuations and poor growth prospects are the primary reasons behind investors’ rotation away from them.
Given their weak fundamentals and growth prospects, popular Robinhood stocks Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), Carnival Corporation (CCL), and BlackBerry Limited (BB) look highly overvalued at the current price levels, according to Wall Street analysts. So, we think they are best avoided now.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",Ohio sues to have Google declared a public utility,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio asked a court on Tuesday to declare Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google a public utility, a step the state's Republican attorney general said would forbid the search and advertising giant from giving preferential treatment to its own products.
""When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access,"" Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement.
The lawsuit, which estimates that Google is used for nearly 90% of internet searches and has 95% of the search share on mobile devices, accuses Google of responding to certain search requests in a way that prioritizes Google's products even if other responses would give better answers.
""Google uses its dominance of internet search to steer Ohioans to Google's own products - that's discriminatory and anti-competitive,"" Yost said.
A Google spokesperson said the company would defend itself in court.
""Google Search is designed to provide people with the most relevant and helpful results. ... Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company. This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law,"" the spokesperson's statement said.
The lawsuit seeks no monetary damages but asks the court to require Google to refrain from prioritizing its own products. It alleges that nearly two-thirds of Google searches in 2020 were done without leaving Google's platform. 

""It often features Google products and services in attractive formats at the top of the Results page above organic search results. Additionally, Google often presents Google products in enhanced ways in the search results that are designed to capture more clicks,"" the lawsuit states. 
The lawsuit was filed in the common pleas court, Delaware County, in Ohio. It is one of several filed by the federal government and state attorneys general against big tech platforms Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

IRS chief Charles Rettig said on Tuesday that Congress needs to provide clear statutory authority for the tax agency to collect information on cryptocurrency transfers valued at over $10,000 that largely go unreported.
Rettig said before the Senate Finance Committee that cryptocurrency market capitalization is over $2 trillion, with more than 8,600 exchanges worldwide. ""By design, most crypto virtual currencies are designed to stay off the radar screen, so we will be challenged right now.""
Earlier a spokesperson for British fund manager Ruffer Investment Management confirmed that it exited its bitcoin bet in April with a $1.1 billion profit amid worries over risk after quick gains in the cryptocurrency's price. 
Ruffer made its bitcoin bet in November, in what was then one of the largest signals of rising institutional interest in the digital currency. By mid-December it was worth around 550 million pounds ($745 million). 
""Long term, we remain interested in digital assets and the role they can play in real wealth preservation,"" the spokesperson said. ""In the short term, following the sharp increase in the bitcoin price, we felt bitcoin was exhibiting more risk.""
Ruffer's bitcoin profit was first reported by The Sunday Times. 
Meanwhile, MicroStrategy Inc, a major bitcoin corporate backer, has increased the size of a junk-bond sale to help buy more bitcoin, now targeting $500 million, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

Bitcoin was last trading at $32,055.20, down 4.5% on the day. It bottomed at $31,025, the lowest price since a shakeout on May 19 dropped it to near $30,000 for the first time since January. 
The cryptocurrency has slumped by half since hitting a record of almost $65,000 in April.

Against this backdrop, we think investing in undervalued growth stocks, such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN),  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), and  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX), should allow investors to maximize returns in the near term. Read on.The United States has one of the world’s fastest recovering economies, with its first quarter GDP (for three months ended March 31) increasing at a 6.4% annualized rate. Solid progress on the vaccination front and impressive job growth have been driving the country’s recovery in the second quarter. According to the back-to-normal index, the United States is currently operating at 91% of its pre-pandemic levels.
Stocks with solid growth attributes are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of this recovery because declining unemployment and rising consumer spending have been driving a substantial rise in corporate sales and profits. The country’s annualized GDP growth expectation of 10.3% in the current quarter (ending June 30) indicates the solid growth prospects of companies that prioritize growth over all else.
However, given that many growth stocks have become expensive now, we think betting on relatively undervalued growth stocks Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN), Energy Transfer LP (ET), and POSCO (PKX) could be highly rewarding.

So, let’s evaluate these names.With the ongoing global economic recovery, investors have been rotating away from expensive tech stocks to stocks that are well-positioned to capitalize on the re-engagement of economic activities. This is evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 7.7% returns so far this year versus SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ETF’s (SPY) 12.9% gains.
However, the tech industry has immense growth potential given continuous technological advancements and increasing adoption of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), by almost all industries. The tech industry is expected to hit a $5 trillion market value by the end of this year. So, we think it could be wise to invest in mid-cap stocks from the tech space because they might hold attractive growth potential, like small-cap stocks, amid the economic recovery, while offering a level of stability similar to large-cap stocks.
We believe mid-cap companies Littelfuse, Inc. (LFUS), Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (KLIC), and Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. (CSOD) have sufficiently solid financials to capitalize on the industry’s growth and the economic recovery. So, shares of these companies could be solid bets now.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",France's Renault charged with deception over dieselgate probe,"PARIS (Reuters) -French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) said on Tuesday that a French court had charged the company with deception over a diesel emissions probe launched in 2017, focused on some of its older vehicles and suspected test manipulations. 
Several carmarkers in Europe have come under scrutiny since the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) ""dieselgate"" scandal which erupted in 2015 over test-cheating in the United States, at a time when regulators are becoming ever tougher on pollution standards. 
Renault denied any wrongdoing. 
""Renault denies having committed any crime, and reiterates that its vehicles are not my any measure equipped with systems that would enable it to cheat in emissions testing,"" the group said in a statement. 
""All Renault vehicles have always been approved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.""
The charges come just as Renault attempts a turnaround under Chief Executive Luca de Meo, who took over last July. 
The group is looking to stay competitive in areas such as electric vehicles, with investments in this area, and wants to focus on its most profitable models, following losses last year. 
Renault's engineering boss Gilles Le Borgne told reporters it was not clear how many of the group's cars were potentially affected by the probe. 
Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had rigged engine software with ""defeat devices"" to cheat U.S. diesel tests, a scandal that has cost the group more than 32 billion euros in fines, refits and legal costs since and reverberated across the industry.
French prosecutors looking into Renault since 2017 - and who also opened a probe into Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, now part of Stellantis - had found that some of its cars produced on-the-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits for some models, according to reports of the investigation from 2019. 
Le Borgne said that the anti-pollution technology known as the ""NOx trap"" in use at the time in cars had known limitations, and only worked in an optimal manner at low speeds. 

""The limits of these anti-pollution systems were linked to the security of our clients and to their own technological and chemicophysical limitations,"" he said on Tuesday.

The discussions are subject to change and it is not clear if agreements with either CATL or BYD will be reached, said the people, who declined to be named as the discussions are private. 
Apple has made building manufacturing facilities in the United States a condition for potential battery suppliers, said two of the sources. 
A senior official in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration confirmed that condition on Tuesday.
""My understanding is that Apple is talking about building advanced battery production factories here, here in the U.S.,"" Jared Bernstein, a senior White House economic adviser, told Reuters.
""That is completely consistent with what the president has talked about in terms of onshoring supply chains particularly in areas where we might grab global market share,"" he said. 
CATL, which supplies major car makers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, is reluctant to build a U.S. factory due to political tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as cost concerns, the two people said.
It was not immediately clear if Apple is also talking to other battery makers.
Apple, which has yet to make a public announcement about its car plans, declined to comment. CATL, the world's biggest automotive battery maker, and BYD, the world's No. 4, also declined to comment.
Shares of BYD closed 6.5% higher in Shenzhen. CATL reversed earlier losses to finish 0.5% higher. 
Apple is in favor of using lithium iron phosphate batteries that are cheaper to produce because they use iron instead of nickel and cobalt which are more expensive, the four people said. 
It has been working on self-driving technology and has targeted 2024 for the production of a passenger vehicle, Reuters reported in December. 
People familiar with the matter have previously said Apple's planned EV could include its own breakthrough battery technology. It was not immediately clear if the discussions with CATL and BYD involved Apple's own technology or designs.
The discussions come at a time when the U.S. government is looking to attract more EV manufacturing. Biden's proposed $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan includes a $174 billion budget to boost the domestic EV market with tax credits and grants for battery manufacturers, among other incentives.
Many battery makers are ramping up production to meet soaring worldwide demand as car makers accelerate their shift to electric vehicles to comply with tougher emission rules aimed at tackling global warming. 

Chinese battery makers are expected to grow at a faster pace than their foreign peers thanks to further expansion of the world's biggest EV market, SNE Research said in a June report. 
Reuters reported last week that CATL is planning a major new automotive battery plant in Shanghai, continuing a blistering pace of expansion that will cement its lead as the world's No. 1 supplier. The factory would be near Tesla's China manufacturing operations.

We think international oil producers and distributors Petróleo Brasileiro (PBR) and PJSC LUKOIL (LUKOY (OTC:LUKOY)) are examples of companies in the sector that are well-positioned to grow in the near term on industry tailwinds. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.,–Petrobras (PBR), is a Brazilian oil and gas refinery and transportation company that operates through four segments—exploration and production; refining; transportation and marketing; gas and power; and corporate and other businesses. PJSC LUKOIL (LUKOY) is a Russian oil and gas exploration and distribution company. It operates in approximately 19 countries through two segments: exploration and production; and refining, marketing and distribution.
On June 4, oil prices surged to hit their 2-year high at $72 per barrel as OPEC and OPEC+ countries agreed to keep their supply cuts in place. The global economic recovery, impressive job growth in the United States, and declining COVID-19 cases in India have led to a steady rise in oil prices over the past few days. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) energy research analysts expect oil prices to rise further if a nuclear agreement is reached between the United States and Iran, owing to an anticipated bullish repricing of the commodity. As the international oil markets gain momentum on the back of rapid economic recovery, both PBR and LUKOY are expected to perform well in the coming months.
Brazil’s higher-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter helped the country to recover its pre-pandemic levels, in turn raising the domestic demand for oil. Russia’s LUKOY, in comparison, is expected to grow substantially due to rising oil prices.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>","Boeing delivers 10 737 MAXs, fewer 787s, in May","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Tuesday it delivered 10 737 MAX jets in May compared with four a month earlier, as the U.S. planemaker works past an electrical issue that cut off a key source of cash earlier this year.
Chicago-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it delivered a total of 17 airplanes to carriers in May, bringing the delivery total for the first five months of the year to 111 aircraft, the latest company data released on Tuesday shows.
In addition to the 10 737 MAX jets, Boeing said it delivered two 787 Dreamliners to airlines in May. Deliveries of the jet were temporarily halted as the Federal Aviation Administration reviewed further analysis and data over production-related flaws.
Boeing's jet deliveries are closely scrutinized by investors because they generate much-needed cash for a company weathering fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and an earlier safety crisis following two 737 MAX crashes. 
Boeing also said it handed over one 747-8 to  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), two 767s and one 777 to rival FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) last month, and booked 73 gross orders.
The gross orders were comprised of 61 737 MAX jets, including a fresh order of 34 from U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, and five 787-9 Dreamliners and one 777 freighter for Germany's Lufthansa. Unnamed buyers ordered six additional 777 freighters.
Bookings for U.S. airlines are expected to rebound this year on the back of speedy COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions after the pandemic caused one of the industry's worst downturns.
Norwegian Air and Mexican airline Aeromexico canceled 48 737 MAX orders in May. 
Net of cancellations and conversions, Boeing booked 20 aircraft orders last month and added 73 orders to its backlog that had previously been removed due to adjustments for stricter accounting standards.

Gross orders for the first five months were 380 airplanes. Net orders after accounting adjustments were 177 aircraft for the same period, Boeing said, up from 84 planes in April.
Boeing said its official backlog grew to 4,121 aircraft orders in May, from 4,045 in April.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.7% Tuesday on positive sentiment created by a very bullish call and reports that the iPhone maker is in talks with Chinese manufacturers for a supply of batteries for its rumored electric car.
Apple could hit a $3 trillion market capitalization next year, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
“We think ultimately 12 to 18 months from now,” Ives told CNBC’s ‘Street Signs Asia’ when asked about a possible timeline to the next milestone.
Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of around $2.11 trillion.
Ives has a target of $185 for the Apple stock, an approximately 27% upside to its current price of $126.77.
The analyst values Apple’s software services business at about $1 trillion and sees it about $1.5 trillion under the $3-trillion valuation scenario.
Moving to news from views, Reuters said the tech giant is holding early discussions with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (SZ:300750) and electric vehicle maker BYD regarding the supply of batteries for its upcoming EV.
The Reuters report said Apple is exploring use of lithium iron phosphate batteries in its planned electric vehicle because they are cheaper to manufacture compared to those that use nickel and cobalt.
CATL is the world’s largest lithium-ion battery manufacturer and plans to build a new major car battery plant in Shanghai."
315,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",Top U.S. Maritime Regulator Sees Shipping Snarls Lasting to 2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks trade and supply chains disrupted by the pandemic. Sign up here.
The top U.S. maritime regulator said stretched global supply chains pushing ocean-freight rates to record highs may stay strained into 2022, raising concerns about whether small American companies can weather another year of a tangled transport system and much higher costs.
“As you see the pandemic lift, I think you’re going to see changes in what’s demanded but demand is going to go up even further,” Dan Maffei, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, said in an interview last week. “If this is primarily a supply and demand issue, then unfortunately it’s going to continue because the supply is limited” and “the demand just keeps on going up.”
U.S. ports are struggling to work through bottlenecks of goods imported on container ships, while the rail and truck networks that disperse them across the country are strained with equipment and labor shortages. The supply snarls are colliding with a surge in demand for goods as the world’s largest economy heads for peak shipping season -- July and August, when retailers build inventories heading into the year-end holidays.
“I definitely think it will hit a ceiling at some point but back-to-school, through the fall, Christmas probably, you’re going to see into 2022 when you finally see a slowdown, and maybe not even then if there’s enough of a backlog,” Maffei said.
He said such a tight market potentially poses medium-term difficulties and is “not a short-term issue.”
Maffei, a former congressman from New York state, said he worries about the effect on smaller U.S. importers and exporters, particularly American agricultural shippers of goods abroad. “If your business model was just based on the very, very low freight rates that we had for many years, then it may be outdated now,” he said.
Asked about inflation, Maffei said it’s “not something we want to see, but it is the market’s way of resolving that -- to a certain extent they will pass that on to their customers.”
Still, “the percentage of the cost of an import that’s based on the ocean transportation cost was small enough that even if you increased that by a couple of fold, you’re still not going to change the price all that much,” he said.
Meanwhile, container carriers that struggled for most of the past decade with overcapacity and losses are facing the opposite now: almost no slack to meet all the demand and soaring profits because they’re able to charge three and four times the pre-pandemic cargo rates.
Record Quarter
The world’s largest private and publicly held container carriers collectively posted record profit of $19.1 billion in the first quarter, more than double the previous all-time high of $9.1 billion set the prior quarter, according to figures compiled by industry veteran John McCown, founder of Blue Alpha Capital.
“We have a system that is at or beyond capacity, pretty much everywhere in the world,” Maffei said. “The carriers have everything they have on the water and still don’t have enough space on the ships for all the demand.”
In Washington, the National Retail Federation cautions that its members are among those bearing the brunt of the problems.
U.S. container ports may have had their busiest month on record in May, the retailers group said on Monday.
“The disruption issues are leading to significant additional costs for businesses and delays in getting products to consumers,” said Jonathan Gold, the industry group’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. “Most of these costs are not being passed to the consumer given the current economy, further impacting the economic recovery of retailers both large and small.”
Maffei, an FMC (NYSE:FMC) commissioner whom President Joe Biden designated as chairman in late March, said a lot of companies are complaining to the FMC about the surge in charges.
“It’s not for us to decide whether it’s fair or not unless they arrived at that through some unreasonable means like artificially limiting supply,” he said. “Frankly, there’s nothing we can do about it because our law doesn’t allow us to.”

Coffee chains had been encouraging the use of reusable cups and thermos flasks to lower their carbon footprint before the health crisis forced them to shift to disposables last year.
The rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States has, however, allowed restaurants to restart dining rooms and apparel sellers such as Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) to reopen their fitting rooms. 

Starbucks said it would also adopt a contactless method that would eliminate any shared touchpoints between its baristas and customers bringing their personal cups.
Last week, the coffee chain announced it would offer reusable cups in stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa by 2025.

318,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>","Forget SemiLEDs, Buy These 3 Taiwanese Semiconductor Stocks Instead","Shares of Taiwanese semiconductor company SemiLEDs (LEDS) appear to be significantly overvalued at their current price level considering the company’s weak financials. So, investors seeking to invest in Taiwanese semiconductor stocks could instead consider United Microelectronics (UMC), Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX), and ChipMOS (IMOS). We think these three companies possess sound financials and are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Read on for details.Headquartered in Chunan, Taiwan, SemiLEDs Corporation (LEDS) is one of the popular players in the semiconductor space. It manufactures ultra-high brightness light emitting diode (LED) chips with fabrication facilities. The stock has been on a roll, gaining 688.3% over the past year to close yesterday’s trading session at $24.20 after hitting its 52-week high of $31.44.
LEDS’ revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $1.21 million for its fiscal second quarter, ended February 28. However, the company’s net loss for the quarter came in at $254 million compared to $707 million loss in the prior-year period. Its loss per share was $0.06 compared to $0.17 in the year-ago period. But,despite the company’s unimpressive financials, its stock is currently trading at an expensive valuation. In terms of trailing-12-month Price-to-Book ratio, LEDS’ 61.90x is 1,116.1% higher than the 5.09x industry average. And the stock’s 18.52x trailing-12-month EV/S is 301.7% higher than the 4.61X industry average. So, we think LEDS could witness a retreat in the near term. However, there are several other Taiwanese semiconductor stocks that appear to be better investment options now.
Taiwan is known for having a significant market share in the global semiconductor space. With the growing adoption of advanced technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), and the increasing demand for chips across various industries, such as automotive and electronics, the industry is expected to continue benefiting in the coming months. According to a report published by Taiwan News in May 2021, Taiwan is expected to grow 11.4% in 2021 and will contribute to 10.9% growth of the global semiconductor market. So, we think it could be wise to bet on Taiwan-based semiconductor companies United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Himax Technologies, Inc. (HIMX), and ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (IMOS). Their valuations appear to be in sync with their impressive growth prospects.

Shares are up more than 3%.
Images of the ""Pizza Crusher, Pizza Slayzer and giant Noid Balloon Blockade"" are available for sale on rarible.com over the course of a 14-day auction, apparently to ""fund future schemes."" 
In a statement (that seems to be an attempt at humor) Domino's asks that people not buy the NFTs. 
""This NFT collection – more aptly called Noid's Failed Tools – may look cleverly-designed, even down to the Noid's unique signature emblazoned on each tool, but don't be fooled by the devious creature's ulterior motives,"" the company said. 
""We saw the Noid fans on Twitter asking how they could get a Pizza Crusher. We get it, it looks pretty fun,"" said Kate Trumbull, Domino's vice president of advertising. ""But who knows what pesky ideas the Noid will be able to fund with the proceeds from the NFT sale? It's just best that everyone steers clear.""
The Noid has not yet revealed to what the proceeds will go, but apparently he is considering things like ""new and improved gadgets, ingenious disguises, or maybe an autobiography. There's even been speculation that the Noid is plotting to hop on TikTok later this week to continue its foolish antics.""

The company said prime members would get additional savings when paying without insurance. Customers can pay as low as $1 per month for select medications, including drugs to treat diabetes and blood pressure, and will get free two-day delivery. 
The e-commerce giant launched an online pharmacy in November for delivering prescription medications in the United States and stirring up competition with drug retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Shares of pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers fell in morning trading as Amazon's launch of online pharmacies has been a threat to brick-and-mortar pharmacies at a time when e-commerce has surged due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Shares of Walgreens and CVS were down 1.2% each, and those of drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) fell 1% and 1.7%, respectively. 
Amazon is also looking at launching physical pharmacies in the United States, the Insider reported last month.
Under the new offering, customers can search for their medication by name and find out if it's eligible for a six-month supply and what the price it will be when using the Prime prescription savings benefit, the company said. 
It added that the supplies would be available only for customers who have a prescription from their healthcare providers. 

Amazon has been trying to enter the pharmacy market since its 2018 acquisition of PillPack, which is a platform used by customers who need pre-sorted doses of multiple drugs. 
Rival Walgreens offers free same-day and next-day delivery options for drugs.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>",Wall Street grapples with new SPAC equity contracts after regulator crackdown,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street accountants and lawyers are trying to figure out new equity agreements to lure investors back to the blank-check company market after the U.S. regulator cracked down on the use of warrants, six industry executives told Reuters. 
They are discussing jettisoning warrants issued by special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in favor of rights agreements, or dramatically restructuring the warrants after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said many SPAC equity warrants should be considered liabilities. 
The SEC's surprise April announcement ground an already-slowing SPAC market to a halt as accountants and lawyers scrambled to figure out a fix with SEC staff, the people said. 
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise cash to acquire and take public a private company, allowing targets to sidestep the stricter regulatory checks of an initial public offering.
""There are ongoing discussions between the auditing firms, the companies pressure-testing the SEC's views,"" said David Brown, an attorney with Alston & Bird LLP. ""Certainly those companies that haven't IPO-ed yet are looking for potential workarounds.""
SPACs typically offer common stock with warrants attached when listing. While some star SPAC sponsors have been able to forego warrants, most view the contracts as a key way to entice early investors who may have to lock up their cash for years.
The contracts grant SPAC sponsors and outside investors the right to buy common stock in the new entity created by the merger at a pre-agreed price, an attractive offer if the stock price rises. They also offer customized terms including anti-dilution protections and other provisions that mitigate potential losses. 
But the SEC has taken issue with them in part because they often give some investors such as SPAC sponsors a better deal than public investors, the sources said. Retail investors in particular may struggle to understand the warrants' complex terms or be unaware when they can redeem them, the SEC said.
Changing the classification means greater quarterly costs for the SPACs while they seek out targets and offers greater visibility into the fluctuations of their potential debts, sources said. 
And warrants commonly have intricate pricing terms and provisions entitling holders to potential cash-payouts that are also more characteristic of debt than equity, the SEC said. 
""The SEC may have been concerned sponsors were being enriched to a greater degree than other investors,"" said Jeffrey Weiner, chief executive of auditor Marcum LLP, which handles over 40% of SPAC audit work, according to data from SPACInsider.
A record $100 billion was raised by U.S. SPACs from the start of 2021 to March, according to data from Dealogic, when the market started to flag amid mounting regulatory scrutiny. There were 298 SPAC IPOs in the United States in the first three months of the year, but just 32 in April and May, according to data from Dealogic. 
The SEC's new stance means SPACs, instead of making a one-time equity valuation, would have to account quarterly for the warrants as debt, a costly process that will potentially make them less attractive to targets and other investors. 
Restructuring the contracts post-IPO is complex and many SPACs in that phase have few options but to reclassify the warrants as liabilities on their books, which many have done, according to accountants and public filings.
""Doing this assessment every quarter can be time consuming and costly,"" said Angela Veal, a managing director with accounting firm EisnerAmper LLP.
ALTERNATIVE CONTRACTS
Sponsors looking to launch a SPAC IPO may have more options, said the Wall Street accountants and lawyers. They are trying to figure out an alternative instrument that would provide similar economic benefits as warrants and meet equity accounting treatment. 
Rights agreements, equity contracts that also give investors the right to buy shares at a set price and date, are one alternative being considered, said Weiner and others. 
Such contracts are commonly used by European companies to raise capital by offering shareholders a right to buy more stock, but it may not be possible customize rights agreements as tightly as warrants to mitigate investor risks, the people said. 
Some pre-IPO SPAC sponsors are removing or tweaking the loss-mitigation provisions and complex pricing terms in a bid to satisfy the equity accounting rules, a move that may make it harder to woo early investors, according to filings and the industry executives interviewed by Reuters. 
The discussions between the industry and the SEC are ongoing the people said and it was unclear the rights agreements or simpler warrant terms will fully address the SEC's concerns. 
An SEC spokesperson said agency staff ""continue to make themselves available to consult on ... accounting questions to facilitate capital formation and protect investors."" 
In the meantime, some SPACs focused on hot sectors are striking the warrants altogether. Last week, for example, venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya launched four biotech SPACs without warrants, in what is likely to be a major test of investor appetite. 

Industry executives hope finding new terms or something to replace warrants will provide a jolt to the flagging SPAC market.
""It'll pick up again, but not the same pace it was,"" Marcum's Weiner said.

However, with U.S. regulators monitoring for signs of manipulation and violations of market rules, it is less likely that these stocks will witness a GameStop-like short squeeze. Given that meme stock rallies are simply the result of speculation by amateur investors, the momentum in these stocks is expected to fizzle out soon. So, that is in-part why Wall Street analysts are extremely bearish on popular meme stocks AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (GME), and Blackberry (TSX:BB), and expect them to tumble 40% or more in the near term. Read on to lean more.It appears that day traders have regained their zest for meme stocks as cryptocurrency continues to wobble, with prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)—two of the most popular cryptocurrencies—plunging since May. While meme stocks are in the spotlight again, as evidenced by AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.’s (AMC) 95% rally on June 2, Wall Street analysts believe substantial declines in these stocks are looming.
The rally is doubtless being fueled by a bout of speculative trading by retail investors who are active on subreddit forum r/wallstreetbets. However, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission has been observing markets and looking for any more signs of misconduct and manipulation as the hype continues to drive a big rally in meme stocks. Amid the Reddit-fueled volatility, we think it is important that investors avoid FOMO (fear of Missing out) and stay focused on companies that can produce long-term values.
Wall Street analysts believe AMC Entertainment Holding (AMC),  GameStop Corp . (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) are highly speculative investment bets given that the meme stock rally is expected to end just as quickly as it began. Their poor long-term growth prospects and weak fundamentals could lead to the stocks suffer a pullback at any time.

Read more to find out.Founded in 1903, leading auto manufacturer Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) operates through three segments—automotive, mobility, and Ford Credit. The company’s recent, high-profile launches of its Mustang Mach-E SUV, all-new 2021 F-150 pickup and Bronco Sport SUV, as well as the introduction of its all-new 2022 F-150 Lightning Pro have helped the stock gain 34.4% over the past month and 80.7% so far this year.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 10:50AM ET</span>","Berkshire leads $750 million Nubank funding round, values it at $30 billion","By Carolina Mandl
(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc invested $500 million in Brazil's Nubank, giving the fast-growing fintech a big vote of confidence as it seeks to widen its footprint across Latin America.
Nubank, best known as a credit card issuer, also said it raised an additional $250 million from a series of other investors. 
The new investments give Nubank a $30 billion valuation, up from $25 billion at the time of its previous fundraising round, according to a source familiar with the situation. That would make the upstart bank worth just slightly less than  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, Brazil's No. 3 bank, which has more than 2,000 branches.
The transaction also vaults Nubank into the upper echelons of fintechs worldwide, on a par with brokerage startup Robinhood Markets Inc and China's Lufax but still far behind Ant Group.
Nubank, which has 40 million clients, said in a statement it plans to use the proceeds to fund its international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, launch new products and services and hire more employees.
The arrival of such high-profile investors, who usually invest in publicly traded companies, gives a hint on how close Nubank is to a listing.
Earlier in April, Reuters reported that Nubank had initiated preparations for a U.S. stock market listing which could come as early as this year, according to sources familiar with the matter.
BERKSHIRE BETS IN BRAZIL
Nubank is Warren Buffett's second bet on a Brazilian financial startup. His Berkshire Hathaway also acquired a stake in payments company StoneCo Ltd almost three years ago, when it went public.
A highly concentrated financial market, in which the five top lenders hold almost 78% of the country's total assets, Brazil has been a hotbed for fintech growth. Online banking has reduced costs for newcomers and the central bank has created new rules to encourage competition, aiming at lower fees and interest rates for consumers. 

Nubank's $750 million new funding round is part of its series G fundraising round, which totaled $1.15 billion. An initial part of the series G round was announced in January.
Other participants in the round included Sands Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, MSA Capital, Advent's Sunley House Capital and Brazilian asset managers Verde Asset Management and Absoluto Partners.

Investing.com – Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) topped up previous session’s 32% gains with more than 60% jump during Tuesday's session as the retail trading mania, driven by Reddit chat groups, continues to expand the list of meme stocks.
Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN), another addition, was also up 14%.
What apparently started with GameStop (NYSE:GME) in December as seemingly a fun activity for the Reddit gang has now expanded to include AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and others with some serious billions at play.
WallStreetBets is the most popular Reddit forum and has more than 10 million members driving each other to take on the Wall Street giants who are short on a stock. Short sellers expect a stock to go down.
It’s the Reddit retail frenzy that has led AMC shares to rise 3,700% in less than a year.
A short squeeze could be behind the surge in Clover Health, which has 32.7% of its float sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. When a heavily shorted stock suddenly jumps higher, it is usually because short sellers are forced to buy back shares to cover their positions to cut losses.
Clover Health is a Medicare insurance start-up that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya’s SPAC.

About a third of institutional traders surveyed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said they’re embracing ETFs more in the wake of the March 2020 stock collapse, which sparked a deleveraging wave like no other across the financial system.
Of 40 respondents, 85% said the liquidity of products is their key selling point. Nearly nine in 10 plan to use them to the same degree or more this year.
But despite the full-throated endorsement from the likes of hedge funds and private-equity firms, concerns that ETFs are distorting markets prove remarkably enduring.
Virtually all professional traders said these typically passive products have “a meaningful impact” on share prices and trading volumes -- with 83% saying they’re creating volatility.
“Institutional investors are increasingly more focused on the impact of ETFs on the underlying equities,” according to the survey published this week.
The likes of Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, have long warned that passive investing is creating an unsustainable bubble in asset prices. And while it’s notoriously difficult to precisely pinpoint the impact of passive flows on stock prices, academics have found links. For example, a 2014 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded stocks held by a substantial number of ETFs were more volatile than equities that weren’t.
Defenders point to the fact that the cohort are still too small to push around the stock market. In the Americas, exchange-traded products represent just a fifth of all assets held in funds, while in Europe, that proportion falls to 7%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Still, passive flows have clearly made waves in certain corners of the stock market. Earlier this year, overseers of the S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Clean Energy Index expanded the gauge after ETFs tracking the benchmark started owning ever-bigger stakes in a limited number of companies. That risked giving them too much power over prices and raised liquidity risks especially in a selloff.
A similar issue plagued an index of gold mining companies after ETFs tracking the sector swelled their holdings to the kind of stakes usually associated with large institutional or activist investors.
In a surprising conclusion, the survey found that just 3% of respondents used ETFs tracking ESG themes, while only 8% planned to do so in the future. That comes even as inflows into equity-focused ESG ETFs are on track this year to break 2020’s record of $31.1 billion.
“Perhaps much of the growth in ESG ETFs has been in the retail market,” the survey’s authors conclude.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Tesla Inc sold 33,463 China-made electric cars in May, including exports, a 29% jump from April, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) on Tuesday. China's new electric vehicle sales surged 177% to 185,000 cars in May from a year earlier, CPCA said. Overall passenger vehicle sales, however, rose just 1.1% to 1.66 million cars.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s China sales - accounting for nearly a third of its total sales - is closely watched as a sign of the U.S. company's health in its second biggest market, where the company has invested heavily and often changed its own marketing playbook to attract customers.
Tesla, which makes its Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, exported 11,527 China-made vehicles in May. 
In April, it sold 25,845 China-made cars, down from 35,478 in March.
Tesla's Model 3 sedans were the best-selling electric vehicles in the country before they were overtaken by a much cheaper micro EV made by the joint venture between General Motors (NYSE:GM) and SAIC Motor. The U.S. company is also facing rising competition in China from conventional EV companies such as BYD and startups including Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng Inc.
CPCA said it expects China to sell 2.4 million electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles this year. 
Tesla is also facing scrutiny in China over its handling of customer complaints regarding quality issues.

Last month, Reuters reported that staff at some Chinese government offices were told not to park their Tesla cars inside government compounds due to security concerns about cameras installed on the vehicles.
In response, Tesla is trying to boost its engagement with regulators and is beefing up its government relations team, sources said. It has set up a data centre in China to store data locally and plans to open a data platform for customers.

Tesla sold 33,463 China-made electric vehicles in May, including 21,936 units in local sales and exports of 11,527. Domestic sales were 11,671 units in April.
The total jump in sales was 29% from April, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed.
China is Tesla’s second-largest market, representing almost one third of the carmaker’s total sales. For Tesla, China is not only a production hub for its cars but also a major source of several inputs that go into making its models elsewhere.
The electric vehicle maker faces competition in China from a joint venture of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and SAIC Motor (SS:600104) and new players such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng.

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) -Qatar Airways said on Tuesday the surface below the paint on some of its Airbus A350s was deteriorating faster than expected and insisted it would not take more deliveries of the carbon-composite widebody jet until the problem was resolved.
The Gulf carrier has fallen out with the European planemaker, warning last week that Airbus faced ""industrial repercussions"" if it failed to resolve the dispute, while until now giving few details of the discussions.
""Qatar Airways continues to experience and has witnessed a condition in which the surface below the paint on some of its Airbus A350 aircraft has been degrading at an accelerated rate,"" an airline spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.
The airline has grounded some A350s ""until the condition and root cause can be understood and corrected,"" the spokesperson said, without disclosing how many aircraft were affected.
""Qatar Airways will require this condition and its underlying root cause to be fully understood and corrected before the delivery of any further Airbus A350 aircraft.” 
Qatar Airways also said it was inspecting its entire A350 fleet more frequently to observe the condition closely. 
An Airbus spokesperson said the company was always in talks with its customers but that such talks were confidential. 
The Gulf airline is the largest customer for Europe's latest long-haul jet and has taken delivery of 53 out of 76 on order.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker last week urged the Airbus board to intervene in the dispute. Airbus and Qatar have extensive business ties in both civil and defence and two sources said broader issues were also at stake in the row.
WORLD CUP JET
Qatar Airways has periodically criticised Airbus or its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) for delays or quality lapses.
The airline says its exacting standards reflect its premium brand, although aerospace executives have accused it of seizing on such details in the past to delay taking deliveries or gain leverage in other negotiations, a suggestion it has denied.
Many airlines have adjusted deliveries due to the pandemic-related travel downturn. Qatar Airways said in June 2020 it would not take Boeing or Airbus jets in 2020 or 2021 and later that year said it had reached a deal on schedules with Airbus. 
The latest dispute also shines a spotlight on the fate of a four-year-old Qatar Airways A350 that has been sitting in Toulouse since January, after initially being sent by the airline to Ireland to be repainted in World Cup 2022 livery.
Two industry sources said problems had emerged when the old paint was stripped away, triggering discussions over whether it was a one-off repair problem or evidence of deeper issues. 
The plane was then sent to a contractor in Toulouse that paints new jets on behalf of Airbus but also works for airlines on existing jets, which need to be repainted every six years. It has remained there since Jan. 5, according to tracking data.
A spokesman for the contractor, France-based Satys Group, said there was no disagreement between Satys and Qatar Airways but declined further comment.
Airbus said it does not comment on customer operations.

Painting an aircraft is costly and technically demanding. 
It takes 20 workers eight days to paint an A350, whose skin must cope with temperatures between -55 degrees Celsius when flying to 40 degrees on the ground in hot climates like the Gulf, according to a Virgin Atlantic post about a larger A350 model.

Investing.com --  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) shares looked set for a positive opening Tuesday after several brokerages upgraded their price target for the stock following its strong sales guidance.
For the fiscal year ending at the end of next month, Stitch estimates net revenue between $2.07 billion-$2.08 billion, a growth of 20.9%-21.5% year-on-year.
Adjusted EBITDA is seen in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
The shares were 14% higher in premarket trading with at least eight brokerages upping targets though the range is wide.
Truist Securities’s $77 target was the highest. At $27, Morgan Stanley's is the lowest and less than half of the stock’s closing price of $57.94 on Monday.
In Q3, the company booked $536 million in net revenue, reflecting 44% year-over-year growth. Active client count grew to more than 4.1 million, reflecting 20% year-over-year growth and the company’s second highest quarter-over-quarter additions ever.
Net loss of $18.83 million was just over half of $34.68 million for the quarter ended May 2, 2020.
Net revenue per active client fell 3% year-on-year to $481.
Wells Fargo noted that while the narrower-than-expected loss was a vast improvement, sales growth and revenue per client number weren’t impressive. Notwithstanding its reservations, Wells Fargo lifted its one-year target for the stock to $35 from $27.

The move brings the carrier's total orders for the MAX 7 to 234. (https:// Shares of Southwest were up 1.1% at $58.92 in premarket trading, while Boeing rose 1.4%.  Bookings for U.S. airlines are expected to rebound this year on the back of speedy COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions after the pandemic caused one of the industry's worst downturns in 2020. Southwest said it expected revenue to continue to improve in June, driven mainly by leisure travel.  It also tightened its second-quarter average core cash burn forecast to between $1 million and $2 million per day, compared with the previous range of $1 million to $3 million per day. 
But the company said that weak business travel, which has lagged a recovery in leisure demand, would continue to impact its fares in the second quarter.  Reuters last month reported that Boeing had drawn up preliminary plans for a fresh sprint in 737 MAX output to as many as 42 jets a month in fall 2022, in a bid to extend its recovery from overlapping safety and COVID-19 crises.

Investing.com -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares were up more than 1% in Tuesday’s premarket following a fresh order Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) placed with it for 34 units of 737 MAX planes.
The move lifts the carrier's firm orders for the MAX 7 aircraft in 2022 to 234 planes.
The order is further endorsement of Boeing’s narrow body 737 MAX. An electrical issue had kept some 100 units of the plane grounded for an extended period and the manufacturer secured the regulator’s approval less than a month for its clients to fly them again.
Southwest on Tuesday also tightened its second-quarter average core cash burn forecast to between $1 million and $2 million per day, compared with the $1 million-$3 million given earlier.
""Passenger demand and booking trends remain primarily leisure-oriented,"" it said in its investor update.
The company reiterated its expectation of revenues improving in June from a month earlier, driven by higher leisure passenger traffic and fares."

Yet over two days in late May, the ETF more than doubled to $2 billion -- and it’s already added another $120 million in June.
The iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy exchange-traded fund (NASDAQ:COMT) is one of many raw-materials products enjoying a boom as investors ride an economic recovery from the coronavirus.
Funds tracking specific sectors including energy, industrials and precious metals have long experienced hot money flows like this. Now demand for broad-based commodity funds is surging to an unprecedented degree this year amid the global economic re-opening, with $7.3 billion of allocations to take assets to $17 billion overall.
“People are seeing that commodities are waking up, and ETFs are a popular way to get exposure to them for those who don’t have direct access to, say, the futures market,” said Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “This year, we’ve seen a lot of previous laggards finally show up” in the ETF market, he said.
These include other sectors exposed to an economic resurgence, such as value and small-cap stocks and emerging markets.
Growing expectations for a global recovery from the pandemic and rebounding demand for raw materials are taking hold just as supply constraints kick in. At the same time, the sector is seen as one of the few investments that can thrive in an inflationary regime.
Commodities could be in the “early innings” of a larger upward move, according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director and head of alternative investments at Direxion Funds. The firm’s Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF (NYSE:COM) has more than trebled in assets this year to $206 million.
“A lot of our investors are looking for areas where there’s still opportunity and also something that doesn’t completely correlate to stocks and bonds,” Egilinsky said. “They’re worried about reflation and want to have something in the portfolio that potentially could benefit during a period where you might see rising inflation.”
Those familiar with the historic ebbs and flows of commodities will be viewing the fund rush with caution, especially as it corresponds to massive flows for ETFs in general.

Meanwhile, a big reason that retail investors have avoided broad commodity ETFs in the past is because of costs associated with rolling futures contracts out month-to-month. That’s not an issue now, with nearer-term contracts trading at a premium to later ones, but will become a barrier when the dynamic eventually flips.
“We’ve seen these types of short-term breakouts in these areas before, and they tend to go right back,” Balchunas said. “It’s very possible this is a new regime change, where commodities and value really lead the way, as growth and tech take a back seat. But it can go either way.”

352,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Samsung bets on Europe 5G orders to grow network equipment business,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics is banking on Europe to maintain growth momentum in its network equipment business, a senior executive said, as 5G rollout widens and industry leader Huawei Technologies of China focuses on its domestic market.
Although the South Korean tech company is global No. 1 in memory chips and smartphones, in 5G network equipment it ranks fifth behind Huawei, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and ZTE (HK:0763) based on the latest four quarters, with a 10-15% market share in the first quarter of 2021, according to market research firm Dell'Oro Group.
But as Samsung (KS:005930) landed a $6.6 billion deal with U.S. telecoms company Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in September, followed by a deal with Japan's NTT Docomo (OTC:DCMYY) in March, ""impressions have changed"", Woojune Kim, executive vice president of Samsung's networks business, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Samsung is currently conducting 5G trials with European telecom companies such as Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) in the Czech Republic, Play Communications in Poland and another major European firm, Kim said. 
Besides Europe, Samsung is also looking to expand in markets such as India, Australia and Southeast Asia, he added. 
The network equipment business is small currently for Samsung, which had revenue of 236.8 trillion won ($212.50 billion) for 2020. It does not announce separate numbers for the business and most analysts don't have estimates for it.
Samsung said since the 5G network rollouts began in 2019 in various countries, it has seen the number of new clients for its 5G equipments and systems rise by 35% a year on average.
In addition to 5G rollouts, U.S. pressure on its allies to exclude Huawei from 5G systems has provided opportunities for its competitors to expand market share.
Samsung is touting its virtualised RAN (radio access network) technology, or software that allows telecom companies to freely use off-the-shelf network equipment in various combinations to connect users to networks, saving costs and providing flexibility. 
Verizon has adopted this technology for 5G RAN, while in South Korea, all operators' 5G core networks are virtualised, Samsung said, with the country's very heavy use of online services like e-commerce and food delivery compared to population size serving as a benchmark. 
Samsung's goal is to become top-three in the 5G network equipment business, Kim said. However, Kim did not give a timeframe, citing the industry's long incubation time. 

""It took us about a decade to win the Verizon deal, since forming early relationships... It takes persistence,"" he said.

LIMA/SANTIAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Peru's market and mining watchers are wary of a presidential election victory for socialist Pedro Castillo, who was building a narrow lead on Monday, but see a potential silver lining: a sharply split vote could hinder his plans for dramatic reforms.
The leftist candidate has rattled miners and investors since a surprise win in the first-round vote in April, pledging to tear up Peru's decades-old constitution and take up to 70% of profits from firms mining in the country's copper-rich Andes.
On Monday the former teacher and union leader held a razor-thin, though growing, lead https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-awakes-uncertain-future-with-polarized-vote-knife-edge-2021-06-07 over his market-friendly conservative rival Keiko Fujimori in the run-off vote. The country's sol currency and equities sank https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-could-face-capital-flight-if-castillo-clinches-presidency-jpmorgan-2021-06-07.
A final tally may take days to arrive and there could be challenges to the results.
""The only positive factor - even if Castillo wins - is that the result of the election shows you that the country is very divided,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Asset Management.
""And with a divided congress it will be very hard for him to implement structural and disruptive reforms.""
Whoever wins the presidential vote, Peru will have a deeply fragmented legislature with ten diverse political parties, none of whom hold a majority. Castillo's Free Peru socialists will have the largest bloc, followed by Fujimori's conservatives.
Peru's congress has relished clashing with the presidency in the past. Last year, it pushed through a controversial impeachment process against then-President Martin Vizcarra that forced him to step down and sparked deadly protests.
Mining firm executives in the country stayed mostly quiet on Monday as they waited for the final outcome.
Roque Benavides, chief executive of local miner Buenaventura, told Reuters that miners could agree to things like voluntary contributions to finance local infrastructure projects but more drastic measures like nationalizations would derail investments.
""I think that neither of the two candidates can impose their position and therefore I think that the idea of them making dramatic, drastic changes is very debatable,"" he said.
Francisco Acuña, a Santiago-based analyst at mining consultancy CRU, said it was quite likely the new government would need to negotiate and reach consensus with companies.
""It is evident that the country is torn. Whoever wins, the margin will be minimal,"" he said. 
(Graphics : Peru's stocks, currency rattled by election - https://graphics.reuters.com/PERU-ELECTION/MINING/ygdpzxkompw/chart_eikon.jpg) 
RADICAL CHANGES
Gustavo Medeiros, deputy head of research at emerging market-focused fund manager Ashmore Group, said that a Fujimori presidency would bring less risks of ""populism"" than Castillo, though there was much still unknown about the leftist.
""Whoever wins is going to have to govern with a very fragmented congress and that is going to complicate any radical structural legislative changes,"" he said, adding that market weakness from a Castillo win could create a buying opportunity.
Castillo said in a statement on Monday evening that if confirmed as president he would respect the central bank's authority and that he was not planning nationalizations or expropriations, but added a tax overhaul on mining was needed to help pay for planned healthcare and education reforms.
Julio Ruiz, chief economist for Mexico and Peru at Brazilian bank Itau, said a win for Fujimori - who has pledged to keep in place market-friendly policies that underpinned Peru's economic growth in recent decades - would be more positive for markets.
A win for Castillo, said Ruiz, could lead to pressure on the exchange rate and raise the probability that the central bank would hike rates before the end of the year to avoid inflationary pressures.
Alejo Czerwonko, Chief Investment Officer for Emerging Markets Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said a Castillo win would lead to a sell-off in Peruvian assets, though he faced challenges turning his rhetoric into reality.

""Whether he manages to deliver will depend on how well he navigates the institutional constraints he will face given his party only enjoys 42 out of the 130 seats in congress,"" he said.
""Key to watch is whether he is successful in his attempt to push for a constitutional reform.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday in subdued trading, with investors cautious ahead of the release of key inflation data later in the week. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4% on Monday, the broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed, gaining 0.5%.
This continued the tight trading ranges the major averages have endured this month to date, with investors seemingly reluctant to take major positions ahead of the release of the latest inflation numbers on Thursday, one of the few remaining major pieces of economic data ahead of the next Fed meeting on June 15-16.
Economists are expecting the May CPI to rise 4.7% from a year earlier, according to Investing.com, a jump from April’s 4.2%, which was the fastest rise since 2008.
Fed officials have called these inflation levels temporary that will ebb as special factors fade away, but analysts at Deutsche Bank have warned of the dangers if the central bank delays chooses inaction for too long.
“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said, in a note. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”
In corporate news, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) could be in the spotlight with the U.S. cloud computing services provider experiencing a technical issue. This could be behind the outage that a number of global news websites including the FT, New York Times and Bloomberg have suffered.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) could also be in focus after the biotech’s stock gained almost 40% Monday on the back of the FDA approving its groundbreaking Alzheimer’s drug, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced the departure of a key executive late Monday. 
Crude oil prices weakened again Tuesday, as the rally that took prices to multi-year highs faltered.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.7% at $68.73 a barrel, after touching $70 for the first time since October 2018. Brent was down 0.8% at $70.94, after previously hitting $72.26, the highest since May 2019.
The market is watching for any progress between Iran and world powers to revive a nuclear deal, with discussions entering a decisive phase, according to the agency monitoring Tehran’s atomic sites.
A successful conclusion could include Washington lifting economic sanctions on Iranian oil exports, potentially resulting in 500,000 to 1 million barrels of crude per day reentering the global market.
Later in the session, traders will be keeping an eye on the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly estimates of U.S. crude supplies.

ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Russia's top airline Aeroflot is restoring Soviet-era routes hoping that direct flights which bypass traditional hubs help increase traffic amid closed borders, CEO Mikhail Poluboyarinov told Reuters. 
Like many other airlines globally, Aeroflot received a cash injection from the government, its controlling shareholder, last year to support it through the pandemic. 
The company is now talking to the government about issuing state-guaranteed debt, Poluboyarinov said in an interview, and is adding new domestic routes so people can fly between cities including resorts avoiding hubs such as Moscow. 
""We made big steps to adjust our route network. Aeroflot refreshed Soviet practise, its Soviet network... almost all the fleet is now busy,"" he said. 
Over 80% of Aeroflot's seats are now taken while Pobeda, its low-cost unit, has a 98-99% load factor. 
Despite starting to recover from last year when Aeroflot lost more than half of its traffic and fell to a 123.2 billion rouble ($1.7 billion) loss, Poluboyarinov does not expect its passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2024. 
""Even if we get all permissions, who knows how many people would fly? The pandemic is still there. The re-opening of international flights depends on collective immunity... Vaccines should be mutually approved,"" he said.

Aeroflot, which operates 334 passenger planes, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, is slightly delaying the delivery of new jets it ordered before the pandemic, Poluboyarinov said, facing no penalties as ""everyone accepts and understands"" the current circumstances.

The London-listed company said it expected revenue growth of more than 5% at constant currencies, above its previous range of 3% to 5% for the year to December. It stuck to its growth expectation for adjusted earnings per share in the mid-single digit range.
The maker of Lucky Strike and Newport cigarettes said its ""new category"" reduced risk products had gained share in all key markets, including the United States and Japan, with the company adding 1.4 million new customers in the first quarter. 
The company, which sells Vuse e-cigarettes and glo tobacco heating products, said users of its new category products now totaled 14.9 million.
""The upgrade and delivery around reduced risk products is particularly encouraging"", Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Owen Bennett wrote.
BAT (LON:BATS)'s comments show more customers in the United States are switching to e-cigarettes before a possible U.S. ban on menthol cigarettes and flavoured cigars.
BAT said it expected its full-year sales volumes to show a better performance than the broader industry, which is expected to see a 3% slide this year. BAT said it expected sales to be boosted by a recovery in markets such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
The outlook for the U.S. industry volumes remained unclear, BAT said, blaming ""macro-economic and fiscal"" uncertainties.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 06:12AM ET</span>",Ford to offer new Maverick compact pickup standard as hybrid,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday its new Maverick compact pickup truck will have a gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain as standard equipment, a technology choice aimed at keeping the vehicle's starting price below $20,000.
Ford expects the hybrid version of the 2022 Maverick to make up about 40% of demand when it goes on sale this fall and the technology was critical to hitting the targeted starting price, Jim Baumbick, Ford's vice president in charge of product planning, said in an interview. A gasoline-powered engine will be sold as an option.
""We see it certainly consistent with our strategy of leaning into electrification,"" he said. ""Hybrid is a step and you've seen a lot of the work that we're doing and all of our investments going into battery electric as kind of a continuum of improving fuel economy.""
Ford and other global automakers are racing to shift their gas-powered lineups to all electric under pressure from regions like Europe and China to cut vehicle emissions. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is moving to reverse former President Donald Trump's rollback of vehicle-emission standards.
Last month, Ford boosted the money it plans to invest by 2030 on EVs by more than a third to about $30 billion and said it aimed to have 40% of its global vehicle volume all electric by then. 
The No. 2 U.S. automaker also confirmed it will develop two dedicated EV platforms, one for full-size trucks and SUVs, the other for cars and smaller SUVs. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has said it aspires to halt U.S. sales of gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, and was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years.
Ford said there are no current plans for an electric Maverick, although IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley expects it could be added down the road as Ford develops dedicated EV platforms. Maverick will use the first Ford-developed electric motor.
The hybrid version will get 40 miles per gallon in the city and offer 191 horsepower, Ford said. It did not disclose the fuel efficiency of the gas-powered model, which will have 250 horsepower.

Brinley said only time will tell whether relying on hybrids during the transition to EVs is the right move for companies like Ford and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, but it will take a couple decades for the market to shift to all electric and in the meantime hybrids help reduce vehicle emissions.
The four-door Maverick, which will be built at Ford's plant in Hermosillo, Mexico is meant to draw new buyers as the company's latest entry-level vehicle. However, analysts expect the base model to be a rare sight on dealer lots, with $25,000 more likely what consumers pay after adding options.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",China pushes new candidate towards top of Huarong Asset Management,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking watchdog named Liang Qiang, an asset management veteran, to the senior post of deputy communist party boss at China Huarong Asset Management Co, the state-run firm that has faced restructuring, the company said on Tuesday.
Liang, now president of state-owned Great Wall Asset Management, was also recommended for the position of Huarong's president and executive director, the company statement said, citing a meeting of executives on June 4.
Liang's appointment to the post was read out by an official from the watchdog, China Banking and Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), at the June 4 meeting, according to the statement.
The position of deputy communist party boss in a Chinese state-owned firm gives the holder a powerful voice in the business decisions. The holder usually also has an executive position at the same company.
The appointment of Liang follows Huarong's restructuring, which spooked investors in China's dollar-bond market in April when it delayed its business results, prompting ratings downgrades, warnings from global agencies and the suspension in share trading. Dealings in its shares are still suspended.
After two years of restructuring its assets, the regulators are pushing Huarong to sell non-core financial assets and are considering informal backing for its $20 billion of dollar debt due this year, Reuters reported last week.

The Finance Ministry is the biggest shareholder in Beijing-based Huarong, which was established in the 1990s to handle soured debts at state banks. Former chairman Lai Xiaomin was executed in January after a corruption investigation into the period when he expanded Huarong into a financial conglomerate.
Reshuffling the leadership of state-controlled asset management companies (AMCs) like Huarong comes amid reforms of state ""bad banks"". Other state AMCs may also follow the lead of Huarong to streamline their businesses, Reuters reported.

Investing.com -- Meme stocks, led by AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), looked set to extend their gains for the second consecutive session rising 2%-5% in premarket Tuesday.
The favorite of the Reddit gang, AMC, was up more than 4% while GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) gained approximately 2% and 3%, respectively.
Meme stocks have defied the naysayers consistently over the last six months and while GameStop and Blackberry (TSX:BB) may be significantly off their year’s highs, it’s not been a flash in the pan.
In the process, the stocks have made new highs several times and created wealth for many even as their books may not yet deserve those valuations.
The companies are trying though. To the surprise of many, AMC has raised $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, and proposes to sell 25 million more shares in 2022.
GameStop, once a bankruptcy candidate, has reshuffled its top management as it tries to become a multichannel global retailer, retired part of its debt and created new facilities.
Blackberry continues to strengthen its security software portfolio, have more cloud-based offerings and forge new partnerships.

LONDON (Reuters) -The London Metal Exchange has abandoned proposals to close its open outcry trading floor, the last such venue in Europe, it said on Tuesday, but added it believes electronic trading is the future.
The floor was closed in March 2020 for the first time since World War II to allow for social distancing needed to deal with COVID-19, silencing its red ring of seats and the theatre of arcane hand signals and frenzied shouting by traders.
In January, the world's oldest and biggest marketplace for industrial metals launched a consultation process on closing its open-outcry trading floor, arguing that the forced migration to digital trading was a success.
""The divergent views in response to the Discussion Paper were particularly apparent between traditional participants and some smaller physical clients on the one hand, and our larger merchant trader and financial participants on the other,"" LME CEO Matt Chamberlain said..
The LME received 192 responses to its consultation, an unprecedented number. 
The LME also proposed in its consultation paper a switch in the methodology for calculating clearing margins to a realised variation model (RVM) from the existing contingent variation model (CVM).
But it has committed to retain CVM in the medium term and will embark on a feasibility study that will look into recreating the cash flows of a CVM model for RVM contracts, the exchange said.
""(This) could support the traditional brokerage community in the provision of credit to their smaller physical clients."" 
Under the CVM, positive balances on some client accounts are used to offset negative balances on others, essentially extending credit.
Physical market participants prefer CVM because cash flows do not have to be managed daily, only when contracts expire.
Under the RVM model, margins are held by clearing houses, which returns positive margin balances daily and call for margin in lieu of negative balances. It would require small and medium-sized firms to lock up more capital. 
RVM is used for most exchange-traded and centrally cleared contracts. Financial participants, such as funds, prefer RVM because they receive daily positive balances, or cash, that can be deployed elsewhere.

Depending on the outcome of a consultation issued today, official or settlement prices -- those traded between 1230 and 1350 London time -- will be determined in floor trading, which will resume on September 6, to support physical customers using these prices in their contracts.
""Closing prices will be determined electronically, enhancing participation and transparency, supporting financial customers and larger physical users,"" the LME said.

Deliveries included the first A380 superjumbo to Dubai's Emirates since December last year, leaving four more to deliver before the world's largest airliner ends its production and cabin-fitting run in the wake of weaker than expected sales.
On Tuesday, Airbus shares rose 0.5%.
Airbus also confirmed an order of five A350 wide-bodied jets from Lufthansa, announced by the airline last month. 
But Airbus data released on Monday showed that the German airline had also simultaneously cancelled three previous A350 orders, resulting in a net addition of two A350 jets. An Airbus spokesman confirmed the mixture of cancellations and orders.
The order reshuffle was part of a fleet restructuring that also saw Lufthansa buy five more competing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-9 jets left without buyers after they were manufactured.
Boeing has been wrestling with 787 production difficulties, while both planemakers face a slump in demand for wide-bodied long-haul jets exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
In total, Airbus has won 94 orders so far this year, but it posted a negative total of 31 after adjusting for cancellations.
Analysts at UBS said Airbus deliveries were expected to show a meaningful pick-up in June reflecting the end of the quarter and that the pace so far this year supported higher production plans announced by Airbus last month.

Some suppliers have voiced reservations about the plans.
Boeing was due to publish May data later on Tuesday. Between January and April it delivered 94 airplanes and booked 84 net orders after cancellations and other accounting adjustments.

LONDON (Reuters) -Activist investor Cevian Capital said  Aviva  (LON:AV) should return 5 billion pounds ($7.08 billion) of excess capital in 2022 after revealing it has built up a near 5% stake in the British insurer, putting new CEO Amanda Blanc under pressure to accelerate changes.
Aviva, which has sold eight businesses since the appointment of Blanc as CEO in July 2020, said last month it had raised 7.5 billion pounds from disposals and planned to return money to shareholders, without putting a figure on it. 
""Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions,"" Christer Gardell, managing partner and co-founder of Cevian said in a statement.
Analysts have said the insurer would have between 3.7 billion and 6.6 billion pounds of excess capital following the completion of the asset sales. 
Aviva should have a value of more than 8 pounds per share within three years, and more than double its dividend to 45 pence, Cevian said.
Aviva's shares are currently trading above 4 pounds a share and rose 3.5% on the Cevian statement. 
Cevian also said it saw scope for further cost-cutting, totalling at least 500 million pounds by 2023. Aviva outlined a strategy last year including 300 million pounds in cost cuts by 2022.
Aviva is shifting focus to the key markets of Britain, Canada and Ireland since the asset sales. 
Industry sources have speculated the insurer could make further changes such as selling books of life insurance business closed to new customers. The Canadian unit might also attract buyers, they said.
""Aviva has made significant strategic progress over the past 11 months and we remain sharply focused on further improving our performance,"" an Aviva spokesperson said in an emailed statement. 
""We regularly engage with investors and welcome any thoughts which move us towards our goal of delivering long term shareholder value."" 
Cevian bought a stake in rival insurer RSA in 2013 which it built up to 15%, culminating in the completion last week of RSA's sale to Denmark's Tryg and Canada's Intact Financial.
Cevian started building up the stake in Aviva several months ago, with relations cordial between the investor and Aviva's management, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Chairman George Culmer and CEO Blanc are ""committed to...delivering substantial shareholder value"", Cevian said in the statement.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Drugmaker Mundipharma has included Boyu Capital and state-owned Sinopharm on a shortlist of bidders for its Chinese business, two people familiar with the situation said.
Chinese buyout firms CITIC Capital and CPE are also on the shortlist for Mundipharma's China unit, which sources have said could fetch more than $1 billion.
Mundipharma, which is owned by the billionaire American Sackler family, has chosen about half of around 20 initial possible buyers, including private equity firms and strategic players, to proceed to the next round, one of the people said. 
Bids for the second round are non-binding and are due in July, the sources, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential, told Reuters.

Mundipharma and CPE declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Sinopharm said it could not comment as it did not have any relevant information on the transaction.
Boyu and CITIC Capital did not respond to Reuters queries.
Mundipharma, which is based in Cambridge, Britain, says it has a presence in 120 countries and $2 billion in global sales from drugs for pain management and supportive care, diabetes, oncology and respiratory diseases, among others.
Mundipharma launched in China, where its business now has more than 1,500 employees, in 1993 with a high-profile ceremony at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.

Its Beijing factory is the biggest maker of narcotic and psychoactive drugs in the country, its website says, with the painkiller OxyContin one of the Chinese unit's core products.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - An Indian court tasked industrial safety officials on Tuesday with visiting carmakers in the southern state of Tamil Nadu to draw up uniform safety guidelines for workers during a second devastating wave of COVID-19 infections amid the pandemic.
Workers at the Indian unit of Renault-Nissan had asked the Madras High Court for operations to be halted, saying social distancing norms were being flouted and the risk to their lives outweighed the health benefits provided by the company.
""Senior representatives from the department of industrial safety may be requested to make further visits to the Nissan-Renault manufacturing facility and...other auto manufacturing units...so that a unified set of guidelines may be imposed,"" the court said.
In a court filing on Monday reviewed by Reuters, the company said it wanted the state government to recommend adequate social distancing measures, based on practices at other automakers, amid the dispute with its workers union over safety.
The company added that while it was following practices at automakers such as Maruti, Hyundai, Kia, Ford and BMW, it was ""impossible"" to increase the space between workers beyond two feet to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) at some work stations.
The workers' union would file a counter petition, said M Moorthy, its general secretary. 
""Other manufacturers need to adopt the best practices we are pushing for, not the other way around,"" he told Reuters.
""We feel unsafe, and that is why we are against what the company is doing.""
The plant resumed operations last week after a strike by workers who said they felt unsafe because of a rising number of virus infections at the factory.
Tamil Nadu, home to a flourishing automobile industry, is one of the Indian states worst hit by the pandemic. 

Labour unions for Renault-Nissan, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Hyundai Motor Co have written letters of protest saying arguing that hundreds of workers in the automaking hub of Chennai have fallen ill with COVID-19 and dozens have died. 
Ford and Hyundai also halted work at their plants last month after workers protested and some went on strike.

The annual reconstitution of Russell’s U.S. family of indexes accounts for market changes in the previous year, and it affects more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. Indexes, according to its website. Trading volumes on U.S. exchanges also tend to be among the heaviest of the year around the event.
Will AMC and GameStop be moved into the large-cap Russell 1000 from the small-cap Russell 2000? The key date was May 7.
The reconstitution ranks and market cap breaks for the Russell Indexes are determined based on information available on rank day -- this year, May 7 -- according to Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell’s director of product management. An existing Russell 2000 index member would have had to have a total market cap exceeding $7.3 billion in order to move into the Russell 1000 index, she said.
Going by that, AMC -- with a market cap of $4.28 billion on May 7 -- would fall short of inclusion, while GameStop and its $11.97 billion market cap would make it.
As of Friday’s close, after big rallies in the last month, GameStop had a market capitalization of $18.4 billion. AMC’s is $24.6 billion.
The reconstitution process is pretty formulaic: There’s a whole cottage industry of analysts who predict changes to the indexes in advance with high accuracy. A preliminary ranking is done by Russell on May 7. The first round of information was announced on Friday, with the preliminary list of additions and deletions from the Russell 3000 (that’s a combination of the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The expectation that hundreds of so-called zombie companies will fail over the next few years and drag on the economy is among the major concerns prompting insurers to reduce risk and charge higher premiums, a trend likely to continue as failures increase, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) AG said on Tuesday. 
Zombies - which lack the cash flow to cover the cost of their debt - are ""a ticking time bomb"" whose explosive effects will be felt as governments and central banks withdraw measures that have helped keep these companies alive during the pandemic, Jerome Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss insurer, told Reuters. 
The sober prediction comes as stock prices hit records and the U.S. economy appears headed for 6.5% growth this year. Yet these strengths are illusory, Haegeli said, because they are based on temporary fiscal and monetary support.
Haegeli said the proportion of companies that are zombies certainly increased during the pandemic, as central banks flooded markets with money and governments provided relief. At the same time, U.S. company bankruptcies fell 5% in 2020, Swiss Re said in a report on Tuesday.
Before the pandemic, about 20% of listed firms in the United States and UK were zombies, and 30% in Australia and Canada, the Bank for International Settlements said in September. By comparison, zombies constituted about 15% of listed companies in 14 advanced economies in 2017 and 4% before the 2008 financial crisis. 
Insurers are being cautious as they forecast where the economy will be in a year or more, Haegeli said. They are reining in underwriting risk, being more prudent about investment portfolio asset allocations and even taking precaution on insuring operations and supply-chain risk.
""They are not getting fooled by the short-term picture,"" Haegeli said. ""If you look at the market today, everything looks great. However, it's illusionary to think that this environment can last"" as ""life support"" is withdrawn in coming months. And that will bring an increase in long-overdue bankruptcies.
""I'm concerned that you're going to see a sudden spike in defaults because the default rates are so low,"" he said. 

Insurers also are likely to continue raising prices to be sure they are adequately pricing the risks ahead, he said. 
Global commercial insurance prices started rising in 2017 and have climbed since, including an 18% rise in the first quarter of 2021, according to data from Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC).

Dan Levy, a Credit-Suisse analyst said in a note the departure is ""negative given Guillen previously viewed as central to Tesla"" as he was ""arguably key in stabilizing auto biz post Model 3 launch"" in 2017. 
Tesla is yet to begin delivering its battery-powered Semi electric commercial truck, with Musk saying in recent months that battery cell supply constraints could delay its mass production to 2022. 
Musk also said in January that Tesla would be able to produce the Semi when its new 4680 cells could be produced in volume, alleviating a battery shortage.
Separately, Musk said on Sunday that Tesla has canceled its longest-range Model S Plaid+, which would use 4680 cells and whose production had been delayed to next year.
""They made a big deal about 4680 ... we are just upset the first (car with) 4680 apparently was abruptly canceled. This just raises more questions that they need to address,"" Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier, said. 
Tesla shares fell 0.7% in after market trading.
Guillen was one of only a few long-serving executives at Tesla, which is known for the high turnover rate of its executives.

Investors now await U.S. inflation data for May, including the consumer price index (CPI), due later in the week. Also on the radar is a U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision to be handed down in the following week that will be scrutinized for signs of asset tapering.
“When the FOMC will begin tapering its asset purchase program is still front and center for market participants,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Kim Mundy said in a note.
Investors could reconsider that timeline following the inflation print, with Mundy expecting the Fed to discuss tapering in July or September.
However, other investors remained optimistic that the Fed would maintain its current dovish policy for now.
“We advocate looking through near-term market volatility and remain pro-risk, predicated on our belief that the Fed faces a very high bar to change its easy monetary policy stance,” BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute strategists led by Elga Bartsch said in a note.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 10:21PM ET</span>","U.S. approval of Biogen Alzheimer's drug sends shares soaring, hailed as 'big day"" for patients","By Deena Beasley and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) -U.S. regulators on Monday approved Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s aducanumab as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's disease despite controversy over whether the clinical evidence proves the drug works, sending its shares soaring.
Biogen said it has priced the drug, to be sold as Aduhelm, at $56,000 per year. After jumping more than 50%, Biogen shares closed up 38.3% at $395.85 - their highest closing level in over six years. U.S. traded shares of Japanese partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) rose 56% to $116.03.
Aducanumab works by removing sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of patients in earlier stages of Alzheimer's in order to stave off its ravages, which include memory loss and the inability to care for oneself.
""This is good news for patients with Alzheimer's disease. We've not had a disease modifying therapy approved ever,"" said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer's disease expert at the Mayo Clinic. However, he cautioned, ""This is not a cure. It's hoped that this will slow the progression of the disease.""
""I think this is a big day,"" Peterson said. ""But we can't overpromise.""
Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
The Food and Drug Administration on its website said results from clinical trials of Aduhelm were mixed, but the drug was shown to reduce amyloid beta plaques in the brain, which is likely to benefit patients.
""We decided that the accelerated approval pathway fits well here,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told Reuters, explaining that this ""allows for there being some residual uncertainty on the drug's clinical benefits while making the drug available to patients rather than having to wait."" 
Under that pathway, Biogen is required to conduct a confirmatory clinical trial, but has several years to do so, she said.
Biogen's drug had been hailed by patient advocates and some neurologists eager to have an effective option for patients with the lethal disease. Other doctors said clinical trial results were inconsistent and more proof was needed.
""I'm surprised and disappointed,"" said Dr. Caleb Alexander, a drug researcher at Johns Hopkins who was on the FDA's advisory committee that voted against approval of Biogen's drug.
""It's hard to find a scientist, even one with ties to the manufacturer, who believes the totality of the evidence is persuasive.""
MORE RESEARCH
U.S. health insurers and the U.S. government's Medicare program will bear most of the cost of the drug, whose price will vary based on dosage and discounts. 
Aducanumab was studied in patients with early disease who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques, but the FDA approval does not indicate that it is for a specific group of patients. That raises the possibility that the treatable population could be larger than anticipated. 
Still, most insurers are likely to limit their coverage of the drug to the type of patients who participated in the trial, said Steve Miller, chief clinical officer at health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI). He estimated that 85% to 90% of U.S. patients eligible for the drug are covered by Medicare. ""I would be very surprised if any payer, including Medicare, made it available for a broader population than the study population,"" Miller said.
The FDA said if the post-approval trial fails to show Aduhelm works as intended it could be pulled from the market. 
""I think they made the right decision. It makes the drug available to patients while requiring the company to do more research to prove its benefit,"" said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Foundation.
Some trial patients experienced potentially dangerous brain swelling. The FDA advised that patients who experience the side effect should be monitored but not necessarily taken off the drug.
Biogen has estimated that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for treatment with aducanumab, which is given by monthly infusion, raising concerns about costs to the healthcare system.
The number of Americans living with Alzheimer's is expected to rise to around 13 million by 2050 from more than 6 million currently, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Wall Street analysts are now estimating peak annual sales for the drug ranging from $10 billion to $50 billion.
Development of aducanumab has been closely watched in Japan, which has a sizable elderly population and an estimated 4.6 million people living with dementia.
Eisai's shares were untraded in Tokyo on Tuesday, bid up by their daily limit of 19%. The company has rights to 55% of profits on the drug in the U.S. and 80% in Japan and much of Asia. Eisai has another Alzheimer's drug candidate called BAN2401 that is in Phase III trials.
Even so, Japan's system for setting drug prices for its national health care system would likely limit annual sales to 100 billion yen ($914 million) ""at the best,"" according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) pharma analyst Fumiyoshi Sakai. 
The medicine is seen as critical to Biogen's revenue growth prospects as competition has hurt sales of its mainstay multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, as well as its other growth driver, Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy.
Wall Street analysts had forecast that an FDA approval of Biogen's drug could reinvigorate a field that has been abandoned by many large pharmaceutical companies after a long string of failures. Current treatments only try to alleviate symptoms. 

Shares of companies developing Alzheimer's treatments also jumped, with AC Immune SA (NASDAQ:ACIU) closing up 27.7% and  Anavex Life Sciences  (NASDAQ:AVXL) up nearly 8%, while shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co closed 10% higher and Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AXSM) finished up 6.4%.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 10:20PM ET</span>",Analysis: More Chinese companies could fall under Biden's broader investment ban,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's order last week banning U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies is broader than a similar one signed by his predecessor Donald Trump and has a lower bar, making it easier to add more companies later.
    Legal experts say it also may help the administration avoid embarrassing defeats in court after a ban imposed near the end of the Trump administration failed to hold up against legal challenges.
    Biden's order will prohibit U.S. investments in about 60 companies in China's defense or surveillance technology sectors.[L2N2NL1XR]
    ""It's broader in scope and it's a much lower standard for listing,"" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official, adding it should better withstand legal scrutiny.
The new order prohibits investments in companies that ""operate in or have operated in"" China's defense or related materials sector, or in surveillance technology, or are owned or controlled by someone who does. Its aim is to limit the flow of money to companies that undermine U.S. security or ""democratic values,"" which allows listings for human rights abuses.
    The Trump ban was placed on Chinese military companies as defined years ago in the National Defense Authorization Act: companies owned or controlled by or ""affiliated with"" the People’s Liberation Army, a government ministry or the People's Republic of China's defense industrial base. 
The revised order eliminates the requirement for a direct link to the Chinese state, using the more vague language that a company must ""operate in"" the defense or surveillance sectors.
The Trump order needed to be shored up after three companies went to court to challenge it. Two got their designations halted, and there's been no ruling in the third case. 
    ""Courts are usually reluctant to overrule the president when he makes a national security determination,"" said Bill Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). ""The fact that they did so suggests really poor drafting on the part of the Trump people and a poor defense of the decisions made."" 
""ARBITRARY""
Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), which lost some $10 billion in market capitalization in the month after it was included on the list of banned firms, was the first to bring a case to try to expose flaws in Trump's order.  
    The judge halted Xiaomi's designation in March citing a lack of evidence it was affiliated with the PLA or PRC, and calling its listing ""arbitrary and capricious."" 
The government's evidence included an award given to Xiaomi's chairman, which more than 500 entrepreneurs had received since 2004, including the leaders of an infant formula company. It also cited Xiaomi's investments in 5G and artificial intelligence technology, but the judge noted they are fast becoming standard for consumer devices, not just military modernization. 
The judge also noted errors in the government's decision memo, including incorrectly quoting the statute at issue, and said the government did not meet the definition of ""affiliated with,"" namely, ""effectively controlled by another or associated with others under common ownership or control."" 
Last month, the Biden administration agreed to remove the company from the list.
    Luokung Technology Corp, a mapping technology company, won a similar initial ruling.
Neither Xiaomi, nor Luokung nor Gowin Semiconductor, the third company that challenged its designation, are on the revised list.
Major Chinese firms included under both orders include China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Huawei Technologies Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. 
    Hong Kong-based lawyer Wendy Wysong, who had been considering bringing cases over Trump's order, said Biden's listings appear to be on more solid ground.
""It may be harder to challenge the designation because the underlying rationale presumably won't be so weak, and the designation criteria is not as narrowly worded,"" said Wysong.

Many more companies could be affected by Biden's order depending on ""how aggressive the U.S. administration wants to be,"" said CSIS's Reinsch.
""In theory it could expand the universe rather significantly,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has urged SoftBank Group Corp shareholders to oppose the election of corporate lawyer Ken Siegel to the board of directors due to his professional ties with the Japanese conglomerate.
The opposition is one of a number of recommendations to SoftBank shareholders ahead of the group's annual general meeting on June 23, with both Glass Lewis and peer Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) opposing elections to auditor positions over independence concerns.
Siegel is managing partner at the Tokyo office of law firm Morrison & Foerster and has worked on some of SoftBank's biggest deals, including the $40 billion sale of chip company Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.
""We question the need for the Company to engage in legal services with its directors. We view such relationships as creating conflicts for directors,"" Glass Lewis wrote in a proxy paper.
SoftBank and Siegel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The recommendations come amid investor concern about the independence of SoftBank's board directors and their willingness to question decisions by founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son.
SoftBank reported record annual earnings in the year ended March as portfolio valuations bounced back, intensifying concerns of there being less pressure on Son to listen to external views. 

Both proxy advisers favour the election of the group's other proposed independent director, veteran gaming executive Keiko Erikawa https://www.reuters.com/business/son-chan-invites-veteran-stock-picker-softbank-board-2021-05-22, who will be the board's only woman, replacing Waseda University business professor Yuko Kawamoto.

(Reuters) - Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries on Monday sued International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp, asking a judge to rule that it did not violate a contract with the U.S. company which claims it is owed $2.5 billion in damages.
 IBM  has accused GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's state-owned fund Mubadala, of failing to continue making chips for IBM, according to a filing by GlobalFoundries with the state court in New York.
GlobalFoundries purchased IBM's semiconductor plants in 2014 when IBM decided to exit the business of manufacturing its own chips. But it quit pursuing advanced chipmaking technology in 2018 due to the high costs of development and IBM instead turned to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd to make its chips. 
IBM ""went silent for nearly two-and-a-half years"" after the changes in 2018, but then in April of this year sent GlobalFoundries a letter alleging that the chipmaker had violated its contract,"" the filing said.
""Other than threatening to sue unless it capitulated to its demands, IBM has yet to provide any substantive explanation as to its claims,"" GlobalFoundries wrote in the suit.

IBM said in a statement it believes GlobalFoundries did not fulfill its obligations under the contract.
""IBM contributed $1.5B to Global Foundries to supply the next generation of chips, and Global Foundries utterly abandoned IBM as soon as the final payment was received and sold off assets from the deal for its own enrichment,"" IBM said.

The bridge loan was part of a $5 billion rescue package led by the Hong Kong government and Cathay's major shareholders Swire Pacific (OTC:SWRAY) Ltd and Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd last year to help the airline weather the COVID-19 crisis.
Cathay Chief Executive Augustus Tang said in a statement the airline had not yet drawn down on the loan as it adopted a suite of measures to save cash, but the extension would give it more flexibility to manage its liquidity position.
Cathay had HK$28 billion of liquidity as of December 2020 and also raised HK$6.74 billion from a convertible bond issue in February and $650 million in a bond issue last month.
The airline's move to access as much liquidity as possible at a time when passenger numbers are down by more than 99% from 2019 levels follows a decision by rival Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd last month to issue S$6.2 billion ($4.69 billion) of convertible bonds.
The Singapore Airlines convertible bonds, underwritten by majority shareholder Temasek Holdings, were an optional part of a state investor-led S$15 billion rescue package announced last year. 
Both airlines lack domestic markets at a time when international borders are still largely shut.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a languid session slightly in the red on Monday, with investors standing by on news of a global minimum corporate tax rate, lingering inflation fears, and a lack of market-moving economic news.
The Dow closed well within negative territory, while the Nasdaq advanced. Still, the S&P and the Dow remained inside one percentage point of their record closing highs.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>",Big Biogen boost on Alzheimer's news could win back biotech investors,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The approval by U.S. regulators on Monday of a Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) drug to treat Alzheimer's disease could reinvigorate investor interest more broadly in biotech and pharmaceutical shares that have struggled in 2021.
Biogen shares soared 38%, closing at their highest level in over six years, after the company's aducanumab was cleared as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's. The approval lifted shares of other companies developing treatments for the mind-wasting disease and helped push key biotech stock gauges to their best days in months.
The renewed attention on biotech and pharma was welcome for investors who have seen those stocks lag in 2021 as focus has shifted to companies expected to thrive as the U.S. economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic.
“The biotech sector needed a spark and this was an explosion,” said Kevin Gade, a portfolio manager focusing on biotech and pharma stocks for Bahl & Gaynor.
Gade said Bahl & Gaynor owns shares of drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, which soared 10% as the company is developing an Alzheimer's drug similar to Biogen's. 
Prior to Monday's news, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF, the second-biggest healthcare ETF by assets, according to Lipper data, had climbed only 1% in 2021, well below the gain of over 12% for the benchmark S&P 500, while the S&P 500 pharmaceuticals index had gained only 4.7%. 
But on Monday the Nasdaq biotech ETF surged 3.4%, its biggest daily percentage gain in seven months. Driven by Lilly shares, the pharmaceutical index also gained 0.66%, outperforming the 0.08% drop for the S&P 500. 
Biogen itself added over $16 billion in market value on Monday.
""This might just be the catalyst biotech investors needed to get this group back on track,"" said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
Ahead of the decision, Wall Street analysts were split over aducanumab's prospects for approval, leading to the big share price reaction on Monday as the decision caught some investors off guard.
The approval “creates a little bit of a halo effect on biotech in general so you see the whole group trade higher on that now,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in South Carolina.
With U.S. President Joe Biden yet to name a permanent head of the Food and Drug Administration - the industry's main regulator - that uncertainty has clouded the outlook for biotech and pharma stocks, Gade said. The industry has also seen some high-profile setbacks in recent months, such as disappointing clinical data for  Sarepta  Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT)' muscle disorder drug, as well as a number of significant regulatory delays, investors said.

More broadly, Todd said, many health stocks have been out of favor as investors have centered attention on bank, energy and other stocks as the U.S. economy reopens, while there remains some lingering concern about biotech and pharma stocks due to the potential for increased U.S. regulation on prescription drug prices.
""The space has kind of been in this purgatory really since the election,"" Todd said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's self-regulatory body, has proposed changes to its short-interest reporting requirements in a bid to make information more useful.
The proposed changes to Rule 4560 would increase the frequency of short-interest reports from twice a month to weekly or even daily. The change would require clearing firms to report synthetic short exposure - bets made against shares via derivatives - in firm and customer accounts.
The move highlights intensifying scrutiny of short-selling, betting against shares to profit if they fall, amid ongoing volatility in ""meme stocks."" These are driven by retail investors banding together to squeeze hedge funds that bet against GameStop (NYSE:GME) AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and other stocks.
The changes would also require clearing firms to report to FINRA certain information on the stock loans that facilitate short bets ""for regulatory purposes, but with an eye toward eventual public dissemination,"" amid other changes, said the watchdog. The proposal was released late Friday. 
""These potential changes could improve the usefulness of short sale-related information to FINRA, other regulators, investors and other market participants,"" FINRA said. 
FINRA is an industry-financed self-regulatory organization overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

The proposed changes, which are subject to public consultation, would likely increase the burden on clearing firms and prime brokers, who bear the primary responsibility for short interest reporting under the current requirements, FINRA said. 
The agency currently collects and publish this data but it is not easy for many investors to access. This proposal seeks to address that.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The heads of all passenger airlines flying between Britain and the United States called on Monday for both countries to lift trans-Atlantic travel restrictions put in place to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
High vaccination rates in both countries meant travel could restart safely after more than a year of restrictions, said the CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), IAG (LON:ICAG) unit British Airways, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp in a rare joint virtual press conference.
The push came days ahead of this week's meetings between U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 meeting of advanced economies this week in Cornwall, southwest England. 
U.S. and UK airline officials told Reuters they do not expect Washington to lift restrictions until around July 4 at the earliest as the administration aims to get more Americans vaccinated.
British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said lifting restrictions is essential.
""I think there's much more at stake here than a holiday, it's about trade, it's about visiting friends and relatives, and it's about getting back and doing business and re-employing people,"" Doyle said. 
Since March 2020, the United States has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have been in the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days from entering the country. Most U.S. travellers visiting the United Kingdom must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival.
Reopening is more crucial for Britain-based airlines British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are not benefiting from a rebounding domestic market like their U.S. peers.
JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said ""the human cost is just I think devastating"" for people who have been vaccinated but ""haven't seen their kids, grandkids for over a year now."" 
The vast majority of nations do not face the entry restrictions and were added by the United States on an ad hoc basis. Only the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil face the restrictions. 

American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said the list of countries that face those U.S. restrictions ""doesn't make much sense anymore ... vaccinated travellers are safe to travel.""
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the airline ""could add pretty significant capacity"" within four weeks if restrictions were lifted. ""We are in the peak travel season for travel between the US and UK, and every single day that goes by is a day lost for the recovery,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and other ""meme stocks"" jumped on Monday, extending a rally in social-media favorites into a third week as message boards hummed with talk of squeezing Wall Street short-sellers.
The sharp gains prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to say it was looking into signs of market manipulation given the ""volatility in certain stocks.""
The volatility has challenged analysts, and two of them in the past week have stopped covering video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), whose shares soared in January in a retail-driven rally.
Cinema operator AMC jumped almost 15%, putting its gain over the past five sessions at 111%. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)'s U.S. listing surged 14% and is now up 57% since the start of June. 
""AMC never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that train is over, it jumps almost 10 points in the first 30 min of trading,"" one poster on Reddit wrote.
AMC shares are up about 2,500% in 2021 as the company has courted individual investors, while GameStop has surged over 1,300% year to date.
Some bearish investors retreated from bets against AMC on Friday. Short interest slumped to 74.5 million shares, or 14.9% of AMC's float, from 88.2 million on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.
Clover Health Investments, which has been the target of short sellers, was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Monday, with some users suggesting the shares as the forum's next short-squeeze target.
The insurer's shares soared 32% in their highest volume trading day since April 19. 
Institutional investors are largely sitting on the sidelines as the meme-stock rally continues.
Amateur investors, however, ""don't need a reason,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""They're trying to do the same thing they did last week. It's a new week. They start over, the meme stock buyers, the wallstreetbets Reddit community."" 
ANALYSTS SIT OUT
Despite the retail-investor driven rally, Wall Street analysts have largely refused to raise target prices, which reflect their view of fair value for a company's shares.
Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman terminated coverage of GameStop. His last rating was ""underperform,"" with a price target almost 90% below Monday's level.
""We're focusing on other areas,"" he said. ""It's hard to justify where the stock is trading relative to the fundamentals.""
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stopped covering GameStop last week, citing ""a reallocation of resources.""
With GameStop set to report its quarterly results on Wednesday, the same day it holds its annual shareholders meeting, options prices imply a potential 24% swing for the stock in either direction by the end of the week, according to data from Refinitiv.
AMC has been the top-traded stock among clients of brokerages Fidelity and Freetrade, used heavily by individual investors managing their own money, data showed.
BlackBerry topped the list of stocks mentioned on wallstreetbets on Monday, according to the swaggystocks.com sentiment tracker. 
The SEC continues to ""monitor the market in light of the ongoing volatility in certain stocks to determine if there have been any disruptions of the market, manipulative trading, or other misconduct,"" an SEC spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
""In addition, we will act to protect retail investors if violations of federal securities laws are found,"" the SEC said.
Market participants have told Reuters that some institutional investors are ramping up options trades that let them bet the shares will fall while keeping a lid on potential losses if they gain.

AMC's corporate debt has benefited from the rally in its stock, though not to the same extent, in part because corporate debt is less accessible to retail investors. Its June 2026 12% bond, worth about $1.5 billion, is up over 360% since Jan. 1, tame compared to the stock's gain.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has tapped a former Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executive to take on a new role as vice chairman of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa as it battles for key advisory mandates to dominate a resurgent M&A market.
Bob Elfring is re-entering the M&A arena three years after leaving Bank of America where he led corporate and investment banking across EMEA between 2012 and 2018, according to a memo seen by Reuters. 
The 62-year-old Dutchman will focus on strengthening JPMorgan's presence outside Britain with an emphasis on the Benelux region where he will work closely with the bank's senior country officer for the Netherlands, Cassander Verwey, the memo said.
Elfring has extensive knowledge of the Dutch market having started his career at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) in the capital markets and syndicate group in Amsterdam. He went on taking management positions at Rabobank, Amsterdamse Investeringsbank and MeesPierson.
The Netherlands is home to some of Europe's biggest companies including technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV which sold 2% of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) for $14.7 billion in the world's largest-ever block trade in April.
Before joining Bank of America, Elfring - who recently became an adviser to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners - worked at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), where he was responsible for the investment banking coverage in Northern Europe and Benelux.

He moved to Switzerland, where he still lives, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, where he worked for eight years in various roles including co-head of the global industrials group. 
At JPMorgan he will report to the bank's co-heads for EMEA investment banking, Dorothee Blessing and Conor Hillery.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets closed at a record high on Monday as technology shares took in stride a deal by the world's richest nations on a corporate tax aimed at U.S. tech heavyweights, and oil prices jumped to a two-year high.
MSCI's all-country world equity index gained 0.1%, marking its sixth record close in seven days, as stocks advanced on expectations of an economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Oil climbed above $72 a barrel, extending this year's rally built on rising recovery demand and supply curbs from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, before giving up the gains as investors took profits.
U.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields edged up in largely subdued trade ahead of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, the same day highly-anticipated U.S. inflation data will be released.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 0.1 basis point to yield 1.5704%, at the bottom of a two-month range. 
Germany's 10-year Bund yield rose 0.2 basis point to -0.195, near one-month lows hit after the U.S. unemployment report on Friday. The data showed a solid pickup in hiring, but not enough to stir fears of an overheated economy that could lead to tighter U.S. monetary policy via higher interest rates. 
The big tech firms, in the crosshairs of the G7 agreement on Saturday that seeks a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%, can expect slightly more predictability in their future tax obligations, said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings.
A period of unilateral taxes and punitive tariffs from both the United States and European Union has been avoided for the moment, Smart added.
On the political front, the agenda of U.S. President Joe Biden may struggle if he is unable to change the filibuster rule in the Senate, said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. 
""We're getting lower volatility and that's leading to a very difficult market to trade or to get excited about,"" Moya said of the rangebound equities market.
""The market is going to have to wait a few months to get some clarity on the labor market recovery and whether these pricing pressures will be persistent,"" he said, referring to spiking U.S. inflation likely to be seen on Thursday.
MSCI's ACWI index, a global benchmark for equity performance in 50 countries, closed at 717.00. The index is heavily weighted to the U.S. tech behemoths, half of which rose while the others fell.

In Europe, advancing automakers more than offset early declines in commodity-linked shares sparked by downbeat China export data.
Chinese copper imports fell 8% in May from the previous month as record-high prices further eroded buying interest while overall export growth missed analysts' forecasts.

389,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",4 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Jump in In-Store Traffic,"Solid progress on the COVID-19 vaccination front has been driving increasing foot traffic at retail outlets, contributing to the industry’s comeback. As the economy continues to recover over the coming months, buoyed by rapid job growth and increased consumer spending, retail stores are expected to regain their pre-pandemic operating levels. Therefore, we think leading companies in this space, Costco Wholesale (COST),  Target  (TGT),  Best Buy  (BBY), and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), should deliver market-beating returns in the coming months. So, let’s pore over these names.The fast-paced U.S. COVID-19 vaccination drive and consequent reopening of the economy has allowed the retail industry to regain the high ground, following the pandemic driven lows it experienced last year. With approximately 63% of the U.S. population having received at least one dose of COVID vaccine, brick & mortar stores have been seeing rising foot traffic over the past couple of weeks. This trend will likely continue, given the government’s efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of the population with at least one dose by July 4.
As people re-engage with shopping at physical outlets, following nearly a year of home deliveries, the retail industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming months. The world’s largest retail association, the National Retail Federation, forecasts annual retail sales to increase between 6.5%-8.2% in 2021. Annual retail industry revenues are expected to be more than $4.33 trillion in 2021, driven by rising per-capita consumer spending and strong job growth.
Thus, we think the stocks of major retailers Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA) will outperform the broader market in the near term.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investor Barington Capital Group on Monday urged Chico's FAS (NYSE:CHS) to explore strategic options for its brands and said the apparel chain's board should add new members to help improve its lagging stock price.
The New York-based hedge fund, which first pushed for changes at the clothing company five years ago, said it wants to see directors with experience in digital commerce, merchandising and marketing and women's fashion specialty retail. 
""We believe the Board has been highly deficient in these two areas for years,"" Barington's founder, James Mitarotonda, wrote in a letter to the board which was made public on Monday. 
""The Chico's Board is largely responsible for this underperformance,"" he said about the company's share price, stressing that ""change is needed at the Chico's Board.""
The company said it has been making progress in its turnaround strategy and will present details when it reports first quarter earnings on Tuesday. ""We are committed to taking all appropriate actions to improve performance and drive shareholder value,"" it said in a statement.
The hedge fund, which said it owns roughly 2% of the shares, is urging directors John Mahoney, David Walker and Stephen Watson to step down, criticizing them for a lack of relevant expertise and for having endorsed a former chief executive's ""failed strategic plan."" 
Mitarotonda also expressed concern about board member Kevin Mansell, citing his close ties to Watson when both men were involved at retailer Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).
The company is expected to hold an annual meeting on June 24. 
While Mitarotonda praised Molly Langenstein, who was named chief executive last year, he said he wants the board to look at strategic alternatives, ""that will unlock the tremendous value we see in the Soma brand in light of the pace of recovery at the Chico’s and WHBM (White House Black Market) brands.""
Chico's stock price jumped 6.88% on Monday to $5.75, and has surged more than 240% since January. The last time Mitarotonda was involved, he forecast that with changes, the stock price could trade closer to $27 a share.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), facing accusations from rivals that it has too much control over its App Store, on Monday outlined plans to increase user privacy and keep consumer data out of other companies' hands, laying out features including expanded video conferencing and storing virtual government IDs on iPhones.
The changes came at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference for software developers, some of whom have started to complain about Apple's grip over which apps can appear on its devices, as well as its 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales. 
Many of the new features allow users to safeguard data, trusting the information to the Apple brand. Users will be able to scan ID cards in participating U.S. states, and the cards will be encrypted in a user's digital wallet, along with credit cards and transit cards in some U.S. cities. It is working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to accept the digital IDs at airports.
In many cases, Apple itself cannot see all the information. The company has updated the paid version of its iCloud storage service to include a service that obscures a user's Web-browsing habits, even from Apple. Another new iCloud feature will let users hide their real email address, which has become increasingly used as an identifier for digital marketers to track users. Apple said iCloud pricing will not change with the new features.
Apple also tweaked some of its apps and services in ways that could intensify its rivalries with  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams, both of which gained prominence during the pandemic.
It updated its FaceTime video chat app to allow scheduling calls with multiple attendees and making the software compatible with Android and Windows devices.
Apple also introduced what it calls in-app events, a way for developers to host live events within apps and have those events featured in real time in the App Store. Video game developers, for example, could host live tournaments and market those on the App Store, which Apple's current systems are not built to handle.
The move could intensify competition with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which on Monday said it was planning to launch an online events business that would be free until 2023 and thereafter will charge commissions lower than Apple's 30% fees for the App Store.
Several of the other features Apple introduced Monday, such as the ability to snap a photo of a sign and use artificial intelligence to pluck out the written text, have been present on the rival Android operating system for several years.
The rest of Apple's conference is dedicated to technical sessions for developers, some of whom have bristled at its controls and fees. 
Those issues have come under regulatory scrutiny and are at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, in which a federal judge is considering how to rule.
Apple has said its App Store practices increase the market for mobile software by creating an environment for paid apps that consumers trust, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team did not address frayed developer relations during the presentation.

Not all developers have negative sentiments, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive at Creative Strategies, who has been surveying Apple developers and found more than 90% have no plans to stop making apps for Apple devices. 
However, some complaints are widespread, with more than half of developers saying fees should be capped at 10%, and many wanting more clarity around reasons for rejecting apps from the App Store and how to resolve such issues, Bajarin said.

However, the rising demand for pet food, medications, diagnostic devices and solutions suggest a positive outlook for pet care spending in 2021. As such, we think Zoetis (ZTS) and IDEXX (IDXX) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Read on for details.Popular veterinary pharmaceutical company Zomedica Corporation (ZOM) has had a remarkable run, gaining 695.6% over the past nine months. This was driven primarily by the positive feedback on its Truforma diagnostic device, which counts T4 and TSH hormone concentration in pets’ bloodstream. However, the company has not been able to generate substantial revenue from Truforma sales in the first quarter of 2021. ZOM plans to supply the product directly going forward, which might lead to depressed sales margins. Furthermore, ZOM's relative overvaluation compared to its peers has been a concern for some time. In terms of trailing-12-month EV/Sales, ZOM’s 43.28kx is significantly higher than the 7.79 x industry average. And the stock is currently trading 68.7% below its 52-week high of $2.91. Its poor quarterly financials and unfavorable analyst sentiment makes it best avoided now.
However, the pet industry has been on a growth trajectory, driven by increased pet adoption during the pandemic and huge spending on pet food medications and other products. The U.S. pet industry reported a record $103.60 billion in sales in 2020. Pet companies are currently focusing on the research and development of viable drugs, vaccines, diagnostic devices and other pet-friendly products to capitalize on the growing demand. The industry’s sales are expected to rise 5.8% year-over-year to hit $109.60 billion in 2021. Furthermore, the global pet care market is expected to grow at a 5.6% CAGR over the next seven years to hit $325.74 billion by 2028.
Given this backdrop, we believe it is wise to invest in relatively better pet stocks  Zoetis Inc . (NYSE:ZTS) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX) that have the potential to outperform ZOM in the near term, given their impressive product launches, higher-than-industry profitability and impressive financials.

Because major EV companies have been scaling back production amid rising costs, their current valuations look expensive. Thus, we think it might be wise to avoid Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Workhorse Group (WKHS) for now. Let’s discuss.The electric vehicle industry (EV) boom last year, driven by rising concerns regarding climate change, multiple government subsidies, and federal plans to phase out fossil fuel powered vehicles, drove a record level of EV sales in 2020. The IEA reported a record 3 million new electric car registrations in 2020, up 41% from the previous year. This sales level came in at a time when the global automobile market contracted by 16% due to the pandemic-led recession.
However, a global semiconductor shortage has emerged as a major hindrance to the growth of the EV industry, worsened by several natural and man-made calamities. According to consulting firm AlixPartners, the global automotive industry is projected to lose $110 billion in revenue in 2021 due to the ongoing chip shortage. Indeed, due to the rising prices of processor chips, EV manufacturers are scaling down their operations as production costs rise significantly. Consequently, several EV companies’ revenue and earnings growth estimates should remain low for the coming quarters.
Given the bleak growth outlook, the current valuations of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) seem unsustainable. Thus, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors dumped Peru's currency and stocks on Monday as results of the weekend's knife-edge presidential election showed socialist candidate Pedro Castillo edging ahead of conservative rival Keiko Fujimori. 
Though the final result may not be known for days, the latest count showed Castillo and Fujimori almost neck-and-neck with over 94% of the vote counted and the remaining rural areas expected to favour Castillo, the son of peasant farmers.
Peru's financial markets have suffered since Castillo scored a surprise first-round victory back in April on promises of more state control of the country's mining, energy and telecoms industries. 
With traders sensing the vote might be edging in his favour, the sol currency sank 2.5% against the dollar, its largest daily drop in seven years, while Lima's main stock market slumped over 7%. 
""A Castillo win would add significant downside risk to our short- and medium-term growth and (foreign exchange) forecasts, given his pledges to nationalize the mining sector and rewrite the constitution,"" said economist Debora Reyna of Oxford Economics in a research note.
""If Keiko (Fujimori) is elected president, the key risk is a short-term deterioration of public finances, as she plans to boost public spending to prop up her popularity.""
The election came after a turbulent year in Peru. The Andean nation has churned through three presidents since late 2020, has the world's highest per-capita COVID-19 death toll, and experienced its worst economic crash in three decades.
Fujimori, the 46-year-old daughter of a jailed former president, who has herself run for president twice before, has pledged to follow the free-market model and maintain economic stability in Peru, the world’s second-largest copper producer.
Castillo has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state, take a larger portion of profits from mining firms and nationalize key industries.
The sol has fallen more than 8.5% against the U.S. dollar since an early April peak as the uncertainty has deepened.
That is despite the country's central bank using the equivalent of $11 billion, or 5.4% of GDP, to intervene in the currency market either through direct buying or via swaps, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated.
""Whoever wins, probably Peru is not going to have a great next five years,"" Federico Kaune, global EM senior portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management, had said ahead of the election, due to the fact politics would remain deeply divided. 
Citi's Latin America economist, Esteban Tamayo, added that with the vote count moving in Castillo's favour, markets were facing a potentially sharp selloff. 
""If Castillo is confirmed the victor, we expect further underperformance,"" he said. ""In that case, after any initial selloff, we would consider adding some risk in PEN (Peruvian sol) in the event of a large overshoot.""
Investors were also wary of potential social unrest in the country. Lucia Dammert, a Peruvian academic based in Chile, predicted the coming days would be volatile, with potential challenges to the votes and requests for recounts. 
She forecast protests particularly if Fujimori were declared the winner.

""Unless the too-close-to-call scenario depicted by the quick count proves wrong, we seem poised for a number of days of heightened uncertainty ahead,"" JPMorgan said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses Monday as investors awaited further catalysts, while a surge in Biogen helped biotech stocks to their best day of the year so far.
The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4%, or 126 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.23%.
Stocks were on the back foot amid a lack of investor appetite to make risky bets ahead of the key data due later this week including the consumer inflation data due Thursday.
Inflation remains a hotly debated topic as investors fear that if price pressures spiral out of control, the Federal Reserve could be forced to tighten too aggressively, potentially risking a recession.
The weaker jobs report, released Friday, meanwhile, reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve is unlikely to taper its bond purchases sooner than expected.

Clean energy and electric vehicle companies are at the forefront of the world's shift to a sustainable and eco-friendly future. And as such, they have been attracting significant investor attention. But, while the share-price gains of many of these companies have been backed by their fundamental strength, some players with weak financials have gained solely based on investor optimism over the industry’s potential. So, both strong and weak stocks in this space have been discussed in Reddit chat rooms, such as the well-known r/wallstreetbets.
Clean Energy Fuels (NYSE:UUUU) Corp. (CLNE) and Workhorse Group, Inc. (WKHS) have been found on the Reddit wallstreetbets dashboard. And we think these stocks are worth watching because Wall Street analysts expect them to rally by more than 20% in the next 12 months.

Investing.com -- Stocks struggled to find direction for much of the trading session on Monday, as both cyclicals and growth stocks failed to draw investor appetite ahead of key data due later this week.
Consumer inflation data is coming on Thursday. Inflation remains a sensitive topic as investors fear price pressures could force the Federal Reserve to tighten aggressively, potentially risking a recession.
The weaker jobs report last Friday, however, confirmed expectations the Fed is unlikely to back off from its bond purchases sooner than expected.
Cyclicals stocks like materials and industrials – which tend to move in tandem with the economy – were the day’s worst performers despite Wall Street’s bullish view on the sectors.
One of the biggest moves came in shares of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), which popped more than 50% in the early afternoon after the Food and Drug Administration announced approval for the pharma’s Alzheimer’s drug, the first approval of a drug to treat the illness in nearly 20 years.
Other pharma stocks rose, as well, including Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), which has its own Alzheimer’s treatment awaiting approval. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. JOLTs
Data on job openings are due out Tuesday. The number of job openings at the end of April is seen making a new high of 8.3 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com, up from 8.12 million on the last business day of March, which was also a record. The data will be released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
2. Small business outlook
Many companies have complained they can’t find workers as they reopen, but that’s not stopping small businesses. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index in the U.S. for April was 99.8. Data for the month of May will be released Tuesday at 6:00 AM ET by the National Federation of Independent Business.
3. Oil stockpiles
The price of U.S. benchmark Crude Oil WTI Futures is close to $70 a barrel and the latest weekly crude inventory data could influence the price more. On Tuesday the petroleum industry issues its report for the last week, ahead of the government data that comes out Wednesday morning. API’s weekly crude oil report showed a draw of 5.36 million barrels for the week ended May 27. American Petroleum Institute will release data for the week ended June 3 at 4.30 PM ET.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 struggled for direction Monday, as investors awaited further catalysts, while the AMC-inspired meme trade rages on.
The S&P 500 fell 0.13%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.40%, or 137 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.40%.
Stocks were on the back foot amid a lack of investor appetite to make risky bets ahead of the key data due later this week including the consumer inflation data due Thursday.
Inflation remains a hotly debated topic as investors fear that if price pressures spiral out of control, the Federal Reserve could be forced to tighten too aggressively, potentially risking a recession.
The weaker jobs report, released Friday, meanwhile, reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve is unlikely to taper its bond purchases sooner than expected.
""Given the lack of clarity from the labor market data as well as the temporary labor supply constraints, we continue to expect that the Fed will provide an advance notice of tapering at the September FOMC meeting,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Monday he has asked staff to tighten up a legal safe-harbor that allows corporate executives to buy or sell company stock without running afoul of insider trading laws.
The ""Rule 10b5-1"" trading plans allow insiders to execute trades in the company's stock on a pre-determined future date, providing legal protection against potential allegations of insider trading on material nonpublic information. 
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats and consumer advocates have long complained the rules for adopting, amending or canceling trades are far too lax, allowing insiders to game the system and reap windfalls at the expense of ordinary investors. 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on Monday that SEC staff should consider tougher restrictions on such changes and increased transparency.
""When insiders or companies adopt 10b5-1 plans, there’s currently no cooling-off period required before they make their first trade,"" Gensler said at the Wall Street Journal's CFO Network event. ""I worry that some bad actors could perceive this as a loophole to participate in insider trading."" 
While the rules do not treat canceling a trading plan as a securities transaction, Gensler added that doing so may be ""as economically significant as carrying out an actual transaction.""
He had also asked staff to consider more robust disclosures regarding the adoption, modification and terms of the trading plans. An SEC proposal could also curb the number of plans executives can set up and reduce the risk of improper trading by requiring insiders to wait up to six months after a plan’s conception before trading, he added.

Dennis Kelleher, head of Washington-based nonprofit Better Markets, said the proposed changes were long overdue. 
""Executives have been able to game the system, including engaging in de facto insider trading, by creating, changing, and canceling these stock trading plans in secret and virtually at will.""

Group of Seven finance ministers on Saturday voiced support for proposed rules reallocating a portion of profits above a 10% margin to be taxed in other countries, and Amazon has estimated a global operating margin of 7.1% this year. But two people familiar with the negotiations said Amazon will be included, with the particulars of how to design the policy to capture the company still being discussed.
Amazon shares dropped as much as 1.1% to $3,172.20, briefly hitting a session low, on the news.
Negotiators are working on the mechanism, the people said. That could include setting a threshold for individual operations that targets Amazon’s more-profitable cloud computing business, rather than the whole company, whose margins are weighed down by heavy investment and thin retail profits.
European leaders have insisted on a way of including all the largest online companies in the tax plan. Group of 20 finance ministers are trying to reach a preliminary agreement in July.
Asked at a press conference Saturday if companies such as Amazon and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). would be captured by the deal, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said they would be, though she didn’t say how Amazon would qualify given its lower profit margins.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman on Monday declined to elaborate on how Amazon would be part of the scope. An Amazon spokesperson referred to the company’s statement Saturday in support of the G-7 agreement.

Already, there are some signs that they are gaining traction such as a drop in COMEX inventories and an increase in PSLV's AUM. Find out 3 ETFs you should consider buying to take advantage of the next, potential short squeeze.The recent run-up in stocks like AMC (AMC), Blackberry (TSX:BB), and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) is an indication that traders on Reddit and social media will continue to be a major influence during this bull market. In fact, this is now the second short squeeze that they have organized and engineered. At the beginning of the year, we experienced the first meme stock rally which caused GameStop (NYSE:GME) to go from $17 to $483 in 13 trading sessions. 
These moves are a testament to the power of social media, the infectious memes about punishing short-sellers on Wall Street, and the human desire to be part of a collective that is focused on a mission. Therefore while many investors may be dismissive of this new trend, I find it fascinating from a human interest perspective and believe that it can lead to profitable trades if we can anticipate the crowd’s next moves.
Something on my radar is a new Reddit message board - WallStreetSilver - which is attempting to engineer a short squeeze in the silver market. This follows an earlier failed attempt in February which caused silver’s price to spike from $23 to $28 in a few trading sessions, however, these gains were quickly reversed. Their mistake was in buying SLV, an ETF that buys futures contracts. However, this group now has a much more promising approach which I believe is more likely to be successful, if they can attract more people to their cause. Therefore, investors should consider buying silver ETFs like the Sprott Physical Silver Trust ETF (PSLV), Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), and the ETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ).

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Blue-Chip Firms Ramp Up Debt Sales While the Going Is Still Good,"(Bloomberg) -- High-grade companies and banks are borrowing at an increasingly rapid clip as signs accumulate that the best funding conditions since 2007 may not last.
Monday’s onslaught of 12 new U.S. investment-grade deals is the biggest daily count since March 3. Borrowers came from across the spectrum -- large banks like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., bellwethers such as Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co., household names General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)., and a handful of utilities.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). sees “market factors that should encourage high-rated, lower-levered firms to take advantage of a market hungry for dollar-denominated spread product by pulling forward borrowing plans,” strategists led by Daniel Sorid wrote Friday. Citi’s base case for annual high-grade supply is $1.35 trillion, which would trail last year’s record but still exceed supply totals for 2018 and 2019.
Three high-grade issuers considered bond sales on Friday, the morning of a major economic data release. While only one actually priced, sales at such a time are rare, showing how companies are more aggressively taking advantage of market windows.
Historically cheap funding costs, a desire to get in before a summer lull and the Federal Reserve’s decision to unwind its secondary market corporate credit facility are all spurring companies on. They have been somewhat insulated from the impact of higher government yields by spreads over Treasuries staying razor thin.
Beyond attractive costs, some high-grade borrowers may view the Fed’s decision to sell corporate bond holdings as a signal that the central bank no longer thinks it needs to be buyer of last resort, Bloomberg strategist Brian Smith wrote Saturday. That points to the possibility of wider spreads and may be driving issuance, Smith added.
Another potential factor accelerating issuance: a desire to get deals done before investors and underwriters take off for summer vacations.
“Seasonality shows a modest pace of issuance as we approach the summer with more holidays and as market participants go on vacations,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen wrote in a note distributed Monday.
U.S.
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the world’s biggest energy company, hired advisers including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for its first dollar-denominated Islamic bond sale.
Europe
Public sector issuers may lead this week’s new bond offerings in Europe, after a slew of new mandates from the sector including from rescue fund EFSF and Agence Francaise de Developpement.
Asia
The Asia ex-Japan dollar bond market started the week with at least three debt offerings on Monday.

The shares of these companies have gained momentum over the past few months, which they are expected to maintain in the near term. So, read on for some details on these names.Even though the economic activities in the United States are returning now to pre-pandemic levels thanks to a rapid vaccination drive, the government’s measures to reduce vaccine hesitancy, and supportive policies, the stock market remains volatile. This can be attributed primarily to investors’ concerns over rising inflation.
Amid this environment, turning to momentum investing could be rewarding because stocks that have managed to gain momentum over the past few months might be able to maintain it in the near- to mid-term irrespective of volatility witnessed by the broader market. Investors’ increasing interest in momentum stocks is evident in the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) 11.6% returns over the past three months.
Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ), SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.

However, the rotation by investors away from tech stocks to cyclical stocks has brought many tech stocks down to trade now at reasonable prices. As such, we think Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) look undervalued at their current price levels given their immense growth potential. Read on.The resumption of economic activities has led investors to shift their focus to cyclical stocks to capitalize on their solid growth prospects. Consequently, many highly priced technology stocks have lost investors’ love lately and are trading at reasonable prices now. Concerns about rising inflation are also playing a major role in investors’ decisions to rotate away from expensive tech stocks. Tech stocks’ weakness is evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 9.2% gains over the past three months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 11.1% returns.
Nevertheless, we think the tech sector holds immense growth potential. In addition to the continued, global digital transformation, increasing use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and augmented reality (AR) in almost all industries could keep driving the sector’s growth.
So, we think it could be wise to bet now on Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM) and Netgear, Inc. (NTGR) that are currently trading at discounts to their peers but hold immense growth potential.

""Ever since I was five years old, I've dreamed of traveling to space. On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother,"" Bezos, who is one of the richest people in the world, said in an Instagram post.
Bezos, who is due to step down as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief on July 5, will join the winner of an auction for a seat on the first space flight from Blue Origin.
Bezos, fellow billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson have been investing billions of dollars on their rocket startups, but Bezos will be the first of the three to actually travel into space on a rocket developed by his own company. 
The Blue Origin spacecraft, which is set to carry Bezos and others, has undergone 15 test flights, none of which had any passengers onboard.
Blue Origin closed the first round of the auction last month and said it had received more than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries, without disclosing the highest bid from the round.
The current highest bid stood at $2.8 million in the ongoing second round of auction, according to Blue Origin's website. (www.blueorigin.com)
Its New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes.
The capsule features six observation windows and are nearly three times as tall as those on a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 jetliner and the largest ever used in space, Blue Origin said. 
Bezos's rocket startup is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.
The startup was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of rival plans from Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and other considerations, Reuters reported in 2018, but its thinking may have changed.

Global insurers as still in the early stages when it comes to covering liabilities surrounding space travel. Life insurers do not ask about space tourism or exclude it from their coverage.
""You will sign this waiver of liability and provided there's no gross negligence or willful misconduct, if you don't survive, unfortunately, there's probably no financial recovery,"" said Richard Parker of Assure Space, a unit of insurer AmTrust Financial.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares were up in double digits Monday on hope that its therapy for treating Alzheimer’s will soon get the approval of the U.S. drugs regulator.
The strength in the drugmaker’s shares followed the Food and Drug Administration’s nod for rival Biogen's (NASDAQ:BIIB) aducanumab, the first time in nearly 20 years that the regulator has approved a medicine to treat the fatal illness.
Alzheimer’s is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks.
There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 2050. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide.
Eli’s donanemab is a monoclonal antibody and has completed phase-2 trials.
The FDA has given an accelerated approval to Biogen’s aducanumab as the regulator was convinced that it provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. Further trials of the drug will continue and meet the FDA norms for final approval."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Safety concerns about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine along with overall flagging demand for vaccinations have slowed its U.S. rollout to a crawl, leaving close to half of the 21 million doses produced for the United States sitting unused. 
J&J’s vaccine was supposed to be an important tool for reaching rural areas and vaccine hesitant Americans because it requires only one shot and has less stringent storage requirements than the two-dose vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.  
But Americans have largely eschewed it over the six weeks it has been back in use after a pause to study a rare safety issue, according to data from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and interviews with health officials and pharmacists in eight states across the country.
""We went from having a waiting list to give somebody a shot to having maybe one shot a day or four shots a day,"" Michelle Vargas, owner of independent Lamar Family Pharmacy in Lamar, South Carolina, said of plunging demand for the J&J shot in the small rural community. ""They're concerned for their safety. I think that's the biggest hurdle right now.""
In the week ended May 25, fewer than 650,000 Americans received the J&J shot, accounting for about 5% of total vaccinations administered and down from nearly 3 million in the week leading up to the pause, CDC data shows. 
Demand for all the vaccines has slowed since mid-April, but the drop has been significantly steeper for the J&J shot. 
Graphic: U.S. vaccinations by manufacturer https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-JOHNSONJOHNSON/jbyprgqbgve/chart.png 
The slowdown may mean some J&J doses will expire unused at a time when global demand for any COVID-19 vaccine is high. J&J doses will be among the 25 million donated by the United States announced by the White House last Thursday.
At least 13 lots of the vaccine have expiration dates of June 27 or earlier, according to a J&J website. It is not clear how many doses that reflects, but the vaccine has a 3-month shelf life and most doses were sent out by early April, including 11 million in the first week. J&J has another 100 million doses on hand but shipment timing is uncertain.
A J&J spokesperson declined to comment on the number of doses expiring before the end of June.
J&J is working with the U.S. government and health authorities to support use of its vaccine, the spokesperson said in a statement, calling it an important tool in the global fight against COVID-19.
""We remain committed to helping end this deadly pandemic as quickly as possible,"" J&J said.
'LET'S JUST STICK WITH PFIZER AND MODERNA'
The CDC and Food and Drug Administration paused use of the J&J vaccine for nearly two weeks in mid-April to investigate links to cases of a very rare, potentially life-threatening condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots and low platelet counts.
Regulators decided that the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risk. The condition has also been linked to AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine.
David Kohll, pharmacist at Kohll's Pharmacy with six locations in Nebraska, said before the safety issue, several companies arranged for him to provide J&J vaccines to employees. 
""Some of them are trucking companies and some others with more blue-collar or hard-to-get-to employees. They wanted us to go with all J&J,"" Kohll said. After the safety pause, ""probably 80 percent of them said 'Let's just stick with Pfizer and Moderna.'""
Public health officials said during the pause they found the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were adequate substitutes in the mobile and walk-up clinics where they had been using J&J.
""Once we get them in for the first dose, we've got them and they will come back for the second dose,"" said Dr. Karen Landers, a public health official in Alabama. 
Use of J&J's shot has fallen in states like Wyoming and Alabama with low vaccine uptake and in places like Maine and Oregon, where vaccination rates are high, according to state and CDC data.
Not everyone has seen a sharp drop-off in demand for the J&J vaccine. Richard  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK), who runs the Bayshore Pharmacy in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., said he has seen plenty of interest, particularly from seniors who are at lower risk for the clotting issue and prefer the single injection.
J&J has said it is not currently selling the vaccine for a profit. The lower demand this year is immaterial to its financials, SVB Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said at the time of the safety pause.
But competitors Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna could benefit as developed countries sign future deals for booster shots. Pfizer and BioNTech's EU deal alone could be worth at least $16 billion - as much as double that if all options are exercised - for the companies through 2023, based on current prices.

Rollout of the J&J shot has had other stumbles as well. Regulators shut down production at the largest U.S. plant making the vaccine due to cross-contamination at the site with the AstraZeneca shot. No new doses have been distributed in the United States since mid-May. 
U.S. regulators are deciding whether it is safe to release up to 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine produced at that plant. The dwindling U.S. demand could provide additional flexibility to donate millions of doses.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co plans to offer subscriptions for its Onstar Guardian security services to anyone in the United States or Canada who wants to download a smartphone app, expanding beyond owners of GM vehicles in a step to generate recurring revenue.
Onstar Guardian services, including roadside assistance and crash response dispatching, will be offered through an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android smartphone app to people who don't drive GM vehicles for $15 a month after a one-month trial, GM said. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is pushing to extend Onstar's reach - and its monthly subscription revenues - as part of a broader plan to expand the automaker's sources of income beyond manufacturing cars and trucks.
GM sees the Onstar Guardian app as a way to tap a $30 billion market for safety and security services, said Santiago Chamorro, the automaker's vice president for connected services.
The Guardian location and emergency notification services could be offered as part of an auto insurance bundle, or marketed to people who want location-based emergency response services independent of a car, he said.
Onstar is beginning on Monday a campaign to promote the service, including a television ad that shows a concerned daughter using the app to track down her father who has wandered away from home.
""Our ultimate goal is even if you're walking with the dog around the corner...we want to be there with our customers,"" Chamorro said.

Onstar also is developing new insurance offers and a data analytics service for fleet operators.
GM, in its announcement, did not say how much additional revenue it expects from offering Onstar Guardian beyond the GM vehicle owner population. The company does not break out Onstar's financial results.

The UAW on Sunday rejected a tentative deal reached in May for its nearly 2,900 members at Volvo's New River Valley truck assembly operations in Dublin, Virginia. Talks began for an agreement in February.

Volvo said in a statement that the UAW's decision was difficult to understand, but it was confident of reaching a deal with the union. 
The New River Valley plant employs more than 3,300 people. It has added more than a thousand jobs since the last union agreement in 2016 and is expected to add nearly 600 positions in 2021, Volvo said. [https://refini.tv/3pxhvt4]

417,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",4 Transportation Stocks for a Soaring Global Economy,"The transportation industry’s recovery is well underway as major economies around the globe continue to reopen and recover. With this, transportation companies  United Parcel  (UPS), FedEx (FDX), Old Dominion (ODFL), and Landstar (LSTR) are expected to benefit from the rising cross-border transportation activities. So, let’s discuss these companies’ prospects in more detail.The transportation industry was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but its recovery is now well underway. With the reopening of major economies worldwide, transportation companies are expected to see rising demand for their cross-border services. Indeed. the global transportation services market is projected to hit $7.8 trillion by 2027, growing at a 3.4% CAGR from 2020. With e-commerce growth expected to continue this year and beyond, and with continued technological advances, the industry is expected to keep growing.
Investors' interest in the transportation industry is evidenced by the First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) and the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF’s (XTN) 24.8% and 24.7% returns, respectively, so far this year. This compares to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 13% gains over this period.
Given the industry’s solid growth prospects along with the recovery of the global economy, we think it is wise to bet on prominent global transportation players United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL), and  Landstar System , Inc. (LSTR). They are well positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

The $10-billion transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of this year, includes the assumption of the data center operator's existing debt.
The deal also includes a 40-day go-shop period, which will let QTS solicit and consider other proposals, the companies said.

Deutsche Post DHL confirmed that its Italian subsidiary DHL Supply Chain had been notified by prosecutors in Milan about an investigation centred on alleged tax irregularities.
""Since the company believes that it has always operated in full compliance with Italian tax laws, it will provide to the investigators all the cooperation needed to quickly and satisfactorily clarify its position,"" Deutsche Post DHL said in a statement.
Milan prosecutors allege that a ""transportation and logistics multinational"" in Italy failed to pay value-added taxes and pension contributions due for staff, police said on Monday, by relying on contractors instead of hired workers. 
The unnamed logistics company used workers provided by a consortium of 23 local cooperative firms, the police said. The asset seizure order, of which Reuters saw a copy, identified the company in question as Deutsche Post DHL's Italian unit. 
Police confirmed they had seized more than 20 million euros of assets following the investigation and searches in Milan and nearby cities.
The seizure order said two executives of the German firm's Italian subsidiary were under investigation for tax fraud. Under Italian law, companies can be held responsible for crimes committed by their executives.
Milan prosecutors Giovanna Cavalleri and Paolo Storari said in the document that by using an external workforce, DHL Supply Chain had made significant savings on labour costs while exploiting workers and competing unfairly with rivals.

""Compliance is and always has been a core principle of all DHL business units and guides all our actions at Deutsche Post DHL Group,"" the German company said.

CCOO, the largest union in the Spanish financial sector, said the bank had signalled it was open to reduce job cuts and would therefore prolong the negotiations with the bank until June 29. Talks were initially expected to finish on June 10.
In April, Caixabank said it was planning to cut 8,291 jobs, one of the largest in Spanish history, though it later offered to bring that number down to around 7,605, to adapt to a client shift towards online banking.

LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union is asking financial market participants to suggest legislative changes that would help them transfer clearing in euro derivatives from London to the bloc as Britain's stock exchange offered an olive branch.
Britain's access to the EU financial market was largely severed after Brexit fully took effect on Dec. 31, 2020 and the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG)'s clearing unit LCH has permission to serve EU customers only until June 2022.
EU officials say they want full sight of large-scale activity by EU regulated banks and asset managers in order to monitor any potential threats to the bloc's financial stability.
The EU's executive European Commission is due to hold workshops with customers of clearing houses about shifting euro interest rate swaps contracts worth trillions of euros from London to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt.
""How long would be needed to transfer positions or flows identified as clearable inside the Union? How could the time needed be potentially reduced?"" an EU document seen by Reuters said.
The EU executive wants to know if the costs of shifting clearing could be reduced, and what changes in EU law or rules applied by regulators would help.
""What supervisory measures could be taken to facilitate the transfer? What steps could market participants undertake to contribute to the process?""
Euro clearing has long been a Brexit battleground as the City of London seeks to minimise damage from EU exit.
The LSE on Friday fought back by setting out key data on clearing, concluding that forced relocation would bump up costs for customers and put EU firms at a competitive disadvantage to international peers.
""Restricting access to the EU economy and the euro would place EU firms in competitive disadvantage against their peers and would also increase risk to financial stability both in the EU and more widely,"" the exchange said.
LCH is already directly supervised by the EU securities watchdog ESMA, LSE said.
In a bid to win over the EU to extend access to the bloc beyond next year, the LSE said it would be happy for its London clearer to be supervised by the European Central Bank, which has long sought a direct say over euro clearing.
The LSE said the ECB has powers under EU law to require LCH to open a deposit account with it to give the central bank more oversight over the clearer's payment flows in euros.
""LCH Ltd is fully supportive of this requirement,"" LSE said.

EU companies accounted for only 27.1% of euro-denominated interest rate derivatives clearing volumes at LCH in London in 2020, with 72.9% coming from non-EU firms, the LSE said.
This illustrated the international use of the euro and the need for EU firms to access international clearers, the LSE said.

Investing.com – Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares were inching towards a 1% gain Monday as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reiterated its bullish outlook on the stock with a $300 target.
The target is 18.5% higher than the stock’s current level of $253.
“Multiple years of solid top-line growth, expanding margins and an expanding multiple have investors concerned the best results are behind the company,” analyst Keith Weiss wrote.
Weiss discussed the software and cloud giant’s growth durability and further margin expansion in the note and pointed out that the company had delivered superior returns over a long period of time to deserve a bullish outlook.
“. . .Our primary research points to an attractive path going forward, as evidenced by CIOs' view that Microsoft should gain the most IT wallet share with the move to the cloud. More specifically, CIOs see Microsoft as the preferred vendor across hybrid cloud, IaaS, and PaaS workloads,” Weiss wrote.
The analyst said longer-term, the higher-margin, recurring gaming revenue should help offset margin pressures from hardware, particularly as the mix of gaming revenue continues to shift away from console sales.
Saturday, the Redmond, Washington-based giant secured the U.S. antitrust approval to buy artificial intelligence and speech technology company  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $16 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shares in U.S. technology giants barely reacted on Monday to a landmark global minimum corporate tax deal agreed between the world's richest nations, with analysts saying it will take the backing of low-tax nations to have any meaningful impact on the companies' bottomlines.
The Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed on Saturday to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15% and the focus now shifts to the G20 countries for a wider agreement on the new tax proposals.
Analysts say the tax deal wouldn't hurt companies unless it's agreed with tax-haven countries such as Ireland, whose economy has been booming with the influx of billions of dollars in investment from multinationals due to lower taxes.
In morning U.S. trading, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) dipped 0.2% to 0.5%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) edged up 0.1% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 0.6%. The benchmark S&P 500 index was down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was little changed.
Europe's tech stocks index slipped 0.1%.
""The details of the implementation are still to be ironed out and potentially further watered down,"" said Marija Vertimane, senior strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
Dublin, which has resisted European Union attempts to harmonize its tax rules, is unlikely to accept a higher minimum rate without a fight.
""I would treat the current proposal as a small positive for the market,"" Vertimane added pointing to levies being lower than what was initially discussed.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp in Charlottesville, Virginia, called it ""neutral"" for the market. 
While any tax hike is ""negative to the way people value stocks,” the agreement could indicate that U.S. President Joe Biden will be less aggressive in seeking an increase of the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28%, Tuz said.
“They might reduce the maximum they were trying to seek, which in general I would think would be a better thing for a lot of U.S. companies,"" Tuz said. ""The great majority probably do not operate outside the U.S. The large ones do, but plenty don’t.” 
The G7's proposals are seen targeting technology companies that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual properly held in low-tax jurisdictions.

""The immediate market implications are likely to be minimal,"" said Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB), economics & strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt.
""No G7 nation currently charges that low a rate and the details, including agreement from numerous smaller countries, require plenty of work.""

The price decline can be attributed primarily to the problems TSLA is facing because of a global semiconductor shortage. The question is, given the EV industry’s immense growth potential and TSLA’s dominant position in the market, is it wise to buy the stock at the current price level? Let’s find out.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is known for its electric cars, such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S and Cybertruck. The company also designs, manufactures, installs and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products, and it is expected to expand into the restaurant business space as well. However, TSLA has been associated with many controversies and is facing several challenges, including vehicle recalls and a global semiconductor shortage.
The stock has lost more than 15% so far this year to close Friday’s trading session at $599.05, 33.5% below its 52-week high.
Company CEO Elon Musk said this month that TSLA has been forced to raise the prices of its cars due to a global shortage of computer chips. This could affect its sales. Also, the company is losing its market dominance in China as Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers ramp up their production. Musk is also being scrutinized by the SEC for his tweets. It is speculated that his tweets have violated the terms of a settlement agreement that required him to have his tweets pre-approved by the company’s lawyers. So, we think TSLA’s near-term prospects seem uncertain.

(Reuters) - Video conferencing services have for years boasted that their technology is ""intuitive"" to use or ""integrated"" to function with other tools, but now vendors such as Google and Cisco can hardly go a blog post without trumpeting a different attribute: ""inclusive.""
The latest buzzword, and the product development that accompanies it, shows how tech companies are newly focused on assuring Black users and other persons of color that online chat products will not leave them out in the cold. The changes stem in part from the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement - which has prompted vendors and customers alike to think beyond the needs of a white, English-speaking audience - and the pandemic, which created a large ""remote"" workforce heavily dependent on technology. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google this month plans to deploy an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that addresses the longstanding issue of darker skin tones being under-illuminated in video chats. 
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) in January launched a gesture-recognition feature to display a thumbs-up in Webex, taking pains to assure that skin tones would not affect performance. LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) Inc's GoToMeeting,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s Workplace are adding translation or pronunciation options in what they describe as an equity push.
""Technology is fundamentally today just not as inclusive as you want it to be,"" said Jeetu Patel, senior vice president and general manager for Cisco security and collaboration. Setting ""values and principles that a product should stand for"" has become essential, he said.
The tech industry has long been under fire for a poor record on workplace diversity and a failure to recognize the ways in which product design can perpetuate discrimination.
Worries about bias in video conferencing picked up last September after Colin Madland, a doctoral student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, tweeted a screenshot https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1307111818981146626 of a Black colleague appearing headless when deploying a virtual background on Zoom.
Studies of other AI cropping systems have shown they generate more errors with darker skin, in part because the data used to train them mostly included lighter examples. 
Zoom's chief diversity officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, told Reuters: ""Bias was not at play, but rather a combination of the user's distance from the camera, use of headphones, and seating position.""
Madland said the problem subsided after his colleague purchased a green screen and some ""snazzy lighting.""
For Zoom and its rivals, delivering on inclusion could provide an edge while vying for post-pandemic deals with clients - which are facing their own reckonings on diversity. 
Global spending on cloud-based conferencing is forecast to reach $5.41 billion this year, up from $5.02 billion in 2020, according to tech consultancy  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). It does not track market share, but analysts cite Zoom and Cisco as the leaders.
'NOT EQUALLY REPRESENTED'
The upcoming Google Meet feature tackles the problem of people appearing darker because of their surroundings, for example when sitting in front of a window, said Niklas Blum, a Google product leader involved with Meet. 
""Users with dark skin tones are not equally represented, and we want to build products for everyone,"" he said.
The AI separates users from their background, determines whether they are underexposed regardless of their skin tone, brightens the picture accordingly, and finally merges the background and foreground. 
Meet's virtual waiting room will prompt users to activate the lighting adjustment when it detects they could benefit from it, said Stéphane Hulaud, product lead for video quality and processing in Meet. 
Blum and Hulaud said Meet first identified the representation issues in video when launching a low-light enhancement for mobile calls well before the pandemic. Developing the latest feature took considerable time, but it led Meet to establish product inclusion testing procedures and mandate them for all of its work.
Google is pursuing additional fixes, too. Meet is pitching laptop makers and operating systems on sharing greater control over cameras' white balance and exposure. Internally, Google adopted minimum light reflectiveness requirements for conference room designs.
At Cisco, the new gesture-recognition option, when turned on, lets users hold up their thumb on camera for about a second to generate a virtual thumbs-up on screen.
Cisco trained its AI to focus on the shape outline and movement of the gesture in time and space, reducing potential issues from variance in skin tone, said Keith Griffin, a distinguished engineer at the company. 
Praying hands - for ""thank you"" - are among possible new gesture options to come, with a feature that interprets sign language an eventual goal. Webex also expects to add skin-tone options beyond yellow for the icons.
Mike Sharp (OTC:SHCAY), LogMeIn's chief product officer for unified communications and collaboration, said education clients have driven some of the company's ""inclusion"" updates.
For instance, forthcoming support for Spanish, Mandarin and other languages in voicemail prompts and transcriptions will benefit an unidentified California school district that wanted to better engage with its community, Sharp said.
Facebook Workplace, a suite of business communication tools, last month said video town hall hosts soon would see name pronunciations for workers posing written questions. 

Product head Ujjwal Singh said the pointers, which are AI-generated but editable, aimed to help executives at clients including Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc properly address colleagues and promote inclusion.
""I don’t want to mispronounce it to thousands of employees and look like I'm not in touch with the company,"" he said.

Investing.com -- Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) received federal approval for its controversial Alzheimer's drug. Shares jumped 58% in midday trading after being halted for the news.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug Monday, the first Alzheimer's treatment approved in 18 years. 
Aduhelm is the first treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the presence of amyloid beta plaques in the brain.  The clinical trials for Aduhelm were the first to show that a reduction in these plaques—a hallmark finding in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s—is expected to lead to a reduction in the clinical decline of this devastating form of dementia, the FDA said in a statement.
It's been a bumpy ride for the drug, with the FDA first saying it appeared to be effective, followed by an outside panel of agency advisers saying more data was needed, Bloomberg reported. The agency said today it concluded that the benefits of Aduhelm for patients with Alzheimer’s disease outweighed the risks of the therapy.
Although the Aduhelm data are complicated with respect to its clinical benefits, the FDA has determined that there is substantial evidence that Aduhelm reduces amyloid beta plaques in the brain and that the reduction in these plaques is reasonably likely to predict important benefits to patients. As a result of FDA’s approval of Aduhelm, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have an important and critical new treatment to help combat this disease, the agency said.
Alzheimer’s is the U.S.'s sixth leading cause of death. On average, a person with Alzheimer’s disease lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but some patients can live up to 20 years with the disease.  More than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease and this number is expected to grow as the population ages. 
Patient advocacy groups and some doctors rallied for the drug's approval, but some experts said there's a lack of compelling evidence that aducanumab can provide meaningful benefit, Reuters said.   
Biogen has estimated that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for treatment with aducanumab, and could result in billions in revenue for the company, likely at a cost to Medicare. 
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a drug pricing research group, said in May there's ""insufficient"" evidence that aducanumab provides a net health benefit. Any drug proven to halt progression of Alzheimer’s-related dementia could be fairly priced at $50,000 to $70,000 per year, Reuters reported.
The FDA said it will continue to monitor Aduhelm as it reaches the market and is requiring Biogen to conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit. ""If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market,"" the FDA said.

Investing.com -- Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) rose 1.5% after Atlantic Equities initiated coverage with an overweight rating.
""We see Etsy as a unique digital retail growth story, benefitting from a number of strong consumer trends, including the growth of digital commerce, and consumers' growing desire for more meaningful consumption,"" said analyst Daniela Nedialkova, according to StreetInsider. 
She placed a price target of $200 on the stock, which is about 22% higher than current levels. Shares soared almost 700% from the start of the pandemic in March 2020 to a record in March. Profit and sales jumped over the past 15 months because we were really bored and needed something to craft and something to buy. As the pandemic has eased in the U.S., shares have dropped about 30% since March.
""Etsy is highly differentiated from other digital pure-plays via its strong brand and community-building,"" Nedialkova wrote in a note. ""Its assortment of unique, handcrafted, personalised goods is another barrier to entry, and the community of sellers and buyers Etsy has already established would be difficult to replicate.""
Revenue growth should exceed 20% for the next several years, along with ongoing growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the analyst said.

By Sujata Rao and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - A global tax crackdown on multinationals has the backing of some of the world's biggest investors who say that using low-tax jurisdictions falls foul of the tenets they have committed to.
After years of negotiations over complex arrangements deployed by big companies, G7 finance ministers meeting in Britain on Friday are expected to declare their support for a global accord to address billions of dollars in lost tax revenue. [L2N2NI198]
This push is backed by some large investors, often state-run, who are scrutinising tax bills as well as profits.
""It's not about paying more tax, it's about paying the right amount of tax. We want companies to not engage in practices through transactions and legal structures which contribute to tax evasion,"" Kiran Aziz, sustainability analyst at Norway's KLP which manages $80 billion in pension assets, said. 
Research by the charity ActionAid International estimates that taxing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ""fairly"" on their 2020 profits could potentially generate $32 billion for G20 countries, while a 2018 academic study found global state coffers lose out on $200 billion a year.
The G7 goal is to set rules on taxing cross-border digital activities as well as a minimum tax rate above the level paid if companies channel profits via a low-tax country such as Ireland with its 12.5% corporate levy.
The United States has mooted a 15% rate, down from its original proposal of 21%. [L1N2M71D3] [L8N2MM7I6]
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which has set the pace on many environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues, recently fired a public salvo over what its CEO said was ""aggressive tax planning"" and lack of transparency on tax by selling stakes in seven companies, which it did not name.
Many funds interviewed by Reuters said they are escalating talks with companies and, if necessary, will dump shares.
KLP has quizzed around 100 companies, including Silicon Valley giants, joining hands with other Nordic investors.
""We believe taxes should be paid where actual economic value is generated,"" Aziz said of so-called ""profit-shifting"" whereby companies book income from sources like royalties, software or patents, not where it was earned but where tax rates are lower.
While KLP for now sees engagement as more effective than dropping investments outright, some have already gone that far.
Peter Rutter, head of equities at the 150 billion pound ($213 billion) Royal London Asset Management said he had sold or skipped buying shares in some companies on the basis of tax arrangements - often at the behest of his pension clients. 
""Corporates doing the right thing by way of taxation is a question we are increasingly getting,"" Rutter said. 
Corporate tax rates in select countries https://graphics.reuters.com/G7-FINANCE/TAX/yzdpxmdjgvx/chart.png 
'KNOW THE RISK'
Tax has typically played second-fiddle to issues such as climate, pollution and labour rights for investors, while most ESG ratings providers do not assess a company's tax planning while calculating scores. 
Many asset managers enjoy lower tax rates by domiciling funds in countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg.
However, MSCI included tax transparency last November and ESG ratings can be affected if for example tax bills differ significantly from what a company would have paid in its country of operation, its managing director Laura Nishikawa said.
""We are not saying 'divest now' but (urging clients) to be an informed investor. You need to know the risk and that's a fiduciary duty too,"" she added.
Many investors are preparing to investigate tax policies more thoroughly, regardless of when rules are tightened.
Dutch asset manager APG is hiring staff and planning to buy specialist data after its main client, pension fund ABP, established a tax and investment policy, senior corporate governance specialist Alex Williams (NYSE:WMB) said. 
Like KLP, APG has been grilling companies about their tax policies, Williams said. The fund, which manages almost 600 billion euros, recently managed to dissuade the new management of one investee firm from using tax havens. 
Then and now: corporate tax intake as % of GDP https://graphics.reuters.com/G7-FINANCE/TAX/bdwvkxdakpm/chart.png 
OCEANS APART?
Investor pressure over tax has largely emanated from Europe, particularly ESG-focused Scandinavia, with an apparent cultural difference among shareholders based in the United States.
U.S. retirement funds CalPERS, CalSTRS and Texas TRS all declined to comment, but an official at one large U.S. asset manager said tax is ""not an investor issue"" and should ""be led by those who ultimately impose the taxes"".
Tech companies have long defended their tax practices. Google, whose European headquarters is in the Irish capital Dublin, says it pays taxes where it is required to do so by law. 
Sudhir Roc-Sennet, U.S.-based head of ESG at Vontobel Asset Management, while backing moves to close tax-rate gaps, argues against demonising companies for legally using loopholes.
""It does not make sense for pensioners of the future to reduce their savings pot by asking companies to pay more tax,"" Roc-Sennet said.
""Should corporates pay a higher tax rate just because it's ethical? I don't think so. As investors, we think companies should operate to the best interest of their shareholders as long as they stay within the legal framework,"" he added
While that view remains widespread, accountants KPMG and BDO have warned clients of the risk to reputations and returns should tax rules be tightened.
One thing investors do agree on is that only coordinated action will stop companies using lower tax jurisdictions.

""In the absence of regulation it will be difficult to get companies to move. Turkeys are not going to vote for Christmas,"" Fred Kooij, chief investment officer at Tribe Impact Capital, a boutique impact investment firm, said.

Read more to find out.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been making a comeback from pandemic driven lows with the reopening of its recreational parks and resorts across the United States, following solid progress on the vaccination front. The huge success of DIS’ over-the-top (OTT) media platform Disney+ has also contributed to its recovery because the platform crossed the 100 million-paid-subscribers mark within just 16 months of its launch. DIS’ net income for its fiscal second quarter, ended April 3, came in at $912 million, representing a 95% rise year-over-year. Its EPS has improved 92% from the same period last year to $0.50.
Robert (Bob) Iger, DIS’ CEO for the past 15 years, retired in February last year to be executive chairman of DIS’ board.

Iger’s personal trading activity on DIS shares have made investors skeptical, however. Iger sold $98.70 million of DIS shares on June 1. The sale has been characterized as an attempt by Iger to diversify his portfolio. However, many analysts think that with a lower stake in the company, Iger’s position as the executive chairman of the board might be compromised.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) rose more than 3% Monday after Loop Capital rated it a buy with a price target of $140, which is 32% higher than its current level of $106.
The brokerage said the negative effect of the company’s treadmill recall has been more than accounted for.
The shares are off 40% of their January highs, a situation accelerated by the company’s April recall of its Tread+. Peloton had first ignored a regulator’s directive to recall the equipment after a child died.
The company relented as public outcry grew over rising incidents of injuries to children while the machine was in operation.
""Although we fully expect some impact from the recalls, we believe the impact will be short-lived and that management's guidance likely bakes in an excessive amount of conservatism,"" the Loop note said.
Peloton has plans to start manufacturing products at a new U.S. plant in 2023. Its launch in Australia is slated for the second half of 2021.
The home exercise disruptor has developed a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that combines equipment, proprietary networked software, and streaming digital fitness and wellness content.
The company has been able to develop a robust user base of more than 5.4 million across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Germany.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 09:35AM ET</span>",What now for the G7 tax deal on multinationals?,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - The G7's weekend agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate and arrangements for taxing multinationals paves the way for a broader deal in the coming weeks that could reshape cross-border taxation for years to come. 
Hailed as historic by its backers, the deal nonetheless contains much detail that still needs to be hammered out in time for countries of the wider G20 grouping to give it their support at a meeting scheduled for next month.
Here is what we know so far and what remains unclear:
WILL THE G7 DEAL APPLY WORLDWIDE?
The G7 deal for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15% sets the stage for the next step, which is a June 30-July 1 online meeting of the 139 countries negotiating future rules for cross-border taxation at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.
The countries aim to reach a consensus at the meeting on the details, as much technical work has already been done. Any accord from that meeting will then go before G20 finance ministers for endorsement when they meet in Venice on July 9-10.
The OECD and the United States have said a final sign-off might not be possible until a subsequent G20 meeting in October, because the U.S. position may not be firm by July as a domestic tax package will be going through Congress.
A G20 sign-off would mean the world's largest economies will implement it, so its reach would effectively be worldwide. 
IS THIS THE END OF TAX HAVENS? 
If the deal does not kill off tax havens entirely, it will make them far less attractive for many firms looking to cut their tax bill but also burnish their credentials with investors focusing on environmental, social and corporate governance.
The whole idea of the global minimum tax is that it gives countries the right to add a top-up tax on company profits in countries with tax rates lower than the global minimum.
Moreover, the G7 wants the minimum rate to be applied on a country-by-country basis rather than an average across the countries a company operates in - an approach considered far tougher on tax havens.
So if a U.S. company books profit in the British Virgin Islands, where there is no corporate tax, U.S. tax authorities could apply a 15% tax on those profits - if that's the global minimum figure finally agreed on.
HOW WILL THIS APPLY TO MULTINATIONALS?
A separate part of the international tax talks deals with how to divvy up governments' rights to tax excess, or non-routine, profit of the biggest multinationals, among them major digital companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
The G7 agreed that governments should get the right to tax at least 20% of the profit earned in their country by a multinational over a 10% margin. All indications are that the excess profit would also be subject to the global minimum.
That said, a lot of the metrics still need to be worked out and there is still scope for such companies to make their point of view heard within the debate.
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE LOOPHOLES?
Countries negotiating the global tax are likely to exempt some sectors. For example, extractive industries are likely to be carved out as companies usually pay royalties upfront to the government where the mines or oilfields are located. There has also been talk of carve-outs for certain financial services.
Officials say some nations want wiggle room on tax breaks for research and development. Others, such as China, want to protect low-tax economic zones they use to attract investment.
WILL THIS MEAN BIG GOVERNMENT WINDFALLS?
The OECD calculated in October that a global minimum tax could yield $100 billion a year, or 4% of global corporate income tax. That's probably on the low side as it was based on a 12.5% rate, which was the focus of talks at the time.
As big as the headline figure sounds, however, it's a drop in the ocean compared with the trillions of dollars that governments around the world have spent to keep their economies afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT ABOUT THE NETHERLANDS, LUXEMBOURG AND SWITZERLAND?
Such countries with tax advantages have seen the writing on the wall in recent years and have been closing tax loopholes, while trying to compete for foreign capital on terms other than just low taxes.
Ireland, where many U.S. tech companies have big operations, has said it will keep its 12.5% corporate tax rate regardless of what gets decided internationally.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe estimates that Ireland's annual corporate tax take will be about 20% or 2 billion euros lower than it otherwise would have been by 2025 due to the anticipated changes but does not expect a massive outflow of companies from its shores.
Switzerland, which is under pressure from abroad, has promised to eliminate special low tax rates that benefited about 24,000 foreign companies based there.
""Switzerland will take the necessary measures to continue to be a highly attractive business location,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
Thanks to its intricate net of tax treaties with other countries, the Netherlands can expect to remain a conduit for multinationals to pass profits from one subsidiary to another at favourable rates. 

While the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands is 25%, the Dutch began this year taxing outbound royalty and interest payments to places where the corporate tax rate is below 9%, and plans to do the same for outgoing dividends from 2024. 
However, it is not clear when the G7 agreement will go into effect and the Dutch rules could still change before 2024.

In December 2020, the banking system's aggregate return on equity was 11.5%, the lowest in the central bank's series, although the 2021 outlook is improving despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, it said.
""The fall in profitability was widespread, affecting banks of different types of control, size and activity,"" the central bank said in its annual report. 
""Bolstering provisions in 2020 reduces the need for significant new provisions, and the rebound in economic activity will support growth, credit quality, and demand for banking services,"" it added.
The report also highlighted reduced concentration of the banking system, as the market share of state-owned institutions such as Banco do Brasil, Caixa Economica Federal and the BNDES national development bank fell.

The five largest banks - Itau, Bradesco, Santander (MC:SAN), Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal - accounted for 77.6% of total assets in December 2020, down from 81% a year earlier, the central bank said.

The report by opposition lawmakers, after a months long cross-party investigation, also said that Chancellor Angela Merkel was naive regarding Wirecard's lobbying efforts.
The criticism echoes lawmakers' public comments since the start of the inquiry, but the 675-page draft revives the topic just months ahead of a federal election to choose Merkel's successor. Scholz is among those vying for the office.
""Olaf Scholz as finance minister bears political responsibility for the failure of BaFin,"" the report says, referring to the nation's financial regulator that is part of the ministry.
The finance ministry and chancellery did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Scholz has denied blame for the failure, and has since revamped BaFin's powers and installed new leadership.
Wirecard, founded in 1999, began by processing payments for gambling and pornography websites before becoming a fintech star and a member of the DAX bluechip index. 
It ended by filing for insolvency in June last year, owing creditors almost $4 billion, after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The lawmakers said in their report that the Wirecard fiasco was more than an accounting scandal. It was a ""collective oversight failure"", with BaFin, prosecutors, lobbyists and others playing a role.
The report said that Scholz and his ministry with oversight over BaFin sought reasons not to investigate Wirecard as concerns about the company cropped up, rather than take action. 
German officials investigated journalists and other critics of the company instead of Wirecard executives, and they helped Wirecard expand in China even as questions arose about its business practices, the report noted.
In the runup to a state visit to China in September 2019, Merkel met with a former German economy minister who lobbied on behalf of Wirecard. 

The chancellor proved ""too naive"" in her interaction with the minister, who ""managed to successfully promote to the chancellor a matter in which he had an undisclosed economic interest"", the report said.
Merkel in April rejected criticism of her lobbying for Wirecard in China, telling lawmakers she had no reason to suspect the firm of criminality as she sought to help it do business there.

LONDON (Reuters) -Businesswoman Amanda Staveley's appeal to overturn a court's verdict against her in her case against  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has been refused, a court filing seen by Reuters on Monday showed.
A London High Court judge in February found Barclays guilty of ""serious deceit"" over how the British bank negotiated a lifeline with Amanda Staveley during the 2008 financial crisis, but denied her damages and dismissed her claim. 
Staveley said at the time she would take advice on appealing the verdict.
Lawyers representing Staveley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, while Barclays declined to comment.
The failure of the Staveley appeal could potentially draw a line under legal action over Barclays' successful attempt to secure funding that helped the bank avoid a state bailout during the 2008 crisis.
During the acrimonious court battle, Staveley's PCP Capital Partners Group claimed as much as 836 million pounds ($1.18 billion) in compensation.
The PCP case revolved around how Barclays secured billions of pounds from Qatar and Abu Dhabi-backed investors 13 years ago, allowing it to secure its independence.
PCP, which led a 3.25 billion pound, Abu Dhabi-backed investment into the bank, alleged it was induced to fund Barclays on much worse terms than Qatar - despite assurances it would get the same deal. 

While a High Court judge said Barclays had deceived Staveley, he ultimately ruled in February that PCP had not proven its case on causation and loss, meaning the overall case failed.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 08:11AM ET</span>",Supermarket groups Carrefour and Tesco to end purchasing alliance,"PARIS (Reuters) -French supermarket group  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and its British peer Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) said on Monday they would not extend a purchasing alliance heralded originally as a potential way to trim costs. 
The companies said in a joint statement that ""they have decided not to extend their purchasing alliance beyond the three-year operational framework agreed in 2018"", without giving further details. 
Two sources familiar with the matter said Britain's exit from the European Union did not trigger the end of the deal, with one adding that the context had however made things ""more complex"". One of the sources added that alliances were regularly reviewed, and that the decision ""was part of that game"". 
The alliance formally ends on Dec. 31, and the groups said that they would now focus on opportunities independently.
The purchasing agreement https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-carrefour-tesco-suppliers-a-idCAKBN1JT2IU-OCABS aimed to allow Carrefour and Tesco to cut prices, by demanding better terms from food suppliers such Nestle, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) or Unilever (NYSE:UL), and expand ranges of their own-label products.
Supermarket groups have been looking for ways to counter rising online competition, including from U.S. giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has teamed up with some firms for delivery partnerships, and from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl.
Analysts at Shore Capital said in a note that the end of the alliance suggested there was no major benefit to the groups from the partnership. 
""At the time of the announcement of the Carrefour-Tesco Alliance, we questioned whether or not we would ever be able to identify any benefit...in either groups' financial statements, and we think the answer is clear,"" the analysts said. 
In December 2020, France's antitrust authority also imposed stricter conditions on the purchasing alliance, saying it ""risked weakening"" small suppliers of private labels.
Tesco and Carrefour had notably to exclude fruits and vegetables of French and European origin from the purchasing alliance on private label products.
One of the sources familiar with the alliance said the partnership was active, with joint buying on some fresh foods, packaged produce and non-food products. 
The companies gave no financial details of the partnership in their latest financial reports. 
Carrefour boss Alexandre Bompard said last week the company, which faces stiff competition on its home turf, was not looking for any further consolidation opportunities. Its potential takeover by Canadian rival Couche-Tard unravelled earlier this year following French government opposition.
Tesco was seen at the time as a potential fit for a fuller merger with Carrefour, according to bankers and analysts.

Carrefour has since agreed to buy Brazil's third-biggest food retailer Grupo BIG, and the company also posted strong first quarter results in April.
In contrast, Tesco reported in April a 20% drop in full-year pretax profit as the cost of adapting the business for the pandemic wiped out the benefit of ""exceptionally strong"" grocery sales.

455,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>",Big Tech Watches Tide Turning on Taxes After Its Years of Plenty,"(Bloomberg) -- A tax deal between the world’s richest countries brings global governments a step closer to clawing back some power from technology giants that have used century-old regimes to build up wealth eclipsing the economies of most nations.
While a weekend accord struck by Group of Seven finance ministers aims to close the net around all major multinationals, the tech industry is particularly adept at taking advantage of the current system. That’s because its main assets -- software code, patents and other intellectual property -- are relatively easy to maneuver compared to physical assets.
The result has been that the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google have paid effective tax rates which appeared on a long, steady march toward zero, much to the consternation of European governments in particular.
The Covid pandemic has reinforced those concerns as nations propped up workers and bricks-and-mortar firms, while big tech’s reach and wealth expanded with people in lockdowns turning to their services for shopping, entertainment, work and socialising. Without power to tax, governments may not only lack revenues to rebuild, but also the capacity to influence investment flows and economic development.
Analysis by Bloomberg Economics last month showed that the median tax rate for the world’s top 50 firms slumped from 35.5% in 1990 to 17.4% last year. Facebook (12.2%) and Amazon (11.8%) both paid below that rate in 2020.
Seeking to modernize practices for the digital age, G-7 finance ministers on Saturday agreed to push for a 15% minimum corporate tax worldwide and require large companies to pay more in countries where they do business, rather than just where they’re headquartered.
The pact sets the stage for talks in July by the broader Group of 20 countries and then discussions among some 140 nations under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It would still be up to individual countries to pass laws to implement any agreement -- a challenge that would only get harder if Republicans in Congress push back against President Joe Biden’s program.
“Presumably, this means the end of global digital taxes, which is great for tech companies,” said Andrew Silverman, government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It also gives tech companies much more certainty, which is as valuable as lower tax rates -- companies can model out how the tax is going to impact them and do tax planning. It’s much harder to respond to a patchwork of digital taxes and tit-for-tat trade disputes.”
Tech firms welcomed the proposal for uniformity and less opacity after some governments, including France, the U.K., Italy and India, tired of the multilateral debate and unilaterally adopted digital taxes in recent years.
“Amazon welcomes the tax deal because applying random taxes in each country is unfair and wrong and it creates distortions,” Mariangela Marseglia, head of Amazon Italy and Spain, said on Monday. Facebook’s Global Affairs Vice President Nick Clegg said the agreement is a “significant first step toward certainty for business.”
Those companies have time yet to wait before any change takes effect. The G-7 deal left it unclear how the sequencing would work, with countries such as France insisting they won’t withdraw unilateral measures until they start getting income under a new regime.
Such dealmaking makes it clear that big tech’s tax bills are what governments ultimately want to raise, and that could be the case in all countries, including those that haven’t taken substitute measures on a national level.
Taxing Tech
While President Donald Trump’s administration resisted pressure to act amid concern American tech firms were being singled-out, current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen concedes such businesses would “almost by any definition” be affected.
An October study by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) found that in 2019 Facebook was the only so-called FAANG company to pay an effective tax rate at or above the U.S. statutory 21% rate. Amazon paid 17%, half the amount of 2019, and Alphabet 13.3%. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). paid 9.5% and 10.2% respectively.For governments, such behavior leaves money on the table at a time when the coronavirus has forced them to run up huge budget deficits. The OECD calculated last year that the two-pillar change to tax policy could generate up to $80 billion a year for countries’ coffers. The latest proposals from the G-7 are likely to make that figure even bigger.
“After a four-year battle, France has succeeded,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. “There will be a tax on digital giants. There will be a minimum corporate tax to avoid the evasion and optimization that revolts our citizens.”
Partly saving the tech companies from the American tax collector was their ability to hold more than $100 billion in profit outside the U.S. in the last fiscal year.
“A company that currently pays a lot of tax on its profits to the IRS will now pay a good bit more tax on its profit to countries in Europe,” said Daniel Bunn, vice president of global projects at the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy group. “There’s going to need to be a whole new level of coordination between governments. This is going to turn this from two-dimensional chess into 3D pretty quickly.”Refreshing a century-old tax system across borders will also not be easy. Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco warned that implementation will take “some years.”
“There’s still a great deal of uncertainty on whether this is going to happen at all and what the design of the tax actually looks like,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “The G-7 agreement is one step forward and definitely not a step backward, but I still think there’s a long way to go.”

“There is a lot of evidence that suggests that demand will be strong, and the shale seems to be remaining disciplined,” Looney told Bloomberg News in St. Petersburg, Russia. “I think that the situation we’re in at the moment could last like this for a while.”
Looney’s comments echo those of other industry executives encouraged by a robust rebound from the pandemic in the U.S., China and Europe. Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft PJSC, Russia’s largest oil producer, said last week that growth in energy demand will continue, and that any new virus waves may slow the process but won’t stop it. Mike Muller, head of Asia at trader Vitol Group, said on Sunday that China’s economic growth should help bolster demand, bringing down crude stockpiles.
Brent crude closed above $70 a barrel last week for the first time in more than two years, as mass vaccinations help to reopen some economies in the Northern Hemisphere and improve mobility and oil consumption.
“I believe in vaccines and vaccines are working, we just need to get them to more places,” Looney said.
BP has added rigs to its shale business in the U.S. since scaling back last year, but its activity in the region remained below pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of the year.
Demand Recovery
Oil’s demand recovery will be at the point of maximum velocity this month and in July, and it may reach 100 million barrels a day by December, according to a recent report from Standard Chartered Plc.
When asked last week about the demand trajectory, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he’ll believe it when he sees it, noting that evidence of demand must precede supply.
So far, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are sticking to a conservative approach. While the group last week confirmed its plan to ramp up output in July, it didn’t provide guidance as to whether more barrels will be added later this year until there’s evidence more crude is needed. OPEC+ has to manage the risk of the potential return of Iran barrels, along with any spike in cases of coronavirus, which “is a persistent and unpredictable foe,” according to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some Wall Street traders are betting against another massive rally in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and other ""meme"" stocks this week through a type of wager in the options market that would limit their losses should retail investors behind the run-up prove them wrong.
A Reuters analysis of options data and interviews with market participants, including a Wall Street banker and a fund manager with $30 billion in assets, show that some institutional investors have ramped up complex options trades that let them bet the shares will fall.
The so-called “bear put spread,” a common bearish options strategy, also limits profits.
Its increased use now, which has not been previously reported, shows how Wall Street is looking for ways to profit off the unprecedented rise of retail trading but treading carefully after some high-profile funds got buffeted earlier this year.
""It's still dominated by these small retail trades for sure, but we are seeing sporadic big institutions tempted in just by the pricing,"" said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) Inc, referring to options trading in AMC. 
AMC has been at the center of a second wave of buying by retail investors who have been hyping the stock in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, giving new life to the ""meme stock"" phenomenon that sent shares of video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) up 1,600% in January.
AMC’s stock rose just over 83% this past week. The stock has surged 2,160% this year, leaving traders with outright bets against it nursing paper losses of nearly $4 billion, according to the latest available data from S3 Partners.
When a stock moves as much as AMC did last week - at times more than doubling in price in the course of a single trading session - it drives up the price of options.
Typically moves of that magnitude don't persist for extended periods of time, and some professional traders are betting that will be the case this time, meaning the stock price will fall, market participants said. 
The problem is, they don’t know when that might happen and whether they have the resources to stand their ground in an extended face-off with retail traders, whose power lies in their numbers.
That’s where a bear put spread comes in. In the trading strategy, the investor buys one set of put contracts, which gives them the right to sell the underlying shares at a certain “strike” price by a certain time, and sells another set with a lower strike price valid for the same time frame.
The sale of the put options offsets most of the upfront cost of buying the first set of contracts. If the shares don't fall, or fall less than anticipated, the trader's losses from the put purchase will be covered to a large extent by the proceeds of the sold put.
The banker, a senior executive at a major Wall Street firm, said the majority of his institutional clients were staying away from meme stocks, but some had started using bearish put spreads to bet against them. The fund manager, who is based in New York, said he was using put spreads to both minimize his risk and reduce costs as he bet on AMC and other meme stocks.
Both requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
Options trading data shows increased complex trades that involve strategies such as put spreads. Such trades, typically favored by professional traders, made up 22% of daily AMC trades, on average, this week, up from 13% for the month of May, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.

Overall options trading in the stock remains overwhelmingly driven by retail traders, the data shows. Only about 10% to 15% of overall daily AMC options volume this week was traded in blocks of over 100 contracts, a size typically associated with professional players.
""It's hard for institutions to stay away when volatility gets this high,"" Cboe’s Schwartz said. “They try to avoid it, but it does draw them in.""

Launched in 2017, Dave is an app used to help Americans avoid billions of dollars in overdraft fees charged by traditional banks. It currently has 10 million customers.
Companies such as Dave are rushing to capitalize on a boom in demand for online banking services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial services startup Chime has also held preliminary talks with investment banks about launching a stock market flotation, which could value it at more than $30 billion, Reuters reported in March.
The deal with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III Inc, includes a $210 million investment led by Tiger Global Management, with additional participation from Wellington Management and Corbin Capital Partners. 
Dave's other investors include Norwest, Section 32, Capital One, The Kraft Group, SV Angel and The Chernin Group. 
A SPAC is a blank-check firm that seeks to merge with a privately owned entity, a deal type that has become very common in the last year.

The merger, which comes after a lull in dealmaking due to weak investor appetite and greater regulatory scrutiny, is expected to close later this year.
Centerview Partners LLC served as the exclusive financial advisor to Dave.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) served as capital markets advisors to VPCC and co-placement agents on the investment. (https://

Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back to office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank said in March it plans to start bringing workers back to its offices after Labor Day due to the increasing availability of vaccines. The company is evaluating whether to allow certain businesses or functional subgroups in the U.S. to return to the workplace before Labor Day.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank is planning to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase.
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
CEO Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
UNITED KINGDOM:
 Barclays  (LON:BARC)
CEO Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model, and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. 
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC)
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40% as it moves to a hybrid working model for most employees. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) 
Britain's biggest domestic bank is hoping to resume office-based trials and experiments with around 5,000 of its staff this summer, once government restrictions allow. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
NatWest 
CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) 
Deutsche Bank in London plans to bring more staff back from June 21 assuming the city's lockdown restrictions are loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Germany's largest lender has also told its investment bankers in the U.S. that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.
SWITZERLAND
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
Credit Suisse in July 2020 launched a global program evaluating various work-from-home options, which are expected to shape its post-pandemic working models. It has been monitoring and adapting work arrangements since launching work-from-home globally in March 2020, taking into account local guidelines.
UBS

UBS Chairman Axel Weber in May said flexibility would remain part of work arrangements at Switzerland's biggest bank going forward, where roles allow. Return to office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines.

462,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 07:04AM ET</span>","AMC, GameStop, Blackberry Poised For A Quiet Start","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Meme stocks such as AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were all up 2%-2.5% in Monday’s premarket, pointing to a relatively subdued start to the week for investors accustomed to double digit gains.
In the case of AMC, the hottest of them for now, traders may be trying to gauge where the company is headed.
After raising $1.24 billion in equity in three installments in less than a month, each at a different price, it filed a preliminary proxy on Thursday seeking permission to sell 25 million more shares in 2022.
It has been a roller-coaster for AMC traders who saw their stock double in just one session on Wednesday to hit a high of $83.63, only to fall in double digits on announcement of a new equity raise. The shares closed at $66.80 Friday.
The pandemic has caused AMC's long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Monday, trading in narrow ranges just below record levels, with investors digesting Friday’s payrolls ahead of a key inflation report later this week. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices closed higher Friday, after last week’s employment report showed that 559,000 nonfarm jobs were added in May. While this was slightly less than expected, it will have alleviated the pressure on the Federal Reserve to rein in its easy monetary policies while still indicating a recovering economy.
The broad-based S&P 500 index lies just 0.2% from its intraday record high set in May, and climbed 0.6% last week to its highest level since May 7, bringing its 2021 gains to more than 12%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite also posted gains last week, and are also up 13% and 7% this year, respectively.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, and the main focus will be on Thursday’s May CPI release for clues of Federal Reserve thinking, especially after April’s 4.2% shock. 
In corporate news, the major tech giants will be in the spotlight after the seven major industrialized nations agreed on a corporate tax deal to try and raise more cash from multinational companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in focus after CEO Elon Musk announced, via Twitter, that the electric car manufacturer had ended the planned production of Model S Plaid Plus, the most expensive variant of its flagship sedan. 
Additionally, the so-called meme stocks, like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), will likely remain volatile after hefty gains over the last week.
Crude oil prices weakened Monday, slipping from fresh multi-year highs as traders banked profits ahead of the restart of talks between Iran and world powers later in the week over a nuclear deal.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.4% at $69.36 a barrel, after earlier touching $70 for the first time since October 2018. Brent was down 0.5% at $71.56, after earlier hitting $72.26, the highest since May 2019.
A 14.6% year-on-year drop in China's crude oil imports in May, released earlier Monday, weighed on prices, but most market participants are concentrating on the fresh set of talks between Iran and global powers in Vienna over a nuclear accord, starting on Thursday.
A successful conclusion could include Washington lifting economic sanctions on Iranian oil exports, potentially resulting in 500,000 to 1 million barrels of crude per day reentering the global market.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,888.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2157.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, was trading 0.4% lower after being down 1.7% at one stage. Sentiment for the stock was also pulled down after the search giant agreed to pay $267.48 million to France's antitrust watchdog in a case involving its ad practice
A probe by the country’s competition regulator found that Google had abused its market power in the intricate ad business online, where some of its tools have become almost essential for large publishers.
The case follows a complaint by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), French news publishing group Le Figaro and Belgian press group Rossel.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",Analysis-Market for U.S. oil acreage booms along with crude price recovery,"By David French
(Reuters) - A recovery in the price of oil to more than two-year highs is offering a long-awaited opening to companies and private equity firms to shed unloved assets in the U.S. oil patch.
Sales of land parcels worth $6.9 billion have been announced in the first five months of 2021, almost eclipsing the $7 billion recorded in all of 2020, according to data vendor Enverus. Last year was the worst for U.S. acreage sales since at least 2006, after energy prices plunged due to coronavirus-related demand destruction.
More deals are on the way. Land worth more than $12 billion is either up for sale or being prepared to come to market in the United States, according to more than a dozen investment bankers and industry sources interviewed by Reuters. 
A 43% rise in U.S. crude prices this year to their highest since October 2018 has made unloved acreage desirable enough for a small group of buyout firms, as well as some publicly listed energy companies with money to spend.
Those seeking to sell are oil and gas exploration and production companies seeking to pay down debt and redeploy capital for new drilling, and buyout firms that are often nursing losses on bets that went sour. 
The sale of these properties could lead to their development, often following years of underinvestment, boosting U.S. energy production to meet growing demand, as the world economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In one such example, Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) is marketing 25,000 net acres (101 square kilometers) in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin, likely fetching upwards of $550 million, two sources said. The company has targeted raising more than $2 billion from divestments in the first half of 2021.
Occidental did not respond to a comment request.
Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) Inc completed in mid-May the $880 million sale of its Eagle Ford position in south Texas to Validus Energy, and subsequently said it would repay debt worth $1.1 billion.
Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI) Inc agreed last month to sell a 37.5% stake in the hydrocarbons extracted from land in two Texas counties to alternative capital provider Sixth Street Partners. It plans to redeploy the proceeds to partly fund the $715 million acquisition of private equity-backed producer Sabalo Energy, whose adjacent acreage will give it scale in drilling.
""The market is robust, especially when compared with this time a year ago. We are putting some money to work, but we are also seeing opportunities to exit, "" said Jason DeLorenzo, managing partner at buyout firm EnCap Investments. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) has said it may divest parts of its shale gas business in North America. Sources said the company has intimated to potential buyers this could start shortly. 
Exxon declined to comment.
Publicly listed companies currently pursuing acreage sales include Occidental,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp, according to marketing documents seen by Reuters, as well as ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Callon (NYSE:CPE) Petroleum Co, according to sources.
Callon declined comment. Chevron, Whiting and ConocoPhillips did not respond to comment requests.
PRIVATE EQUITY DEALS
The dealmaking upturn is also a boon for private equity firms. Many of them bought land in the mid-2010s to exploit it just enough to prove its production viability and sell it at a profit. They were left nursing losses after a late-2018 drop in energy prices scared off potential buyers. 
Delaware Basin producer Advance Energy Partners, majority owned by EnCap, is exploring a sale that could value it at around $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said.
Advance did not respond to a comment request.
Private equity firm Warburg Pincus asked for indicative acquisition offers for North Dakota producer RimRock Oil and Gas in recent weeks, a deal that could exceed $500 million, according to sources.
Warburg declined comment. RimRock did not respond to a comment request.

The Permian and North Dakota's Bakken have seen strong deal activity in 2021 as buyers focus on shale basins with the cheapest production costs. EnCap-backed Grayson Mill Energy bought the Bakken shale assets of Equinor earlier this year for $900 million.
However, land in some Western U.S. shale fields, such as the Uinta in Utah and Colorado's Denver-Julesburg, has drawn limited interest because of regulatory concerns, including the Biden administration's halt on new drilling leases on federal land.

""Model S goes to Plaid speed this week,"" he said in another tweet, without elaborating.
The Model S Plaid, which will cost $112,990, is scheduled to be unveiled Thursday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific borrowers more than doubled issuance of bonds tied to environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes to a record $69 billion this year, data showed, as they sought to burnish their sustainability credentials and tap red-hot investor demand.
Bankers say the trend will continue, boosting their fee incomes. Some of the biggest global investment banks are bulking up their teams to cope with the increased ESG-related bond deals.
ESG-related issuances from companies, government bodies and other institutions in Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) this year have outpaced those by U.S. issuers for the first time in two years. 
Asia-Pacific entities are fast-tracking their ESG plans, taking advantage of abundant liquidity and soaring demand from global investors who are keen to increase their exposure to the region as economies recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with the growing rollout of vaccinations. 
Data from Refinitiv showed that of the $69.1 billion in ESG bonds issued in Asia-Pacific so far this year, green bonds were the most common, accounting for 70% of the deals and ahead of sustainability-linked bonds, which made up 20%.
Chinese entities issued 51.3% of the ESG bonds in the region, ahead of South Korea which accounted for 21.2%. 
""Demand for green deposits, loans and access to capital markets is running at record levels versus prior years and is gathering further momentum,"" said Kaleem Rizvi,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s head of corporate banking in Asia Pacific.
""More clients are realising they need a clear ESG strategy. Investors and other stakeholders are demanding it and they don't want to be left behind.""
So far in 2021, Citi has been involved in ESG-related financing deals in Asia Pacific worth nearly $25 billion, six times more than the year-ago period – including a Hong Kong government $2.5 billion green bond.
China Development Bank raised $3 billion in a green bond in March and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank carried out a $2.9 billion deal in January, the data showed.
Climate change and other green issues are high on the agenda of most Asian governments, and financial regulators, such as in Hong Kong and Singapore, have also begun changing rules to force companies to better disclose their environmental impact.
Hong Kong announced in December that financial institutions and listed companies will have to disclose the financial impact of climate change on their businesses, as outlined in a major global standard, by 2025.
'GREENWASHING' RISK
There have been 234 ESG-linked bond issuances in Asia- Pacific this year, nearly trebling from the same time-frame last year, Refinitiv data showed. 
In the United States, there have only been 86 deals, which raised $53.1 billion. In Europe, the traditional ESG market leader, $248.1 billion in ESG-related bonds have been issued in 2021, at least three times more than the same time last year.
A risk for investors in ESG-related bonds in China and other Asia-Pacific markets is 'greenwashing', or issuers exaggerating their environmental credentials which has led to caution among some bond buyers.

""Investors have an expansive appetite at the moment but there is also an increasingly discerning approach to investing; they don't want to get burnt with a greenwashing label,"" said Kamran Khan,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s head of ESG for Asia Pacific.
""They have a lot of capital, they want to invest it in ESG transactions, but they want them to be of very high quality with substantiated impact.""

472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>","Regus owner's shares slide as COVID-19 curbs, variants slow recovery","(Reuters) - Office space provider IWG warned on Monday that its 2021 core earnings will be well below last year's crisis-hit level as continuing curbs in some markets and new COVID-19 variants derail recovery, sending its shares as much as 16% lower. 
The grim forecast in an unscheduled trading update underlines the challenges facing an industry that has seen occupancy levels plummet as a shift to remote working during the health crisis emptied out many office buildings.
Shares in the Regus owner were 15% lower at 310 pence by 0741 GMT, heading for their worst one-day drop since March last year.
IWG and its rivals have to some extent pinned their hopes on offering work spaces that would align with a permanent shift to a flexible working model, dividing week days between the office and home. 
IWG, which has already signed deals with companies including bank Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) for hybrid working services, said on Monday it was making good progress on larger master franchise agreements, with several in the final stages of talks.
For 2020, IWG suffered a 17% slide in adjusted core earnings and took COVID-19 costs of 389.8 million pounds ($550.24 million). 
Rival Workspace has warned that a recovery to pre-pandemic levels will take a couple of years. 
""For it (underlying core profit) to be 'well below' is remarkable, when Q1 commentary was upbeat, occupancy troughed in February and price was supposed to be moving up,"" Peel Hunt analysts wrote.
""There is no question that this is disappointing.""
IWG said it still expects a strong recovery in 2022, adding it has continued to see ""unprecedented demand"" for its hybrid work options. 
The company said occupancy was improving in markets where pandemic curbs were easing, including the United States, while enquiries touched pre-crisis levels. 

Softbank-backed office-sharing startup WeWork, which posted a first-quarter loss of more than $2 billion as it prepares to go public, also said last month it was starting to see signs of a recovery as more people returned to the office.

The projected upgrade at Beijing Benz Automotive Co (BBAC), 49%-owned by Stuttgart-based Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and the latter's main business in China, was set out in a document posted on the BBAC website last month to seek public opinion on the expansion. 
It comes as demand for BBAC's luxury vehicles surges in the world's biggest car market. China is Daimler's biggest country business, with more cars sold there than in Germany and the United States combined.
Last year BBAC sold a record 611,000 vehicles in the country, up 8% from 567,000 in 2019. The didn't specify the base capacities of the factories, but the company has previously said combined capacity of the two plants was 520,000 vehicles a year.
According to the document, the joint venture will increase working days to 312 per year at both of its Beijing plants. Previously, one plant, known as the MRA factory, had 290 days of output per year while the other, the MFA factory, had 250 days.
One of the plants will also add one 7.5-hour shift per working day, according to the document, which did not specify the investment related to the capacity increase at the two factories, which plan to make gasoline and electric-powered vehicles.
BBAC, which declined to comment on the projected upgrade, also has a separate electric vehicle factory in Beijing with capacity of 150,000 cars per year. 
The venture is 51%-owned by BAIC Motor. The latter's parent, BAIC Group, owns 5% of Daimler, which didn't answer Reuters' questions on the capacity upgrade project.
Hong Kong-listed shares of BAIC Motor jumped more than 5% after Reuters reported the plan to upgrade plant capacity on Monday. 

Aside from BBAC, next year Daimler will start making electric Smart cars with China's Geely, which holds a 9.7% stake of Daimler, the companies said in 2019. It also has a truck venture with another BAIC Group unit, Beiqi Foton.
Chinese policymakers expect 20% of overall new vehicle sales will be battery electric, plug-in hybrid or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in 2025.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's anti-money-laundering agency on Monday widened a probe into due diligence at casinos to include the three biggest operators, ratcheting up pressure on a sector already struggling with the pandemic and heightened regulatory scrutiny.
Months into an investigation of top player Crown Resorts, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said it was formally looking into possible breaches of background check rules at rival Star Entertainment Group and New Zealand's SkyCity Entertainment Group.
That means owners of casinos in Australia's five most populous cities now face enforcement investigations that could carry fines or restrict their licences.
Crown already has been under intense pressure after an inquiry this year found it unfit for a licence at a just-opened A$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion) Sydney casino, sparking royal commissions in two other states and fueling class-action lawsuits, as well as an AUSTRAC probe that was expanded to its Perth city resort on Monday.
""The Australian casino sector is at risk of criminal misuse due to the products and services they offer,"" AUSTRAC CEO Nicole Rose wrote in an editorial published in The Australian newspaper hours before the casino operators disclosed the investigations in market filings.
""We have an enforcement investigation under way at Crown casino that demonstrates the seriousness of our concerns. And we also have significant compliance work under way on the casino sector,"" Rose wrote.
AUSTRAC later confirmed the investigations - plus a separate investigation of No. 3 lender National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd - without commenting further.
All three casino companies said AUSTRAC was concerned with their management of ""customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons"", that the agency had not decided whether to take enforcement action, and that they would cooperate fully.
The crackdown may meanwhile complicate a A$9 billion buyout by Star of larger rival Crown, which has been fielding takeover approaches.
""If it's found to be a systematic and ongoing lackadaisical attitude to enforcement then (a regulator objection) seems likely,"" said Nathan Bell, portfolio manager of Intelligent Investor, which has Crown shares.
""If Star is seen to have good standards and there is a genuine effort to weed out these people then ... the regulators would rather Crown was kept in Australian hands and Star's takeover proposal would remain live.""
Angus Hewitt, an analyst at Morningstar, said the widening of the investigation was ""obviously not good news for the embattled casinos, and we expect fines to be the most likely outcome"".
Crown shares were down 1.5% in a flat overall market and Star shares were down 3%. SkyCity's New Zealand-listed shares did not trade because of a public holiday.

In a separate development, Crown said it had received legal advice that it had contravened casino laws by selling over A$160 million of gambling chips to people paying with credit or debit cards from 2012 to 2016 - potentially sparking yet another investigation.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",UBS ramps up 'Netflix' of banking to tap into stream of millionaires,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's new hybrid digital wealth management platform has attracted $3.7 billion in its first year, boosting chief executive Ralph Hamers' strategy of winning more business from the lower echelons of the global rich.
The world's biggest wealth manager is trying to improve its digital services to reach customers outside its super rich core client base, with a new online platform called MyWay open to people with 250,000 Swiss francs ($278,000) upwards.
UBS's emphasis on a digital approach to customers highlights a major shift in the world of private banking, where human connections and personal contact are usually the key to doing business with the very wealthy.
The project, started in May last year before Hamers' became CEO, has the potential to pull in $30 billion within the next 12 months, a source familiar with the matter said. A UBS spokesman confirmed that target and current assets of $3.7 billion.
At UBS's first-quarter results in April, Hamers unveiled an unexpected new strategic focus - that the bank would target private clients, or those with up to $5 million with the bank.
""(This) is a trend where we expect further growth and fast growth,"" he told analysts at the time. ""That's where you can expect our resources to go.""
Hamers made a comparison with video and music streaming services Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), where people get personalised recommendations they can click on. ""If we can make our content available in that way, we can differentiate ourselves,"" he told analysts.
Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said that for an institution that already banks more than half the world's billionaires, the much larger pool of the globe's 1% of millionaires presents a major opportunity.
""I wouldn't say UBS can't grow further in the billionaires space ... but it's very clear that their market share outside the billionaires space is definitely nowhere near 50%,"" Venditti said. ""The potential for growth there remains huge.""
Since being rolled out to new markets in Asia in October, MyWay has attracted interest ranging from smaller clients to some billionaires.
Bruno Marxer, who heads global investment management for UBS' chief investment office, said in the past clients could be overwhelmed by the choices offered to them.
""But being able to drag and drop and play around with different elements that fit their personal needs and preferences is a much more intuitive and frankly enjoyable way to build an investment portfolio for many people,"" he said. 
The lion's share of assets are from Swiss clients, but MyWay has attracted larger tickets out of Asia, where it has netted nearly $1 billion since launch, Roberto Rango, UBS' head of advisory and sales for customer systems in Europe, said. Additional European markets are planned.
Customers currently access MyWay through advisers, but the bank also plans to make it available remotely.
""Soon clients will be able to access a microsite where they can explore the concept... and simulate a portfolio,"" Rango said, adding that investment decisions would be made in discussion with an adviser.
MyWay is just one of at least five digital roll-outs the bank unveiled for wealth management and its advisers last year, while further initiatives are planned this year, including a digital lending tool.
In China, it is also looking to roll out a new digital bank to gain access to the country's burgeoning affluent class, while Hamers has further set his sights on millionaires in the United States.
In the past few years, focus on the ultra-wealthy has helped UBS to boost efficiency, with the bank's advisers managing increasingly large pools of money from these clients, even as the number of relationship managers has shrunk.
Now, industry experts say wealth managers must look to digital tools to help to capture the ""regularly wealthy"" at the other end of that spectrum by allowing just one adviser to oversee more of these clients.

""The big Swiss banks need to up their digital offerings, because younger clients want it and their costs are too high,"" Ingo Rauser, a partner at global technology and management consultancy Capco, said. ""Less complex processes can be digitised and automated. It's how they differentiate from competitors.""

By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - British consumer goods maker  Reckitt Benckiser  Group Plc (LON:RKT) said on Saturday it was selling its infant formula and child nutrition (IFCN) business in China to investment firm Primavera Capital Group for an enterprise value of $2.2 billion.
The Lysol disinfectant and Dettol soap maker will retain an 8% stake in the IFCN China unit and anticipates net cash proceeds from the sale to be about $1.3 billion, it said in an emailed statement.
Reckitt expects to incur a net loss of 2.5 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) on the disposal, mainly due to the re-measurement of goodwill and intangible assets, it said.
Reuters in March reported that the Slough, England-based company was considering the sale of the business.
The sale closes a strategic review of IFCN China launched in February as a result of sluggish sales caused by intense competition from local Chinese baby formula brands and slowing birth rates in China.
Reckitt executives have also attributed Hong Kong border closures during the COVID-19 pandemic as weighing on the business, which it acquired as part of its $16.6 billion purchase of U.S.-based Mead Johnson in 2017. 
In the same sector, French dairy group Danone sold its 9.8% stake in China Mengniu Dairy in May for about 1.6 billion euros.
Reckitt's Greater China infant formula business represents 6% of group sales, which were almost 14 billion pounds ($19.82 billion) in 2020, up 11.8% year-on-year.
On Saturday, Reckitt said the deal included the sale of its manufacturing plants at Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and in Guangzhou, China, and a royalty-free perpetual and exclusive license of the Mead Johnson and Enfa family of brands in China.

After the deal's close, expected in the second half of 2021, Reckitt will own and operate the Mead Johnson and the Enfinitas, Enfamil and Enfagrow brands in the rest of the world.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) said on Monday it is under investigation for suspected serious and ongoing breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws, sparking concerns about potential fines and higher compliance costs.
The financial crime regulator said there were ""areas of serious concern"" that required further investigation, but it was not considering a civil penalty order at this stage. 
Shares in Australia's third-largest lender fell 2.6% in morning trading while the wider market was little changed.
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said the problems at NAB involved ""potential serious and ongoing non-compliance"" with customer identification procedures, customer due diligence and other compliance requirements. 
""AUSTRAC's concerns emanate from historical and contemporary compliance assessments,"" the agency said in letter to the lender dated June 4. 
""In particular, the seriousness of self-disclosed matters presented to AUSTRAC over a prolonged period combined with the accompanying closure rates is concerning.""
The investigation would now be handled by AUSTRAC's enforcement team, the agency said. It had not made a decision about whether further enforcement action would be taken and was not considering civil penalty proceedings at this stage.
This was ""reflective of the work undertaken"" by NAB to date, but the regulator's position could change, the letter added.
NAB said it would continue to cooperate with the regulator.
""NAB has an important role in monitoring and reporting suspicious activity and keeping Australia’s financial system, our bank and our customers safe,"" Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said in a statement.
""We are very aware that we need to further improve our performance in relation to these matters. We have been working to improve and clearly have more to do."" 
AUSTRAC has levied A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in penalties on NAB's larger peers - Commonwealth Bank and  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp - for breaches of anti-money laundering rules since 2018. 
The escalation of AUSTRAC's investigation could have material consequences for NAB such as higher compliance costs, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note.

489,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2021 09:53PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Analysis of “Goldilocks” U.S. Employment Report Continues","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Monday morning as investors continued to digest the U.S. employment report released at the end of the previous week.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.11% by 9:46 PM ET (1:46 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.74%. China is due to release trade data, including export, import and trade balance figures, later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.72%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.28% while South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.03%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.04%.
The U.S. employment report said that non-farm payrolls rose by 559,000 in May, below the 650,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above April’s 278,000 reading. May’s unemployment rate was at a better-than-expected 5.8%.
The report continued to fuel the debate as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will taper its asset purchases earlier than expected as price pressures increase.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said President Joe Biden plans to move forward with his spending plans even if they trigger inflation that persists into 2022. She added that a “slightly higher” interest rate environment would be a “plus.”
“The data was perfect for a goldilocks type outlook for risk: not too hot to bring in fears of a faster Fed taper, and not too cold to worry about the outlook for the recovery... this caused a weaker dollar, better stocks, reinforced the earlier bid in commodities, and boosted emerging markets,” NatWest Markets strategist John Briggs told Reuters.
Investors now await consumer price index (CPI) figures, due later in the week, for further clues to the Fed’s next move. However, Briggs expects that Fed officials could start discussing tapering at its June policy meeting, with the start coming in early 2022 and a rate hike not until 2024. The meeting is currently scheduled to take place from Jun. 15 to 16.
The European Central Bank holds is also due to hand down its policy decision on Thursday. The central bank is widely expected to stay the course regarding its current stimulus measures, with tapering still in the distant future.
Other investors also looked to Thursday’s CPI data for further clues.
“The slightly softer-than-expected rise in U.S. payroll employment in May probably won’t change the Fed’s thinking, but another pickup in CPI inflation likely to be reported on Thursday will further spur the taper talk,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital head of investment strategy and chief economist Shane Oliver said in a note.
Meanwhile, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations, including Yellen, struck a landmark agreement over the weekend during their meeting in London. The agreement could see taxes for big firms increased and enable governments to impose levies on U.S. tech giants including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc . (NASDAQ:FB)"
490,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 06, 2021 08:18PM ET</span>",G-7 Strikes Deal to Revamp Tax Rules for Biggest Firms,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.
The Group of Seven rich nations secured a landmark deal that could help countries collect more taxes from big companies and enable governments to impose levies on U.S. tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The agreement by the G-7 finance ministers in London satisfies a U.S. demand for a minimum corporate tax rate of “at least 15%” on foreign earnings and paves the way for levies on multinationals in countries where they make money, instead of just where they are headquartered.

— Bloomberg Quicktake (@Quicktake) June 5, 2021
The deal is aimed at modernizing the century-old international tax code and cools transatlantic tensions that threatened to spill into a trade war under Donald Trump. But key details are still to be nailed down, more nations must sign on, and full implementation could take years.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, among the finance chiefs who hailed the announcement as an unprecedented step, said a final accord on which companies could see their profits taxed outside their home countries would include the likes of Amazon and Facebook.
“What you’re seeing is a revival of multilateralism, a willingness of leading nations in the G-7 and G-20, to cooperate to address the most critical challenges facing the global economies,” Yellen said after the meeting.
Focus will now shift to a July meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Italy and long-running talks between about 140 countries at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The G-7 pact marks a step to re-write a global system that critics said allowed big companies to save billions of dollars in tax bills by shifting jurisdictions. It’s also help address complaints that major digital companies can make money in multiple countries and pay taxes only at home.
In response to the announcement, some of the world’s biggest tech companies focused on how the deal could help clear up the rules on where to pay taxes.
“Today’s agreement is a significant first step toward certainty for businesses and strengthening public confidence in the global tax system,” Facebook’s Global Affairs Vice President Nick Clegg said on Twitter.
An Amazon spokesperson said the OECD-led process “will help bring stability to the international tax system” and described Saturday’s deal as a “welcome step forward in the effort to achieve this goal.”
Under the Trump administration, the U.S. had also refused to allow foreign governments to tax American digital companies, a key European demand.
The transatlantic division spiraled into a battle of unilateral measures and threats of trade sanctions, which although suspended, are still in place.
According to the communique after the London meeting, countries where big firms operate would get the right to tax “at least 20%” of profits exceeding a 10% margin. That would apply to “the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises,” potentially enabling the G-7 to square the circle so that digital is included without being targeted.
Asked whether that means companies like Facebook and Amazon would be included, Yellen said they would qualify “by almost any definition,” and “most of those firms are likely to be included in this new scheme.”
The ministers of the U.K. and France both said they were now assured that tech giants would be in the cross-hairs of new rules, even as the final quantitative criteria are still to be determined.
“We’ve been fighting for four years in all European and international forums, here at the G-7 and the G-20 for a fair taxation of digital giants and for a minimum corporate tax,” France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.
The antipathy in recent years was greatest between Paris and Washington. France was the first country to bypass the slow-going OECD process on how to tax profits, opting for a controversial levy exclusively on the digital revenues of large firms.
The G-7 said that countries would “provide for appropriate coordination” to remove such digital services taxes. Resolving the exact sequencing of that could prove tricky, with countries unwilling to give up revenues before they have certainty over what they will gain from new global rules.
Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco said he’ll aim to broaden the discussion when G-20 finance ministers meet in July in Venice. Once the proposal is agreed, Italy will no longer need its digital tax, he said.
Two Issues
Highlighting other remaining divisions, the finance minister of Ireland, whose country has attracted some of the world’s big businesses with low taxes, said any deal on a minimum rate must meet the needs of “small and large countries, developed and developing.”
Pushing in the other direction, Le Maire said the 15% is a starting point and France would fight for a higher rate in the coming weeks.
The administration of President Joe Biden still needs approval from Congress and will hope the deal hands it leverage for its massive infrastructure program. It is seeking support from lawmakers to raise the domestic corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. An international deal for 15% could help him because it offers multinationals options.
Two top Republican lawmakers said the agreement “appears premature given the many unanswered questions about the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 proposals and their potential effect on American companies and U.S. revenues.”
“We continue to caution against moving forward in a way that could adversely affect U.S. businesses,” Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo and House Ways and Means Ranking Member Kevin Brady said in a statement.
The OECD has said a final global deal may not come until October, with delivery requiring nations to pass the plan through national legislatures.
“There is important work left to do,” said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. “But this decision adds important momentum to the coming discussions.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will resume making political donations to U.S. lawmakers but will not give to Republican members of Congress who voted to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory, according to an internal memo on Friday seen by Reuters.
The country's largest lender was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election. 
Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud.
Following a review, JPMorgan will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a ""handful"" of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said.
The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November's midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said.
""This was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,"" the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden's win.
Also on Friday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said it was resuming PAC contributions but did not specify how it would treat the lawmakers who tried to block Biden taking office. 
Citigroup said it would evaluate whether to give to all lawmakers case-by-case based on a new set of criteria which includes ""character and integrity"" and ""a commitment to bipartisanship and democratic institutions.""
JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates.
""Democracy, by its nature, requires active participation, compromise, and engaging with people with opposing views. That is why government and business must work together,"" JPMorgan wrote.
As part of its revamped spending strategy, the bank will also expand donations beyond lawmakers who oversee financial matters to those active on issues the bank considers ""moral and economic imperatives for our country,"" such as addressing the racial wealth gap, education and criminal justice reform.
Since the initial January backlash, corporations have been grappling https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-politics-republican-donations-ins-idUKKBN2B119B with how to resume PAC spending, seen by lobbyists as important for gaining access to policymakers, without alienating other stakeholders, including their employees who fund the PACs. 
Other big financial companies that paused donations have slowly resumed spending.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s PAC resumed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morgan-stanley-pac/morgan-stanleys-pac-resumed-donations-weeks-after-capitol-riot-pause-idUSKBN2BB2B3 donations to some lawmakers in February, while the American Bankers Association PAC, one of the biggest in the country, started giving again in March, federal records show.
While JPMorgan did not name lawmakers in its memo, the bank's new policy risks alienating Republicans with sway over banking policy, some of whom are already angered by its active stance on issues like climate change and racial equity.
Of the 147 lawmakers, JPMorgan gave $10,000 each to House finance committee members Blaine Luetkemeyer and Lee Zeldin, and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, among others, during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Representatives for the lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment.
All told, JPMorgan's PAC gave nearly $1 million to federal candidates and committees backing candidates during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to CRP. 
Of the $600,300 it gave to federal candidates, nearly 60% went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats, according to the CRP data, a mix that is likely to swing further to the left as the bank supports a broader range of social and economic issues.

Commercial banks overall have ramped up political spending in recent years, dishing out $14.6 million to federal candidates in the 2020 cycle, the second highest amount since 1990, the data shows. 
Following the 2008 financial crisis, that mix favored Republicans but in recent years banks have increased spending on Democrats as they look to rebuild bipartisan support in Congress.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Sunday said it had reached the broad outlines of a settlement with former boss Martin Winterkorn over his role in the dieselgate scandal, with the final details to be thrashed out over coming days.
Via the settlement, Volkswagen is trying to turn the page on its biggest ever corporate crisis in which it admitted using illegal software to rig diesel engine tests in the United States. No details were given on the size of the deal.
""In its meeting yesterday, the supervisory board agreed the essential conditions,"" a VW spokesperson said in a statement. ""The agreements will be concluded in coming days.""
Since it broke, dieselgate -- one of the biggest corporate scandals ever -- has cost the carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($38.93 billion) in fines, refits and legal costs.
Volkswagen in late March said it would claim damages from former Winterkorn for breaching his duty of care by failing to fully and swiftly clarify circumstances behind the use of unlawful software functions in some diesel engines.

Winterkorn has denied being responsible for the scandal. He resigned as CEO on Sept. 23, 2015, a week after the scandal was uncovered.

Air travel remains in crisis despite accelerating vaccine rollouts in developed countries. With video calls having replaced in-person meetings, it remains to be seen to what extent business travel will recover.
But Faury told Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag corporate thinking had changed.
""Companies realised: at some point they have to meet their customers and suppliers in person again. At some point they must be on site to develop products or build factories,"" he said.
""That is what airlines are telling us, since they must decide now how their planes will be seated in future. And we see that they are planning as many seats in business class as before the pandemic.""

LONDON (Reuters) -The United States, Britain and other large, rich nations reached a landmark deal on Saturday to squeeze more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and reduce their incentive to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens. 
Hundreds of billions of dollars could flow into the coffers of governments left cash-strapped by the COVID-19 pandemic after the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it expected it would have to pay more tax, in more countries, as a result of the deal, which comes after eight years of talks that gained fresh impetus in recent months after proposals from U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration.
""G7 finance ministers have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age,"" British finance minister Rishi Sunak said after chairing a two-day meeting in London.
The meeting, hosted at an ornate 19th-century mansion near Buckingham Palace in central London, was the first time finance ministers have met face-to-face since the start of the pandemic.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the ""significant, unprecedented commitment"" would end what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation.
German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the deal was ""bad news for tax havens around the world"".
Yellen also saw the G7 meeting as marking a return to multilateralism under Biden and a contrast to the approach of U.S. President Donald Trump, who alienated many U.S. allies.
""What I've seen during my time at this G7 is deep collaboration and a desire to coordinate and address a much broader range of global problems,"" she said.
Ministers also agreed to move towards making companies declare their environmental impact in a more standard way so investors can decided more easily whether to fund them, a key goal for Britain.
TAXING TIMES
Current global tax rules date back to the 1920s and struggle with multinational tech giants that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual property held in low-tax jurisdictions. 
Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice-president for global affairs and a former British deputy prime minister, said: ""We want the international tax reform process to succeed and recognise this could mean Facebook paying more tax, and in different places.""
But Italy, which will seek wider international backing for the plans at a meeting of the G20 in Venice next month, said the proposals were not just aimed at U.S. firms.
Yellen said European countries would scrap existing digital services taxes which the United States says discriminate against U.S. businesses as the new global rules go into effect.
""There is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand,"" she said.
Key details remain to be negotiated over the coming months. Saturday's agreement says only ""the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises"" would be affected.
European countries had been concerned that this could exclude Amazon - which has lower profit margins than most tech companies - but Yellen said she expected it would be included.
How tax revenues will be split is not finalised either, and any deal will also need to pass the U.S. Congress.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would push for a higher minimum tax, calling 15% ""a starting point"".
Some campaign groups also condemned what they saw as a lack of ambition. ""They are setting the bar so low that companies can just step over it,"" Oxfam's head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, said.

But Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe, whose country is potentially affected because of its 12.5% tax rate, said any global deal also needed to take account of smaller nations.
The G7 includes the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has hired former Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) banker Luigi Rizzo for a new client-facing role overseeing a drive to win business from a wide spectrum of companies across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), sources familiar with the move told Reuters.
Rizzo, who was at the helm of Bank of America's European corporate and investment banking and quit in late 2019, will become Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of investment banking for EMEA, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Morgan Stanley was not immediately available for comment. 
A seasoned dealmaker who started his career at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in 1993, Rizzo rose through the ranks, becoming a partner in 2008 and working closely with some of Europe's most prominent dealmakers including Diego De Giorgi, now co-CEO at Pegasus Europe.
In 2013 he joined Bank of America to take on top jobs in both M&A and investment banking for the EMEA region, and moved to Paris after the Brexit referendum to oversee the bank's rollout across the EU.
In his new role he will advise clients, including consumer and retail companies, financial institutions and TMT (telecoms, media and technology) conglomerates in their efforts to pursue strategic combinations that could speed up their post-COVID recovery.
The 50-year old Italian, who is also a lecturer at various business schools including  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) Brussels School of Economics and Management, where he graduated, will be based in London and report to Morgan Stanley's head of investment banking Simon Smith.

His appointment comes as Morgan Stanley - which ranked second after Goldman Sachs in Refinitiv's global M&A league table last year - aims to take advantage of a rebounding M&A market, with an overall $2.4 trillion worth of M&A deals announced globally during the first five months of 2021.

""As soon as this money will be injected in the newco we will take the (due) steps,"" CEO Eddie Wilson told Italian daily la Repubblica in an interview. 
""We are waiting to see, but it is clear that it is illegal aid and we will defend our interest by appealing against this umpteenth loan,"" he added. 
Italy is close to a deal with the European Commission to launch Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA), which was initially expected to start flying again in April. 
Under the relaunch, the government plans to inject 3 billion euros ($3.65 billion) into ITA, which would take over the assets of the old Alitalia. 
""I have the impression that there's nothing new, ITA will just be the extension of Alitalia... with the same problems seen for decades, money being drained from public resources into an airline that today, like yesterday, will lose money,"" Wilson said. 
Last week Ryanair urged the EU to require ITA to bid competitively for Alitalia's airport slots. Ryanair has made no secret of its interest in picking up Alitalia slots. 
The European Union competition watchdog is reviewing past and present Italian state aid to Alitalia, with a decision expected in coming weeks.

Under EU state aid rules, there needs to be economic discontinuity between ITA and Alitalia for Brussels to allow Rome to inject the funds into the new carrier.

Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the government had acted because of ""the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence"".
Mohammed did not spell out what form the suspension would take or give more details on the undermining activities. His ministry also announced Twitter's suspension on Twitter https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249. 
When asked about the details of the suspension, a ministerial aide told Reuters: ""Wait and see how things will turn out.""
As of the early hours of Saturday, Twitter's website was inaccessible in Nigeria on some mobile carriers, while its app and website worked on others, according to Reuters tests in Lagos and Abuja.
Twitter is investigating its ""deeply concerning"" suspension of operations by the Nigerian government, and ""will provide updates when we know more,"" the company said in a statement.
On Wednesday, the U.S. tech firm said Buhari's post threatening to punish groups blamed for attacks on government buildings had violated Twitter's ""abusive behaviour"" policy.
In April, the information minister reacted angrily when Twitter chose neighbouring Ghana for its first African office. He said the company had been influenced by media misrepresentations of Nigeria, including reports of crackdowns on protests last year.
Demonstrators calling for police reform had used social media to organise, raise money and share alleged proof of police harassment. Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted https://twitter.com/jack/status/1316485283777519620?s=20 to encourage his followers to donate.
In the protests' wake, Mohammed called for ""some form of regulation"" on social media to combat ""fake news"". 

A spokesperson for Airtel, one of Nigeria's largest mobile carriers, on Friday declined to say whether the company had received any government directives about the suspension.
MTN, the largest mobile carrier, did not respond to calls and a message seeking comment.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2021 01:31AM ET</span>","Facebook suspends Trump until 2023, shifts rules for world leaders","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Friday suspended former U.S. President Donald Trump until at least January 2023 and announced changes to how it will treat world leaders who break the rules on its site.
Facebook had suspended Trump's account the day after the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol Hill riot, determining he had incited violence. That suspension will last at least two years from the date of the initial block and would only be lifted if the risk to public safety has receded, Facebook said on Friday.
Trump criticized the decision as a form of censorship and an insult to his voters.
This new timeline denies Republican Trump a major social media megaphone ahead of the November 2022 congressional elections. However, it means he may be able to return to Facebook well before the next presidential election in late 2024.
Trump has been permanently banned by Twitter and remains suspended by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube after the riot. Trump, who this week shut down his recently-launched blog, has teased plans to start his own platform.
""Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,"" Facebook's head of global affairs Nick Clegg said in the post.
Facebook's oversight board, an independent group funded by the company who rule on a small slice of controversial content decisions, in May upheld the company's unprecedented block on Trump. However, the board ruled it was wrong to make the ban indefinite and called for a ""proportionate response.""
In a statement on Friday, Trump slammed the decision and repeated false claims of voter fraud: ""Facebook's ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election. They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!"" Several investigations have not found evidence of election fraud.
Trump added, ""Next time I'm in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!"" 
Facebook said it would work with experts to decide when the public safety risk had subsided for Trump to be restored to its platforms. It said it would evaluate factors including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest. 
It also said there would be a set of escalating sanctions that would be triggered if Trump broke further rules that could lead to his permanent removal.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking to reporters, said of Facebook's decision on Trump that it felt ""pretty unlikely that the zebra is going to change his stripes over the next two years, we'll see.""
POLICY CHANGES
Social media companies have grappled in recent years with how to handle world leaders and politicians who violate their guidelines. 
On Friday, the Nigerian government said it had indefinitely suspended Twitter's activities in the country, two days after the company removed a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened to punish regional secessionists.
In a major reversal that also came as part of Facebook's Friday responses to its oversight board, Facebook said it was ""removing the presumption we announced in 2019 that speech from politicians is inherently of public interest."" 
The company said it now would weigh violative content from politicians against the potential risk of harm in the same way it does for all users. It will also disclose when it does use its ""newsworthiness"" exemption. 
However, a Facebook spokesman confirmed politicians' posts will remain exempt from third-party fact-checking. 
Facebook has come under fire from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech, but has also been criticized by those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates, who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship. 
Its decision on Trump and new policy changes could have major ramifications for how Facebook handles rule-breaking world leaders and officials on its services. It said that public figures who violate its rules by inciting or celebrating ongoing violence or civil unrest could be restricted for periods ranging from one month to two years.
Social media companies have faced calls from some rights groups and activists to be more consistent in their approach to other leaders who have violated or pushed their rules. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and lawmakers in India's ruling party have drawn scrutiny.
Facebook also gave some transparency into its standard system on how many ""strikes"" users can receive before suspensions, which normally last up to 30 days.
The Trump case has been seen as a test for how the company responded to the ruling and recommendations of its recently-established oversight board. 

The board also recommended Facebook review its role in the election fraud conspiracy that led to the Jan. 6 siege, which Facebook said it would partially implement through its partnership with academics studying the role it played in the 2020 U.S. elections. Facebook said it was implementing 15 of the 19 board recommendations.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An unruly passenger who tried breaking into the cockpit of a Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) flight bound for Tennessee from California was subdued by cabin crew and fellow passengers as the plane was diverted to New Mexico, officials said.
Delta Flight 386, from Los Angeles bound for Nashville, arrived around 2:20 p.m. local time at Albuquerque International Sunport, where authorities removed the passenger from the plane and took him into custody, an airport spokesperson said. 
Delta said the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-900 had 162 passengers and six crew members aboard.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Albuquerque said on Twitter that it was responding to the incident and that there was ""no threat to the public at this time."" The FBI provided no further details.
The airline and law enforcement did not say whether the individual was armed, whether he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs or what may have prompted his outburst.
No one was hurt during the incident, and the flight resumed its trip to Nashville after the diversion, the airport spokesperson said.
Los Angeles-based CBS News affiliate KCBS-TV posted cellphone video taken by several passengers showing a man lying on his stomach in the aisle of the aircraft repeatedly yelling “Stop this plane"" as he was being restrained.
A flight attendant and passengers bound his hands and feet with yellow cord, then carried him to the rear of aircraft, where he was placed face down in a seat, the video clips showed.
“Thanks to the crew and passengers of Delta Flight 386 ... who assisted in detaining an unruly passenger as the flight diverted to Albuquerque,"" Delta said in a statement, adding that aircraft landed without incident and the passenger was removed by law enforcement.

Wirecard collapsed last June, owing creditors almost $4 billion, accused by its auditor of a sophisticated global fraud. At one point, it claimed it kept more than $2 billion in two Philippine banks - claims that the Southeast Asian nation's central bank and the lenders have denied.
Philippines Justice Minister Menardo Guevarra said via text message on Saturday complaints filed by the National Bureau of Investigation on May 31 accuse the respondents of violating banking, cybercrime, and e-commerce laws as well as falsifying commercial documents.
In addition to Wirecard's former COO Jan Marsalek, Gueverra said complaints were also filed against the M.K. Tolentino Law Office as well as against other entities that he did not name.
The whereabouts of Marsalek, who was fired after auditor EY refused to sign off on Wirecard's accounts, are unknown and Reuters could not immediately reach him for comment.

Mark Tolentino, whose law firm was used by Wirecard to open foreign currency bank accounts with BDO Unibank Inc and Bank of the Philippine Islands, did not respond to requests for comment.
The unraveling of Wirecard, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, has prompted EU financial authorities to propose stricter rules next year for company financial reporting and auditors.

505,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Biden's electric vehicle plan includes battery recycling push,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's strategy to make the United States a powerhouse in electric vehicles will include boosting domestic recycling of batteries to reuse lithium and other metals, according to government officials.
As Biden makes fighting climate change and competing with China centerpieces of his agenda, the administration is set to wrap up a 100-day review on Friday of gaps in supply chains in key areas, including electric vehicles (EV). 
These gaps include the minerals used in EV batteries and consumer electronics. The administration is also looking for ways to reduce metal usage in new battery chemistries.
Reports from various government agencies will be submitted to the White House, a process Biden ordered in an executive order earlier this year. Parts of the reports could be released publicly as soon as next week.
Democrats are pushing aggressive climate goals to have a majority of U.S.-manufactured cars be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be electric by 2040. 
Securing enough cobalt, lithium and other raw materials to make EV batteries is a major obstacle, with domestic mines facing extensive regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition. 
Reuters reported on May 25 that Biden plans to rely on mines in ally countries to supply much of the metals needed to build EVs.
The administration's options to spur domestic recycling include direct investment in projects and scientific research, as well as spending funds approved by Congress.
Boosting domestic recycling would help the administration further that goal by breaking down older EVs into component parts for new vehicles and thus relying less on mining.
""When you look at the way the U.S. has approached the recycling opportunity, what's very evident is we need to invest in that capacity, we need to take a more proactive approach,"" said one of the administration officials. 
""A big part of the lithium opportunity is really recycling, and being a global leader in recycling the lithium from existing batteries and driving that into these new batteries."" The White House would like to see more recycling plants open in the United States, one of the officials said, noting the announcement last fall by China's Ganfeng Lithium Co of plans to build a battery recycling plant in Mexico to supply the U.S. EV market.
EMPHASIS ON R&D The administration's emerging strategy will also include a heavy emphasis on research and development intended to boost the use of already-mined metals, the officials said. That plan would effectively expand on ongoing research at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (NYSE:LH), which has been the focal point for much of the government's battery recycling research. Extracting the various mineral components of a battery has proven difficult and costly in the past, and new research focuses on ways to reuse cathodes and other battery parts, according to Argonne researchers. Washington's recycling focus comes as other regions are doing the same. The European Union is considering clamping down on exports of metal waste to encourage more regional recycling, part of an effort to become climate neutral by 2050. [L5N2NL2YZ] Global EV sales topped 2.5 million last year, a figure that's projected to jump 70 percent for 2021 and continue to rise through 2040, according to IHS Markit forecasts. Without recycling, the EV revolution would cause 8 million tons of battery scrap to be dumped in U.S. landfills alone by 2040, according to U.S. government estimates. An April report found that recycling end-of-life batteries could cut the projected need for new sources of copper for EV batteries via mining by 55% by 2040. For lithium, the figure is 25%, and for cobalt and nickel it's 35%. Recycling will have the added benefit of cutting the demand for new mines, said the report, which was authored by the conservation group Earthworks and the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures. 
That would help Biden avoid some battles with environmentalists and other constituencies opposed to mining. ""We can power the renewable energy transition without digging new holes in the ground,"" said Payal Sampat of Earthworks. Lead acid batteries were once rarely recycled, but now nearly all are broken down for reuse in internal combustion engines. Environmentalists say that could be a blueprint for the EV recycling industry. Battery recycling plants have started to slowly open up in the United States. Last fall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested in Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials, a Nevada-based privately held recycling firm that has signed a deal to recycle scrap and battery parts from a Tennessee-based contractor for Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's Leaf electric vehicle. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has said it is developing a battery recycling system at its Nevada Gigafactory. The company also contracts with third-party recyclers.

And Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has started to recycle old iPhones and other electronics at a facility in Austin, Texas. The U.S. government is also the largest shareholder in mining investment firm TechMet, which is a major investor in Canadian battery recycler Li-Cycle Corp. 
Li-Cycle Corp plans to go public later this year through a merger with blank-check acquisition company Peridot Acquisition Corp, shares of which gained 6% on Friday.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors eye Washington talks after big rally in infrastructure shares,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will watch Washington in the coming week for clues on whether an outsized rally in shares of companies that would benefit from President Joe Biden's proposed $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan has more room to run.
Expectations of spending from Washington on bridges, roads, and tunnels bolstered so-called value stocks, especially the industrials and materials sectors, both up around 20% this year, ahead of the 12.5% gain for the S&P 500. 
Among the biggest winners have been shares of United States Steel (NYSE:X) Corp, up nearly 200% since the start of the year, while steel producer  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE)'s stock has gained around 104%. 
Those large gains may leave many industrials and materials stocks vulnerable to a selloff if a large spending bill in Washington fails to materialize, said John Mowrey, chief investment officer of NFJ Investment Group, which manages $8.2 billion in assets. 
""It's scary how much of (the spending bill) is already priced into the market,"" he said. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg circled June 7 as the date by which negotiations with Senate Republicans must have a ""clear direction."" If not, he suggested, Senate Democrats could propose a more targeted infrastructure bill. [L2N2NL2PG]
Republican leaders have endorsed roughly $257 billion in new spending, while calling major tax hikes to finance the construction of roads, bridges, water pipes and other projects a non-starter.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats, meanwhile, are warning they would block any bill they view as inadequate. [L2N2NL1UT]
Talks continued between Biden and Senator Shelley Capito, the main Republican negotiator. [L2N2NL2PG]
Mowrey is focusing on companies he believes are undervalued that would benefit from an upgrade of technology-focused infrastructure like cell phone towers and data centers. 
Shares of American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT), one of Mowrey's holdings, are up 17% for the year. 
Investors have embraced infrastructure stocks at a time when concerns about rising inflation, lingering disruptions in global supply chains from the coronavirus pandemic and accommodative central bank policies have helped push prices for raw materials to multi-year highs.
Investors trying to gauge the inflation threat will keep a close eye on U.S. consumer price data, to be released on June 10. 
A much stronger than expected CPI number sparked a selloff in the market last month, bringing infrastructure stocks down with it, as many worried rising inflation could force the Federal Reserve to begin unwinding stimulus soon.[L2N2N628K]
Still, exchange-traded funds that bet on infrastructure stocks were the only type of thematic ETFs to attract positive net inflows in May, according to data from  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). Infrastructure ETFs were up 76.1% for the year through May, more than double the return of other thematic bets such as robotics or digital security. 
The utilities sector may have the most to gain over the long term from roughly $384 billion in federal spending from Biden's proposed bill,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) noted in an analyst report. However, rising Treasury yields will likely leave the sector unattractive over the next six to 18 months, the firm said. 
""The full ramifications of the American Jobs Plan will take multiple years to convert to growth for utilities firms,"" the firm said. 
Investors who are skeptical that Congress will pass an infrastructure bill should focus on areas such as clean energy, automotive parts and manufacturing, and agricultural machinery, which have not had the same run-up as commodity-tied businesses, said Brian Sponheimer, a portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust fund. 

Automotive companies will likely continue benefiting from above-trend demand through at least 2023 as the global semiconductor shortage and a lack of inventory keeps supplies low, said Sponheimer, whose position in parts supplier Genuine Parts Co is among his fund's ten-largest holdings. 
If lawmakers cannot reach a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure, ""there are reasons to think that there are supply chain challenges that push out growth for pockets of the market through 2022 and 2023,"" he said.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>","Analysis: With popcorn and tweets, AMC's Aron rides retail investor wave","By David Randall and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Free popcorn for shareholders. Following more than 500 die-hard fans of his company's stock on Twitter. Retweeting a video of what appears to be an airplane flying a banner with the meme-stock rallying cry ""AMC to the Moon"" around Manhattan. 
Welcome to the world of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron, who since the beginning of the year has taken to new heights the role of chief promoter of a company that was on the brink of bankruptcy. 
At a time when many on Wall Street argue that the movie theater operator is over-valued and in dire need of an accelerated economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to justify its share price, Aron, 66, is leaning in to the growing power of individual investors to keep so-called meme stocks surging. 
""Watch out naysayers, AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!"" Aron wrote in a June 1 tweet https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152. 
He has been riding a wave of enthusiasm for the stock. AMC shares are up nearly 3,000% since the start of the year and almost doubled on Wednesday to close at $62.55 a share, way above the average target price of $5.11 among Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data. AMC is now valued at $28.2 billion, based on Wednesday's closing price.
Aron, who became CEO in 2016 after running the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, started promoting AMC after its shares were swept up in a retail buying frenzy in January. 
AMC did not respond to a request for comment, and Aron did not reply to a direct message on Twitter. 
Aron is part of a growing number of executives on Wall Street such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk and the incoming chairman of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), Ryan Cohen, who appear to be doing more to court retail rather than institutional investors. 
""These individual investors likely own a majority of our shares,"" Aron said during the company's May earnings call. ""They own AMC. We work for them. I work for them.""
Some analysts are skeptical that such showmanship will bolster AMC's share price long-term. There are no actively managed stock funds among the company's 20 largest shareholders, according to Refinitiv data, leaving open the risk that a shift in retail investor opinion could quickly sink its shares. 
""The Twitter horde love him. He's playing to the crowd and it's working,"" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, who questioned AMC'S stated strategy of issuing new shares to raise capital. ""He'd be better off improving the balance sheet and providing some stability for the business,"" he said. 
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that selling enough movie tickets and popcorn to justify a $40 share price for the company - where it was trading early on Wednesday - would require that revenues nearly double from his 2022 estimates of $322,000 per screen from movie tickets and $6 per person in spending on food and drinks. 
""It's hard to understand why AMC would perform at double its historical average,"" he said. 
Aron, whose career includes a decade as chief executive of Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) Inc and a stint leading Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc, focused more of his attention on connecting with consumers rather than retail shareholders in his previous executive roles. 
At the 76ers, for instance, he was part of a charge to cut ticket prices, while at Vail Resorts he was instrumental in expanding the company into a nationwide business. Shares of the company fell nearly 4% when he announced his resignation in 2006. 

Promoting a company's shares to retail investors may be the new reality for many companies, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group. 
""CEOs have always been showmen and a big part of what they do is put on shows for institutional investors,"" said Paulsen. ""You may have a Reddit group that is the focus of the tweet but the reality is institutional guys like me are going to hear about it just as quickly.""

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Friday, led by technology shares, after a tepid U.S. monthly jobs report relieved investor concerns the Federal Reserve might rein in monetary stimulus soon.
U.S. employers increased hiring in May and raised wages as they competed for workers. But the nonfarm payrolls increase of 559,000 jobs was below the 650,000 forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
Investors were concerned that a robust jobs report that pointed to rising inflation could prompt the Fed to pull back on stimulus put in place during the pandemic.
""It keeps pressure off the Fed and will enable them to keep their low interest rate policy in place longer and take more of a wait-and-see attitude,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""The opportunity to keep rates low is good news for risk takers.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 179.35 points, or 0.52%, to 34,756.39, the S&P 500 gained 37.04 points, or 0.88%, to 4,229.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 199.98 points, or 1.47%, to 13,814.49.
All three indexes rose for the week, with the Nasdaq posting its third straight weekly gain.
The heavyweight S&P 500 tech sector was the best-performing group on Friday, rising 1.9%, as longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
Tech and other growth stocks are seen as particularly vulnerable if inflation drives up bond yields and more heavily discounts the value of future cash flows. The Russell 1000 growth index gained 1.4% against a 0.4% rise for the counterpart Russell value index, as the financials sector, a key value group, lagged, rising just 0.2%. 
“It’s just a risk-on trade because the market believes rates are going to stay lower for longer,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.
Overall, the S&P 500 is up 12.6% this year and near record-high levels.
The wild rides for so-called ""meme stocks"" kept investors' attention, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings shares falling 6.7% but rising over 80% for the week.
Billionaire William Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings dropped 11.9% after news it was in talks to buy 10% of Universal Music Group.
Next week, investors will watch Washington for clues on whether an outsized rally in shares of companies that would benefit from President Joe Biden's proposed $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan has more room to run. [L2N2NM25U]
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 20 new lows.
About 9.9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 10.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) - Major airlines are pressing the United States government on its decision not to move quickly to relax COVID-19 restrictions that block travelers who have been in much of Europe and elsewhere even as other countries began to ease prohibitions.
On Monday, the heads of several major airlines as well as the chief executives of Heathrow Airport and industry group the U.S. Travel Association will hold a virtual news conference to push for removal of travel restrictions between the United States and the United Kingdom. On hand will be the CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), IAG (LON:ICAG) unit British Airways, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp.
The airline CEOs on May 11 had called for a summit between U.S. officials, UK officials, and airlines to discuss how to ""expeditiously reopen transatlantic travel.""
Since March 2020, the United States has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have been in the UK within the last 14 days from entering the country. Most U.S. travelers visiting the UK must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival.
Airline and administration officials say no change is expected in the near term but add it is possible the restrictions could be removed as early as July 4 or thereabouts, but they caution no decisions have been made.
On Friday, France said vaccinated Americans starting on June 9 will be able to travel to the country. United said it would resume Paris flights from Washington in July and Delta said it was adding flights to France as well.
At a press event at Washington National Airport on Friday, American Airlines President Robert Isom said, ""We know there is tremendous pent-up demand for service.""
Isom said the airline has ""a lot of capacity to be ready to go"" for European travel. Asked if July 4 would be too late for European summer travel, Isom said: ""We're going to take it whenever it comes.""
Airline officials had held out hope earlier that by late May, the United States would have lifted travel restrictions on the United Kingdom and Ireland, where new COVID-19 cases have plummeted. (See graphic, Global vaccination tracker: https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/)
The travel restrictions also apply to most non-U.S. citizens in Brazil, South Africa, India and Iran.
The Biden administration held a call with British officials on Thursday, people briefed on the matter said, but the White House gave no indication it is planning to lift restrictions.
The White House, which is focused on boosting U.S. vaccination rates and reducing COVID-19 cases, declined to comment on Friday. 

President Joe Biden is certain to face questions about the issue from foreign leaders when he travels to Europe next week.
""We certainly understand the desire of many Europeans to come to travel the United States and vice versa,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said May 21. ""We can't respond to public pressure or even emotion. We have to rely on the guidance of our health and medical experts.""

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) edged lower on Friday, closing out a wild week with a gain of just over 83% as the action reinvigorated the meme stock craze and the investors behind it
""AMC has a very strong following of believers,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""They're trying to hold strong, and they believe they're going to drive this to the moon.""
The movie theater chain’s shares ended the day down 6.7% to $47.91 after trading in both positive and negative territory during the session. 
AMC has been at the center of a fresh wave of buying by retail investors who hyped the stock in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, breathing new life into a phenomenon that began with January’s more than 1,600% gain in GameStop (NYSE:GME). Meme stocks got the name because their explosion in trading volume stems from interest and promotion on social media. 
The past week’s blistering rally saw the market capitalization of AMC, which was at the brink of bankruptcy not long ago, swell to nearly $24 billion and put its year-to-date gain at 2,160%. The rise in part reflects optimism about the re-opening of public venues like cinemas after pandemic shutdowns, but most analysts say that the scale of the rally is out of line with AMC's fundamentals. 
Despite the big gains, short interest in AMC held relatively steady during the week, with 88.20 million shares shorted by the end of Thursday's session equating to 17.65% of AMC's float, according to the latest available data from S3 Partners. 
""We have seen AMC short-covering this week, but by no means are we seeing a wholesale short squeeze in this stock at the moment,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.
A short squeeze, which occurs when a rising share price forces bearish investors to unwind their bets, helped fuel the big rally in GameStop earlier this year.
Short interest in AMC stood at around 20% earlier in the week, the firm's data showed. Shorts are now down $3.98 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses. 
Some Wall Street banks, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group LLC, have tightened their rules for who can bet against some meme stocks, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people familiar with the moves.
TD Ameritrade put in place trading limitations on AMC Entertainment Holdings' shares, the retail brokerage's website showed on Friday.
SECOND SHARE OFFERING
Meanwhile, several AMC executives on Friday reported personal stock sales totaling more than 88,0000 shares after the close of trading.
AMC on Thursday completed its second share offering in three days, taking advantage of a nearly 400% surge in its share price since mid-May.
""AMC has made the best of its current 'meme stock' status by selling shares at a premium, and has raised significant capital doing so,"" said Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese, who raised her firm’s price target on AMC to $7.50 from $6.50.
""We expect significant volatility in shares of AMC to continue, driven by trading momentum unrelated to AMC's fundamentals,"" Reese said.
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd, a cybersecurity software company whose shares have been caught up in a social media-driven rally, slid 12.5%, leaving it with a 37.9% gain for the week . The company’s shares are up 98.3% year-to-date.
Shares of meme stocks GameStop and Koss Corp were down 3.8% and 12.6%, respectively.

This week’s rally in AMC and other social media darlings sparked celebration among some WallStreetBets users, while others exhorted one another to hold onto their shares and looked forward to next week.
“The shorts are playing a dangerous game and soon they will be burnt. They are shaking off panic sellers,” wrote Reddit user KocaKolaKlassic in a thread focused on Blackberry (TSX:BB) shares. ""Eventually there will be very few and to the moon we go.”

513,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 06:23PM ET</span>","Retailers, newspapers, printing firms oppose U.S. postal rate hikes","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of retailers, newspapers, printers, greeting card companies and others oppose the U.S. Postal Service plan to hike postage prices for most mail by 7% and called on Congress to direct a new review before the increases take effect.
The group includes the National Retail Federation, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), the National Newspaper Association, Envelope Manufacturers Association, Greeting Card Association and the American Forest & Paper Association.
The price increases to be implemented on Aug. 29 ""will impose new and substantial costs to the detriment of the American public and businesses, especially small businesses, nonprofits and charities, consumers generally ... and, of course, the millions of jobs postal-reliant businesses support,"" the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service said in a letter on Friday.
USPS said in response on Friday that for the last 14 years it ""has not had sufficient pricing authority to respond to changing market realities."" 
USPS said the price hikes are needed because over the past 10 years, mail volume has declined by 46 billion pieces, or 28%, and is continuing to decline. ""While we may have experienced an increase in revenue over the last year, it is not enough to offset the more than decade worth of losses,"" a USPS spokesman said.
The agency says it will still have some of the lowest letter-mail postage rates in the industrialized world.
USPS has proposed a plan to cut $160 billion in forecasted red ink over the next decade. The plan would increase the cost of a stamp for first-class mail by 3 cents, to 58 cents. 
The group noted USPS wants to generate an additional $35 billion-to-$52 billion from mail over 10 years. 

""Increases of this magnitude are fundamentally unaffordable. Businesses reliant on USPS jointly generate $1.6 trillion in commerce and employ more than 7 million Americans ... Small businesses and others will cut back on mail, with some not able to survive, and larger businesses will simply move more paper communications online.""
Other members include the News Media Association, Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), Quad Graphics, R.R. Donnelly, Major Mailers Association and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said it had removed the head of the oversight board that sets standards for audits of public companies and planned to replace the rest of the board in due course.
The SEC said in a statement that it had voted to remove William Duhnke III as chair of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a role he has held since January 2018, effective Friday. The other four members of the board will stay on, but the SEC -- which oversees the accounting watchdog -- is soliciting resumes for those roles. 
Duhnke's ouster is a warning shot by the new SEC chair Gary Gensler, who took the helm at the markets regulator in April. The PCAOB, which was created by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act following major accounting scandals, has long been criticized by Democrats for being toothless. 
The PCAOB has also come under criticism by hawks who wanted it to take a tougher stance on Chinese auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies which have generally evaded U.S. oversight.
""The PCAOB has an opportunity to live up to Congress’s vision in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,"" Gensler said in the statement. 
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders last month pressed the SEC to immediately replace the board, which they said has fallen down on its job of overseeing audit firms meant to keep publicly-traded companies in check. 
While the SEC did not disclose the breakdown of the vote, Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman, the Republican members of the five-person commission, said in a statement that Duhnke's ousting established a ""troubling precedent.""

Former SEC chair Jay Clayton overhauled the PCAOB in 2017, appointing five new members including Duhnke, after the board's staff leaked confidential information to one of the audit firms it oversees. 
Duane DesParte, who also joined the board in 2018, will serve as acting chair, the SEC said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican airline Interjet hopes to strike a deal with creditors within a year so it can re-start operations after it shut down during the coronavirus pandemic in December, the firm representing it in the debt talks said.
Shareholders of the carrier owned by ABC Aerolineas reached an agreement in April for Interjet to seek commercial bankruptcy to allow it to restructure $1.25 billion in liabilities. Interjet had also been struggling before the pandemic.
Argoss Partners, the firm tapped to negotiate with Interjet's creditors, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that a judge was expected to start the bankruptcy process soon.
Carlos Ortiz-Cañavate, a partner at Argoss, said Mexican law requires a deal to be met with creditors within a year. 
""At maximum, it's 365 days. The sooner we can fly again, the better,"" he said, without giving a more specific date.
Interjet's spokesman, Carlos del Valle, said it was too early to say when the firm might restart operations. 
Igor Marzo, another Argoss partner, said Mexico's tax authority is Interjet's biggest creditor. He declined to state the amount owed, and said employees would have priority on collecting back pay. 
The airline's union, made up of more than 5,000 people, went on strike in January demanding back wages. 

Marzo said Interjet is talking with potential investors who could help the airline pay down its debt, but declined to name the potential funders. 
""To keep negotiating you need an inflow of capital,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on Friday and closed near all-time highs, and oil and gold rose while the dollar dropped after U.S. jobs data was strong but not as robust as expected, easing investor worries that the Federal Reserve would soon rein in monetary stimulus.
U.S. employers increased hiring in May and raised wages. But the nonfarm payrolls increase of 559,000 jobs landed below the 650,000 forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% after hitting a record high this week. MSCI's all-country world index, which tracks shares in 50 countries across the globe, gained 0.71%.
A stronger-than-expected jobs report would have heightened worries that the Fed might contemplate paring back its bond-buying program and raising interest rates.
""This lower payrolls number should keep investor concerns about inflation muted – as long as the job market remains depressed, it's hard to see wage inflation jumping higher,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Zaccarelli added that there may be some lingering concerns about overall price inflation as the Fed keeps rates lower for longer amid unprecedented fiscal stimulus.
Market whispers had been for a stronger number, analysts said. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh in an interview with CNBC welcomed a ""good, solid"" jobs report and predicted more Americans would get back to work in coming months as more are vaccinated.
On Wall Street, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lifted the S&P 500, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the index gained 37.04 points, or 0.88%, to 4,229.89, marking an overall near-record jump of more than 12% this year. Those technology firms account for more than 5% of the MSCI's all-country index's weight.
Shares for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also were up.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 179.35 points, or 0.52%, to 34,756.39 while the Nasdaq Composite added 199.98 points, or 1.47%, to 13,814.49. 
So-called ""meme stocks"" continued their wild ride, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings shares little changed but on track to nearly double for the week.
Analysts said investors were watching progress for proposed U.S. infrastructure spending. President Joe Biden rejected a new proposal from Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the White House said. They were scheduled to meet on Monday.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 20/32 in price to yield 1.5585%, from 1.627%, while euro zone bond yields edged lower as investors wondered about Fed policy.
Oil rose, with Brent topping $72 a barrel for the first time since 2019 on as OPEC+ supply discipline and recovering demand.
The dollar index fell 0.39%, with the euro up 0.36% to $1.2168. Strategists in a Reuters poll were almost evenly split on the dollar's near-term direction.
New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in April as a global semiconductor shortage weighed on production of motor vehicles and electrical equipment, appliances and components.

TAPER TALK
Investors have been parsing economic data to gauge whether inflation could force the Fed to change course.

""Will prolonged, low-wage inflation allow for a longer period of low, overall price inflation to reign? Or will a Fed that is slow to raise rates - because they are concerned about a weak labor market - create a higher-than-expected overall inflation regime?"" said Independent Advisor Alliance's Zaccarelli.
Spot gold added 1.1% to $1,890.65 an ounce after a 2% tumble on Thursday, its biggest since February.

The S&P 500 was up 0.52%, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 01.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52%, or 179 points.
The economy created 559,000 jobs in May, a sharp increase from the upwardly revised 278,000 in April, but short of economists’ forecast of 650,000.
While “this is not the ‘million jobs per month’ that looked like the base case expectation for the late spring ahead of the April payrolls data, it isn't a disaster either,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Average hourly earnings climbed 2%, stoking inflation fears somewhat as rising wages are unlikely to be reversed. But some suggested businesses could pass on rising costs to consumers to mitigate wage pressure, keeping overall inflation in check.
The tepid jobs report added credence to the Fed’s stance to maintain its bond purchases until there was substantial progress on the economy. 
“Powell's adjusted unemployment rate, which includes misclassified workers and labor force dropouts, declined by a more modest 0.2 % to 9.1%,” Jefferies added. [P]resumably the final destination is 4%, which is the Fed's estimate of longer-run unemployment … [but] we're only about one-fifth of the way toward that goal.”
Bets on a lower-for-longer Fed stance sent Treasury yields lower, pushing growth sectors like tech back on the trading menu.

Tontine became the biggest ever SPAC when it raised $4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) last summer, with Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square committing a minimum of an additional $1 billion. 
It did so to take a company public. Yet Universal is already in the process of being listed in Amsterdam by its French parent Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SA, and it will not rely on Tontine to go public, as most companies do in their SPAC deals.
Instead, Tontine shareholders will receive Universal shares once the music label's stock market flotation is completed. Tontine will carry on in search of another deal, with $1.5 billion in capital left to deploy. Tontine investors will also receive warrants in a new blank-check company launched by Ackman that will pursue another, yet-to-be-determined deal. 
The unusual deal would cap a worldwide hunt for a suitable target by Ackman, who previously flirted with home rental giant Airbnb and Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab Holdings as targets. 
Tontine's shares were trading down more than 14% at $21.51 in afternoon trading on Friday, as investors fretted over whether the SPAC was offering Universal too high a valuation.
The closer Tontine's shares trade to its $20 IPO price, the higher the chance that SPAC investors will choose to redeem their shares, taking away money that Pershing Square would use to fund the deal. Pershing Square said on Friday it would backstop any potential financing gap with its other funds. 
Pershing Square said it would invest $4 billion to buy the Universal stake. Investors in the SPAC will get Universal shares when they are listed, but will not be able to exercise their current warrants. Investors will also get rights to buy shares in a Special Purpose Acquisition Rights Company (SPARC) launched by Pershing Square, to do yet another deal down the line.
The SPARC will have $10.6 billion in capital available to spend on a new target. It will have no deadline to spend the money and will become publicly listed down the line, Ackman said.
Ackman added that he plans to make a full presentation on the deal once it has been finalized in a few weeks. 
A frenzy of SPAC listings in the United States has seen over $300 billion raised through the listing of blank-check acquisition vehicles in 2020 and 2021, according to Refinitiv data. 
The SPAC listing frenzy has cooled in recent months, with new issuance dropping dramatically and existing blank check vehicles trading down as a higher interest rate environment hurt appetite for riskier investments. The IPOX SPAC index is down 23% from its February peak. 
AMSTERDAM LISTING
Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, has benefited from growing streaming revenues at the world's biggest music label, which is behind artists such as Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga. 
It has already sold chunks of Universal Music to a consortium led by Chinese giant Tencent, and plans to list Universal in Amsterdam by September as part of a two-step transaction to distribute 60% of the label to existing investors. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in April raised its estimate of Universal's valuation to 44 billion euros, amid a faster shift to music streaming.
With about 2 billion euros of debt for Universal, the implied equity value for the music label is roughly 33 billion euros, along the lines of the valuation given by Vivendi last month, Bernstein said in a note.
""Universal Music Group is one of the greatest businesses in the world,"" Ackman said in a statement. 
A Vivendi spokesman confirmed on Friday there were no changes to the plans for a Universal IPO by Sept. 27 after the deal with Ackman. The company, which owns 80% of Universal, had already flagged it could sell an additional 10% of the group to an American investor prior to the IPO. 
Bringing in Ackman will diminish the stakes held by Vivendi, at the end of the distribution-in-kind, giving Vivendi 10%, Pershing Square 10%, Bollore 16% and the Tencent-led consortium 20%. 
Vivendi shareholders are due to vote on the transaction at a June 22 investor meeting. 
The Universal IPO plan has raised hackles of activist fund Bluebell, however, which said it penalized minority shareholders as the distribution-in-kind structure was not tax efficient. 

Bluebell, which has declined to reveal the size of its stake in Vivendi, has called on France's markets watchdog to examine disclosures around the deal.

Cases in point are  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Snowflake (SNOW), Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA). They are trading at lofty valuations now and we don't think their financials justify those valuations. So, these stocks are best avoided now. Read on.COVID-19-pandemic-led restrictions heightened demand for cloud-based services from most industries last year. And the future looks promising for the cloud industry due to continuing advancements in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) space and rapid deployment of 5G, among other factors. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 17.9% CAGR between 2021- 2028.
However, amid the ongoing economic recovery, investors are rotating away from expensive tech stocks to capitalize on the higher growth potential of cyclical stocks, which is pushing some super expensive cloud stocks out of investors' portfolios. This is evident in the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF’s (SKYY) 0.1% loss over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 9.8% gains.
The sky-high valuations of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM), Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV), and Okta, Inc.’s (OKTA), as examples, don’t justify their recent financial performance and growth prospects. So, we think these stocks could continue retreating in the near term.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped Friday as a soft monthly jobs report for the second month in a row renewed bets the Federal Reserve will have to wait longer to abandoned its easy monetary policy stance.
The S&P 500 was up 0.79%, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, or 139 points.
The economy created 559,000 jobs in May, a sharp increase from the upwardly revised 278,000 in April, but short of economists’ forecast of 650,000.
While “this is not the ‘million jobs per month’ that looked like the base case expectation for the late spring ahead of the April payrolls data, it isn't a disaster either,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Average hourly earnings climbed 2%, stoking inflation fears somewhat as rising wages are unlikely to be reversed. But some suggested businesses could pass on rising costs to consumers to mitigate wage pressure, keeping overall inflation in check.
The tepid jobs report added credence to the Fed’s stance to maintain its bond purchases until there was substantial progress on the economy. 
“Powell's adjusted unemployment rate, which includes misclassified workers and labor force dropouts, declined by a more modest 0.2 % to 9.1%,” Jefferies added. [P]resumably the final destination is 4%, which is the Fed's estimate of longer-run unemployment … [but] we're only about one-fifth of the way toward that goal.”
Bets on a lower-for-longer Fed stance sent Treasury yields lower, pushing growth sectors like tech back on the trading menu.
With the exception of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up about quarter of the S&P 500 weighting, climbed more than 1%.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were supported by rising oil prices amid expectations strong demand over the summer months will help offset the gradual increase in crude production from major oil producers next month.
The wild swings in so-called Reddit meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) continued as the movie chain tapped the market for more cash for the second time this week. Following its announcement to sell 8.5 million shares, AMC said Friday it may sell up to 11.6 million shares. GameStop (NYSE:GME) slipped 1%, while BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was down 10%.
In other news, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) jumped nearly 17% after delivering better-than-expected guidance on revenue following a Q1 beat on both the top and bottom lines."

Bitcoin wallets can be stored offline or online at cryptocurrency exchanges, venues where bitcoin can be bought and sold for traditional currencies or other virtual coins.
With a non-custodial wallet, you have sole control of your private keys, which in turn control your cryptocurrency and prove the funds are yours. With a custodial wallet, another party controls your private keys. Most custodial wallets are Web-based exchange wallets.
Dorsey first made the announcement in a tweet on Friday and then gave some details at a conference called Bitcoin 2021 in Miami. Dorsey is also the chief executive of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). 
""We don't want to compete with other hardware wallets out there,"" Dorsey said. ""We just want to take it to the next level and get to 100 more million people, which have non-custodial solutions.""
As bitcoin and other crypto-currencies have gained in popularity, many companies have emerged to serve a growing need to protect these assets from online theft. 
""If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,"" said Dorsey.

Shares of Square were last up 1.3% at $215.28. 
The company has further raised its bets on bitcoin since it disclosed in February https://reut.rs/34PFSZb it had invested $170 million more in the cryptocurrency.

Instead, we think the stocks of aerospace companies  Lockheed Martin  (LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  (NOC) have the potential to outperform the market given that they are driving the industry forward. Read on for insights into these companies’ prospects.After previous failed attempts, Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic Holding, Inc.’s (SPCE) rocket-powered plane finally reached space. While the event was a milestone in Branson's nearly two-decades-long effort to achieve this. But now the plane is finally ready to ferry passengers to the edge of space, the company could face intense competition from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, which plans to emulate SPCE beginning in July.
Furthermore, since the company’s last mission in December was aborted due to a fire in the engine, potential customers might have qualms about flying in the craft. Delays in its commercial space flights and flight tests amid increasing competition have made investors nervous about the stock’s future growth potential. SPCE’s stock has declined 3.2% over the past three months.
Conversely, the shares of two other companies in the space sector—Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)—are performing better than SPCE. And these companies have better financials. We believe these two companies are well positioned to capitalize on the space industry’s growth potential. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

One of the groups that will thrive are casinos. Here are three lesser-known gambling stocks to consider buying: International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT),  Scientific Games  Corp.

One of the biggest beneficiaries of this will be the travel and tourism industry which had largely been off-line until a couple of months ago.
Already, there is a rapid recovery in TSA’s Travel Tracker which is showing that the number of people passing through TSA checkpoints is now at 67% of 2019 levels. In contrast at the same time last year, it was at 13% of 2019 levels. Another metric showing similar improvement is miles driven. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that miles driven (seasonally adjusted) are now back to pre-coronavirus levels in the US.
Given that many Americans have put off traveling and vacations for more than a year, we are likely to see massive pent-up demand well into 2022. Among the different groups within the travel and tourism sectors, casinos will certainly benefit as they are destinations for gambling, nightlife, concerts, and dining out. However, I’m more intrigued by the lesser-known gambling stocks that make and maintain the various games and machines that populate a casino.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission on Friday defined the scope of revised copyright rules adopted last year following criticism from governments, including France and Poland, but EU broadcasters and internet activists said there was a danger of censorship.
The revamped copyright directive, the first overhaul in two decades, aimed to provide fair compensation for the bloc's $1 trillion creative industry and its 11.7 million employees.
A central provision, Article 17, backed by the creative industry, would force Google-owned YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram and other sharing platforms to install filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials.
It triggered a fierce lobbying battle, pitting artists and news publishers against tech companies, internet activists and consumer groups, with France saying the Commission's stance could weaken Article 17, while Poland is challenging it through the European courts.
The platforms can be sued for making copyright-infringing content available to the public, even when it has been uploaded by their users. Critics say filters are costly and could lead to erroneous blocking.
EU countries have until June 7 to transpose the directive into national law.
The Commission in its policy paper published on Friday said Article 17 would only apply to online service providers and online audio and video streaming service providers that make money from copyrighted work uploaded to their platforms by their users.
Not-for-profit online encyclopaedias and educational bodies, open source software platforms and online marketplaces would be exempt.
Companies may also escape liability if they can show they have done their best to obtain authorisation for copyrighted works on their platforms and acted speedily to remove content when notified.
To mollify internet activists, the Commission said Article 17 should not apply to caricature, parody, criticism, review and quotation.
It said automated blocking of content should be limited to manifestly infringing uploads and EU countries should provide a complaint and redress mechanism to service providers so that their users can use it in the event of disputes.
Authoritarian governments can abuse automated blocking of content to go after critics, lobby group European Digital Rights (EDRi) said.
""This sets a dangerous precedent for future European legislation and for other governments around the world that would get inspired by legalised copyright censorship in Europe,"" its head of policy Diego Naranjo said.
The Association of Commercial Television in Europe was also critical and predicted the guidance would be ignored.

""This very last minute non-binding guidance is manifestly contentious and very likely to be challenged,"" ACT Director-General Gregoire Polad said in a statement.
Facebook had no immediate comment and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended at a record high on Friday as weak U.S. payrolls data pointed to lower chances of early policy tightening, while optimism over a euro zone economic recovery buoyed most sectors. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% to a new closing high of 452.57, having earlier hit an all-time high of 452.71. It added 0.8% for the week. 
Technology stocks rose 1.2% and were the best performers for the day, led by Austrian chipmaker AMS.
Shares of the firm rose 4.4% after it announced the sale of its North American digital systems business to U.S.-based Acquity Brands.
Global stocks rose after data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose less than expected in May, leading many to tone down expectations for hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. [MKTS/GLOB]
The Fed has cited inflation and labour market health as two key factors necessary for it to tighten policy. 
The data comes ahead of Fed and European Central Bank policy meetings next week, where investors will watch for hints on tapering their large bond purchase programmes. 
Both banks are widely expected to leave policy unchanged.
""It is too soon for the ECB to begin even hinting at any form of monetary tightening, even with economic growth improving,"" BCA Research analysts wrote in a note. ""While headline inflation pushed above the central bank's 2% target in May, core inflation only rose to 0.9%.""
Still, recent European data has shown the economy heating up rapidly after last year's COVID-induced lull. 
The dovish outlook on lending rates weighed on government bond yields, which in turn saw European bank stocks fall 0.9%. 
The banking-heavy Spanish benchmark index also fell 0.6%.
European automobile stocks were the best performers this week, adding more than 5% as positive sales and production data from major American car makers Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) boosted the sector.
Shares in British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), Wizz Air and easyJet (LON:EZJ) slipped between 0.9% and 3.3% after Britain removed Portugal from its green list of quarantine-free travel destinations and added seven countries, including Egypt and Sri Lanka, to its ""red list"" which requires hotel quarantine on return to England.

Ryanair slipped 0.8% even as its chief executive officer forecast unrestricted movement between Europe and Britain from July onwards.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>","EU to launch infringement procedure over Italian media law, newspaper says","MILAN (Reuters) -The European Commission is set to launch an infringement procedure against Italy over a media law potentially curbing Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY)'s interests in the country, newspaper la Repubblica reported on Friday.
The Commission raised questions over the validity of the law, approved by Rome in November, which allowed national communications regulator AGCOM to start an investigation into Vivendi's Italian assets to evaluate whether these holdings are harmful to media plurality.
France's Vivendi, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, holds a 29% stake in Italy's top commercial TV group Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), and is also top investor in former phone monopoly  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) with a 24% holding.
The law gives the Italian regulator the power to impose curbs on companies holding stakes both in telecoms and TV firms, after assessing total revenues, entry barriers and the level of competition in those sectors.
""The Commission considers such rules protecting media pluralism contained in the Italian law of November should have been notified under the transparency directive"", a European Commission spokesman said at a weekly briefing on Friday.
""I can also say that we are looking into compliance of the adopted law with the relevant union law,"" the spokesman added.
Vivendi had lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission against the Italian law, saying it was aimed at helping Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, in a long running legal dispute against the French group.

However, last month, Mediaset and Vivendi ended years of legal sparring with an accord under which the Paris-based company will drastically cut its stake in the broadcaster over the next five years.
Two legal sources close to Vivendi told Reuters that the opening of an infringement procedure would have no effect on the long-awaited deal reached between the two companies, which will be finalised in July.

Investing – Zumiez (NASDAQ:ZUMZ) shares were up more than 3% Friday as the company pleasantly surprised the Street with a profit.
The retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories benefited from higher discretionary spending as people stepped out to use their stimulus checks.
The pent-up demand allowed it to report a profit even as a portion of its global store fleet remains closed.
Net income in 2021 fiscal’s first quarter ended May 1 was $1.03 per diluted share, compared to a loss of 84 cents in the year-ago quarter. It exceeded the 3-cent profit of the 2019 quarter when the world hadn’t heard of Covid-19.
While the company didn’t provide a guidance as the pandemic is still raging in several countries and many are still in lockdown, it said it is “optimistic that we can maintain our positive momentum over the remainder of the year”.
Net sales for the first quarter rose 102.6%, to $279.1 million, from $137.8 million in the year-ago quarter. They were higher by 31.1% from 2019’s first quarter.

PARIS (Reuters) -CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container shipping groups, on Friday posted a jump in first-quarter earnings and said it expected strong demand for transporting consumer goods to continue for the rest of the year.
French-based CMA CGM's net profit rose to $2.1 billion in the first quarter from $48 million in the same period last year, while core EBITDA earnings rose to $3.2 billion from $973 million, the group said in a statement.
Container lines such as market leader Maersk have seen a boom in demand as the COVID-19 crisis has stoked buying of packaged goods by locked-down consumers, while supply chain disruption during the pandemic has further fueled freight rates.
""The sustained demand for the shipping of consumer goods seen since the summer of 2020 is expected to continue in the second half of 2021,"" CMA CGM said.
The privately owned group said its shipped volumes climbed 10.7%, also reflecting a favourable comparison with the first quarter of last year when the start of the pandemic hit activity in China.
To meet demand and adapt to supply chain congestion, CMA CGM added more vessels during the first quarter while continuing to expand its number of containers, which has risen by 8% over the past year, it said.
The group said it also relied on its growing non-maritime business, including a new air cargo division.
Its logistics business saw core earnings rise by 25.5% to $172 million, and remained slightly positive in net profit as CMA CGM pursued a turnaround of CEVA Logistics, acquired two years ago.
Group earnings in the second quarter should at least reach the first-quarter levels, CMA CGM said.
The group also announced the early reimbursement of $1.7 billion in loans, including the outstanding portion of a 1.05 billion euro ($1.3 billion) loan backed by the French state.

Its net debt fell by $1.2 billion compared with the end of 2020 to $15.7 billion as of March 31.

So, we think it could be wise to invest in EMCORE (EMKR) and inTEST (INTT). These companies are not making headlines but have solid upside potential. Read on.The rising demand for semiconductor chips from several industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer electronics, has since last year created a huge imbalance between supply and demand. The resulting increase in prices has been beneficial to the semiconductor industry. Consequently, semiconductor stocks are attracting investors’ attention. This is evident in the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 70.8% gains over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 38.6% returns.
Even though semiconductor manufacturers are increasing production to meet the high demand, with support from governments, the supply shortage may not end anytime soon. An increasing demand for advanced devices that feature a wide range of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and internet of things (IoT), should keep the demand for semiconductors at higher levels than the supply for the foreseeable future. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global semiconductor market is projected to grow at a 8.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2028.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on EMCORE Corporation (EMKR) and inTEST Corporation (INTT). These two companies are not making daily headlines, but could nonetheless capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 11:26AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China pushes Huarong to sell non-core units, mulls implicit support - sources","BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China is pushing China Huarong Asset Management Co to sell non-core assets, two people involved in the revamp told Reuters, while considering offering an implicit guarantee of the liabilities of the debt-laden bad-debt manager.
Regulators are pressing the state-controlled ""bad bank"", which has been trying to restructure since 2018, to sell units including a bank, a trust, an investment firm and a consumer finance firm, the sources said.
The plan, one source said, envisions the authorities informally backing $20 billion of dollar debt coming due this year for the sprawling company, one of the nation's four giant state-owned asset managers.
News of the plan lifted dollar bonds issued by Huarong Finance, a subsidiary of the company, to near three-week highs.
Huarong's problems spooked investors in China's dollar-bond market in April after it delayed its business results, prompting ratings downgrades, warnings from global agencies and an ongoing suspension in share trading. Huarong's onshore and offshore subsidiaries have made timely repayments on maturing debt.
""The benefit of bailing out (Huarong) is great,"" the other source said. ""So is the harm of not bailing it out.""
The Beijing-based company, established in the late 1990s to handle soured debts at state banks, has the Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder. Former chairman Lai Xiaomin was executed in January after a graft probe into the period when he expanded Huarong into a financial conglomerate.
The authorities are considering asking the other state-owned asset managers - China Cinda Asset Management, Great Wall Asset Management and Oriental Asset Management - to undertake similar streamlining after Huarong, the sources said.
They asked not to be identified because the information is not public and they are not authorised to speak to the news media.
Huarong told Reuters in an emailed statement on Friday that regulators have asked it to ""return to our roots, focus on our main business and build up core competitiveness."" It did not confirm or deny asset sales, saying it would make statements in the future, and did not comment on any debt guarantees.
""The company will earnestly fulfill our debt repayment obligations with a responsible attitude,"" Huarong said, ""At the same time, the company's liquidity is in good condition and we have made proper arrangements and adequate preparations for future bond repayment.""
The Ministry of Finance and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), Huarong's regulatory supervisor, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The authorities have not made any final decisions on a rescue or on Huarong's long-term business development prospects, the sources said. Regulators are waiting for the final audit results of Huarong's delayed annual report, which could be released in August, before making such decisions, the second source said.
The backing for Huarong's debt would not be a public announcement but more informal suasion from the authorities, as sometimes seen in China, to prevent creditors from taking drastic action, the first source said.
The CBIRC, for example, previously asked some banks not to withhold loans to Huarong and asked some state banks to be prepared to support it with cash, Reuters reported in April.
Following Reuters' report on Friday, a perpetual bond issued by Huarong Finance added 7.5 cents to trade at 68 cents in the dollar, while other issues maturing in 2029 and 2027 jumped 5 cents and 5.5 cents respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
SEEKING BUYERS FROM HUNAN TO GERMANY 
Beyond any rescue of Huarong, the plan aims to shore up confidence in investment-grade Chinese issuers in the offshore market, the two sources said.
Regulators are trying to avoid bankruptcy or ""haircuts"" for investors in Huarong's offshore dollar bonds after the company's difficulties recently sent their prices to record lows, the first source said.
The key aim of the current approach is to ensure Huarong can roll over debt and, ideally, use future cash flow to repay its debt, the second source said.
The three-year push to streamline Huarong has been slowed by disagreements among the company, its shareholders and regulators, a third source told Reuters.
Now, a number of possible asset sales are in the works.
The government of central China's Hunan province is in talks to take a controlling stake in Changsha-based Huarong Xiangjiang Bank, said the first source. The Hunan government and the Huarong banking subsidiary did not respond to requests for comment.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) plans to buy Huarong's stake in their joint venture investment firm, Huarong Rongde Asset Management, said a fourth source with direct knowledge of the deal. Germany's largest lender rejected this claim, saying that it has no such plans. Huarong Rongde did not respond to a request for comment.

Huarong has put Huarong Consumer Finance on sale, with food-delivery giant Meituan expressing interest earlier this year, the second source said. Meituan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A previous plan for the central bank to buy Huarong assets through a subsidiary was rejected by Chinese regulators, Reuters reported in April.

The separate moves open new fronts in Europe against the tech giant, whose platforms are used regularly by almost 3 billion people and which is accused of using its vast trove of ad data to better compete with companies from which it also collects data. 
The European Commission will assess whether Facebook violated EU competition law to unfairly compete in its Marketplace classified business, while the British regulator will also look at whether it is using the same tactic in its dating offering. 
""In today's digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. 
Vestager has already slapped more than 8 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in fines on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and is also investigating Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The UK regulator is also examining Google and Apple. 
Launched in 2016, Facebook's Marketplace is used in 70 countries to buy and sell items and has been under EU scrutiny since 2019.
""We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data,"" Vestager said. 
Online commerce has become ever more important during the COVID-19 pandemic and Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said in April that more than 1 billion people were visiting the Marketplace buying and selling service a month. 
The EU probe confirmed what a person familiar with the situation had told Reuters on May 26. Facebook said the investigations were without merit.
SEPARATE BUT COOPERATING 
The EU executive will also investigate whether Facebook ties Marketplace to its social network, giving it an advantage in reaching customers and threatening rival online classified ad services through its scale.
The UK investigation is broader, looking at how Facebook collects data from advertisers and the single sign-on that gives access to other websites with a Facebook login, and how that can benefit both Marketplace and the Facebook Dating business.
The investigations are separate but will cooperate.
""We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook's use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors,"" the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement.
""Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice,"" Coscelli said.
Governments around the world are looking at strengthening the regulation of tech firms that have become more powerful during the COVID-19 pandemic. G7 finance ministers are examining new tax laws to target multinationals.
Britain's competition regulator is launching a Digital Markets Unit to better regulate tech giants, with a legally binding code that is backed up by the threat of fines of up to 10% of turnover. 
Facebook said it would cooperate fully with both the EU and UK investigations ""to demonstrate that they are without merit"".
""Marketplace and dating offer people more choices, both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents,"" the company said in a statement.
The two investigations announced on Friday are just the latest regulatory challenge facing the Californian group. 
On Thursday it bowed to French pressure, offering to provide its partners with clear and objective conditions of access to advertising inventories and ad campaign data following a complaint three years ago.

The German cartel office issued an order in February 2019 to curb Facebook’s collection of data from users, triggering a prolonged court battle that continues.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) shares gained nearly 5% Friday after the company reiterated its 2021 revenue outlook even as its quarterly numbers missed the Street forecast.
It sees revenue of $195 million to $205 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022. This represents 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Traders chose to ignore the higher net loss of $39.4 million on non-GAAP basis, compared to $29 million in the prior year’s first quarter.
The first quarter is typically one of the weaker ones for the company as it experiences seasonally lower networked station sales.
ChargePoint President and CEO Pasquale Romano said the company expects an acceleration in the business as electric vehicles gain market share and economies reopen.
For the first quarter ended April 30, revenue was $40.5 million, an increase of 24% from $32.8 million in last year’s first quarter but lower than the $40.85 million estimate as per a poll by Investing.
ChargePoint expects revenue of $46 million to $51 million for its second quarter ending July 31.

As a result, home remodeling, including kitchen spaces, should continue. For similar reasons, the demand for kitchenware should continue to climb. Hence, we think kitchenware companies Tupperware (NYSE:TUP) and  Lifetime Brands  (NASDAQ:LCUT) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now. Let’s discuss this.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic shift in consumers’ lifestyle and buying habits. One change has been the widespread adoption of home cooking as a daily routine. The 'new normal' increase in home cooking has been feeding into people’s motivation to restyle their kitchens and purchase more kitchen appliances and products. This has been bolstering kitchenware sales.
Also contributing to the growth of this industry are fiscal stimulus checks that have driven a substantial rise in consumer spending.
We think a surge in spending on cooking utensils and various cookware products should lead to an increase in demand for products offered by Tupperware Brands Corporation (TUP) and Lifetime Brands, Inc. (LCUT). As such, these companies are well positioned to deliver significant returns.

Investing –  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB) shares popped Friday a day after the company surprised the Street with losses that came below what most had expected.
The database platform provider that counts cloud giants AWS, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) as its partners lost 15 cents per share for the first quarter ended April 30, less than half of the 35-cent loss a poll of analysts by Investing estimated.

MongoDB said Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) has hit a $400 million revenue run rate.
Developers use the open-source MongoDB database to make apps. Atlas is a version of the same that can be run in the cloud. As the company has pushed Atlas as a subscription-based model over the last five years, it now accounts for majority of MongoDB’s revenue.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 09:21AM ET</span>",Global airline body blasts EU safety regulator over Belarus ban,"PARIS (Reuters) - Global airline industry body IATA on Friday criticised a decision by European air safety regulators to ban overflights of Belarus amid outrage over its interception of a Ryanair jet, saying aviation safety must never be ""politicised"".
The broadside from IATA chief Willie Walsh came after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ordered governments to ban overflights of Belarus by their airlines, upgrading an earlier recommendation.
""This is a retrograde and disappointing development,"" Walsh said in a statement issued by the International Air Transport Association, which counts most of the world's major airlines among its 293 members.
""EASA should rescind its prohibition and allow airlines to manage safety as they do each and every day.""
The EU agency's safety rulings were issued after a Ryanair Athens-Vilnius flight was diverted to Minsk on May 23, and a travelling dissident journalist arrested. European governments are also taking separate action to bar Belarusian carriers.
Some aviation experts fear EASA's involvement would set a troubling precedent which, if followed, could obstruct air traffic and undermine the credibility of safety rules.
""Two wrongs don't make a right,"" said Walsh, a former boss of British Airways and its owner IAG (LON:ICAG) - adding that IATA had condemned Belarus' interception of the Ryanair jet.
""Banning European aircraft from using Belarusian air space with a safety directive is also a politicisation of aviation safety,"" he said.
Blurring safety and diplomacy will make aviation ""a toy of politics"", Wizz Air boss Jozsef Varadi said on Wednesday, adding that the Ryanair passengers were never endangered.
EASA defended its intervention on Friday.
""Regrettably the safety directive, introduced for the safety of passengers and crews, brings additional cost and work for the airlines,"" the agency said.

Some major carriers including Qatar Airways have continued to operate passenger and cargo flights over Belarus. IATA said it supported their decision, along with the incident investigation underway by the United Nations aviation body ICAO.
EU ambassadors acted on Friday to ban Belarusian airlines including national carrier Belavia from the bloc's air space, as many of the bloc's 27 member states have already done.

French judges have been holding hearings in Beirut's Palace of Justice since Monday, in a process that Ghosn's lawyers have called a first for justice since his arrest in Japan in 2018. 
""We think based on legal opinion made by an expert that part of the file has to be declared null and void since it is tainted by the mistakes made voluntarily by the Japanese authorities,"" one of his lawyers told reporters after the end of hearings. 
Ghosn was questioned voluntarily as a witness in the hearings, which are dealing with allegations of financial misconduct in France.
The architect of the Renault-Nissan auto alliance has been fighting multiple probes since fleeing to Lebanon from Japan in late 2019 and has said he hopes to clear his name in financial misconduct cases against him.
Ghosn, who has denied all wrongdoing, was chairman of both Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Mitsubishi and chief executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) when he was arrested on charges of under-reporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes.
He is at loggerheads with Renault over pension and severance payments he argues are due, and tax authorities have looked into his fiscal arrangements.

The French magistrates were also pursuing questions about events thrown by Ghosn at the sumptuous Palace of Versailles, including whether in one case he knowingly used company resources to host a party that was for private purposes.
The French prosecutor's office is also looking into financial flows between Renault, its Dutch affiliate and a car dealership in Oman.

Airlines and travel companies criticised Britain's decision on Thursday to remove Portugal from its quarantine-free safe travel list, saying it would devastate trade and last minute changes made planning for customers and business impossible.
But Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary earlier shrugged off industry worries about a second lost summer, saying that by July unrestricted travel would return.
The Portuguese rule change sparked a rush of passengers trying to get home before the deadline of 0300 GMT on June 8. After that time means travellers must undergo 10 days of self-isolation on arrival in Britain plus pay for additional COVID-19 tests.
EasyJet said it would add hundreds of extra seats by switching to larger aircraft and was considering adding extra flights, while British Airways said it was increasing the number of flights from Portugal to help customers get home.

(Reuters) - U.S. regulators are slated to decided by Monday whether to approve Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s controversial Alzheimer's disease drug, and Wall Street analysts and industry observers are deeply divided on its chances of making it over the finish line.
Given the desperate need for anything that can help patients with the mind-wasting disease, some analysts are betting on approval, while others put the chances well below 50%. 
If approved, Biogen's aducanumab would be the first treatment to address an underlying cause of the memory-robbing, condition, which is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
The Food and Drug Administration decision will impact not only Biogen and its partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd, but other drugmakers developing Alzheimer's drugs such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co. And, as a signal of the agency's permissiveness, the decision could have ramifications for other neurological treatments and the broader pharmaceutical industry.
Aducanumab is an antibody designed to remove amyloid plaque from the brain, but only one of two large-scale trials showed that it significantly slowed progression of the disease. All previous experimental medicines employing the same approach to Alzheimer's so far have failed. Patient advocates are lobbying for the drug to be approved, citing the high unmet medical need, but many doctors remain skeptical. 
A panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted in November that aducanumab had not been proven to slow Alzheimer's progression, despite a report from agency staff that said results from the successful trial were persuasive.
""We support a decision for approval of aducanumab ... It ushers in a new era of potential treatments,"" Dr. Joanne Pike, chief strategy officer at the Alzheimer's Association, told Reuters. 
Oppenheimer last month raised to 50% from 33% its odds for an aducanumab approval, citing comments from Biogen that it is preparing for a commercial launch. ""If the FDA approves aducanumab, (Biogen) could go to circa $400, and if not, to circa $200,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed said in a recent research note.
Biogen shares were trading near $271 on Thursday, down from their 52-week high of $355.63 reached in November before the advisory committee vote. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analyst Geoff Meacham said in an interview that he puts the odds at 75% that the FDA will not approve Biogen's drug.
Others said approval remains possible. ""I am going out on a limb, saying a two in three chance or so,"" ISI Group analyst Umer Raffat said in a recent webcast.
Analysts have also speculated that the FDA could proffer a narrow approval - limiting aducanumab's use to certain patients, for instance, or requiring more data to prove that the drug is effective. 
Biogen declined to comment on whether the FDA may make such a move.
The FDA's decision may be viewed as a barometer for how strict the agency will be under the Biden administration, which has yet to name an FDA commissioner. Currently, the agency is being run by Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock.

""If the FDA does approve, I think it could signal probably more regulatory flexibility,"" BofA's Meacham said. 
Aducanumab was studied in patients with early disease who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques. Some trial patients needed to be monitored for brain swelling. Biogen estimates that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which is given by monthly infusion, raising concerns about costs for both diagnostics and treatment. Analysts project annual aducanumab sales of $1.26 billion by 2023, according to Refinitiv data.

Investing – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares were trading in the red premarket Friday as the social media's data sharing practices come under fresh investigations in the E.U. and the U.K.
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority separately said they would investigate if the company violated rules by using data gathered from advertisers on its social media platform to compete with them.
The formal investigations will also assess whether Facebook ties its online classified ads service ‘Facebook Marketplace’ to its social network, in breach of competition rules.
Ar 8:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), Facebook stock dropped 0.4% premarket.
Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook, according to Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager who is in charge of EU’s competition policy.

Cooperation with Google could be attractive for publishers and other news providers and offer consumers better information services, it said.
""However, it must be ensured that this does not lead to discrimination between individual publishers,"" the statement said. ""Nor must Google's strong position in access to end customers lead to a crowding out of competing offerings from publishers or other news providers.""
In response, Google said that its Showcase product, which was launched last autumn, was one of many ways it supported journalism, building on products and funds that all publishers can benefit from. 
""Showcase is an international licensing program for news - the selection of partners is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria, and partner content is not given preference in the ranking of our results,"" said spokesperson Kay Oberbeck. He added that Google would cooperate with the probe.

The case is the second to be opened against Google in a matter of days, after the German antitrust body launched a probe into whether the U.S. search giant was exploiting its market dominance in the way it handles user data.
The Bonn-based watchdog has also made use of the enhanced powers it was given under recent reforms to Germany's competition laws to open new probes into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over their data practices.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>",Money market funds see more inflows as banking reserves surge,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) -Money market funds and equities saw almost similar inflows, BofA's latest fund flow statistics showed on Friday, in a puzzling investment trend amid rising concerns over a dialling back of stimulus by central banks.
With the U.S. banking system swimming in nearly $4 trillion of reserves, a major chunk of that is likely to be flowing into money market funds, which are absorbing the flush of cash and finding fewer options for investing it.
Some $16 billion went into money market funds in the week to Wednesday, on top of the $68 billion the week before, BofA said citing EPFR data.
Flows into equities also occurred, albeit at a slower pace, BofA's data crunching showed. Equities attracted $14.7 billion led by banks and material stocks, which typically benefit from an inflationary environment.
That has helped Europe, which saw $2.3 billion in inflows.
Fund managers have been steadily shifting towards stocks that typically benefit from rising rates, growth and inflation, like banks and energy, which make up a big part of European stock indexes.
The slowdown in equity flows was mainly seen in tech-focused funds. Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rate expectations because their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when rates rise.

BofA expects market trends in the second half of the year to shift from ""quantitative easing to quantitative tightening"" and ""inflation to stagflation"" - meaning rising prices despite a decline in economic activity.
BofA highlighted how U.S. retail sales soared 20% above pre-pandemic levels, while U.S. employment was 8 million less than in February 2020. Global stocks were treading water on Friday ahead of the Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing –  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock traded higher premarket Friday after the athletic apparel retailer raised its guidance for the year, riding on demand for its clothing as more people, coming out of a pandemic, look for healthier ways of living.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2021, ending Jan. 30, 2022, were guided in the range of $6.73 to $6.86, up from the previous forecast of between $6.30 and $6.45 seen when the company reported on March 30.
Net revenue is seen between $5.82 billion and $5.90 billion, up from the $5.55 billion-$5.65 billion forecast earlier.
In the first quarter ending April 30, net revenue rose 88% to $1.2 billion.
Revenue from company-operated stores more than doubled, but the contribution of the direct-to-consumer segment in the total revenue fell a little short.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.16 compared to $0.23 in the first quarter of 2020.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Friday, with investors cautiously awaiting the release of the highly-anticipated May jobless report. 
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 25 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 1 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 12 points, or 0.1%.
Wall Street has seen lacklustre trading throughout most of this holiday-shortened week, with eyes on the release of the May nonfarm payrolls data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
“The soft U.S. jobs report of just a 266k increase in April set the tone for the month of May. This allowed markets to look through Federal Reserve references to tapering, safe in the view that the central bank would not be hurried into a decision,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This week’s release of the May jobs report also stands to set the tone for trading in June.”
Despite the week’s muted trading, the major indices remain near record highs, helped by strong signs of economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic while the Federal Reserve retains very accommodative monetary policies.
The latest unemployment data released Thursday provided the latest signs of this recovery, with weekly jobless claims falling below 400,000 for the first time since the early days of the pandemic and May’s private job growth rising at its fastest rate in nearly a year.
In the corporate sector, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will remain in focus, with the meme stock seen over 6% lower premarket, the day after the movie theater chain raised just short of $600 million in additional funding via a stock sale.
The likes of Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD),  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are also likely to be in focus after they all released quarterly earnings after the close Thursday.
Crude oil prices pushed higher Friday, continuing the recent rally to multi-year highs, amid optimism that global demand for fuel was recovering while U.S. supplies slipped.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.4% at $69.11 a barrel, climbing to the highest level since October 2018. Brent was up 0.3% at $71.50, after climbing to the highest since May 2019. Both contracts have climbed about $5 each in the past two weeks.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected on Thursday in another bullish sign for the market, with data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing a draw of just over 5 million barrels last week, bigger than the expected  2.4-million-barrel draw.
Later Friday, traders will focus on the latest weekly update from Baker Hughes of the number of oil rigs, while the CFTC will release its weekly commitments of traders report."

""The same situation we will observe in June, but we will see a more realistic year-on-year monthly comparison from July on,"" Thomas Staertzel, chairman of the AEB Automobile Manufacturers Committee, said in a statement. 
Car sales in Russia fell 9.1% in 2020, hit by restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The very high level of sales growth in May was to be expected, given the ""pandemic lockdown effect"" last year, Staertzel said.
April sales of new cars had increased more dramatically, rising by 290.4% from the same month a year earlier, which was hardest hit by coronavirus lockdown measures.
April retail sales, meanwhile, jumped 34.7% year on year, helping the economy to recover after a 3% contraction in 2020, data showed on Friday.

Staertzel said the AEB expects lower sales of new vehicles for most brands in the coming months because of the worldwide shortage of electronic components.
AEB will renew its annual forecast with its next news release in July, he said.

Prices of copper, which is used widely in the power and construction industries, hit a record high of $10,747.50 last month as worries about shortages this year triggered a speculative buying frenzy.
They have since retreated, but an expected surge in demand as the enegry transition takes off will support prices at levels that will act as an incentive for investment in new production capacity.
Other investors include Orion Resource Partners and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Jetti Resources said on Friday. 
The company now has $100 million for development and deployment of its technology.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Investors see Biden's 15% minimum tax offer as positive,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors hailed U.S. President Joe Biden's offer on Thursday to scrap his proposed 28% corporate tax hike as a move in the right direction and embraced the idea of a compromise that could allow an infrastructure and tax package to move through Congress. 
Biden offered to set a minimum tax rate that companies should pay at 15%, two sources familiar with the matter said, in what would be a major concession by the Democratic president as he works to hammer out a deal with Republicans.
In return, Republicans would have to agree to at least $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending, versus the president's original proposal for a $2.25 trillion package.
""To set those rates at 15%, I think it would be great for the market,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.
Raising the global minimum rate on U.S. companies' foreign income to 21% from 10.5% and the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, among other Biden tax proposals, would slash earnings per share by about 7.6% next year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Monday. 
Headlines on Biden's proposal led the S&P 500 to trim losses by about half of 1%, though the market still closed lower.
Investors would welcome a compromise that allows the infrastructure and tax package to pass in Congress, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
""The alternative is the potential for a much more extreme package voted on only by Democrats,"" Meckler said. 
Rob Sechan, managing partner and co-founder at Newedge Wealth in New York, said anything that is less than the expected 28% tax hike will help the market.
""The tax structure now has gone from headwind to a tailwind,"" he said. 

A 28% corporate tax rate would have a huge impact on earnings, although the probability of a compromise is unlikely, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
""There's a higher probability that Democrats push through whatever ...they want,"" Hayes said.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) will move finance chief Marc Dunoyer to head newly acquired rare diseases business Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), using the $39 billion takeover as an opportunity to freshen up a management team that had been in place for eight years.
Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has faced heavy public criticism and EU legal action after AstraZeneca missed targets for coronavirus vaccine deliveries, with he and Dunoyer also attracting investor anger over their pay packages last month.
Dunoyer will replace Ludwig Hantson as boss of United States-based Alexion on completion of the agreed deal, with the proposed switch allowing Aradhana Sarin to move in the opposite direction and become AstraZeneca chief financial officer.
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker agreed in December to buy Alexion in a bet on rare-disease immunology to add to its fast-growing cancer medicines unit and a major COVID-19 vaccine.
London-listed AstraZeneca said Sarin's appointment is also conditional upon completion of the Alexion deal, which was approved by shareholders last month. Britain and the European Union are reviewing the deal, which gained U.S. approval in April.
As well as becoming Alexion chief executive, Dunoyer will also be appointed chief strategy officer at AstraZeneca. He will leave the board but continue to report to Soriot. 
Soriot and Chairman Leif Johansson have been in their roles since 2012 and Dunoyer was appointed in late 2013 https:// In an interview with the Financial Times last month https://on.ft.com/3zapoJp, Soriot indicated that succession planning had begun for the three men at the top.
SHAKE-UPS
India-born Sarin would become the first woman to take up the CFO role at AstraZeneca on a permanent basis. She joins a handful of women in the so-called C-Suite of top executives at UK blue-chip companies. 
Sarin's addition to the board increases the composition of female board members to 42% from 33%,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
""In Aradhana Sarin, we've appointed a talented successor to Marc,"" AstraZeneca's Johansson said in a statement. 
It was unclear what role Alexion's Hantson will take after Dunoyer's arrival. Hantson did not immediately respond to a request for comment via networking platform LinkedIn. 
AstraZeneca declined to comment and a representative for Alexion could not be reached for comment outside business hours. 
Hantson joined Alexion in 2017, as did Sarin and former AstraZeneca CEO David Brennan, to regain investor confidence after its top executives left amid an internal investigation over sales of Alexion's top-selling drug, Soliris. 

Soliris is used against a range of rare immune-disorders, and AstraZeneca hopes that an improved version of the drug will boost sales further.

An analysis of the country’s most important banks revealed that the liquidity requirements currently imposed would probably not be enough to cover liquidity needs in an emergency or in a default event, the government said in a statement on Friday after adopting its fourth evaluation report on the banks.
A working group including the Finance Ministry, the Swiss National Bank and Swiss banks regulator Finma is being charged with the task of coming up with ways to adjust the requirements, the statement said. The Finance Ministry should also draw up proposals on how incentive systems for big banks could be improved.
The Swiss regulators are taking a closer look at lenders’ stability, against the backdrop of a turbulent few months in the sector.

ROME (Reuters) - ROME, June 4 (Reuters) - The Italian economy, will grow by 4.7%this year, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday, raising a previous projection of 4.0% made in December as the country's coronavirus crisis eases.
In its twice-yearly economic outlook report, ISTAT forecast that gross domestic product will increase by 4.4% next year.
The institute's latest projections are fairly close to those of Mario Draghi's government, which sees growth of 4.5% this year and 4.8% in 2022.
The sustained economic expansion forecast by ISTAT this comes on the back of the 8.9% contraction in 2020, a negative post-war record, when the euro zone's third largest economy was hobbled by lockdowns to try to contain the coronavirus.
Growth over the next two years will be ""due to domestic demand, led by investments and, to a significant but lesser extent, by consumer spending,"" ISTAT said in its twice-yearly report.
Trade flows will offer only a marginal contribution to growth this year, it said, and will be a drag on growth in 2022.
Draghi has been easing COVID-19 restrictions since April in response to a steady decline in new infections and daily deaths.
Italy reported 59 coronavirus-related fatalities on Thursday, and 1,968 new infections. 
The International Monetary Fund on Thursday forecast Italian growth of 4.3% this year and 4.0% in 2022. 
The economy grew by 0.1% in the first quarter from the previous three months due to higher investments and inventories, ISTAT reported on Tuesday, sharply raising a preliminary estimate for a 0.4% contraction.
The unusually strong revisions, which took the country out of recession, significantly increased the possibility of hitting Rome's 4.5% full year growth target.
ISTAT forecast an average jobless rate of 9.8% this year, down from its December projection of 11.0%. It projected an average rate of 9.6% for 2022.
The unemployment rate stood at 10.7% in April, ISTAT reported on Tuesday, the highest reading since October 2018.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Some global banks, funds and other financial services providers say they are stepping up hiring in Hong Kong, in a sign the city's unique position as a financial gateway to China is outweighing concerns about Beijing's tightening grip over it.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), UBS AG and other banks are each hiring hundreds of people in the city this year, adding substantially to their existing ranks. Citigroup, for example, has said it is bulking up its staffing by 1,500 people, including additional headcount and replacements in 2021, double the number of people it hired a year ago. It has about 4,000 people in the city. A Goldman spokesman said the bank, which has about 2,000 people in Greater China, expects hiring in Hong Kong to be up 20% this year. The Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's market regulator, is seeing a rebound in licenses it issues for people involved in asset management, securities and other financial activities, according to data on its website. The total number of licenses it issued was up 1.7% at the end of March, compared with nine months earlier, and just shy of an all-time peak in 2019. ""Hong Kong has some unique advantages, and it will remain the gateway for many of our local and global clients to access China,"" said Kaleem Rizvi, Head of Citi's Asia-Pacific corporate bank. Many financial companies slowed hiring last year, after protests against Chinese rule and a new security law imposed on the city to crush dissent by Beijing, as well as the coronavirus pandemic, six bankers, recruiters and other industry executives said. The increased hiring plans of some major players show that they are now willing to live with the political risks. ""Everyone in the business community I have spoken with welcomes the peace and stability now, compared with the chaos of 2019,"" said Weijian Shan, chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-based private equity group PAG. To be sure, politics remains contentious and unsettling for some finance professionals, some bankers have said. Some expatriate financial workers have left or considered leaving Hong Kong, along with thousands of residents of the former British colony.
Hong Kong police have asked some banks to hand over account details of opposition activists and politicians arrested under a stringent national security law imposed by Beijing, and the government has threatened jail time for bankers handling assets belonging to media tycoon Jimmy Lai frozen under the new law. Hong Kong's financial regulators declined to comment on banks' hiring plans or some bankers' disquiet about the political tightening. CLOSE TO CHINA Bankers and other financial services professionals interviewed by Reuters said much of the lure of being in Hong Kong comes from the city's close ties to China and the business it brings. That business is booming. Flows via the stock connect schemes linking Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges rose to record highs in the first quarter of 2021. Companies, mostly from mainland China, raised more money through Hong Kong listings in the first five months of this year than they did in the same period of the last four years combined, Refinitiv data shows. Mergers and acquisitions in Greater China are the highest since 2018. Anthony Fasso, Asia Pacific chief executive of global asset manager PineBridge Investments, said Hong Kong was adapting to the new realities. “We believe that Hong Kong will remain a globally competitive international city at the doorstep of one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world,” Fasso said. HIRING SPREE Besides Goldman and Citigroup, Swiss bank UBS hired 200 people in the year through March, which consisted of 20 new full-time staff compared to seven in the previously financial year, a spokesman said. The bank took on 100 contractors and 80 graduates in the year to March. It was the highest number of graduate recruits to join UBS in more than 10 years. The bank has 2,500 people based in Hong Kong.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) has said it plans to add 400 staff in Hong Kong this year, part of its plan to recruit 5,000 people in the next five years in the region to wealth management in Asia. Lok Yim, Hong Kong chief executive of Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), said the German bank was also planning on making further strategic hires, after a first quarter that had been its strongest in years. ""We are probably two to three times as busy now as we were late last year,"" said Olga Yung, regional director at recruitment firm Michael Page in Hong Kong.

The donation of shares by Chief Executive Wang Xing comes as Meituan and other so-called platform economy companies have come under the scrutiny of China's anti-trust regulator, which announced a probe into Meituan in April.
On Thursday, the market regulator warned Meituan and several other ""sharing economy"" companies over opaque pricing practices.
""The changes regarding Wang Xing's interest in shares of Meituan represent a personal asset allocation decision that was made out of philanthropic considerations,"" the company said in a statement. ""This decision does not reflect any changes in his dedication to Meituan's business.""
In March, the founder of e-commerce giant  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), Colin Huang, announced he was stepping down as chairman after last year giving away 2.37% of his shares, worth $1.85 billion.
Last month, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced he will step down as CEO of the TikTok owner.
""The timing is a bit sensitive,"" said Xie Wen, a former Yahoo China president turned critic of the Chinese tech sector, adding that he does not believe there is one single reason behind such decisions. 
""Wang is a person with a sense of social responsibility, according to my understanding of him,"" he said.
Wang will convert 57.319 million class A shares into class B shares and transfer the class B shares into the Wang Xing Fund, which promotes education and scientific research.

(Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity hit a record high for the third straight month in May, driven mainly by low interest rates, soaring equities and higher dealmaking interest in sectors that have received a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Refinitiv data, the total value of pending and completed deals announced from the January-May period touched$2.4 trillion, an all-time record. Last month, $532.9 billion worth of deals were recorded, the highest for the month of May.

During the five months, 428 deals worth over $1 billion were struck, compared to 131 during the same period last year.
The surge in deals comes as more companies look to deploy massive war-chests as they focus on expanding their businesses, and as major economies across the world are resuming normal business after ramping up vaccination efforts.
The United States witnessed $1.3 trillion worth of M&A activity this year, while Europe and the Asia-Pacific saw $411 billion and $387 billion, respectively.

""Following a period of uncertainty, many businesses and executives are looking at ways to fast track expansion, maturing quickly by merging with companies that have complementary capabilities,"" said Paul Roberts, chief executive officer at ad-tech firm Kubient.
Analysts also said the world's biggest private equity firms have raised large amounts of capital over the past few years, which has contributed to the surge in M&A activity.
The merger between AT&T (NYSE:T)'s Warner Media and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), home to lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, is the biggest deal of the year so far, with the enterprise value of the new combined company standing at more than $120 billion.

The tech sector, which typically accounts for the majority of deal volumes every quarter, continued to lead the way -- deals worth $503 billion were announced from the sector. Industrials M&A volumes stood at $255.1 billion, while financial services accounted for $250 billion.
Acquisitions by blank-check companies or SPACs (special-purpose acquisition companies) also hit a record $348 billion in the January-May period.

SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep a traditional initial public offering.
Blake Hutchison, CEO at Flippa.com, said he expects M&A activity to continue to be strong for the rest of the year.

""There's no evidence of a sensational shift in market conditions in the near term. I sense that M&A activity will thrive in food & beverage and eRetail with consolidation,"" he said.
""For other industries, the surge to an online economy will force the hand of many. They'll see no other way but to acquire innovation as they'll need to leverage data and analytics found in digital players and their platforms / ecosystems.""

The company has confirmed 405.7 billion yuan in claims as valid and has rejected 353.5 billion yuan in claims, the person quoted Ren Qinghua, the head of HNA's liquidation team, as saying.
Another 156.5 billion yuan in claims are being assessed as part of a preliminary review while some claims have yet to be reviewed, added the person.
HNA Group and its related companies are ""seriously insolvent"" and it is unclear whether strategic investors can be introduced in the short-term, the person also quoted Ren as saying.
The person was not authorised to speak to media on the matter and declined to be identified.
HNA declined to comment.
After creditors filed a petition, a Hainan court placed the once highly acquisitive HNA in bankruptcy administration in February and in March it gave the go-ahead for 321 related companies to be merged as part of the conglomerate's restructuring.
Under Chinese law, a six-month period is usually given for restructuring although that can be extended for three months. If restructuring goals agreed with regulators and creditors are not met by that time, then a firm is broken up and its assets are sold off.
HNA, whose flagship business is Hainan Airlines, used a $50 billion debt-fuelled acquisition spree to build an empire that included stakes in businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.

But its spending and debt levels drew scrutiny from the Chinese government and overseas regulators. Its liquidity woes deepened when the COVID-19 pandemic paralysed travel demand last year, forcing the company to ask the Hainan government to step in.

ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) -Qatar Airways is weighing a multibillion-dollar investment with a potential order for 30 or more freighters, attracting interest from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which has begun offering a freighter version of its future 777X jetliner, the airline's chief executive said.
In April, the Gulf carrier said it was interested in a 777X freighter but had not been told by Boeing of any plans to launch one. But speaking to Reuters on Thursday, Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said a cargo 777X was now on the table as the airline ponders a freighter order from Boeing or Airbus.
""Qatar Airways is very interested in purchasing a large fleet of freighters because we have to now start replacing our old freighters,"" he said in an interview in St Petersburg.
""We have our programme of replacement over several years and we would be very keen to place an order with Boeing or with Airbus, it all depends on how things proceed.""
A Boeing representative told Reuters in response late on Thursday that the planemaker engages with its customers on its product development programme and their long-term fleet needs.
Boeing's Chief Executive Dave Calhoun separately said the board had not yet approved a 777X freighter version.
Qatar Airways' cargo fleet currently consists of 30 freighters, all made by Boeing, according to its website.
Al Baker has raised the prospect of a 777X freighter launch amid an unspecified contractual dispute with Airbus.
European planemaker Airbus is also gauging airline interest in a freighter version of its A350 passenger jet, which if launched would target a market key to Boeing, Reuters reported in March.
Boeing's plans for a 777X freighter have been delayed as the U.S. planemaker wrestles with certification delays and weak demand for its passenger version.
The new passenger version of Boeing's popular 777 series is not scheduled to start delivery to airlines until late 2023, three years later than the planemaker had planned.
""With Boeing we have no issue, with Boeing we have a large 777X order and we will take those airplanes, we have made a recommendation with Boeing on the deliveries on those airplanes,"" Al Baker said, without disclosing what the airline had proposed.

Qatar Airways, which operates only international flights, is on average filling around 40% of seats on all flights, he said, and had received $3 billion in equity from the government since the pandemic broke out to help it through the crisis.
""We are good for now, we have credit lines from the banks which we are using,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Friday morning, ending the week on a down note. The release of positive U.S. employment data raised concerns about a slowdown of central bank stimulus measures, with investors now awaiting further data to be released later in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.51% by 10:37 PM ET (2:37 AM GMT). Household spending increased 0.1% month-on-month and 13% year-on-year in April, according to data released earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.41%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.06%, with home loans data released earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.12%. China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.27% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.31%.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday said initial jobless claims fell to 385,000 in the previous week, lower than the 390,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 405,000 claims filed during the previous week. The number of claims also posted a fifth consecutive week of declines to a record low not seen since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Investors now await the non-farm payrolls data in May, due later in the day, which could lead to volatility should it deviate from expectations. St. Louis U.S. Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the labor market might be worse than the current unemployment rate forecasts.
“With seemingly all systems go on the jobs front, the economy is flashing some very real signs that this isn’t just a comeback, expansion mode could be on the horizon,” Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC), told Bloomberg.
“So what does that translate to? Likely more pressure on the Fed to make a move, perhaps sooner than many thought from the outset.”
Investors remain concerned that the price pressure will force the Fed to change the course of its current dovish monetary policy although some officials repeatedly stated that any inflation will be transitory and the central bank will keep its current policy unchanged for a while.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Thursday that the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 is far from the level at which the Fed might start to scale back its support for businesses, but added the central bank needs to start talking about a tapering of stimulus measures.
Other officials have also joined Williams in reiterating the need to start tapering discussions.
Investors will also be monitoring China’s response to an order signed by U.S. President Joe Biden on Jun 3. In the order, Biden amended a ban on U.S. investment into Chinese companies and named 59 firms with ties to China’s military or surveillance industries. Some of the affected companies include Huawei, China Mobile Ltd. (HK:0941), China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecommunications Corp.
The order will take effect on Aug. 2 at 12:01 a.m. in New York, and investors will be given one year to fully divest any stakes."

Meituan’s chairman and chief executive officer transferred 57.3 million shares to the organization, the company said in a filing late Thursday. That’s about a 10th of the billionaire’s stake in the company, worth HK$17.6 billion ($2.27 billion) based on its last close. The stock slid more than 3% in early Friday trade.
Meituan is grappling with an investigation by China’s antitrust watchdog, part of a broader campaign to curb the growing influence of internet giants like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. In April, Tencent founder Pony Ma pledged $7.7 billion toward curing societal ills and lifting China’s countryside out of poverty, echoing Xi Jinping’s priorities at a time Beijing is tightening its grip on the sector.
Wang’s largesse will go toward education and science, similarly echoing nationwide priorities in speeding technological innovation. The surprise move coincides with speculation over the billionaire’s fate after Wang posted online a classical poem about book-burning during the Qin dynasty that some interpreted as a veiled criticism of Beijing. The entrepreneur deleted it days later and issued a clarification that he used the poem in reference to the company’s competitors.

“The changes regarding Wang Xing’s interest in shares of Meituan represent a personal asset allocation decision that was made out of philanthropic considerations,” the company said in a statement. “This decision does not reflect any changes in his dedication to Meituan’s business.”
Meituan is awaiting the outcome of an investigation that kicked off in April over alleged antitrust violations. Financial regulators then imposed wide-ranging restrictions on its fintech operations, alongside those of peers like Didi. At the same time, renewed scrutiny over the treatment of its delivery riders added to concerns regulators may intervene to demand business changes, eroding profitability.
Still, some investors are betting that the crackdown on homegrown tech giants may be winding down, leaving stock valuations of some of the major firms at attractive levels. While a probe into billionaire Jack Ma’s empire, spanning Alibaba and Ant Group Co., took three to four months, a second batch of investigations into firms such as Tencent and Meituan may proceed more quickly. That suggests the regulatory cycle could be wrapping up as key players in the industry have agreed on what needs to be done, according to Hyomi Jie at Fidelity International Ltd., whose China consumer equity funds oversee $7.3 billion in assets.

Wang last week unveiled better-than-expected results and moved to reassure investors, igniting a rally in the company’s stock. He detailed plans to address government concerns about its business practices, pledged to work with regulators and improve its compliance standards.
The company also promised to provide insurance for millions of its delivery drivers -- many of them work as part-time personnel and lack proper employee benefits -- and has started to reform its commissions scheme in a move to cut fees for partner restaurants.
Meituan said in its Thursday filing that 9.35 million shares of the transferred stake had already been gifted to an unspecified third party.

Wyatt, 47, retired from state parliament in March after a 15-year career that included time as Aboriginal affairs minister, where he helped reshape legislation to protect Aboriginal cultural heritage. 
He will join Rio as a non-executive director, Rio said in a statement.
Rio Tinto destroyed 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia in May 2020 against the wishes of the traditional owners, causing a public outcry and costing Rio's boss, chair and two senior executives their jobs. 
Wyatt graduated from the Royal Military College Duntroon, has a masters from the London School of Economics, and family links to the remote Pilbara region of northwestern Australia, where Rio mines its iron ore, through his Yamatji heritage. 
He said he was looking forward to building on the momentum for change at Rio Tinto that had been generated by its new leadership team.
""I was deeply saddened and disappointed by the events at Juukan Gorge but I am convinced that Rio Tinto is committed to changing its approach to cultural heritage issues and restoring its reputation, particularly in Australia and Western Australia,"" he said in a statement.
Rio Tinto Chairman Simon Thompson said in a statement Wyatt's knowledge of public policy, finance, international trade and Indigenous affairs would ""significantly add to the depth of knowledge on the Board at a time when we are seeking to strengthen relationships with key stakeholders in Australia and around the world”.

Western Australian heritage protection legislation is still being redrafted and is expected to be presented to parliament later this year. 
Wyatt also this week joined the board of energy producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum.

SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday said there could be ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery than he expected from the aviation downturn during the pandemic. 
Speaking at a Bernstein virtual conference, Calhoun also said he expects Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be able to deliver the ""lion's share"" of roughly 100 787 aircraft sitting in inventory due to production defects and weakened demand.
With U.S. leisure travel going ""gangbusters"" and carriers needing to rehire and rebuild their networks and supply chains, Calhoun pointed to likely ""supply constraints for a while
""I think that will mean it's a healthy recovery and they'll get back to former pricing levels sooner rather than later,"" Calhoun added.
Boeing is working to emerge from a safety scandal following two deadly crashes of its 737 MAX airliner and an air travel collapse during the pandemic. 
It is also trying to decide the timing of its next new jet program, a multibillion-dollar dilemma that has sparked an internal debate and put the future of the largest U.S. exporter on the line, industry insiders say.
Calhoun said it would not be ""all that long"" before Boeing announces plans, but said the planemaker is not rushing the decision.
Regardless, Calhoun said efficiency gains on the aircraft would have to be found during design and assembly, as the next quantum leap in engine technology remains years away.
Separately Calhoun sounded notes of caution about the U.S.-China trade relationship, saying he could not predict when a ""thaw out"" would open up jet deliveries in one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that Qatar Airways was weighing a potential order for 30 or more freighters, attracting interest from Boeing, which has begun offering a freight version of its future 777X jetliner.

In April, the Gulf carrier said it was interested in a 777X freighter but had not been told by Boeing of plans to launch one. 
On Thursday, Calhoun pushed back against uncertainty over demand and certification challenges for the 777X, saying there will ""always be routes"" for the mini-jumbo. But he added the Boeing board had not yet approved a freighter version.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>","Biden administration will expand union rights for 46,000 TSA officers","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Homeland Security Department said on Thursday that 46,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers will be eligible for expanded union rights and the department will move to boost pay for frontline airport screeners.
Unions have sought the move for two decades. Since 2011, the officers representing 70% of TSA's workforce have had labor union representation but lacked certain protections other unionized government employees have, including some collective bargaining rights.
The announcement is the latest by the Biden administration in support of workers' rights to unionize and is consistent with a executive order signed by President Joe Biden, DHS said.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the department is committed to improving pay for the TSA workforce and will work with the American Federation of  Government Employees (AFGE) ""to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. "" The workers will also have access to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
""TSA employees are outstanding public servants who work on the frontlines, including throughout the pandemic, to keep the traveling American public safe,"" Mayorkas said.  ""They deserve the empowerment of collective bargaining and a compensation structure that recognizes and rewards them for their contributions to our safety and security.""
Lawmakers note transportation security officers (TSOs) have been denied full collective bargaining rights and are also subject to a pay and performance system that does not track the government's primary wage system for federal workers and do not receive regular salary increases.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called the announcement ""a critical victory for tens of thousands of hardworking union members and will finally allow @TSA workers to bargain for their future like other federal workers.""
He urged TSA ""to immediately come to the table to reach a fair contract, and we call on Congress to finally codify these workers’ bargaining rights into law by passing the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act.""
When Congress created the TSA after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, TSOs were excluded from protections most federal workers receive. They are subject to a determination by the TSA administrator.
AFGE National President Everett Kelley said members ""have been fighting for nearly two decades to put an end to the system of separate and unequal treatment."" The union added the decision is ""not just going to help the workers by giving them more rights and better pay, it’s going to help reduce turnover so that the agency can benefit from experienced officers’ expertise.""

TSA said last month it plans to hire another 1,000 officers by July 4, a peak U.S. travel period, after hiring 3,000 officers since Jan 1. 
U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Homeland Security committee, praised DHS's action and said ""TSA frontline officers have been grossly underpaid and denied basic workplace rights for far too long.""

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",United Airlines to bring back supersonic flying with Boom deal,"(Reuters) -United Airlines said on Thursday would buy ultra-fast jets from Denver-based aerospace company Boom Supersonic, bringing back supersonic passenger travel which died out with the retirement of the Anglo-French Concorde in 2003.
Under the agreement, the airline will purchase 15 of Boom's ""Overture"" aircraft once they meet United's safety, operating and sustainability requirements, with an option for an additional 35 aircraft.
The announcement comes less than two weeks after Aerion's plans to produce a supersonic business jet faltered due to a lack of funding for production. 
Supersonics have come under criticism from environmentalists for burning more fuel per passenger than comparable subsonic planes. 
United, which has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2050, said the aircraft would be optimized to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from its entry to service, projected to be in 2029. 
Currently, commercial aircraft engines are certified to fly with 50% of alternative fuel, with the rest using ordinary kerosene, but available supplies fall far short of that level.
Boom's Overture, a supersonic aircraft with 65 to 88 seats which will be initially priced at business class fares, would cut transatlantic flying time by 50% to about three-and-half hours. 
The era of regular commercial supersonic flights ended in 2003 when Concorde, flown by Air France and British Airways, was retired after 27 years of service. 
The plane's noisy sonic boom prohibited it from flying over land routes, and it suffered a double blow with a fatal crash in Paris in 2000 and the downturn in the aviation industry after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
The return of supersonic jets faces hurdles from regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which must first give approval for them to fly at supersonic speeds over land, along with pressure from groups like airports that want the planes to be no noisier than comparable subsonic aircraft.
United did not disclose any financial details though a spokeswoman said a deal was in place and a deposit had been made.

Earlier, United's head of corporate development, Mike Leskinen, told The Air Current in an interview that the transaction was not a firm order but it involved United taking the lead on ""a real aircraft"" project.
A Boom spokeswoman said the order meets the terms of a commercial agreement.

Companies must now have a stock market value of at least $13.1 billion to join the S&P 500, Wall Street's most followed benchmark. That is up from a previous minimum of $11.8 billion.
Falling below market capitalization minimums does not mean companies will be removed from S&P indexes. Nearly 40 S&P 500 companies currently have stock market values under $11 billion. 
Corporations face several additional eligibility requirements for consideration to be included in the S&P 500, as well as the S&P MidCap 400 and SmallCap 600.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had a market capitalization of over $600 billion when it entered the S&P 500 last December.
The minimum market capitalization requirement for the S&P MidCap 400 index will rise to $3.6 billion from $3.3 billion, and the minimum for the SmallCap 600 will climb to $850 million from $750 million, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a press release.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. traffic deaths soared after coronavirus lockdowns ended in 2020, hitting the highest yearly total since 2007 as more Americans engaged in unsafe behavior on U.S. roads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Thursday.
For all of 2020, 38,680 people died on U.S. roads - up 7.2% or nearly 2,600 more than in 2019, even though Americans drove 13% fewer miles, preliminary data showed. The fatality rate hit 1.37 deaths per 100 million miles, the highest figure since 2006.
In the second half of 2020, the number of traffic deaths was up more than 13%.
NHTSA said the main behaviors that drove this increase included impaired driving, speeding and failure to wear seat belts.
Deaths involving motorists not wearing seat belts were up 15%, speeding related deaths jumped by 10% and fatal crashes involving alcohol rose 9%. 
Michigan said traffic deaths in the state rose 10% in 2020 to the highest number since 2007, even as crashes fell 22% and injuries fell 22%.
""We intend to use all available tools to reverse these trends and reduce traffic fatalities and injuries,” said acting NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff.
In an open letter to drivers in January, NHTSA said ""fewer Americans drove but those who did took more risks and had more fatal crashes. ... It’s irresponsible and illegal to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, which not only puts your life at risk but the lives of others.""

Some experts said that as U.S. roads became less crowded, some motorists engaged in more unsafe behavior, including those who perceived police were less likely to issue tickets because of COVID-19. Data suggests a higher number of serious crashes last year involved drug or alcohol use than previously.
NHTSA said in October a study of early crash data after the pandemic lockdowns found that ""drivers who remained on the roads engaged in more risky behavior, including speeding, failing to wear seat belts, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) -All of meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY)'s global facilities are fully operational after a weekend cyberattack disrupted much of its North American and Australian operations, the company said on Thursday.
The Brazilian meatpacker's arm in the United States and Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), a U.S. chicken company mostly owned by JBS, lost less than one day's worth of food production following the hack, according to a statement. It said the losses will be recovered by the end of next week. 
JBS has recovered faster than some meat buyers and market analysts expected from the May 30 ransomware attack, which the White House linked to a Russia-based group.
The attack followed one last month by a group with ties to Russia on Colonial Pipeline, which crippled fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast.
JBS voluntarily shut down all its systems to isolate the intrusion upon learning of the attack, which failed to infect encrypted backup servers, according to the statement.
""The criminals were never able to access our core systems, which greatly reduced potential impact,"" said Andre Nogueira, chief executive of JBS USA.
U.S. beef prices initially jumped as the attack tightened supplies. However, American consumers should not see a lasting impact on prices ""if the situation continues to resolve quickly,"" a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said.
""The market is moving toward normalization,"" the official said.
JBS on Tuesday halted cattle slaughtering at its U.S. plants, which process nearly a quarter of America's beef, according to union officials.
By Thursday, the number of cattle slaughtered by U.S. processors including JBS was up 27% from Tuesday and 14% from Wednesday, according to USDA estimates.

Last year, the U.S. meat supply chain buckled as COVID-19 outbreaks closed slaughterhouses, reducing production and raising prices.
""We need to invest in a food system that is durable, distributed and better equipped to withstand 21st century challenges, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions,"" the USDA official said.

(Reuters) -Shares of retail favorite AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) went on a rollercoaster ride on Thursday before ending lower after the company said it completed another share offering, raising $587.4 million in additional equity capital. AMC has been taking advantage of a blistering run in its stock price to complete two share issues in three days. In announcing the latest issue, it said it did not know how long the run would last and warned investors of the risks involved.
""These prices are not going to last forever, so why not use this opportunity to shore up your balance sheet and raise some cash,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
Shares of the movie theater chain, which counts more than 80% of its shareholder base as retail, or 3.2 million individual investors, were down 18% at $51.34 at the close. The share price nearly doubled on Wednesday to a record close of $62.55 thanks partly to a wave of retail investor buying.
The wild ride is reminiscent of the huge gains that GameStop (NYSE:GME) made earlier in the year when traders bought up the video game retailer, betting against hedge funds that had bearish positions.
""Our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,"" AMC said in a statement on Thursday.
The company said it completed an 11.55 million share offering it announced before the market opened at an average price of approximately $50.85 per share.
A number of Wall Street analysts have said AMC is already overvalued and many institutional investors have said they are steering clear of the stock, which is popular with traders who congregate on Reddit's WallStreetBets and other forums.
Wednesday's record price was 30 times the level AMC traded at the end of 2020 and came a day after it issued 8.5 million shares to Mudrick Capital, which the hedge fund flipped at a profit..
AMC said in January it had secured almost $1 billion in new funding and cash since mid-December, and it has continued with further issues, including the two this week.
AMC after Thursday's close said it will ask shareholders to authorize the sale of only 25 million additional shares. 
The AMC board in April decided not to proceed with a plan to ask shareholder approval to issue an additional 500 million shares, but said it will propose that investors greenlight a smaller, stock issue at its next annual meeting, scheduled for July 29.
AMC has authorization from shareholders to sell more than 524 million shares of common stock. With Thursday’s offering, it will have sold almost all of them.
'WRONG DIRECTION'
The rise of streaming and competition facing movie theaters meant the U.S. economy's reopening from coronavirus closures is unlikely to boost AMC's performance, said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs. 
""AMC's business was trending in the wrong direction even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic ... We think AMC's stock is worth $0 per share, given its weak earnings, dilution from recent stock offerings and mountain of debt,"" Trainer said.
AMC shares have continued to gain as they were hyped online with calls for small investors to buy shares and call options on certain ""meme stocks.""
The breathtaking gains have hurt those betting against AMC shares, though some analysts say bearish investors have mostly held firm. 
Short interest in AMC stood at 89.98 million shares late Wednesday, compared with 90.87 at Tuesday's close, according to S3 Partners. Bearish investors were down $5.2 billion for the year as of Wednesday, the firm's data showed. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) told its clients on Wednesday that its prime brokerage arm would no longer allow the execution of short sales in GameStop, AMC and MicroVision Inc., according to reports in Street Insider and Bloomberg News. 
A Jefferies spokesperson declined to comment on the reports.
Meanwhile, AMC's bonds tell a different story to its stocks.

While prices have recovered due to the company's renewed access to capital, they remain in troubled territory. For example, a $600 million 5.75% bond due 2025 was trading at 80 cents on the dollar on Thursday. 
Of other big recent so-called ""meme"" plays, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd's U.S. shares closed up 4.1%, while GameStop was down 8.5% and Koss Corp shed nearly 24.3%.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, with tech shares dragging on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, as investors balanced concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserve reining in stimulus with relief about corporate tax hikes.
The Dow posted a slight loss after five sessions of gains. Stocks rebounded somewhat after reports that President Joe Biden offered to scrap his proposed tax hike. In talks with Republicans, the Democrat offered to drop plans to hike corporate rates as high as 28%, and instead set a 15% minimum tax rate for companies, sources told Reuters.
A better-than-expected U.S. weekly unemployment report and private payrolls numbers for May pointed to strengthening labor conditions, ahead of the closely watched U.S. payrolls report due on Friday. A measure of service sector activity increased to a record high.
Investors are focused on whether robust economic reports could prompt the Fed to pare back monetary support put in place during the coronavirus pandemic sooner than expected.
""The market is digesting strong economic data with some inflationary pressures and factoring in whether this will change the timing of Fed tapering and how to factor that into stock prices,"" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger in New York.
Sparking fears over easing support was the Fed's announcement on Wednesday that it will begin to unwind its corporate bond holdings acquired last year through an emergency lending facility launched to calm credit markets at the height of the pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.34 points, or 0.07%, to 34,577.04; the S&P 500 lost 15.27 points, or 0.36%, at 4,192.85; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 141.82 points, or 1.03%, to 13,614.51.
The heavyweight S&P 500 tech sector fell 0.9%. Tech and other growth stocks are seen as particularly vulnerable if inflation drives up bond yields and more heavily discounts the value of future cash flows.
""Higher rates and inflation are kind of the package deal that investors are watching right now,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""If you have rising inflation, rising interest rates, they are going to be especially harmful to growth stocks.""
The energy sector rose 0.3% and financials gained 0.2%. Those and other value stock segments that are expected to outperform in an expanding economy have topped tech and other growth shares for much of 2021.
Overall, the S&P 500 is up 11.6% for the year and within about 1% of its record high.
In company news, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) shares rose 6.4%, after the carmaker estimated ""significantly better"" first-half profits than previously forecast. Rival Ford added 7.2%.
Frenzied trading continued in retail investor favorite AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings. After big swings, AMC shares ended down 17.9% after the theater chain operator said it completed a share offering it announced earlier in the day.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 31 new lows.
About 12.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the roughly 10.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

This, coupled with substantial private investments and tariffs, should allow steel prices to achieve fresh highs soon. Thus, we think small-cap companies Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais S.A. (USNZY (OTC:USNZY)),  Schnitzer Steel  (SCHN), and  Insteel Industries  (NYSE:IIIN) are well-positioned to outperform established players. So, read on and let’s evaluate these names.On March 31, President Biden introduced an infrastructure spending package that totaled more than $2 trillion with the goal of rehabilitating U.S. infrastructure and the U.S. economy. Biden has characterized the fiscal stimulus package as a “once-in-a-generation” investment that would upgrade the country’s existing infrastructure base and bring “transformational progress” to the economy. The proposed plan is currently being negotiated in the U.S. Senate, where the Republican party made a $928 billion counteroffer to Biden’s proposal on May 27.
The United States’ infrastructure sector is looking at a potential trillion-dollar investment over the next eight years. The steel industry, which is currently witnessing soaring prices given the high global demand, should hit fresh highs soon. Section 232 tariffs placed on steel imports by the previous administration have led to nearly $15.70 billion in new capacity investments, allowing the domestic steel industry to improve. On the global front, steel production had increased 23% year-over-year in April.
The steel industry boom is expected to increase if an infrastructure bill is passed, given steel’s use in construction. Given this backdrop, we think small-cap steel stocks Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais S.A. (USNZY), Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN), and Insteel Industries, Inc. (IIIN) could be attractive additions to one’s portfolio, based on their immense growth potential.

(Reuters) -Broadcom Inc forecast current-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations on Thursday, as the semiconductor firm is set to benefit from the rising adoption of 5G technology.
As the global rollout of 5G ramps up, strong demand for higher-priced chips used in smartphones will benefit Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which counts iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer in its wireless chip division. 
The company, which also makes chips for data centers and servers, estimates third-quarter revenue to be about $6.75 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $6.6 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The company's fiscal third-quarter estimates typically include ramping up production for the launch of Apple's iPhones in the fall.
Shares were flat after the results. 
On a conference call with investors, Chief Executive Hock Tan said demand in the company's wireless segment was higher than expected in the just-ended fiscal second quarter, which could result in less demand in the fiscal third quarter. 
He also said that long-term supply contracts such as the one with Apple give Broadcom ""the confidence to invest in R&D to make (capital expenditure) capacity investment. And in return, we offer the best leading-edge technology in specific areas in a timely manner to our critical customers.""
Broadcom has been working to allocate the chips it can get to end market demand for electronics rather than to customer stockpiling, an effort analysts said seems to be working. ""While our industry checks do indicate significant double ordering in Broadcom's supply chain, we think Broadcom's customers are still unable to build much buffer inventory,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group.
Revenue rose to $6.61 billion in the second quarter ended May 2, from $5.74 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $6.51 billion.

The company reported net income of $1.49 billion, or $3.30 per share, in the second quarter, compared with $563 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $6.62 per share, beating estimates of $6.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global equities markets lagged on Thursday after stepping back from near-record levels earlier in the week, as investors studied strong U.S. data reports for economic recovery and inflation signals.
U.S. stocks wavered during the session and ended lower as investors experienced rosy reports about corporate tax hikes but still wary about the Federal Reserve potentially shifting monetary policy.
Analysts said the moves in major stock indexes have been muted in recent days as concerns about high valuations for many stocks following the months-long rally in U.S. markets gives some investors pause.
""The market is digesting strong economic data with some inflationary pressures and factoring in whether this will change the timing of Fed tapering and how to factor that into stock prices,"" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger in New York.
Oil was little changed following two straight days of gains that took oil futures to highs not seen in a year, after weekly U.S. crude stocks fell sharply while fuel inventories rose more than expected.
U.S. crude recently rose 0.07% to $68.88 per barrel and Brent was at $71.36, up 0.01% on the day.
Gold slid more than 2% as a strengthening labor market helped propel the dollar higher.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.574 points or 0.64 percent, to 90.483 after falling 2% in April and a further 1.6% in May. 
The euro was last down 0.66 percent, at $1.2129, drifting away from highs scaled earlier in the week, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.07 percent at 1,736.44.
A better-than-expected U.S. weekly unemployment report and private payrolls numbers for May pointed to strengthening conditions in the labor market, while a measure of service sector activity increased to a record high, pointing to a robust economic rebound.
The strong data could force the Federal Reserve to pare back its crisis support sooner than expected, despite central bank officials' reassurances to the contrary. 
Yet, wary investors backed away from big bets over concerns of inflation ahead of the Friday release of U.S. jobs data, which should offer further clarity on whether the faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery can be sustained and what that might mean for monetary policy.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, fell 3.06 points or 0.43 percent, to 711.36.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.34 points, or 0.07%, to 34,577.04, the S&P 500 lost 15.27 points, or 0.36%, to 4,192.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 141.82 points, or 1.03%, to 13,614.51.
A surge in euro zone business activity did little to improve sentiment. IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 57.1 last month from April's 53.8, its highest level since February 2018.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 1.6284%, from 1.591%.
While broader stock markets remain close to record highs, the momentum seen earlier in the year has ebbed as investors worry a stronger-than-expected rebound from COVID-19 means higher inflation and sooner-than-expected monetary policy tightening.
Thursday's weekly U.S. unemployment claims report will be followed by monthly jobs numbers on Friday, which investors hope will offer fresh insights into the recovery in the labor market.
So far though, ""increases in inflation expectations have coincided with equities performing well recently,"" said Oliver Jones, senior markets analyst at Capital Economics.
""In general, we suspect that these conditions will remain in place for a while longer.""

Capital Economics forecasts that real global output will grow at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years this year. 
""While it is possible that major central banks eventually have to tighten policy faster than is widely expected if inflation does not fall back in the way they are anticipating, it will be hard to tell if this is happening until next year at the earliest,"" Jones said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc surged to a record high this week in a blistering rally that again highlighted how an arcane options market dynamic known as a gamma squeeze can super-charge stock price gains. 
WHAT IS OPTIONS GAMMA? 
AMC's rally was partly fueled by heavy trading of equity options. These financial derivatives give buyers the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price in the future, depending on where the stock price is. 
As the share price moves in the normal course of trading, the value of these derivatives fluctuates with the changing probability of the options buyer exerting that right.
These changes are captured through a range of mathematical calculations, one of which traders call a gamma.
Anyone who sells options is ""short gamma."" Gamma is highest when the strike price of the options sold is very close to that of the underlying stock. 
WHAT IS A GAMMA SQUEEZE? 
Market makers who sell options may ultimately have to deliver the underlying stock, so they risk heavy losses if they have to pay more than they bargained for.
To hedge their exposure, they often buy or sell shares of the underlying stock.
In the case of AMC, hordes of call options buyers left market makers with a massive short gamma position that grew as the share price inched closer to the high strike prices held by bullish investors. 
As the share price skyrocketed, market makers bought AMC shares to offset their exposure, adding more fuel to the rally, analysts said. That is a gamma squeeze. 
CAN GAMMA SQUEEZE WORK BOTH WAYS? 

Yes. Market makers may be said to be short gamma from either selling calls or puts. When a stock is falling, market makers are highly motivated to sell the stock to hedge their exposure. 
However, a downward squeeze on shares from gamma-induced selling is generally less extreme, compared with upwards buying pressure, analysts said.

The health crisis and ensuing gym closures have pushed people to take up running and biking, creating a demand surge for clothing from athletic wear makers, including Lululemon,  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA).
The home-fitness trend coupled with an increase in interest in comfortable work-from-home lounge wear has prompted apparel sellers to double down on their casual offerings, with Lululemon also launching new styles of tank tops and shorts.
The owner of Mirror home-fitness platform said it expects fiscal 2021 net revenue to be in the range of $5.83 billion to $5.91 billion, compared with its prior range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion.
Lululemon said it expects adjusted earnings to be between $6.73 and $6.86 per share, compared with its prior range of $6.30 to $6.45.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $6.48 per share on net revenue of $5.68 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For the first quarter, Lululemon's net revenue rose 88% to $1.23 billion from a year earlier, as sales at stores that Lululemon operates more than doubled. Analysts on average had expected net revenue of $1.13 billion.
Excluding items, Lululemon earned $1.16 per share, above estimates of 91 cents.

""Our first quarter results reflected strength across all drivers of growth, fueled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business and a rebound in brick-and-mortar stores,"" Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald said.

Direct to consumer net revenue increased 55% to $545.1 million.

Amid surging market volatility, we think betting on the share of  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) and  Patrick Industries  (NASDAQ:PATK)—which have both been heavily bought by insiders—should yield substantial returns. Let’s discuss.High volatility in the United States stock market due to rising inflationary pressures and general price levels amid geopolitical tensions has resulted in modest gains in benchmark indexes and fluctuating share prices of most companies. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite have declined 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively, over the past five days. And the CBOE Volatility Index, which gauges market volatility and sentiment, has increased 10.8% over the same period.
However, the United States’ long term growth outlook remains favorable, driven by impressive job growth and proposed fiscal stimulus packages. Consequently, insiders are scooping up the shares of Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK) because the companies are likely to grow in tandem with the economy. While rising oil prices should drive ET, PATK is expected to benefit from increasing manufacturing and industrial activities.
Owning shares of the company for which they work is considered a strong motivation for executives to ensure the company performs to the best of its ability. Similarly, an increase in insider buying is perceived as positive for a stock ideally because managers and top executives have intimate details of a company’s operations, business expansion and order flows that could be unknown to analysts and investors. So, substantial insider buying at a company could be an indication of its solid growth potential.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 04:22PM ET</span>","Analysis: With AMC shares sky-high, 'gamma squeeze' less of a driving force","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The meteoric rise in shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc may have diminished an important options market force that helped fuel its recent gains, analysts said.
Bullish options bets that would profit if AMC’s shares traded in the $40 to $70 range drew a huge influx of buying in recent days, with millions of contracts changing hands as the movie theater chain’s stock price rose by as much as 178% this week.
As AMC’s share price climbed, some of the market makers on the other side of the trade - typically large banks or financial institutions - were forced to buy AMC stock to hedge their risk. Leaving options unhedged would have exposed them to potentially severe losses as the stock climbed.
That buying helped push the share even higher in what is known as a gamma squeeze, analysts said. This options-related buying pressure had also been at play earlier this year when a combination of a short-squeeze and massive options trading had sent several so-called meme stocks soaring, most notably GameStop (NYSE:GME).
Now that many of those market makers have already hedged their exposure, that buying force is largely spent until new positions are opened, analysts said.
""The gamma picture is different because the share price is much higher than the strikes where most of the gamma exists,"" said Jay Wolberg, founder of Trading Volatility, a data and analytics provider focused on financial derivatives.
Most AMC options contracts are clustered around the $20 to $40 level with open contracts thinning out above the $60 level. AMC was trading above $60 on Thursday.
In fact, Thursday's brief retreat in AMC's shares - when the stock fell as much as 40% on news of a second share issue in three days - may have been exacerbated by the very options dynamic that helped drive it higher earlier.

""Gamma can and does work in both directions,"" said Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
To be sure, with millions of AMC options traded daily, the gamma picture can quickly change as investors take new positions, Wolberg said.

Investing.com – The Dow cut gains to end roughly unchanged Thursday as investors awaited the jobs report due Friday that could intensify bets on the Fed tapering bond purchases sooner rather later.      
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, or 23 points, but had been 265 points down intraday. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.03%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.3%.
Signs of a recovery in the jobs market continued to take shape as jobless claims and private job gains data came in better than expected ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The Labor Department reported that 385,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 20,000 from the prior week's 405,000 and larger than the 15,000 decline economists had expected.
In a further sign of improvement in the labor market, the economy created 978,000 private jobs in May, well above economists forecast for a 650,000.
The services sector, meanwhile, continued to see a revival as the economy reopens, rising to a record levels.
The pickup in the recovery has stoked expectations the Federal Reserve could start talking about tapering at its next meeting on June 15. 
""A firmer employment report … could tip the scale for Powell to officially kick off the tapering discussion at the FOMC meeting in two weeks' time,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) added.
The slew of positive data pushed economically-sensitive cyclical stocks, particularly in financials and energy, higher. 
Banking stocks were supported by increasing investor bets on a favorable backdrop for banks as the eventual Fed tightening will steepened the yield curve, boosting net interest margin.
Energy stocks were helped by a recovery in oil prices following a larger-than-expected draw in crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.1 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels.
Tech, meanwhile, was a drag on the broader markets as the sector's recent revival appears to running out of steam.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended more than 1% lower.
Chip stocks, which have played a role in the bidding up tech in recent weeks, also faltered, down about 1%.
The Reddit meme mania faded somewhat, paced by an 18% decline in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC). The movie chain company struck an agreement to sell up to 11.6 million shares as it seeks to cash on its recent rally that seen its share price jumped more than 350% in the past month.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) slipped 9%, while BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) ended up 4%.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ryanair may decline to accept delivery of its first Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet until after the summer following a delay in the certification of a version of the jet designed for the airline, a senior executive said on Thursday.
The Irish airline, the largest European customer for the MAX, is still waiting for Boeing to provide a date for the delivery of its first jet, a 197-seat MAX200, and will decide then if it can take it during its busy summer season, the executive said. 
""We need a definitive date as to when we're going to get the airplane and then we've got to decide ... whether that suits us to take them or not because in the normal course of events we don't take aircraft in the summer months,"" said Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the main airline in the Ryanair Group.
Wilson, speaking to Reuters in an interview, said the delay was related to the certification of the MAX200 model, which has an extra door to allow more passengers than the standard model, and appeared to hinge on the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.
""The release of that aircraft ... has to do with a fairly straightforward issue. And it's how the interface between Boeing and the FAA is going to work in matters like that and they have to iron that out once and for all,"" Wilson said.
""It's really up to Boeing at Seattle to bed in that relationship with the FAA in dealing with issues of certification and how they have to do things differently. That's what it looks like,"" he said. 
Asked about the comments, a Boeing spokeswoman said: ""We continue to work closely with Ryanair to deliver their first 737-8-200s.” 
Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first MAX two years ago before the jet was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes.

Since then the airline has announced repeated delays, cutting its planned deliveries in time for use in summer 2021 from 40 to 16 to possibly zero.
Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last month said he was upset with Boeing and did ""not necessarily believe"" a promise from the U.S. firm to deliver the first plane before the end of May.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>",New blood at Wall Street's old guard rattles Corporate America,"By Ross Kerber and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - A new generation of executives at the world's biggest asset managers is helping drive an uprising against Corporate America that environmental and social justice activists have long campaigned for. 
The big mutual fund firms, whose stock holdings amount to trillions of dollars, used to be loyal members of the corporate establishment. They cast their votes at shareholder meetings largely as instructed by the management of companies in their portfolios, on issues ranging from CEO pay to carbon emission reporting. They rarely discussed their decisions publicly. 
This year marks a sea change as top funds throw more of their weight behind investor challenges to companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and put companies on notice by often choosing to publicize how and why they voted, a Reuters review of voting results and fund firms' new disclosures shows. 
A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject their executive pay packages as of June 1, according to corporate governance consultant ISS Corporate Solutions. Investors voted down a total of 12 CEO pay plans in the entirety of 2020. About 28% of S&P 500 companies have not yet held their annual meetings this year.
This trend culminated in the three largest index fund firms - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) and Vanguard Group - disclosing last week they had backed a successful board challenge against  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), one of their biggest holdings, over dissatisfaction with its efforts to diversify away from fossil fuels. 
(Graphics: Shareholder proposals gain traction - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FUNDS/COMPANIES-ESG/yzdvxmymrpx/chart.png) 
The mutual fund firms are increasingly relying on ESG-focused funds they manage for a part of their fee revenue. They are also being prodded by their own investors, including state pension funds, to take a more active stance. Some of them seized on calls for social reform following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose death while in Minneapolis police custody unleashed a national reckoning over racial injustice.
Big fund managers ""have gotten the message that this is important to investors,"" said Andrew Collins, who oversees responsible investing for the $31 billion San Francisco Employees' Retirement System, whose fund managers include BlackRock.
NAMING AND SHAMING 
Many of the executives driving the changes are newcomers to the big funds. Sandy Boss, who BlackRock recruited from the Bank of England last year as its new global head of investment stewardship, is pressing companies to do more on issues such as climate change and boardroom diversity. BlackRock has made public its voting decisions on more than 80 companies since 2020, and frequently criticizes corporate governance lapses under Boss. 
BlackRock declined to make Boss available for an interview, but in a statement sent by a company representative Boss said the new disclosures - some of which predate her arrival - are meant ""to help keep our clients informed about the work we do on their behalf to encourage the governance and sustainable business practices that support long-term financial performance."" 
John Galloway, a former White House official who became Boss' counterpart at Vanguard last year, has been naming and shaming companies he considers ESG laggards. Vanguard declined to make him available for an interview, but Galloway has said previously he wants to make Vanguard's views transparent. 
Another new ESG chief, Jessica Ground, joined American Funds parent Capital Group last year after spending 23 years at investment manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc. Capital wrote in February to about 1,600 portfolio companies to push for boardroom diversity and ask for workforce demographic data. ESG issues are ""fundamental to the long-term success of companies we invest in,"" Ground said in an emailed statement sent by a Capital representative.
Caitlin McSherry, who joined Neuberger Berman last year as director of investment stewardship after four years with State Street, said she planned to double to 60 the memos her firm will publish in 2021 on how it voted on corporate ballots, to help boards understand what investors expect of them. She added that 2020 brought many ESG topics such as workplace safety, diversity and supply chain management to the fore. 
James McRitchie, a private investor and prolific filer of shareholder resolutions challenging companies, said the recent push by the big funds to publicize their displeasure with ESG failures at companies has encouraged large and small investment firms to vote alongside them. 
(Graphics: Say-on-Pay rejection rate soars at S&P 500 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FUNDS/COMPANIES-ESG/xegpbrnrgpq/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Among major companies that lost votes this year was railroad operator  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP), whose board was rebuked by 86% of shareholder votes cast that backed a call to disclose diversity information about its workforce. A Union Pacific spokeswoman said it will soon release the workforce details sought by investors.
In another case of pushback, on May 4 a majority of shareholders at industrial conglomerate  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co rejected the compensation of CEO Larry Culp, worth as much as $230 million. Critics included BlackRock and Neuberger Berman, their new disclosures showed. A GE representative said the company would gather additional feedback from investors in evaluating its executive compensation program.
Detailed filings showing how specific fund firms voted in annual shareholder meetings of companies will not be available until August.
VOTES LEAD TO CHANGES To be sure, the big funds remain selective in the battles they pick, and most companies have not yet faced such pressure. 
Yet some investment managers view this as only the start of a scramble on Wall Street for firms to buff up their ESG credentials. ""If you see BlackRock significantly improving its record, and you are Vanguard, you can't lag too far behind,"" said Tim Smith, a director for investment management firm Boston Trust Walden, which often submits shareholder resolutions opposed by management. 
Many of the resolutions backed by big funds that challenge companies are nonbinding. Still, they often lead to companies heeding investor concerns.
About half the companies that received at least 30% of votes in support of environmental and social resolutions responded by making the changes that had been sought, an analysis of 74 investor resolutions from 2017 to 2019 carried out by BlackRock shows. Another quarter of companies partially met the requests associated with the shareholder proposals, according to the asset manager.

Paul Moroz, chief investment officer of Mawer Investment Management, which has $69 billion in assets under management, said growing interest among younger investors in companies' records on climate change or workforce diversity will only up the pressure on fund firms to challenge companies more on ESG matters. 
""Younger investors want to see ESG factors incorporated into their portfolios,"" said Moroz. Top fund firms, he said, ""have to evolve with their client base.""

According to a Research and Markets report, the global oil and gas pipeline market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 6% between 2021-2026.
Investors’ interest in the oil energy stocks is evident in SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF’s (XOP) 17.9% gains over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 0.2% returns.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to scoop up the stocks of lesser-known oil energy companies Ovintiv Inc. (OVV) and Crescent Point Energy Corp. (NYSE:CPG) because they are expected to continue benefiting from rising oil prices.

Investing.com – The Dow cuts losses Thursday as upbeat labor data spurred a rally in cyclicals, with financials and energy stocks rising to offset losses in tech.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, or 18 points, but had been 265 points down intraday. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.61%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.3%.
Signs of a recovery in the jobs market continued to take shape as jobless claims and private job gains data came in better-than-expected ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The Labor Department reported that 385,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 20,000 from the prior week's 405,000 and larger than the 15,000 decline economists had expected.
In a further sign of improvement in the labor market, the economy created 978,000 private jobs in May, well above economists forecast for a 650,000.
The services sector, meanwhile, continued to see a revival as the economy reopens, rising to a record levels.
The pickup in the recovery has stoked expectations the Federal Reserve could start talking about tapering at its next meeting on June 15. 
""With further improvement in the domestic data and rising inflation pressures with the latest read on the PCE over 3%, policy makers are likely to at least begin a discussion of when to begin the discussion of tapering back accommodation, "" Stifel said in a note.
The slew of positive data paved the way for a rise in economically-sensitive cyclical stocks, particularly in financial and energy.
Financials were pushed higher by rising banking stocks as investors bet on a favorable backdrop for stocks, with the inevitable steepening in the yield curve as the Fed tightens policy.
Energy stocks were helped by a recovery in oil prices from session lows following a larger-than-expected draw in crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.1 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels.
Tech, meanwhile, was a drag on the broader markets as the sector's recent revival appears to running out of steam.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red.
Chip stocks, which have played a role in the bidding up tech in recent weeks, also faltered down about 1%.
The Reddit meme mania faded somewhat, paced by a 7% decline in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC). The movie chain company struck an agreement to sell up to 11.6 million shares as it seeks to cash on its recent rally that seen its share price jumped more than 350% in the past month.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) slipped 8%, while BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up 4%.

Investing.com – The dollar jumped Thursday as positive labor market data stoked optimism for a strong monthly jobs report due Friday that will likely lay out the carpet for talks on tapering at the Federal Reserve's meeting later this month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, added  0.70% to 90.53.
""[T]omorrow's payrolls report … could be decisive for the Fed tapering discussion in two weeks time,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.  
The Federal Reserve has previously highlighted ""sustained progress"" as the benchmark to begin curtailing its $120 billion monthly purchases.
Inflation, which forms part of the Fed's dual mandate, is an important cog in the wheel of the Fed monetary policy decision.
The Fed has insisted that it would allow inflation to remain above 2% for some time, and stuck to its bet that inflation will be transitory.
But market participants are nervous the Federal Reserve may find itself behind the curve, potentially rising the risk it may have to rein in policy aggressively to get a grip on rising price pressures.
The latest data on the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core price consumer expenditure index, came in at 3.1% for April, exacerbating investor concerns.
But allowing the economy to run hot is starting to have an impact on businesses, which are faced with a double whammy of headwinds as rising input costs and labor shortages are set to continue for months.
Incoming data including the labor market and services data Thursday, has shown these factors are likely to be sustained.
But the all-important jobs report due Friday will be take the spotlight as the Fed has shifted its priority to the labor market.
""A firmer employment report … could tip the scale for Powell to officially kick off the tapering discussion at the FOMC meeting in two weeks' time,"" Commerzbank added.
""Our economists have brought forward their tapering call to Q4 this year. Together with further strong increases in core inflation through September (taking core CPI above 3.5%),"" it added.
Against the backdrop of increasing bets on the Fed tapering sooner rather than later, U.S. rates have started to catch a bid into the jobs numbers, and could take dollar along for the ride."

642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 02:18PM ET</span>",Active Funds Crushed Equity Benchmarks in May Like Never Before,"(Bloomberg) -- Active managers have finally found a market they can beat. One that doesn’t move.
That’s what happened in May, when the S&P 500 barely budged and a historically large number of stock-picking mutual funds posted returns that beat the benchmark. While doing well in a market that is actually going up might be more exciting for their customers, it’s still a welcome win for an industry pilloried for years after failing to keep up with passive indexes.
Almost 70% of large-cap funds were ahead of their benchmarks, sporting their best May since Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). began tracking the data in 1991. As a result, 62% of them have outperformed the market year-to-date. Meantime, strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said the beat rate of the category is “well above” the long-term average.
The scorecards are likely to spark hopes for a renaissance of active funds after years of money outflows amid the proliferation of passive investing. Still, BofA strategists led by Savita Subramanian have some cautioning words: the current environment for stock picking is “largely mixed.” While stocks increasingly move on their own, creating discernible opportunities, the returns are too similar to strike a big difference.
Using a strategy that buys the biggest winners against biggest losers in the S&P 500 to gauge chances for generating alpha -- or above-market returns -- the strategists found that the return dispersion in the top and bottom quintile sat below the average since the 1980s. That means fewer chances for alpha.
“Correlations remain below the historical average as of May, suggesting a stock picker’s market,” Subramanian wrote in a note to clients. “However, long-short spreads in the S&P 500 sharply fell to the lowest level since February 2020, indicating scarce alpha opportunities.”
One of the reasons active funds outperformed was a bigger pool of winning stocks in the Russell 1000, where 54% outperformed the benchmark in May, compared with 46% in April, according to BofA.
Another reason is that stock pickers pivoted toward stocks trading at a low multiple relative to book value or earnings -- like banks and oil producers, said Goldman Sachs strategists led by Arjun Menon and David Kostin. Meantime, those funds stayed away from tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). that’s known as the FAAMG, a group that underperformed.
On average, mutual funds have been underweight the FAAMG group since 2016 and currently have near record low levels of exposure, Goldman data show. The stance cost them dearly last year, when internet and software stocks were all the rage during the pandemic. Now as the economy bounces back, companies seen more sensitive to the recovery are taking over the leadership.
The FAAMG cohort saw their combined market value falling 3% last month, while indexes tracking commodity and financial shares each advanced more than 4%.
“A record high allocation to value as well as overweight allocations to energy, financials, materials and industrials have been tailwinds to performance,” Menon and Kostin wrote in a note last month. “The persistent FAAMG underweight turned from a performance headwind in 2020 to a tailwind.”

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app.
Details of the feature were first uncovered last month by software engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who is well-known in the tech industry for reverse engineering apps and discovering new features before they are officially launched.
Twitter Blue is the social media company's first subscription offering, and a significant move as it works to gain a new consistent source of revenue and expand beyond its core business of selling advertising on the platform.
Avid Twitter users, who for years have demanded an ""edit"" button to fix typos in their tweets, will now be able to set a timer of up to 30 seconds, giving them a window to click an ""undo"" button and edit tweets before they are posted. 
The new feature will also let users organize their saved tweets into bookmark folders, so they can easily find content later.
Long threads of multiple tweets will be easier to read through a new ""reader mode"" on the service, Twitter said.
Twitter Blue will cost C$3.49 ($2.90) or A$4.49 ($3.48) per month in Canada and Australia respectively. 
The service will cost $2.99 per month in the United States according to app details in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store. 
The company did not provide details on when Twitter Blue would be available to U.S. users.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Thursday confirmed it will introduce a compact pickup truck called Maverick next week, augmenting its entry-level vehicle offerings more than three years after it said it would largely abandon the U.S. sedan market.
While Ford said it will provide more details about the truck on June 8, executives have talked about the ""white-space"" vehicle that will move the U.S. automaker into a new segment, and people familiar with the plans said the Maverick's starting price will be below $20,000.
The four-door small pickup will be built, starting in July, at the company's Hermosillo, Mexico, plant with plans to eventually build more than 120,000 annually, according to AutoForecast Solutions. Ford declined to comment on pricing or other details about the vehicle ahead of next week's reveal.
In an industry where the average new vehicle now sells for almost $41,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, and the number of vehicles sold for less than $20,000 is rapidly shrinking, Ford hopes Maverick helps attract buyers turned off by its April 2018 announcement that it would stop selling the Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI), Focus, Taurus and Fusion sedans, the last of which was discontinued last year.
Ford's current entry-level vehicle is the EcoSport SUV, which starts at just under $20,000.
Dealers are excited they will have a low-cost vehicle to draw buyers into the Ford brand.
""When they decided to get rid of the sedans, they made it very, very difficult for us to compete in that entry-level market,"" said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. ""Ford's timing on this thing's perfect. It's going to put us back in the game.""
But Ford is re-entering a different market today. In 2012, 54% of all U.S. new vehicles sold for less than $30,000, but that share slid to 20% last year as consumers shifted to more expensive trucks and SUVs, according to Cox Automotive. As of April, only six car models sold for less than $20,000.
Today's low-cost buyers focus instead on saving money, analysts said.
""Cars have become so reliable, entry-level sales have moved to off-lease and used cars,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""When you have the average transaction price of $40,000, under $30,000 is quote unquote affordable.""
Ford is not alone in eyeing this end of the truck market either, as Hyundai Motor Co will this summer introduce the Santa Cruz compact pickup, which it has dubbed a ""sport adventure vehicle."" 
    ""It's going to take us into an entirely new territory for the Hyundai brand and it's going to attract a new buyer that probably wouldn't have considered purchasing a Hyundai in the first place,"" Hyundai North American sales chief Randy Parker said in an interview.

The Santa Cruz price tag will start around $25,000, he said. AutoForecast Solutions expects Hyundai to build fewer than 35,000 a year at its Alabama plant.
The Maverick also is an example of leveraging existing platforms to save money and speed vehicles to market. It will be built on the same vehicle architecture used for the Bronco Sport, Lincoln Corsair and Ford Escape SUVs, saving the company 68% off the original investment made for the Focus, Ford disclosed last December.

It also includes plans to reduce water consumption so that usage remains constant compared to earlier proposals despite the expansion.
Tesla has sharply criticised the lengthy regulatory processes in Germany and has pushed back the factory's opening date.
The agricultural and environment ministry of the state of Brandenburg had already flagged that Tesla would tweak its application for the construction of its planned factory, located in Gruenheide outside Berlin.
Tesla said in April that its plans were moving forward, with production and deliveries ""on track for late 2021"". But that was later than previous plans for July 1.

Authorities will now decide whether the public needs to weigh in on the new plans given the scope of the changes. A decision on that is expected in days, the ministry said.

However, does the company’s stock have room for further gains? Let’s find out.Headquartered in Montreal, Canada, Resolute Forest Products Inc.

(Reuters) - Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling's stealth energy investment venture has launched, two people familiar with the matter said this week, staffed with former McKinsey & Co. consultants like himself and offering a technology edge to oil and gas returns. 
Skilling was convicted of securities fraud and insider trading in connection with manipulating financial reports ahead of the 2001 collapse of Enron. He served more than 12 years in prison and was released in 2019. 
His venture, Veld LLC, was set up as a digital marketplace to sell packages of oil and gas production to investors, sources have said. The business has analytical software that investors can use to evaluate packages for their potential returns, the people said. 
The company in April filed for a U.S. trademark for its software and business operation under the name Veld Applied Analytics and last year submitted an trademark application for a business named Shalemetrics. The former facilitates ""asset backed securitizations for oil and gas producers,"" according to a post by Ron Hulme, who joined the firm this year as chairman. 
Hulme, who spent more than 26 years at McKinsey and became its global practice leader for oil and gas, is a senior executive at Houston-based energy investors Parallel Resource Partners and Bluescape Energy Partners in addition to his role at Veld Applied Analytics.
Taek Chung is a managing director for Veld Applied Analytics, according to patent office filings. He has a Ph.D in electrical engineering from Stanford University and also worked at McKinsey, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Chung's LinkedIn profile describes his current status as at a Houston, Texas-based ""Stealth Startup."" 
Skilling, Hulme and Chung did not respond to requests for comments. 
In fundraising meetings last year, Skilling told potential investors he had secured significant financial commitments for the project, a source familiar with the matter said, estimating he had raised tens of millions of dollars at the time. 
Skilling was a long-time McKinsey consultant who helped Enron build its natural gas marketing and finance operation, and later became its chief executive. He turned an energy pipeline company into one of the 10 largest U.S. companies before questionable accounting and related-party trading practices led to its bankruptcy. 
Enron's tainted history and Skilling's role in its financial demise should not have a significant impact on Veld's ability to attract business, said Ed Hirs, an Energy Fellow and lecturer at the University of Houston. The bankruptcy caught many investors by surprise. The company claimed to have $100 billion in revenue the year before it collapsed.

""I don't see it as a positive or negative,"" Hirs said, referring to Skilling's reputation. ""To succeed, they have to compete with the established firms in the business.""
Veld's website is up and running and soliciting email addresses for those interested in receiving newsletters. The site describes Veld as an ""energy software"" company.

Goldman's investment bank produced $3.8 billion in revenue in the first quarter this year, up 73% from the year-ago quarter.
Waldron said the bank expects further acceleration in dealmaking activity to come from companies because executives are feeling better about the economy.
""We are seeing rising CEO confidence. CEO confidence is an extremely important factor... (in being) more offensive in M&A,"" Waldron said.

Waldron, who is also Goldman's chief operating officer, stopped short of saying that his own company would jump in on the activity. He highlighted two recent acquisitions the bank completed -of United Capital in 2019 and Folio Financial in 2020 - saying they are typical of the ""bolt-on"" deals investors should expect.
""We always evaluate buy versus build,"" Waldron said. ""But anything that gets larger than what you and I would think of as a bolt-on is hard to integrate, and the bar goes up financially and from a culture standpoint.""

One of the most popular travel destinations in the world, Italy is easing travel curbs and restrictions on the hospitality sector to help the country recover from the pandemic. 

Under an agreement with the Italian Touring Club, Facebook will offer firms located in some 252 rural villages online courses and other digital tools to improve the visibility of businesses such as bed and breakfasts and craft products shops on online platforms. 
Italy, which derives some 13% of its economic output from tourism, suffered a 64% fall in tourist numbers in the first nine month of 2020, according to latest data by national statistics agency Istat.

Buy These 3 ETFs Now,"The ongoing economic recovery is driving a rise in commodity prices due to increasing demand from reopening industrial and construction sectors. So, for investors looking to capitalize on rising commodity prices in a relatively less risky manner, the ticket could be investment in popular commodity ETFs Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), and Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA). Let’s discuss.Most economic activities came to a near halt last year due to COVID-19 pandemic-led restrictions and social distancing measures. With the global economy’s gradual recovery, commodity prices are surging this year, due primarily to rising demand from reopening industrial and construction sectors. Supply disruptions are also pushing up commodity prices.
President Biden’s proposed ‘Build Back Better’ infrastructure plan, if adopted, is expected to further boost demand for commodities. While it may be risky to bet on a particular commodity or stock to benefit from rising commodity prices, a less risky way could be to bet on commodity ETFs.
We think the Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), and Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA) are all well-positioned to generate significant returns in the coming quarters. So, it could be worth adding these ETFs to one's portfolio now.

These companies are well positioned to witness a surge in orders in the near term.The uniform industry was hit hard by the pandemic last year because of the stringent regulations that lead to the closure of manufacturing plants, retail shops, supply chains, and various sectors that demand work wear. In fact, many uniform manufacturers switched to producing medical scrubs, PPE kits, and warm-up jackets for healthcare employees, which, in turn, kept their businesses running.
But now, as more than 50% of adults are fully vaccinated in the United States, offices and factories are reopening and employees are returning to work. This is leading to rising demand for uniforms.
As more employees return to physical workspace, the demand for work wear is expected to soar. Moreover, the rising interest of consumers for customized clothing is driving the uniform market further. Against this backdrop, uniform stocks like Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) and UniFirst Corporation (UNF), with strong financials, are expected to soar in the coming months.

ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Airbus faces ""industrial repercussions"" if it fails to resolve a dispute that has driven a wedge between the European planemaker and major customer Qatar Airways, the airline's chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.
Raising the stakes of a dispute potentially affecting airplane deliveries, which became public, Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker urged the Airbus board to intervene directly.
""(Airbus) need to get real and they need to know that this problem will create industrial repercussions for them,"" Al Baker told Reuters in an interview. 
""The ball is in their court to fix the problem we have with them, and it is up to them to resolve this as soon as possible before things can get a bit out of hand,"" Al Baker added.
He declined to give specifics, but denied a Reuters report that the dispute concerned A350 paintwork.
""I think now is a time for the Airbus board to get involved and look at what is going on,"" Al Baker said.
An Airbus spokesman said the planemaker regularly held talks with its customers and that these remained confidential.
Al Baker was speaking on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, chaired by President Vladimir Putin, where a large Qatari delegation is present this year.
The Gulf airline official is among the most influential and outspoken in the aviation industry and has periodically lashed out at Airbus or Boeing (NYSE:BA) for delays or quality lapses.
The airline says its exacting standards reflect its premium brand, though aerospace executives have accused it of seizing on such details in the past to delay taking deliveries or gain leverage in other negotiations, a suggestion it has denied.
Earlier this week, industry sources told Reuters Qatar Airways and Airbus had clashed over A350 paintwork.
A separate source later said Qatar Airways had complained that paint was peeling off the carbon-fibre A350, Airbus' state-of-the-art wide-body jet of which Qatar is the biggest customer.
Another cited the technical quality of fresh livery painted on to existing Qatar Airways A350s ahead of the 2022 World Cup.
""This is not a paint issue,"" Al Baker said on Thursday.

As of the end of April, Qatar Airways had 73 planes on order from Airbus that had yet to be delivered, including 23 A350s.
On Monday, Al Baker was quoted by Bloomberg as saying Qatar Airways would refuse to take new aircraft from Airbus unless the dispute was resolved.

Investing – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) shares rose more than 1% Thursday after a report by TechCrunch that the company has introduced a paid premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, in Canada and Australia.
The monthly subscription will cost C$3 ($2.49) and A$4.49 ($3.45), respectively.
The subscription will allow Twitter users to access premium features, including tools to organize bookmarks, read threads in a clutter-free format and take advantage of an undo tweet feature — which is the closest thing Twitter will have to the long-requested edit button, TechCrunch said.
The company behind the micro blogging site said the initial launch of Twitter Blue will help it determine whether its existing feature set will meet the needs of those who are looking for more customization over their Twitter experience, as well as to encourage discussion around other features that the social media platform should prioritize for future iterations of the premium service.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - For the Khoi and San - South Africa's first inhabitants - a verdant patch of land in Cape Town embodies victory and tragedy.
The two communities drove back cattle-raiding Portuguese soldiers there in 1510. But, a century and a half later, it was where Dutch settlers launched a campaign of land dispossession.
Today it is again the scene of another conflict, this time over a development where construction is due to begin this month and which will eventually be home to a new 70,000-square metre Africa headquarters for U.S. retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""This is where land was first stolen,"" said Tauriq Jenkins, of the Goringhaicona Khoena Council, a Khoi traditional group opposed to the project. ""We want a World Heritage Site. We do not want 150,000 tonnes of concrete.""
The 15-hectare riverside area was previously home to a golf driving range and popular bar - a small blue plaque the only indication of its historical significance.
It is now earmarked for a 4 billion rand ($284 million) mixed-use development complete with a hotel, retail offices and residential units.
Amazon, which already employs thousands of people in Cape Town in a global call centre and data hubs, is lined up as its anchor tenant, with no other big names yet disclosed by city bosses or developers. 
While some groups have welcomed the prospect of new jobs, the whole project, not Amazon's specific plans, has faced a backlash from other community leaders as well as environmentalists and activists. They have held marches at the site and are now threatening to take the matter to court.
According to the Observatory Civic Association, which represents a nearby residential community, close to 50,000 objections to the development have been lodged so far with city and provincial authorities.
They want the development stopped and the area declared a provincial or national heritage site; environmentalists say it is important to preserve because it is an ecologically sensitive area at the confluence of two rivers.
Amazon in South Africa and the United States declined to comment on the dispute and referred queries to the developer, South Africa's Zenprop. It in turn directed the queries to Liesbeek Leisure Properties Trust (LLTP), the structure set up to develop this specific project.
""There is no groundswell of unhappiness,"" said LLTP's Jody Aufrichtig, emphasising that the development went through an extensive public approval procedure.
""The handful of vocal objectors who remain, who were given fair opportunity to participate, simply do not like the outcome."" 
BALANCING JOBS AND HERITAGE
Land, its history and its ownership are fraught issues in South Africa, where memories of forced removals and segregation remain fresh nearly three decades after the end of apartheid.
Such sensitivities were taken account when considering the project, Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato said in a statement, announcing his approval of the development. 
""We are acutely aware of the need to balance investment and job creation, along with heritage and planning considerations,"" he said, touting the development as a much-needed boost for Cape Town's tourism-dependent, pandemic-crippled economy.
The project will create thousands of new jobs, LLTP say, while also paying tribute to Khoi and San culture and history. 
Designs include an indigenous garden and a heritage centre where LLTP's Aufrichtig said Khoi and San descendents will work as operators and educators.
Such efforts have succeeded in winning over some Khoi and San, including a group calling itself the First Nations Collective, which engaged directly with the developers.
""We chose cultural agency rather than the evil of government deadlock to achieve the objective of creating a liberated zone for our people,"" said Zenzile Khoisan, spokesman for the Collective.
Mayor Plato gave the project a green light in April after a two-year provisional heritage protection order instated to allow time to examine opposition to the project lapsed last year. And Aufrichtig said development is now due to begin mid-June.
But opponents, like Martinus Fredericks, paramount chief of the !Aman (Nama) Traditional Council, said they are not ready to give up. They still hope to force a review or block of the planning permission via the courts.

""We will approach the courts,"" he said. ""We will mobilise every single Khoi and San person in the country to stop that development.""

ANAHEIM, Calif. (Reuters) -Spider-Man will fly high above Disneyland Resort's new Avengers Campus in California when it starts welcoming the public on Friday, tumbling through the air as guests below meet Iron Man, Black Panther and other Marvel superheroes.
The six-acre (2.43 hectares) Avengers Campus at  Disney  California Adventure Park in Anaheim is the Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co's latest redesign of its popular theme parks, which were closed for extended periods during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Highlights include an aerial Spider-Man robot that performs somersaults while flying 60 feet (18.3 m) in the air. A human dressed as Spider-Man will greet visitors at ground level.
Guests also can ride a Spider-Man attraction called Web Slingers, where they team with the character to battle out-of-control Spider-Bots. Physical sets and virtual environments will blend to make visitors feel like they are slinging their own webs, designers said.
Fan favorites from Disney's blockbuster Marvel movies, from Black Widow to Captain America and Ant-Man, also will roam the area and interact with guests. 
""It's the first time we are celebrating all of these heroes and bringing them together in one place,"" said John Mauro, portfolio executive producer at Walt Disney Imagineering.
Food options include a cart offering shawarma, a nod to a scene at the end of the 2012 ""Avengers"" movie when various superheroes ate the Middle Eastern dish together after saving the world. 

The Disneyland Resort, which includes the original Disneyland and adjacent California Adventure, re-opened to the public on April 30 after being closed for more than a year due to the pandemic. The Avengers campus had originally been set to open in July 2020. It was built in an area that previously celebrated the animated movie ""A Bug's Life.""
As part of ongoing safety measures, Disneyland is accepting guests only from California until June 15, when it will start allowing visitors from other states. Guests are currently required to wear face masks.

(Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian predicted on Thursday a boom in business travel in September as corporate America emerges from the coronavirus pandemic and businesses reopen, with leisure travel already fully restored.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also pointed to continued strength in leisure bookings on Thursday and said it was starting to see increased demand among small and medium sized enterprises and certain large corporate customers.
But investor concerns about higher fuel costs and disappointing second quarter revenue guidance from both airlines sent U.S. airline shares sharply lower in morning trade. (DJUSAR)
The market has mostly priced in the idea of a U.S. domestic leisure recovery and is now weighing the impact on airlines' bottom lines after heavy losses in 2020.
""Shares are either back to pre-pandemic levels or close to, and earnings aren't expected to return to those levels for at least another 18 months to two years,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said.
One point of uncertainty continues to be the timing and strength of a recovery in business and international travel.
Speaking at a virtual Bernstein conference, Delta's Bastian said: ""I think there's going to be a renaissance of business travel in our country, not just for the airlines, I think in general.""
He cited a strong desire for people ""to get back out on the road and reconnect like never before,"" something he said ""technology can't possibly replicate.""
But that does not mean that overall volume will be 20% to 30% lower from 2019, he said, as different types of business travel emerge.
Airlines have said, for example, that as more people work from remote places, they may make trips to the corporate offices once or twice a month. 
""I think the lines actually will hold in just fine with where we were in 2019,"" Bastian said.
Robert Isom, president of American, said that ""advancements in technology ultimately drive a need for people to be together."" 
American said it had positive adjusted cash flow in May for the first time since the pandemic began but still expects revenues to decline 40% in the second quarter versus 2019.

Delta said it expects a pre-tax profit in the second half of 2021 and forecast a second-quarter pre-tax loss of between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, compared with an earlier expectation of between $1 and $1.5 billion loss.
It expects total adjusted revenue of $6 billion to $6.2 billion in the second quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $6.2 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. housing regulator announced Thursday it was extending until the end of September an ongoing moratorium on evictions at multifamily properties backed by Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
The move from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) applies to any multifamily property owners who have sought forbearance with the enterprises due to financial hardship. Under the extension, which is now in effect until Sept. 30, those property owners cannot evict tenants for not paying rent, or charge late fees for unpaid rent.
The relief marks the third time the FHFA has extended such a moratorium in an effort to provide relief to struggling property owners and renters amid the coronavirus pandemic. The current moratorium had been set to expire at the end of June prior to the extension.

The additional relief comes as a broader legal fight about government efforts to curb evictions plays out. On Wednesday, a federal appeals court refused to lift a separate nationwide moratorium on residential evictions established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The three-judge panel said it would not lift a stay of a lower court ruling that had found the eviction ban unlawful. That moratorium is set to expire on June 30.

That last part is a warning the movie chain and its lawyers made in a regulatory filing a day after announcing its intention to sell more than 11 million shares to a market dominated by frenzied retail traders.
While companies commonly use cautionary language when making share offerings, the extent of AMC’s was uncommon. It included an acknowledgment that the stock is at the mercy of the retail mania, with fundamentals playing little role in determining valuation.
“We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,” AMC said in its filing Thursday. “Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.”
The movie-theater chain revealed that it plans to capitalize on the rally by selling up to 11.55 million shares to trim its debt load and finance future acquisitions. The tone in Thursday’s filing is starkly different than the one in its announcement a day earlier, when it said it would offer retail shareholders special perks as a reward for their loyalty.
It’s “very unusual,” said Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC. “But, a statement of the obvious. It’s like saying, ‘Be careful when you go cliff diving because there is this force called gravity, and you might get hurt.’”
Shares of AMC plunged more than 30% as trading kicked off on Thursday, triggering a halt. They’re are still up more than 2,000% since the beginning of the year. This would be the company’s fourth stock sale of 2021. It sold shares this week to Mudrick Capital, which flipped them on the same day for a profit.
“When a company files to sell more than 11 million shares of stock, you wouldn’t expect to see the above statement connected to the offering,” Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note.
At its recent share price of around $60, AMC could raise $693 million as part of its offering, Hickey said. For perspective, AMC’s total market value at the start of 2021 was around $434 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bristol Myers Squibb Co was sued for $6.4 billion on Thursday for allegedly delaying its Breyanzi cancer drug to avoid payments to shareholders of the former  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), which the drugmaker bought in 2019.
According to a complaint in Manhattan federal court, Bristol Myers failed to use contractually required ""diligent efforts"" to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug by a Dec. 31, 2020, deadline.
By missing the deadline, Bristol Myers was excused from owing an additional $9 in cash to Celgene shareholders for each share they held, enabling it to acquire Celgene at an ""enormous discount"" and enjoy a ""windfall,"" the complaint said.
Bristol Myers bought Celgene for $80.3 billion in cash and stock in November 2019. It won FDA approval for Breyanzi, whose chemical name is lisocabtagene maraleucel, on Feb. 5.
The lawsuit was brought by UMB Bank NA, acting as a trustee for Celgene's former shareholders.
""We will not be commenting on pending litigation,"" Bristol Myers said in a statement. 
The $9 per share ""milestone"" payment had been contingent on New York-based Bristol Myers winning FDA approval by specified deadlines for three drugs that Celgene had been developing.
UMB said Bristol Myers withheld or belatedly submitted critical information to the FDA for Breyanzi's approval, and did not prepare its manufacturing plants for required inspections.
""Other cellular therapies based on similar technology have received FDA approval without the issues and ineptitude that plagued Bristol Myers, and in substantially less time,"" UMB said.
A lawyer for the Kansas City, Missouri-based bank declined additional comment.

Bristol Myers won FDA approval for the two other Celgene drugs, Zeposia for multiple sclerosis and Abecma to treat multiple myeloma, by the specified deadlines.
The case is UMB Bank NA v Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-04897.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 11:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Private equity bet on troubled Caribbean refinery blows up on retirement funds,"By Laura Sanicola and Tim McLaughlin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Arclight Capital Partners LLC, which invests the retirement savings of Maine teachers, NFL football players and Mayo Clinic doctors, lost hundreds of millions of dollars betting on a troubled Caribbean oil refinery, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters.
Boston-based Arclight’s Energy Partners Fund VI, which held a majority stake in the Limetree Bay refinery on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, shed more than a quarter of its value in the year ended March 31, according to financial disclosures by a limited partner in the fund. 
The fund has since removed the refinery from its portfolio, while investors holding hundreds of millions of dollars of common and preferred equity in the facility have been forced to write it off as worthless, according to pension fund officials and financial disclosures. 
Arclight declined to comment on the performance of the investment. Arclight had been winding down its ownership in the refinery since last year and sold its remaining stake in April, a source familiar with the matter said.
Arclight added the refinery to its Energy Partners Fund VI portfolio after purchasing it out of bankruptcy in 2016 for $190 million, hoping to renovate and restart it, along with other investors. But the refinery, mothballed since 2012, never ran smoothly.
Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the plant shut for at least 60 days after the refinery sprayed nearby neighborhoods with a petroleum mist.
The ownership company Arclight formed to oversee the refinery, Limetree Bay Ventures LLC, is now being dissolved, according to pension fund executives and documents viewed by Reuters. Contractors hired to help restart the refinery also claim they are still owed millions of dollars for their work, according to liens filed with the U.S. Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds.
Linda Woods, 69, a retired English teacher in Maine, said she never liked the idea of her retirement dollars funding investments in fossil fuels. 
But she said she hopes the problems at Limetree Bay will encourage the state legislature to limit oil and gas investments by the pension plan in the future. “This could be a watershed moment,” Woods said.
Earlier this year, New York City pension funds voted to divest their portfolios of some $4 billion worth of fossil fuel investments while other plans face pressure to take similar steps.
RETIREMENT SAVINGS HIT
Arclight closed a $5.6 billion capital campaign for the Energy Partners Fund VI in 2015, winning commitments from several pensions for investments in the private energy infrastructure sector that were not named at the time.
Top commitments included $200 million from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio; $150 million from the Maine Public Employee Retirement System and $100 million from the Lancashire County Pension Fund in England. 
Smaller investors included a pension fund run for Mayo Clinic employees and the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Retirement Plan, financial disclosures show.
Ultimately, the fund ended up with investments that included Limetree Bay, as well as a major coal plant in Ohio and gas pipelines.
Heavy losses hit the fund last year when the Limetree refinery encountered operational problems. Other assets were also hit by slumping energy demand from the pandemic.
In the first quarter of 2020, the overall Arclight VI portfolio tumbled by $1.2 billion. That included a $246 million, or 93%, drop in Limetree Bay’s value, according to disclosures by the state of Connecticut retirement system, which invested $85 million in the fund.
The overall fund declined 26% during the 12-month period that ended March 31, according to financial disclosures by the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System, which invested $40 million.
The Lancashire fund, meanwhile, said investments in a fossil fuel-focused fund might not pass muster today: ""Our investment strategy has evolved since this investment was made, and it would be less likely to meet our current criteria for responsible investment practices.”
Sandy Matheson, executive director of the Maine pension plan, described the developments at Limetree Bay as a “terrible situation.”
The Mayo clinic and the NFL pension plan declined to comment.
Debt holders have also taken a beating. After buying the plant, the Arclight-led ownership recapitalized the facility in 2018 with $1.2 billion in preferred equity and leveraged loan financing.
FS Energy & Power Fund, a business development company managed by EIG Global Energy Partners and FS Investments, disclosed in an investor presentation last month that interest payments on the refinery's debt have not been made in more than 90 days. The fund's refinery-backed debt was valued at $151 million after markdowns of more than 50% from the original principal.

Common and preferred equity stakes in the refinery project, meanwhile, no longer hold any value, according to U.S. regulatory filings by the fund.
EIG declined to comment.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who has made green energy a central plank of Greece's post-pandemic recovery drive, attended the delivery ceremony along with Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess.
""Astypalea will be a test bed for the green transition: energy autonomous, and entirely powered by nature,"" Mitsotakis said.
The cars will be used by the police, coastguard and at the local airport, the beginnings of a larger fleet aimed at replacing about 1,500 combustion-engine cars with electric models and reducing vehicles on the island, a popular tourist destination, by a third.
The island's bus service will be replaced with a ride-sharing scheme, 200 electric cars will be available for locals and tourists to rent, while there will be subsidies for the island's 1,300 inhabitants to buy electric vehicles, bikes and chargers.
Some 12 chargers have already been installed across the island and 16 more will follow.
Financial terms of the deal with Volkswagen were not disclosed.
Astypalea, which extends over 100 square kilometres in the Aegean Sea, currently meets its energy demand almost entirely by diesel generators but is expected to replace a big part of that through a solar plant by 2023. 

""Astypalea can become a blue print for a rapid transformation, fostered by the close collaboration of governments and businesses,"" Diess said.
Greece, which has relied on coal for decades, aims to close all but one of its coal-fired plants by 2023, as part of its drive to boost renewables and cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s camera unit, Ring, is planning to make police requests for users' video footage through its neighborhood watch app more transparent, the company said on Thursday, a move that follows criticism that its products facilitate surveillance and profiling.
Public safety agencies such as police and fire departments now must request material from their communities through a new, publicly viewable type of post on the Neighbors app, Ring said in a blog. 
Previously, Ring device owners would receive private messages from the app on behalf of police looking for videos.
Ring is a smart security device company whose video doorbell product allows users to see and record people who approach their doorsteps, deterring theft and allowing them to monitor around their homes. It was bought by e-commerce giant Amazon in 2018. 
Its devices and its social app, which allows users to share and discuss the surveillance footage captured through their cameras, have been met with concerns from lawmakers and civil rights groups over privacy and racial profiling. 
Ring's partnerships with U.S. law enforcement agencies have drawn particular attention. Hundreds of police and fire departments have joined the Neighbors app, according to Ring's active agency tracker: https:// 
Ring said its new ""Request for Assistance"" feature in the Neighbors app will roll out starting next week. 
It said no information would be shared with agencies without users choosing to do so and that requests can be issued only by verified agency profiles and that request history will be logged online, so users can see how their police force is using the posts.
Social apps focused on neighborhood safety have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months.
Crowdsourced crime-tracking app Citizen was recently blasted for putting a $30,000 reward to find a man it wrongly said was an arson suspect. The company has said it regrets the mistake and is working to improve its internal processes. Citizen has also sparked controversy over what it said were internal tests for a service that would deploy rapid-response security personnel to app users in Los Angeles. 
Hyper-local site Nextdoor, which attracted more users during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been criticized for failing to more quickly address racial profiling and misinformation on the site. The site has said it is adding user prompts and moderator training to mitigate these issues. 

Ring said on Thursday it had rules in place to prevent ""overly broad requests"" from agencies on the Neighbors app, such as needing a valid case number and limiting the time frame and area in a request.
Amazon also recently extended its one-year moratorium on police use of its facial-recognition technology, which it says is not used in Ring products.

It's not surprising that it comes about as inflation concerns are rising. Taylor Dart breaks down some recent developments, and why higher prices are in store.We’ve seen a strong start to Q2 for silver (SLV) market, with the metal easily outperforming the S&P-500 (SPY), as well as the yellow metal. This is a very bullish development given that the strongest periods for precious metals occur when silver is not only outperforming gold but also the S&P-500. In addition, we are now 12 months into a new multi-year breakout for silver, and we are working towards a very similar setup to what we saw in 2005. While history doesn’t repeat itself, it often rhymes, and this would point to silver tripling over the next six years if it were to play out similarly. However, we could have some consolidation left to fill out this pattern based on the past setup. Assuming this plays out, GoGold (GLGDF) could have significantly more upside, which is why I added to my position again recently. Let’s take a closer look below:

The chart above shows the silver price between 1980 to 2010, with the period beginning with a parabolic top in silver, a 10-year bear market, and a 12+ year consolidation period. Once silver finally broke out of this consolidation period, the metal suffered three pullbacks, with each being less violent (~35%, ~23%, and ~8%) while the metal built a 21-month base. This basing period allowed silver’s monthly moving average to play catch-up, with the final pullback landing right on this key moving average. From this breakout from the base-on-base pattern, silver soared more than 400% in less than seven years, finishing its bull market in a parabolic fashion near $50.00/oz.

For instance, in the healthcare sector, the need to adopt less invasive and more precise ways to treat patients is expected to further heighten the sector’s demand for robotic technologies. As such, we think the recent price dip in robotics stocks Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Boston Scientific (BSX), and Integra LifeSciences (IART) provides a perfect opportunity to bet on them because they have the potential to generate significant returns in the near term. So, let’s pore over these names.According to a McKinsey Global Institute report, by 2030, one-third of American jobs could become automated because a technology-driven world will continue to substitute human work activities with robots and AI (artificial intelligence)-powered technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unexpected innovations in automation, with the rapid deployment of robotic technology in the healthcare system. Because the healthcare sector plans to be ready if/when the next pandemic hits, its demand for robot-assisted healthcare technologies should accelerate. 
The global healthcare robotics market is expected to grow at a 21.5% CAGR over the next five years to hit approximately $11 billion by 2026. Many hospitals worldwide are currently using robots to support both staff and patients. The growing need for automation and rapid technological advancements to cure patients should further drive the industry’s growth.
Against this backdrop, we think one should consider buying the dip in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG), Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), and Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART). These robotics companies are well positioned to see sustained demand for their products.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said Thursday it could face up to $1.3 billion in penalties in a long-running dispute over import duties paid on Ford Transit Connect vehicles.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said after the Supreme Court declined to hear its appeal in 2020 that it paid increased duties for some prior imports, plus interest. U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is now seeking additional duties of $181 million and is considering seeking a monetary penalty of ""as much as $652 million to $1.3 billion,"" Ford said. The automaker added that it would vigorously defend its actions and noted any penalty ""would be based on our level of culpability as determined by the courts."" 
CBP ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans were subject to the 25% duty applicable to cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% passenger vehicle duty.
The vans were assembled in Turkey.
The Justice Department said Ford ""designed, marketed, sold, and delivered the van to consumers exclusively as a two-person cargo van. But to avoid the higher rate of duty that applies to cargo vans as compared to vans principally designed for passenger transport, petitioner imported each Transit Connect ... with a temporary, cheap rear seat that was designed to be immediately removed as soon as the van cleared"" Customs.
The government noted the seats lacked head restraints and ""was upholstered with cost-reduced fabric that did not match that of the front seats."" 

Ford argued the rear passenger seat met all federal safety standards, had seat belts for every seating position, and anchors for the rear seats and seat belts and were ""street-legal passenger vehicles.""
The 25% tariff stems from a 1960s trade war involving frozen chicken, and the larger tariff on cargo vehicles is known as the ""chicken tax.""

Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), one of China's busiest container ports with an annual handling volume of more than 13 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), has imposed stringent disinfection and quarantine measures since May 21 when the virus was discovered among port staff.
More than 40 container ships were anchored in open water outside the terminal, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed on Thursday. 
Top international container lines said they would be skipping some port calls to Yantian to ease the pressure, while shipping sources added that some vessels may be re-routed to other destinations.
“The overall operation productivity at YICT has been adversely impacted, and we expect the current vessel berthing delays and port congestion situation will likely continue for at least a week,” the world’s no. 2 line MSC said in a customer advisory on Wednesday.
Yantian port did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Global container shipping rates have climbed to record highs in recent months due to bottlenecks caused by a surge in demand for consumer goods. 
Even before the disruption at Yantian, global supply chains were struggling to clear container backlogs, a knock-on effect from the week-long blockage of a major trade route through the Suez Canal in March. 
Container freight rates from China to Europe [FREIGHTOS-CN-EU] touched a record high of $10,627 (per 40-foot container unit) this week. 
Yantian port in late May temporarily suspended the acceptance of export laden container ships, leading to a heavy backlog in the container yard and congestion outside the port. 
By the time Yantian partly resumed processing on Monday, more than 23,000 containers were waiting to be exported. 
The world's leading container line Maersk warned in a letter on Thursday that it expects congestion and delays to last at least 14 days, longer than its expectation of 12 days communicated earlier on Thursday.
Maersk estimated operations in the eastern area of the Yantian terminal, where larger vessels mainly berth, would remain at around 30% of their normal level. 
Other major shipping firms including COSCO Shipping, Hapag-Lloyd and ONE also alerted their customers to the growing delays and congestion and the possibility of not calling at Yantian.
""The local government is paying great attention to the disinfection measures at Yantian, as right now is the busiest season for exports and Yantian is one of the biggest transportation hubs for European and American lines,"" said a person close to Yantian port, who is not authorised to talk to media.
Shipping companies and Chinese authorities have advised vessels to divert to nearby ports, including Shenzen's west port and Guangzhou's Nansha port, which are operating normally despite sporadic cases of the coronavirus in the region.

""There are not as many (virus) cases in Yantian as the nearby cities. But more rounds of nucleic acid testing will need to be done. Thus it will take some time until the port resumes full operations,"" said the person close to the port.
Recently expanded YICT has become a critical gateway into China with around 100 vessels calling weekly, 60% of which operate on European and U.S. routes, according to a recent note from the regional Shenzen government.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose more than 6% Thursday after saying it expects its first-half results will be significantly better than prior guidance and it is optimistic about the full year.
For the six months ending June 30, the company had guided for net income of around $3.5 billion.
For fiscal 2021, net income is seen coming between $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion, while diluted adjusted earnings per share is forecast at $4.50 to $5.25, as per the May 5 forecast.
The company reiterated its commitment made in May to return full-size pickup production to its Oshawa assembly plant in Canada by December.
“The new accelerated timeline and incremental volume are expected to make an impact in 2022, as production ramps up,” it said in a note.
The company’s optimism is a result of its efforts to prioritize semiconductor usage, its success engineering solutions that maximize the utilization of chips as well as the pull-ahead of some projected semiconductor deliveries into the second quarter.
GM is among the several carmakers affected by the shortage of semiconductors, which have seen a surge in demand during the pandemic since they also go into mobile devices, laptops and other consumer products.
Production at certain manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia and South America will continue to be affected by the global semiconductor shortage through June and July, the company said.
Phil Kienle, GM's vice president for North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations, said customer demand continues to be very strong.

(Reuters) -Experian, the world's largest credit data firm, faces a potential impact on up to 40% of its revenue if the Biden administration overhauls credit reporting and scoring in the United States, brokerage RBC said on Thursday.
A proposal to create a public credit reporting agency to help increase access to traditional loans for low-income groups would put it in competition with the three credit reporting firms - Experian (OTC:EXPGF) and its U.S. rivals Equifax (NYSE:EFX) and  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU).
The new agency could include more factors like rent and utility payments into lending decisions, Reuters has reported. However, the consumer data industry has opposed the move, saying they provide fair and affordable credit to all. 
""(Experian) is at longer-term risk of significant financial disruption from interventions designed to tackle economic inequality in the U.S. via changes to credit scoring and data regulation,"" RBC analysts Karl Green and Andrew Brooke said in a client note. 
Businesses representing up to 40% of Experian's overall revenue and even higher proportion of earnings could be vulnerable to impact from the proposal, they said. 
RBC, which cut its rating on Experian's shares to ""underperform"" from ""sector perform"", said the market had not factored in these risks to the stock price. Shares fell 2.4% to 26.7 pounds by 1324 GMT.
A spokesperson for Experian said the company has always operated in a highly regulated environment. ""We continually work closely with U.S. Federal and State administrations and our regulators.""

Investing.com --  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO) snagged an upgrade from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), with significant growth expected.
Shares of the videogame maker were little changed. 
Analyst Andrew Uerkwitz upgraded the stock to buy from hold, and raised the price target to $231 from $185, StreetInsider reported.
There is “an abundance of opportunity to significantly grow net bookings and earnings” in the coming years with the company planning to launch dozens of titles in the coming years, Uerkwitz wrote in a note.
Shares of Take-Two hit a record last year as video games became must-haves in the pandemic, though they have slipped about 15% since then. The company has beaten estimates for profit and sales for each of the last five quarters.
Street estimates for coming years look “very conservative,” the analyst said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Merck (NYSE:MRK) shares rose 1% Thursday ahead of the day’s listing of Organon (NYSE:OGN_w), its spun-off business that has a broad portfolio of medicines and products.
The spinoff is expected to net Merck incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over three years, with approximately $500 million realized during 2021. In connection with the spinoff, Merck received approximately $9 billion of Organon.
The announcement of the spin-off is one of the several positive developments that have happened at the German company this month.
The completion of the spin-off follows three announcements on Tuesday, only one of which was made by Merck.
The first was the launch of VAXELIS, the only hexavalent (six-in-one) combination vaccine in the U.S. indicated for active immunization to help prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, and invasive disease due to haemophilus influenzae type b.
VAXELIS is approved for use as a 3-dose series in children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (prior to the 5th birthday).
The novel vaccine has been developed as part of a U.S.-based partnership between Merck and  Sanofi  Pasteur (NASDAQ:SNY).
In Tuesday’s second announcement, biotechnology company Immutep (NASDAQ:IMMP) announced it will collaborate with Merck in the safety trial of an immunotherapy treatment the Sydney, Australia-based company is developing for cancer.
The trial will be done in combination with another immunotherapy that Merck and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) are jointly developing.
Tuesday’s third disclosure involving Merck was California-based  Sutro Biopharma  (NASDAQ:STRO) saying it has received a milestone payment from Merck for patient enrollment to study next-generation cancer and autoimmune therapeutics."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Thursday it would give nearly half its U.S. employees free Samsung (KS:005930) phones by the end of the year so they can use an app the company has developed to manage shifts, clock in and stay in ""constant communication.""
The world's largest retailer, which employs nearly 1.6 million people in the United States, said more than 740,000 workers would receive Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro smartphones, cases and protection plans. Currently, most people share company devices.
Walmart declined to share financial details, but the phone sells at $499.99 on Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd's website. It is common for big companies to strike heavily discounted deals with carriers and device makers when buying corporate phones in bulk.
The retailer, which tested the project earlier this year, said it would not be able to see personal data. It will be able to see work emails, installed work apps, web history on the phone's work-specific browser, device specifications and clock-in locations. 
People will only be able to access work apps while on their shifts, but can use the phones as personal devices, Walmart said. 

The app - called ""Me@Walmart"" - can be used to check schedules up to two weeks in advance, ask for changes and request time off. It has a voice-activated assistant that helps locate products and is also designed to ensure workers can ""instantly connect with one another"" in stores. Using the phones is not mandatory.
""Constant communication is essential for our business. Walkie talkies were one solution, but not every associate has one,"" Walmart executives Drew Holler and Kellie Romack said in a blog post.

701,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Steely Meme-Stock Short Sellers Stare Down $4.5 Billion Loss,"(Bloomberg) -- The capacity of short-sellers to withstand pain is being tested anew by day traders driving up the share prices of meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc.
Paper losses from the bearish wagers on 10 of the most-shorted U.S. shares amounted to $4.5 billion Wednesday, according to Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of analytics provider Ortex. That includes $2.75 billion in unrealized losses for AMC following the stock’s 95% surge, rising to nearly $4 billion after adding in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY).
“How much longer can short sellers hold on?” Hillerberg wrote in an email. “The majority of short-sellers have been happy to sit on significant paper losses in the hope that retail investors will blink first and the losses won’t be realized. This now looks like a flawed strategy.”
Professional speculators may still take issue with that last claim. While hedge funds were forced to retreat in late January under a similar withering assault whipped up on Reddit, this time around they are boosting their bearish wagers. Short positions against single shares climbed for a ninth straight week to reach an almost one-year high relative to overall equity holdings, according to prime-broker data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The steadfastness of hedge funds is evident in AMC shares, where short interest remained elevated even after the stock more than doubled last week. The percentage of shares outstanding sold short edged higher Tuesday to top 20%. As the stock doubled again Wednesday, short interest only slipped below 19%, according to data from S3 Partners.
Shares of AMC erased earlier gains in early trading Thursday after the movie-theater chain said it plans to sell up to 11.55 million of its common stock to repay debt and finance future acquisitions. The stock slipped about 8% as of 8:30 a.m. in New York.
The dynamic contrasts with four months ago, when a rally in meme stocks like GameStop compelled hedge funds to quickly slash their short exposure to the lowest in five years. Goldman Sachs attributes the opposite reaction to the fact that the current carnage has yet to cause widespread pain for the industry.
Consider a basket of the 50 most-shorted stocks tracked by Goldman. While AMC more than tripled this quarter through Tuesday in a blow to short sellers, roughly half of the basket’s members were down. The group was up 1.4% in the span, trailing an advance of 6% for the S&P 500. That means gains for any trade that’s short individual companies and long the broader market.
“This confirms that managers have felt more comfortable utilizing single names to express directional views or adjust exposures, as highly shorted stocks and high retail sentiment names broadly underperformed in the past two months,” analysts at Goldman’s prime-broker unit wrote in a note to clients. Despite a sharp rally in stocks favored by retail money, “shorts on the group only saw modest net covering,” they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is issuing two new recalls to address seat belt issues, it said on Thursday.
One recall covers 5,530 vehicles, comprising 2018-2020 Model 3 and 2019-2021 Model Y cars, because fasteners that secure the front seat shoulder belt to the b-pillar may not be properly attached. The other recall covers 2,166 Model Y vehicles from 2019-2021 because fasteners that secure the left and right second-row seat belt retractors may not be properly attached. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it was not aware of any crashes or injuries relating to the recalls.
Tesla will inspect and, if necessary, replace the fasteners to confirm that they are secured to the correct specification. Tesla added that in ""the unlikely event that damage to the b-pillar hole threads and/or top loop is found during the inspection, Tesla Service will repair the hole threads and/or replace the top loop.""
Tesla said during the assembly process if workers could not achieve the specified torque and angle requirements while securing either front seat fastener then ""a non-conformance was generated that required subsequent manual inspection and repair of the fastener. During this inspection, the fastener may not have been confirmed to be secured to the correct specification.""

Tesla has issued three recalls this week for production issues.
On Wednesday, NHTSA said Tesla was recalling 5,974 U.S. 2019-2021 Model 3 vehicles and 2020-2021 Model Y vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, potentially causing a loss of tire pressure.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",Electric-van startups race for a 'golden ticket' order,"By Nick Carey and Lisa Baertlein
LONDON (Reuters) - The future of a bevy of commercial electric van startups seeking investor capital through blank-check IPOs rests largely in the hands of a small group of big companies, above all UPS, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), DHL and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
With each carrier having tens of thousands of vehicles in its global fleet, an order from a package delivery giant can launch a startup on the road to manufacturing scale and profitability, and serve as a marketing tool to win orders from other big customers.  
""Everyone is looking for their golden ticket,"" said Steven Merkt, president of transportation solutions at sensor, connector and electronic component maker  TE Connectivity  Ltd (NYSE:TEL), which works with all the startups and provides technical feedback on designs. ""If you don't have scale, you're going to get squeezed out pretty quick.""
Desperate to find the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, investors have poured billions of dollars into electric vehicle startups, with mixed results.
But unlike Tesla, which enjoyed a headstart of years over traditional carmakers, commercial electric vehicle startups are racing against time as major manufacturers like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co race to bring products to market or others like Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) beef up their electric offerings. 
Some startups already have their golden ticket. Arrival, which went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), has an order for up to 10,000 vans from UPS. Chanje has a 1,000 van order from FedEx in California, while Rivian has an order to build 100,000 vans for Amazon. 
Others, like Xos, are close. Xos, which is going public via public through a merger with blank-check firm NextGen Acquisition Corp, is testing electric delivery trucks with both UPS and Amazon.
Some, like Canoo Inc have experienced turmoil as they finetune their strategies.
Thore Meurer, European senior fleet director at  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) unit DHL Express, said, ""The window of opportunity is closing."" 
He said DHL has been talking to Britain's Arrival for years and will try out some of its test models. In the U.S. market, DHL has announced it will buy 89 electric vans from Lighting eMotors, which went public via a SPAC merger.
Meurer says DHL Express is also talking to two Asian startups about electric vans for Europe. But the company wants 14,000 electric vans in its European fleet by 2030 and is eager to get going. In April, DHL ordered 100 E-Ducato electric vans from Stellantis, a long-established manufacturer, to deliver packages in Europe.
""If another startup comes to market with a van two years from now, there will be no opportunity left for them,"" Meurer said. ""By then, every big player will have an electric van on the market.""
""CONFIDENCE GAP""
The Arrival electric test van decked out in UPS' distinct brown livery is popular with drivers at the package delivery giant's facility in London's Kentish Town district. During a demonstration of the van by Luke Wake, UPS vice president of maintenance and engineering, several drivers asked: ""When can we drive one?""
The Arrival van is the culmination of many years work by UPS to incorporate electric vehicles into its fleet. The Kentish Town depot is still home to some old former diesel trucks that UPS converted into electric vehicles. 
""We converted hundreds of our pre-existing vehicles to electric to see how they fit in,"" Wake says, ""and to stimulate a market that didn't yet exist.""
Working with a startup like Arrival has opened up a wealth of possibilities for UPS, including self-driving features on the van that can reduce costly accidents at depots, Wake said.
The van's battery pack will allow UPS to add automatic doors for drivers and LED lights in the back to help drivers find packages more quickly. Such features can save seconds per delivery - which add up as UPS delivers 2 billion packages annually.
The UPS order put Arrival on the map, and the startup emphasized that relationship when announcing last month it will develop an electric car for Uber (NYSE:UBER).
""You always have a confidence gap to bridge,"" said Carl-Magnus Norden, founder of Stockholm-based Volta Trucks, which is developing an electric truck for inner-city deliveries to businesses and has an order for 1,000 trucks from French refrigerated truck firm Petit Forestier. ""So someone like Petit Forestier is important for us.""
While most startups seek that golden ticket order, Electric Last Mile Inc (ELMS), which will go public via a merger with Forum Merger III Corp, a SPAC, is tapping U.S. dealer networks as a way to build scale and has pre-orders for 45,000 small electric vans that it will launch this year. 
Chief Executive James Taylor said speed is paramount as giants like Ford focus on electric commercial vehicles. Ford sells the most commercial vehicles in the U.S. and European markets and will launch an electric Transit van in 2023. 

ELMS is betting it can make it because so far no one else plans to produce a van as small in the United States.
""We have at least a short runway where we have no competition,"" Taylor said.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 07:57AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon starts testing UK staff for coronavirus variants,"By Kate Holton and James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is testing its front-line staff in Britain for coronavirus variants and feeding the data to public health officials, including in hotspots where a strain first found in India is spreading fast. 
The retail giant opened COVID-19 testing labs in the UK and the United States last year to provide voluntary testing for staff and can now also test for variants in Britain, where scientists have pioneered sequencing coronavirus genomes.
Aided by a rapid vaccine rollout, Britain is on the verge of reopening its economy after months of lockdowns but the Delta variant first found in India has spread, including in areas where Amazon has its lab and some fulfilment centres. 
Luke Meredith (NYSE:MDP), director of the Amazon Diagnostic Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Britain, said the company was open to offering the same service in the United States, and did not rule out making its testing programme available to the UK public in future. 
""It's very important that we acknowledge the fact that variants can transmit in different ways, they have different responses to vaccines, they may have different impacts on people's health,"" he told Reuters. ""This is a learning phase."" 
    The coronavirus pandemic has killed 3.7 million people, forcing governments, companies and society to rethink how people work, travel and socialise. Some initial studies show the Delta variant spreads more easily. 
Amazon's testing is available to around 30,000 front-line staff in Britain, working in warehouses and logistics. The British lab has already processed more than 900,000 tests since it opened in September, including from its sites in Europe. 
Meredith, who previously worked for the World Health Organization and the University of Cambridge, said Public Health England had been eager to receive the additional data to help track the spread of variants.

Asked if Amazon would make the testing facilities available to the public in Britain, where the cost of private testing can run into hundreds of pounds for international travel, Meredith said it was too soon to say. 
""I don't think we can rule anything out at this point in time, that's a decision that will have to be made, but for now we just want to focus on our staff,"" he said.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>","Remy Cointreau beats forecasts on U.S., China sales","By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) -Remy Cointreau on Thursday beat annual profit expectations amid U.S. and Chinese demand for premium cognac but its shares fell after investment plans pointed to slower than expected growth ahead.
The French spirits group vowed to accelerate investments behind its brands, a move that would limit profitability and the shares reversed earlier gains to trade down 5%.
The maker of Remy Martin cognac said it had emerged stronger from the COVID-19 crisis due to buoyant at-home consumption in the United States, a penchant for cocktails and rising e-commerce sales - all of which supported its push towards higher-priced spirits to boost margins.
Remy Cointreau, which plans to buy back up to 1.98% of its equity capital, also handed investors an 85% increase in its dividend.
It forecast an ""excellent"" start to its 2021/22 financial year that started on April 1 and said it had decided to increase its investment in communication to support its brands, notably Remy Martin and Louis XIII cognacs.
""2021/22 will be a strong year of growth and investment and we are on track to achieve our 2030 vision,"" CEO Eric Vallat told a news conference.
Commenting on prospects for FY 2021/22, Finance Chief Luca Marotta spoke of ""top line and bottom line growth in the mid-teens in organic terms"", which lagged analysts expectations at least for operating profit growth.
The market consensus for 2021/22 stands at 15.6% for organic sales growth and at 22.1% for operating profit growth.
A rebound in demand for its premium cognac in China and the United States, along with tight control over costs, lifted Remy's organic operating profit by 12.8% to 236.1 million euros ($288 million) in the year ended March 31. 
Analysts on average and Remy itself had expected 10% growth.
This marked a sharp turnaround from a 22% fall in group profit a year earlier due to the impact of the pandemic.
The company said it was confident it would achieve a gross margin of 72% and an operating margin of 33% by 2030, up from 67.3% and 23.4% respectively in 2020/21.
Remy Cointreau reiterated its goal was to become a ""global leader in exceptional spirits"" while also building a business model more focused on sustainability.

While Remy expected good growth in operating profit this year, it said that would be tempered by adverse currency effects estimated at 16 to 20 million euros and a 2 million euro hit following asset sales.

711,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Lower; AMC Entertainment Craze Continues,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, as investors consolidate ahead of a spate of economic data releases, headed by the weekly jobless claims numbers. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 215 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 futures traded 30 points, or 0.7%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 120 points, or 0.9%.
The major indices all closed marginally higher Wednesday, near record highs, but worries that a stronger-than-expected economic rebound will result in higher inflation and thus sooner-than-expected monetary policy tightening have deprived the asset class of a lot of its momentum.
Investors will focus on Thursday’s packed data slate for fresh clues on the pace of recovery in the world's largest economy, and thus Federal Reserve thinking,.
First off the blocks is the ADP jobs number, at 8:15 AM ET, which is expected to say the economy added 650,000 private sector jobs in May, a slight slowdown from the 742,000 which were added in April. 
The weekly initial jobless claims data follows 15 minutes later, with expectations calling for a number of 390,000 claims for the week ending May 28, an improvement from the 406,000 the previous week and a new post-pandemic low.
Also due for release is the May ISM non-manufacturing PMI, at 10 AM ET, which is expected to show renewed confidence in the vital services sector, especially after the equivalent numbers in Europe impressed earlier in the day.
In the corporate sector, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will remain in focus, with the meme stock favorite rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares doubled in a single session.
Other Reddit favorites, like BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), are also set to push higher as retail inventors act together to bid up shares of heavily-shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss.
The earnings calendar Thursday includes the likes of online office tool DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), group messaging app Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK), leisure wear retailer  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) and chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
Crude oil prices edged lower Thursday, as traders banked some of the recent gains ahead of the latest official U.S. supply data.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.3% at $68.62 a barrel, after earlier climbing to its highest level since October 2018. Brent was down 0.3% at $71.17, after closing above $70 for two consecutive days for the first time in more than two years.
Confidence is high that crude demand will surge in the second half of the year, led by resurgent demand in the United States, the world's biggest oil user, from vehicle consumption during the driving season.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Wednesday, showed a draw of 5.360 million barrels for last week, a substantial increase from the 439,000-barrel draw recorded during the previous week.
Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due at 11 AM ET.

712,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>",Meme Stock Craze Reaches New Heights as AMC Keeps Surging,"(Bloomberg) -- “AMC to the Moon” posters are popping up at street corners and pool parties in the U.S. in yet another sign of the retail frenzy over meme stocks.
After a reality-defying surge on Wednesday, the stock is skyrocketing once again. The shares added 20% to $74.85 in U.S. pre-market trading. AMC now has a market value of more than $30 billion, making it bigger than at least half of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.
The latest meme stock frenzy appears to have greater momentum behind it than  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). back in January, and the reasons are just as unclear. Some analysts point to an abundance of liquidity and savings created during the pandemic. Others cite the impact of social media in providing a platform for small investors to egg each other on.
“AMC and meme stocks are somewhat the modern and accelerated version of tulip bulbs frenzy in the 17th century,” said Sylvain Goyon, a Paris-based strategist at Oddo BHF. “The shares rise with the hype and die without it.”
Other retail favorites were also on a tear. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd. soared 39% in premarket Thursday, while Workhorse Group Inc. jumped 26%.
AMC’s rally has been remarkable both in terms of its speed and extent. Just a few short months ago, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy as the pandemic shuttered cinemas across the U.S. What’s more, the outlook for the cinema industry remains littered with challenges.
As of Wednesday’s close, AMC stock had risen almost 30-fold since the start of this year, far exceeding GameStop’s 15-fold increase.
“Fundamentally, AMC is not a flourishing business, or at least not right now,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “There is a little chance that the actual and future business environment would ever justify a $33 billion worth of market capitalization unless there is an incredible innovation in the movie theater business that no one’s heard of, and which would change the face of the business moving forward.”
To help explain the stock’s meteoric performance, some commentators point to a financial system that’s awash with cash and liquidity.
“This leads to bubbles and extreme situations such as the one we are seeing now on these retail sentiment names,” said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief financial and chief investment officer at FlowBank SA. “The meme stock phenomena is coming back with a vengeance after a two-month pause and this could indeed create some volatility on the overall market.”
AMC announced this week that it will reward the small-time supporters with goodies such as special screenings and free popcorn. It’s also taken advantage of meteoric gains to raise $230 million directly from one of its main creditors, Mudrick Capital Management, and shore up its finances.
“When a fresh pile on, sparked by the offer of free popcorn, leads to a doubling of the share price in just a day, it shows a huge disconnect between price and underlying value,” Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said by email.

713,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Tesla Slips As China Vehicle Recall Hands Bears More Ammunition,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were down 1.5% in premarket trading on Thursday after a recall of its vehicles sold in China added to the list of negative news at the company.
Tesla is recalling 734 vehicles that include 311 units of the imported Model 3, China’s Global Times said.
Tesla’s woes in China seems to be piling up fast. The company has come under increased scrutiny in the country with the regulators increasing their oversight of the company and the media and people venting their anger against it on social media platforms.
The EV maker has had to tackle allegations ranging from possible spying by the cameras loaded on its vehicles to faulty brakes in its cars sold in China.
On Wednesday, the company ordered recall of nearly 6,000 vehicles over concerns that their brake caliper bolts might loosen, which could result in a loss of tire pressure.
The recall covers certain 2019 to 2021 Model 3 vehicles and 2020 to 2021 Model Y vehicles, Reuters said.
It is not clear if the recall in China is part of the Wednesday announcement.
In another development Wednesday, a WSJ report said the Securities and Exchange Commission told off Tesla for CEO Elon Musk’s ""use of Twitter."" The agency said Musk’s tweets have violated the terms of the 2018 settlement that required Musk to get his tweets preapproved by company lawyers.
As part of the agreement reached with the U.S. markets regulator, Musk was also forced to step down as the company’s Chairman. Current incumbent Robyn M. Denholm replaced him.
The maverick CEO has been unrelenting with his tweets, directly or indirectly influencing prices of assets ranging from cryptocurrencies to shares of listed companies."

715,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",EU court backs Tesco workers in equal pay dispute,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Thousands of current and former employees of UK supermarket group Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) on Thursday won the support of Europe's top court in their fight for equal pay in a judgment that could affect other retailers.
Tesco found itself in the spotlight after about 6,000 current or former employees took their grievance to an employment tribunal in Watford, near London.
They argued the company's shop workers - mostly women - had not received equal pay for equal work compared with its distribution workers - mostly men - since February 2018, in breach of EU and UK laws. The shop staff argued the firm should be seen as a single entity in terms of employment conditions.
Tesco had argued an EU law defining equal pay for equal work, or work of equal value, was not directly applicable in this case. 
The UK tribunal sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's highest, which rejected Tesco's arguments.
""The principle, laid down by EU law, of equal pay for male and female workers can be relied upon directly, in respect both of 'equal work' and of 'work of equal value', in proceedings between individuals,"" CJEU judges said.
Tesco said the jobs in its stores and distribution centres were different and hence the different pay. 
""These roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay – but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. 
""We reward our colleagues fairly for the jobs they do and work hard to ensure that the pay and benefits we offer are fair, competitive and sustainable. These claims are extremely complex and will take many years to reach a conclusion. We continue to strongly defend these claims,"" she said.
The Watford tribunal will now have to take the CJEU ruling into account when it decides on the case.

The CJEU said it had jurisdiction over the case in accordance with Britain's withdrawal deal with the EU. 
The CJEU ruling is final and cannot be appealed. The case C-624/19 Tesco Stores.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",Analysis: Global funds feel the heat over Belarus 'blood' bonds,"By Marc Jones and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - When Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko intensified his crackdown on protesters in February, activists turned their attention to one of the country's sources of funds: international bond markets.
Hashtag #BelarusBloodBonds - which had first emerged around the country's disputed 2020 elections - gathered steam again on Twitter, targeting big banks and funds, reminding them of their sustainable investment pledges and calling on them to shun Minsk's debt. 
One portfolio manager at a major global asset management company which had bought into Belarus' most recent bond in June 2020, said their clients saw the social media chatter in February and pressed them to sell. 
The manager, who requested anonymity, said, at the time their fund - having come to the conclusion that Lukashenko's regime had taken a turn for the worse on human rights - was already in the process of selling.
""So we had the answer they were looking for,"" the manager said. ""You can't talk about ESG and invest in a really bad actor – and more and more companies are afraid of the reputational risk.""
But many investors stayed in the bonds. They are now finding their environment, social and governance credentials (ESG) questioned again after the ""skyjacking"" of Belarussian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, which is shaping up as a major test case in how the investment industry approaches these issues in emerging markets
Belarus has some $5.5 billion in hard-currency bonds outstanding, and counts fund managers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), PIMCO,  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) IP, UBS, Aberdeen Standard and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  BlackRock, PIMCO, NN IP and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story. Belarus' finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  CLEAR CUT  The matter is clear cut for some investors.      Jens Munch Holst, CEO of the $22 billion AkademikerPension in Denmark added Belarus to its list of excluded countries in January, and said warnings of systemic human rights abuses had been flashing for a number of years. ""At a very minimum, we are linked to action of states through our investments in these bonds, because we are providing them with capital,"" he said.      ESG is the buzzword these days, with hundreds of billions of dollars of investment chasing sustainable assets. In the world of sovereign debt, however, how a country's record on human rights is handled is a grey area.  Some of the world's largest asset managers remain heavily invested in regimes with questionable rights records. The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi did little to dampen the kingdom's investor allure. China debt markets have sucked in billions despite European and U.S. criticism over alleged human rights abuses, denied by Beijing. While its governance and institutions are classed as only slightly better than a country in state of war by ratings firms like S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Belarus does score well on some ESG metrics - such as education, improving air quality and gender equality. Yet several major bond holders said the seizure of Protasevich and girlfriend Sofia Sapega sparked new concerns and debates either internally or with clients, or both, about the compatibility of ethical principles and investments in Belarus sovereign bonds.      ""The extreme description of these kind of assets is that these are blood bonds where the regime oppresses or tortures its citizens,"" said Aberdeen Standard Investments' portfolio manager Viktor Szabo, whose company holds Belarus bonds and has been targeted by the social media campaign. ""The question is where the threshold is, and that is all qualitative."" SANCTIONS VS ESG Some suggest sanctions restricting access to international bond markets might be more effective than ESG principles.  At a European Union summit last Thursday, Germany's foreign minister said the bloc was looking at curbing future bond issuance by Belarus in Europe. The country - which has been under EU sanctions since 2014 - last sold an international bond in June 2020. The bond was three times oversubscribed to piled into the debt offering a coupon of about 6%.  (Graphic: Belarus bonds hit by sanctions worries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwmgnjpw/Pasted%20image%201622227495572.png)  Within days of the issue, protests against Lukashenko swelled, sparking an increasingly harsh response from authorities ahead of the August 9 elections. Hard-currency sovereign bonds make up nearly a third of Belarus' $18.5 external debt burden. But Lukashenko has increasingly relied on long-time ally, Russia for funding.  This Russian backstop and Belarus's low debt-to-GDP ratios could also mean any new sanctions would pack less of a punch.  Russia is moving ahead with a second $500 million loan tranche for Belarus and has pledged more financial support in case of EU curbs.  G7 and EU-led development bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, also continues to invest in Belarus.  Federico Kaune, Global EM Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Asset Management, which shows up in the EMAXX bond holdings data as a top-four holder of Belarus government debt, said the sanctions question was key.  
    ""EU leaders will decide on sanctions so we will see what they do in the end,"" Kaune said, pointing to both the Russia-style option of bans on buying new bonds, or the more extreme Venezuela-style option of a bond trading ban. Once the extent of sanctions are known, ""we will have to reassess whether access to those markets is something we want to have,"" Kaune added.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",European stock traders place their blockbuster bets in the dark,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Think of an exclusive poker game where the minimum bet is close to $1 million. The stock-trading version, ""dark pools"" that host blockbuster trades, are pulling in major money in Europe. 
Their rise has been swift.
On June 24, 2016 - the day after the Brexit vote - just 3% of trades on the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise shares platform were carried out in its dark pool via so-called block trades, mega-bets of around $800,000 or more.
Fast forward about four years to Nov. 9, 2020 - another momentous day for markets, when  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was the first COVID-19 vaccine developer to announce it had produced an effective shot - and 58% of trades were executed in these giant blocks.
The ballooning interest is evidence that U.S.-style block trading of shares is ""becoming truly mainstream"" among European institutional investors, according to Robert Barnes, global head of primary markets at LSE Group. 
The LSEG is one of a handful of European exchanges trying to grab a slice of the action, having seen dark pools - traditionally run by investment banks or specialised platforms - siphon off growing trading volumes from their industry. 
Pan-European exchange operator Euronext told Reuters it was preparing to launch its own business - Euronext Block - in coming months.
Block trades are so big - EU regulators stipulate at least 650,000 euros ($795,000) for large-cap stocks - they are, in practice, too costly for investors to make on mainstream exchanges where they can move the market and take a big hit on price.
Such ""off-exchange"" deals accounted for 4.2% of overall EU monthly trading volumes in February, up from 1.5% in January 2017, according to investment bank and research firm Rosenblatt Securities. Over that period, block trades in the more mature U.S. market eased from 9.6% to 6.7%.
Thus business is brisk for dark pools, which match buyers and sellers away from wider market and regulatory scrutiny.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told Reuters its European block-trading volumes in the first quarter of 2021 had already surpassed full-year levels for 2020, which itself had doubled from 2019. It declined to disclose volumes. Another top U.S. bank confirmed similar rates of European growth on condition of anonymity.
Among other leading venues, more than $7 billion worth of shares were traded on CBOE's European block-trading platform in April, and more than $10 billion at Liquidnet, according to data from broker and analytics firm Instinet. 
Jason Lenzo, head of trading at London-based Russell Investments, said if block-trading volumes continued to rise, investors had to adapt. Russell has increased its share of block trades from 30% of all trade volumes a couple of years ago to the ""mid-30s"" now, he added. 
""If there is more block trading, then you certainly need to shift your trading strategy,"" he said. ""You want to be in the market where the liquidity is focused."" 
LSE AND EURONEXT
The shift towards the dark has alarmed some mainstream European stock exchanges, which are lobbying for tighter controls on such rival venues, saying they hinder transparency.
Prices of deals on dark pools are only shared with the wider - or ""lit"" - market after the trade takes place, unlike on exchange where it is displayed until it's executed. 
Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said dark pools trading could have a negative impact on price discovery, when it came to smaller-sized orders, and that this would eventually push up trading costs for issuers and investors. 
""Trading in the dark should be limited in order not to harm price formation in the long run,"" said Sandra Vincent, head of market structure and regulation at Deutsche Boerse Cash Market.
EU regulators are concerned too. With MiFID II in 2018, they ruled that only 8% of a stock's average trading volume can be transacted via dark pools and set minimum limits for the size of each trade that can preclude all but the biggest fish. 
Yet the LSE's dark pool has become an important source of earnings since Britain's decoupling from the EU and its rules.
Trading on Turquoise, a trading venue majority-owned by the LSE, doubled to around 241 billion euros last year compared with 2015, when the exchange started reporting full-year volumes for the unit. Over the same period, volumes on the LSE's main bourse declined 18% to 1.4 trillion euros.
The block-trading business received a fillip in December when regulators in Britain, now competing with the continent for investment money, said international investors would be allowed to trade near-unlimited amounts of shares in the country.
Euronext told Reuters it was taking a different tack. Rather than compete with existing players more focused on large-cap stocks, it said it was going to launch a block-trading venue for small and mid-caps, which it described as ""underserved and neglected"" in European trading as a whole.
""In the next few months, I can't give a date yet, we're just onboarding offer to customers, we're going to be launching something called Euronext Block,"" said Simon Gallagher, head of cash equities and derivatives at Euronext. 
""In the midcaps, it could be 10,000-euro order sizes, which is equivalent to a blue-chip trade in the lit market.""
BLOCKBUSTER SAVINGS?
The cost savings offered by block trades are a big draw for the European investment industry, where many are already facing higher regulatory scrutiny over client fees. 
A block trade would have saved an investor nearly 90% of the transaction cost they would otherwise incur, according to an analysis at the end of 2020 by trading platform Instinet, which runs a European dark pool called Blockmatch. It defines transaction cost as ""the price achieved for an order vs the price available at the time you decided to make a trade or more importantly vs the expected cost"".
Danny Mallinson, head of EMEA execution services at Goldman Sachs, said costs savings made block trading increasingly attractive for investors.
""In the last 12 to 18 months, we have been living in a market environment where the cost of trading has gone up as spreads have widened,"" he added. 
With trading concentrated at the start and end of each day, increasingly thin-volume markets make transactions expensive and almost impossible to hide. Bid and offer prices are often far apart, meaning even medium-sized trades can move markets.
""Some of those spreads can be 20 basis points wide or some can be as much as 500 bps wide,"" said Lenzo at Russell Investments. 
ARCHEGOS SCANDAL
In the United States, block trades have been part of the investment scene for the best part of two decades. Many exchanges operate a dual strategy, with separate platforms focused on retail and institutional investors.
These platforms usually co-exist peacefully as institutional clients trade with their peers without worrying about information leakage, while the retail investor can trade tiny chunks without worrying about large orders swamping the market. 
Problems can arise when these markets collide, though, as happened this year when the implosion of Archegos Capital led to institutional investors dumping large amounts of shares via dark pools. The news leaked, fuelling a selloff across the broader mainstream market, and led to some retail investors questioning why big players were party to sensitive information first.
U.S. regulators are not stepping up scrutiny of dark pools directly, but are looking into the relationship between investment banks and hedge funds. 
Ben Stephens, global head of product management at Instinet, said the advantages of block trading, particularly electronic midpoint blocks and guaranteed prices from dealers, meant the practice was here to stay in Europe. 

""The opportunity cost of not trading a block vs trading in the lit market is so high that it means asset managers will continue to choose to execute blocks electronically where they can,"" he added.

Investing -- Meme stock favorite AMC (NYSE:AMC) looked set for another blockbuster run Thursday, rallying 20% in the premarket, a day after shares more than doubled in a single session.
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was up too, rising 30% in premarket, while GameStop (NYSE:GME), the original meme stock darling, gained 3%, in line with its relatively subdued trend in recent times.
The meme stock rally has been driven by by retail inventors acting together to bid up shares of heavily shorted companies, forcing short sellers to unwind their bets at a loss.
AMC has done much more recently beyond offering free popcorn to investors who sign who sign up for its AMC Investor Connect, an initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholders, to attract attention but this demolition of trading records and stock market highs has left many baffled.
In less than a month, AMC has raised $658.5 million in equity. Part of this money will be spent on new leases and revamping old theatres.
But the pandemic has caused its long-term debt levels to soar to $5.4 billion as of the first three months of this year from less than $2 billion in 2016. And it’s still losing money, with analysts expecting another $100 million to go over the next 12 months.
Many experts have warned that retail traders, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify current valuations.

FAO also issued its first forecast for world cereal production in 2021, predicting output of nearly 2.821 billion tonnes -- a new record and 1.9% up on 2020 levels.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 127.1 points last month versus a revised 121.3 in April.
The April figure was previously given as 120.9.
On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 39.7% in May. 
FAO's cereal price index rose 6.0% in May month-on-month and 36.6% year-on-year. Maize prices led the surge and are now 89.9% above their year-earlier value, however FAO said they fell back at the end of the month, lifted by an improved production outlook in the United States.
The vegetable oil price index jumped 7.8% in May, lifted primarily by rising palm, soy and rapeseed oil quotations. Palm oil prices were boosted by slow production growth in southeast Asia, while prospects of robust global demand, especially from the biodiesel sector, drove up soyoil prices.
The sugar index posted a 6.8% month-on-month gain, due largely to harvest delays and concerns over reduced crop yields in Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter, FAO said. [SOF/L]
The meat index rose 2.2% from April, with quotations for all meat types buoyed by a faster pace of import purchases by east Asian countries, mainly China.
Dairy prices rose 1.8% on a monthly basis and were up 28% on a year earlier. The increase was led by ""solid import demand"" for skim and whole milk powders, while butter prices fell for the first time in almost a year on increased export supplies from New Zealand.

FAO said its forecast for record world cereal production this year was underpinned by a projected 3.7% annual growth in maize output. Global wheat production was seen rising 1.4% year-on-year, while rice production was forecast to grow 1.0%. 
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was seen increasing by 1.7% to a new peak of 2.826 billion tonnes, just above production levels. ""Total cereal food consumption is forecast to rise in tandem with world population,"" FAO said.

The Casino group caused a stir in 2018 when its upmarket Monoprix stores struck a deal with Amazon, considered one of the biggest rivals to retailers trying to boost their own e-commerce operations. 
The latest partnership would affect Casino-branded stores, and involves the roll-out of new click-and-collect services for Amazon Prime members. It will kick off in July in the French cities of Annecy and Clermont-Ferrand, and 180 food collection points will be rolled out across France by the summer of 2022, the companies said. 
The indebted Casino group and its rivals saw sales surge in France at the height of a first coronavirus lockdown in the spring of 2020, helped in part by customers shifting even more orders online. 
The company, which is considering a share sale in its Cdiscount e-commerce unit among options to help trim its debts, reported slowing revenue growth earlier this year.

Its Casino-brand stores first struck a e-commerce partnership with Britain's Ocado (LON:OCDO) in 2017.
Rivals have also looked at tie-ups with tech giants, and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) teamed up in 2018 with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to boost its online shopping business. It also has delivery partnerships with the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Deliveroo.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>","Analysis-With popcorn and tweets, AMC's Aron rides retail investor wave","By David Randall and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Free popcorn for shareholders. Following more than 500 die-hard fans of his company's stock on Twitter. Retweeting a video of what appears to be an airplane flying a banner with the meme-stock rallying cry ""AMC to the Moon"" around Manhattan. 
Welcome to the world of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron, who since the beginning of the year has taken to new heights the role of chief promoter of a company that was on the brink of bankruptcy. 
At a time when many on Wall Street argue that the movie theater operator is over-valued and in dire need of an accelerated economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to justify its share price, Aron, 66, is leaning in to the growing power of individual investors to keep so-called meme stocks surging. 
""Watch out naysayers, AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!"" Aron wrote in a June 1 tweet https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152. 
He has been riding a wave of enthusiasm for the stock. AMC shares are up nearly 3,000% since the start of the year and almost doubled on Wednesday to close at $62.55 a share, way above the average target price of $5.11 among Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data. AMC is now valued at $28.2 billion, based on Wednesday's closing price.
Aron, who became CEO in 2016 after running the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, started promoting AMC after its shares were swept up in a retail buying frenzy in January. 
AMC did not respond to a request for comment, and Aron did not reply to a direct message on Twitter. 
Aron is part of a growing number of executives on Wall Street such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk and the incoming chairman of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), Ryan Cohen, who appear to be doing more to court retail rather than institutional investors. 
""These individual investors likely own a majority of our shares,"" Aron said during the company's May earnings call. ""They own AMC. We work for them. I work for them.""
Some analysts are skeptical that such showmanship will bolster AMC's share price long-term. There are no actively managed stock funds among the company's 20 largest shareholders, according to Refinitiv data, leaving open the risk that a shift in retail investor opinion could quickly sink its shares. 
""The Twitter horde love him. He's playing to the crowd and it's working,"" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, who questioned AMC'S stated strategy of issuing new shares to raise capital. ""He'd be better off improving the balance sheet and providing some stability for the business,"" he said. 
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that selling enough movie tickets and popcorn to justify a $40 share price for the company - where it was trading early on Wednesday - would require that revenues nearly double from his 2022 estimates of $322,000 per screen from movie tickets and $6 per person in spending on food and drinks. 
""It's hard to understand why AMC would perform at double its historical average,"" he said. 
Aron, whose career includes a decade as chief executive of Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) Inc and a stint leading Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc, focused more of his attention on connecting with consumers rather than retail shareholders in his previous executive roles. 
At the 76ers, for instance, he was part of a charge to cut ticket prices, while at Vail Resorts he was instrumental in expanding the company into a nationwide business. Shares of the company fell nearly 4% when he announced his resignation in 2006. 

Promoting a company's shares to retail investors may be the new reality for many companies, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group. 
""CEOs have always been showmen and a big part of what they do is put on shows for institutional investors,"" said Paulsen. ""You may have a Reddit group that is the focus of the tweet but the reality is institutional guys like me are going to hear about it just as quickly.""

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) -China's Huawei Technologies launched its Harmony operating system for smartphones on Wednesday, looking to recover from U.S. sanctions that have hobbled its handset business. 
Huawei will start rolling out HarmonyOS on selected smartphone models, offering users the chance to switch from the current operating system based on Google's Android platform.
The use of HarmonyOS means the company will no longer be wholly reliant on Android. U.S. sanctions banned Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from providing technical support to new Huawei phone models and access to Google Mobile Services, the bundle of developer services upon which most Android apps are based.
Rather than being a like-for-like replacement, Huawei is billing HarmonyOS as an 'Internet-of-Things' platform, aimed at operating on and connecting other devices such as laptops, smartwatches, cars and appliances.
The company unveiled several new products using HarmonyOS, including a tablet, a smart watch and a stylus, during a video launch from the company's headquarters in Shenzhen.
The presentation ended with a teaser for the flagship P50 phone, whose spring launch was delayed ""for reasons that everyone is aware of,"" said Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group.
Huawei is aiming to have HarmonyOS on 200 million smartphones and 100 million third-party smart devices by the end of the year, said Wang Chenglu, president of Huawei Consumer Business Group's software department, who has led Huawei's efforts to develop HarmonyOS since 2016.
Wang spoke at a media roundtable a day earlier and his comments were embargoed until Wednesday.
China's leading telecommunications equipment maker found itself on a U.S. trade blacklist in May 2019 due to national security concerns. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is a risk.
The ban put Huawei's handset business under immense pressure. Once the world's biggest smartphone maker, Huawei is now ranked sixth, with a 4% market share in the first quarter.
The presentation did not feature any new smartphones, although a company press release said two older high-end models would be re-released.
The company is looking into providing upgrades for some components like batteries for users with older phones, Yu said. 
But Wang said the company was looking beyond smartphones with HarmonyOS. He said the smartphone market had plateaued and smartphones remained the dominant device in people's lives largely because most developers had few other platforms to develop for. 
Instead, there was a need for a system to bridge the gap between devices, Wang said.
""The problem with existing operating systems is that devices can't be connected easily,"" with users often having to download separate apps to get things to connect, Wang said. 
""But Harmony can enable devices to be connected to form a super device. It will work as one file system, literally one device,"" Wang said.
Wang said he would welcome other smartphone makers adopting HarmonyOS, but added Huawei sees big opportunities in working with makers of non-smartphone devices.

Will Wong, an analyst at IDC, said it was not essential for Huawei that other smartphone makers adopt HarmonyOS.
""(But) for Huawei to achieve its ambition, it will be important to get other electronics brands and even automakers onboard for the OS, and China provides a favourable market ecosystem to achieve this,"" said Wong.

(Reuters) - Asian equities in May clocked their biggest foreign outflows in 14 months due to a spike in COVID-19 cases in the region and as growing inflationary pressure tempered risk appetite.
Data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and India showed foreigners net sold a combined total of $12.05 billion in regional equities, the highest since March 2020. 
""The outflows in May were driven by different reasons in different markets, but the common thread was COVID-19 resurgence,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said. 
Graphic: Foreign investments in Asian equities: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxmdrevx/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg 
He said markets such as Taiwan, Thailand and India, which faced a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, were sold down by FIIs in anticipation of decline in consumption and cuts in earnings estimates. 
South Korea led outflows, seeing net sales of $7.97 billion last month on concerns over rising inflation, which has reinforced calls for gradual monetary tightening.
Taiwan faced outflows worth $2.1 billion, with the sub-tropical nation dealing with its worst drought in history after no typoons directly hit the island last year, meaning much less rain.
Thai and Indian equities saw net sales of $1.1 billion and $389 million, respectively. 
India's daily infection rates have been falling in recent weeks, offering hope that a devastating second week is ebbing.
However, worries still linger, as just 3% of the country's population have been vaccinated so far, which is the lowest rates among the 10 countries with the most COVID-19 cases.

BNP Paribas' Raychaudhuri said he expects foreign flows to improve selectively in a few Asian markets in the second half of 2021, particularly in Taiwan and South Korea.
""Korea and Taiwan should benefit in the medium-term as corporate earnings in both markets are strongly driven by global consumption revival – particularly that in the developed economies – a trend that we believe is likely to last for a while,"" he said.

The plant would be able to make 80 gigawatt-hours of battery cells a year, one of the people said, which would come on top of 69.1GWh in current production capacity and another 77.5GWh under construction. 
Locating the plant in Shanghai will put it close to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Chinese production base after it began supplying the U.S. automaker last year. It will also enable CATL to draw upon a larger and more diversified talent pool than its headquarters in Ningde in southeastern China, they said.
The expansion plan is likely to add to competitive pressure on Tesla's other battery suppliers, Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp and LG Chem's LG Energy Solution unit.

CATL has been in talks with the Shanghai government about building the factory, the people said. It was not immediately clear when a final agreement might be reached or when CATL hopes to have the new plant up and running.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 10:59PM ET</span>",Analysis: China seeks to milk the milk market but doesn't have enough cows,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China has come to crave milk. Demand that had been steadily growing has spiked further after doctors touted its health benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic and dairy firms across the country have embarked on a farm-building frenzy.
But quenching that thirst will be problematic, not least because finding the millions more cows needed for planned new and expanded farms will be challenging.
China is the world's third-largest milk producer, but last year's 34 million tonnes of output only met about 70% of domestic needs. Complicating matters are feed costs at multi-year highs, while land and water are also in short supply, making the country a costly place to produce milk. 
Graphic: Cow milk output by country: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/azgpoobkqpd/CowMilkProductionbyCOuntry.png 
Spurred on by near record highs for raw milk prices and government subsidies, just over 200 new Chinese dairy farm projects were announced last year, according to consultancy Beijing Orient Dairy.
Its analysis shows that 60% of the new projects have set their sights on 10,000-plus cows and in total the plans call for some 2.5 million cows - roughly half of China's current milking herd - to be added in the coming years.
On the face of it, China's dairy market, worth some $62 billion in annual sales, is ripe for development. The government has heavily promoted milk and its benefits - in part to support the rural dairy industry - boosting consumption. Even so annual per capita intake is only 6.8 litres compared to 50 litres for the United States, according to Euromonitor International.
""Average per capita consumption is still very low,"" Gao Lina, the CEO of China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd told Reuters. ""The potential is huge."" 
Graphic: Cow milk consumption by country: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnvwmyxmvw/CowMilkConsumptionbyCountry.png 
She said Chinese people, especially children, have begun eating more cheese which will further inflate demand. A kilogram of cheese generally requires 10 kilograms of milk to make.
Milk in China is, however, still considered special enough to be a popular gift. Fresh milk costs about $2 a litre, roughly double UK and U.S. prices, while the more common 240 ml packs of room temperature UHT milk cost about 40 cents.
Demand for fresh chilled milk especially, which constitutes just a fifth of milk sales in China, has shown rapid growth, climbing 21% in the first 11 months of 2020 versus 10.9% for room-temperature milk, according to Nielsen data.
To satisfy that demand, big players will need to develop more raw milk sources closer to wealthier population centres, analysts say.
SEND IN THE COWS
Firms outlining grand plans include Modern Dairy, which wants to double its herd over the next five years to 500,000 by buying up smaller farming companies and building new farms. 
Shanghai-based processor Bright Dairy and Food Co Ltd aims to build four more farms to add 31,000 cows to its 66,000-strong herd. China Youran Dairy is planning an IPO, seeking up to $800 million to expand its breeding herd and increase milk output. 
According to Beijing Orient Dairy, new Chinese farms needing a total of 1.35 million cows are already under construction, but some of those will have to sit empty.
It estimates that over the next two years, China's domestic herd will generate about 500,000 new heifers while imports could come in at around 400,000 if the pace of imports stays the same as last year when China imported almost 200,000 heifers, mostly from Australia and New Zealand.
Importing heifers is the fastest way to stock a new farm, shaving about a year off the time it would take to breed the stock at home. Imports are also preferred as the cattle are free from the many diseases circulating in China's herd.
But clouding that outlook has been New Zealand's decision in April to halt live cattle exports within two years due to concerns about the welfare of livestock on ships for long periods.
""We have been inundated with inquiries, especially as New Zealand stops the trade,"" said an Australian cattle exporter who declined to be identified, adding that the surging demand from China is encouraging graziers to spend more on breeding.
Chile and Uruguay also export small volumes, but shipping times are twice as long and the breeds used produce less milk, making them less attractive options.
Brazil, the United States and European countries could become good sources of breeder cattle, said Dou Ming, chief economist at Beijing Orient Dairy.
""If we just added two more import countries, we'd be fine,"" he said. 
Graphic: Milk-producing cows by country: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DAIRY/xegpbrmmrpq/chart_eikon.jpg 
China and the United States pledged to start talks on imports of breeder cattle within a month of the Phase 1 trade deal signed in Jan. 2020 but it remains unclear if the discussions have begun.
The office of the U.S. Trade Representative, China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs did not respond to requests for comment.

Feed costs, however, present another impediment, analysts and industry sources say, as imported heifers take time before they become milkable cows.

(NYSE:CVX) would consider selling its 20% stake in a Canadian oil sands mine as its faces investor pressure to do more to curb emissions and fight climate change.
The oil producer’s stake in Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd.’s Athabasca oil sands project generates “pretty good cash flow” without needing much capital “but I wouldn’t deem it a strategic position,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said at Bernstein’s 37th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference.
“We’re not in the kind of fire-sale mentality,” Wirth said. “But if we got what we think is fair value for an asset like that, we’ve been willing to transact on things that are of that scale and kind of relative importance in the portfolio.”
Oil sands are among the most challenged energy assets because of the volume of emissions created when producing crude from mines and from underground wells that require steam injection.
Facing increased pressure to cut carbon emissions, multiple international oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) have divested of their Canadian oil sands holdings in recent years.
Those pressures have only intensified in the past week. Chevron shareholders voted on May 26 in favor of a climate proposal to include emissions from customers’ burning of fuels in future reduction targets, against the wishes of the board.
Environment-focused activist investors are expected to win three seats on  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).’s board of directors in a stunning rebuke to the company’s management. Shell was ordered to cut emissions more quickly by a European court last week.
The Athabasca project is a little more than 300 miles north of Edmonton, the capital city of Alberta.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Thursday morning as investors digested a slowdown in the Chinese service sector’s expansion alongside comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.02% by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.31%.
Data released earlier in the day said May's Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 55.1, lower than April’s 56.3 and the non-manufacturing PMI’s 55.2 reading released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
U.S-China tensions were also on investors’ radars as U.S. President Joe Biden will reportedly sign an amended order later this week that bans U.S. investment in a list of companies for their connection to China’s defense and surveillance technology sectors.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.35% after data released earlier in the day said the services PMI in May was 46.5, below April’s 49.5.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.11% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.80%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.45%. The country’s retail sales grew 1.1% month-on-month in April according to data released earlier in the day.
In the U.S., Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Wednesday that the Fed should start discussing the timeline for tapering its bond purchases.
“I think it is appropriate for us to slowly, carefully move back on our purchases at the appropriate time… when that is, that is something we need to start discussing,” he said.
Investors remain concerned about a mix of issues including prospective runaway inflation and a gradual scale back of stimulus measures. However, some Fed officials have reiterated the price pressure will be temporary and that policymakers will continue to support businesses’ reopening from the COVID-19. BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK). Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said a prospective outbreak of inflation may be underestimated.
The central bank also indicated in its periodic Beige Book that businesses are facing a labor shortage and rising costs when U.S. economic growth increased at a “moderate pace” from early April to late May.
The Fed also on Wednesday announced plans to slowly sell a portfolio of corporate debt purchased through an emergency lending facility that it launched in 2020 when COVID-19 hit financial markets.
“Portfolio sales will be gradual and orderly, and will aim to minimize the potential for any adverse impact on market functioning by taking into account daily liquidity and trading conditions for exchange-traded funds and corporate bonds,” the Fed said.
“It seems like they’re starting to lay the groundwork for tapering… so I think investors are just in a holding pattern right now,” Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management, told Bloomberg.
On the data front, investors now await U.S. non-farm payrolls data for May to further gauge the economic recovery from COVID-19 and inflation risks."

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) -JBS SA employees started returning to U.S. meat plants on Wednesday, a day after the company's beef operations stopped following a ransomware attack, disrupting meat production in North America and Australia. 
A notorious Russia-linked hacking group is behind the cyberattack against JBS, a source familiar with the matter said.
Brazil's JBS controls about 20% of the slaughtering capacity for U.S. cattle and hogs, so the plants' reopening should prevent a severe supply-chain disruption.
JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, said most operations resumed on Wednesday, ""including all of our pork, poultry and prepared foods facilities around the world and the majority of our beef facilities in the U.S. and Australia.""
""We anticipate operating at close to full capacity across our global operations tomorrow,"" JBS USA Chief Executive Andre Nogueira said in a statement. 
The cyberattack followed one last month by a group with ties to Russia on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, which crippled fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast.
It is the third major attack this year tied to Russia, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday the JBS hack was expected to be discussed at President Joe Biden's mid-June summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""We're not taking any options off the table in terms of how we may respond, but of course there's an internal policy review process to consider that. We're in direct touch with the Russians, as well, to convey our concerns about these reports,"" Psaki added. 
""President Biden certainly thinks that President Putin and the Russian government has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks.""
The Russia-linked cyber gang goes by the name REvil and Sodinokibi, the source said. 
Cybersecurity investigators have said they believe some members of the REvil ransomware team are based in Russia. The prolific ransomware group, which is perhaps best known for attacking an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier named Quanta Computer Inc earlier this year, previously posted in Russian on cyber-crime forums, marketing stolen data. 
In the Quanta Computer case, the hackers sent extortion threats and demanded a payment of $50 million for the company to regain access to its systems.
Over the past few years, ransomware has evolved into a pressing national security issue. A number of gangs, many of them Russian speakers, develop the software that encrypts files and then demand payment in cryptocurrency for keys that allow the owners to decipher and use them again. 
SCRAMBLING FOR BEEF 
With North American operations headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, JBS sells beef and pork under the Swift brand, with retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) carrying its pork loins and tenderloins. 
U.S. beef and pork prices are already rising as China increases imports, animal feed costs rise and slaughterhouses have confronted a labor shortage since COVID-19 outbreaks shut down many U.S. meat plants.
""It's probably going to be pretty tight for the next few days because even though they (JBS) are going to start opening ... who knows how they are going to run,"" said Altin Kalo, economist at Steiner Consulting Group. ""There's a fair amount of people that are scrambling (for beef supplies).""
U.S. meatpackers on Wednesday slaughtered 12.5% fewer cattle than a week earlier and 8% less than a year earlier, although slaughtering was up about 12% from Tuesday, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Plants are expected to return to full capacity in the next couple days, said officials with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union, which represents over 25,000 JBS meatpacking workers.
JBS also owns most of chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Co, which sells organic chicken under the Just Bare brand.
The company's operations in Brazil, Mexico and the UK were not affected by the attack, JBS said. 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) cattle futures rose on Wednesday after tumbling on Tuesday as the JBS plant shutdowns prevented farmers from delivering their cattle to slaughter plants.

The attack drew attention to the concentrated beef sector in the United States, where four companies including JBS slaughter over 80% of fed cattle and shutdowns of slaughtering plants have a severe impact on prices that ranchers are paid for their cattle. 
""The Justice Department needs to take a serious look into the meatpacking industry, and if they cannot, Congress needs to pass reforms that protect a fair and open cattle market,"" U.S. senators led by Republican Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Democrat Tina Smith of Minnesota wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Multiple fiscal stimulus checks distributed since last year have also contributed to the rise in consumer spending.
Due to the success nations’ ongoing vaccination drive, many consumer companies are improving their services and launching new products to capitalize on an expected increase in demand this summer. Overall, consumer stocks are benefitting from the gradual reopening of the economy and rising consumer spending.

(Reuters) - Shares of retail investor favorite AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc nearly doubled in price on Wednesday, extending a breathtaking rally and reinvigorating the meme stock phenomenon that has captivated investors.
The theater chain operator's shares closed up 95.2% at $62.55, a fresh record. At the close, AMC's market value stood at $28.17 billion, more than ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K), as well as fellow meme-stock GameStop (NYSE:GME).
In an apparent nod to the retail investors that have hyped the stock in forums such as Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets, AMC CEO Adam Aron on Wednesday announced an initiative that offered even the smallest shareholder a free large popcorn if they signed up to a regular newsletter.
Among other so-called meme stocks - companies popular with a new generation of social media centric traders on WallStreetBets and other online forums - security software provider BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) and headphone maker Koss Corp rose 31.1% and 68.6%, respectively.
The massive rise in AMC's shares, which are up about 2,850% from just over $2 at the end of last year, is beginning to resemble the wild ride in shares of GameStop earlier this year.
""It's meme stock 2.0.,” said Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
GameStop shares rose more than 1,600% in January, buoyed in part by bearish investors unwinding their bets against the heavily shorted stock in the face of a massive buying surge. 
'GAMMA SQUEEZE'
Some of the upward price move in AMC is likely being driven by market makers buying up stock to hedge their exposure from selling options, an event known as a “gamma squeeze,” analysts said.
""People have learnt what tactics work under these insane circumstances. They are using a very similar play-book,"" Sosnick said. Call options that would pay off if the shares topped $73 by Friday were the most heavily trade AMC options on Wednesday, with about 233,000 contracts changing hands.
With shares approaching that level, market makers who sold these and other similarly bullish contracts were left with no choice but to buy up AMC stock to hedge their own risk, thereby exacerbating the rise in the share price, analysts said.
""Market makers are just chasing the stock,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS.
Wednesday’s near doubling of the stock price will likely test investors that have shorted AMC. Bearish investors were down $5.2 billion for the year and lost nearly $2.8 billion on Wednesday alone, data from S3 showed.
""If you began your short at under $10 and you were sure the stock was overvalued at $10 it makes more sense that it’s over valued at $30 or $70,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, ""at a certain point your losses outweigh your thesis.""
The surge in AMC shares comes a day after hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management LP sold a $230 million stake in the company for a profit shortly after acquiring it, saying the stock was overvalued, according to a source.
Investors appeared unfazed by the sale, which some analysts characterized as an attempt to cash in on the retail-driven surge in its stock.
""There's a retail fanaticism with this stock right now,"" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, who has a sell rating and a $1 price target on AMC stock. ""There's such a disconnect between what the stock's doing and what the fundamentals look like.""
On Twitter and WallStreetBets, some users exhorted one another to hold on to their shares of AMC while others cheered on the rally.
""$amc let’s go again to $100 and beyond,"" wrote Twitter user @Rodolf30592158.
AMC was the most heavily traded name in options on Wednesday, with 4.6 million contracts traded. About $39 billion worth of AMC shares was traded on Wednesday, by far the most of any stock on Wall Street, per Refinitiv data.

The company has been among the biggest gainers from a deluge of interest in so-called meme stocks.
""The (retail trading) party could go on as long as investors could continue co-acting,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. ""The problem is, the higher the price goes, the higher is the temptation to take profit and walk away.""

Oil prices hit the highest level in more than a year on lift from a decision by OPEC and allies to stick to the plan to gradually restore supply, along with the slow pace of nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.
Wall Street's main indexes ended the session mixed after erasing earlier gains near midday trading led by a jump in shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, which nearly doubled in price on Wednesday.
This breathtaking rally saw the theater chain operator's shares closed up 95.2% at $62.55, a fresh record, which affected a group of stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.
This comes despite wary investors remaining unconvinced by central bank assurances that the current inflation upsurge is transitory.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.28% and MSCI's gauge of stocks, which tracks shares in 50 countries, gained 0.09%.
Markets are being driven less by fundamentals than at any time in recent memory, said Howard Fischer, a partner with law firm Moses & Singer.
""As the ""meme stock"" frenzy continues, the apparent disconnect between asset values and asset prices continues to widen. Predictions that prices and inherent value will eventually converge have, so far, proven baseless.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to unwind the corporate bond holdings it acquired last year through an emergency lending facility launched to calm credit markets at the height of the pandemic, the central bank announced on Wednesday. 
Central bank officials said in its Beige Book report released earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. recovery accelerated in recent weeks even as a long list of supply chain troubles, hiring difficulties, and rising prices cascaded through the country.
This comes after a strong expansion in European and U.S. factory activity in May had lifted world shares to record highs on Tuesday.
A weekly unemployment report and May private payrolls data on Thursday will be followed by monthly jobs numbers on Friday, with investors looking for signs of an economic rebound and rising inflation.
Yet ahead of Friday's crucial U.S. jobs data, traders eagerly aim to assess what the increasing evidence of a faster-than-expected economic recovery would mean for central bank policy in Europe and the United States.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.07 points, or 0.07%, to 34,600.38, the S&P 500 gained 6.08 points, or 0.14%, to 4,208.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.85 points, or 0.14%, to 13,756.33.
Investors already are stuck in the summer doldrums, with markets struggling to find direction as much of the good economic news is priced in, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Inflation and job growth will continue to be debated, he said.
""With the Fed and many bond market investors confident that price increases will remain temporary ... others will cast a more skeptical eye on the conversation.""
Brent rose $1.1, or 1.6%, to settle at $71.35 a barrel. It reached $71.48 a barrel, its highest since January 2020.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $1.11, or 1.6%, to settle at $68.83 a barrel. It hit $69.00 during the session, its highest since October 2018. 
Crude oil inventories fell last week while fuel stockpiles rose, according to two market sources, citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Wednesday.

While broader stock markets remain close to record highs, the momentum of earlier in the year has ebbed as investors begin to worry a stronger-than-expected rebound from COVID-19 means higher inflation and sooner-than-expected monetary policy tightening.
Economies are recovering much faster than anticipated - data on Wednesday showed Australia's economy racing ahead last quarter as consumers and businesses spent with abandon, lifting output back above where it was last year before the pandemic.
SHRUGGING OFF INFLATION DATA
While investors have built sizable short positions against the U.S. dollar more broadly, they are worried over a potential hawkish tone from the Fed at its meeting later in June, and traders are reluctant to send the greenback much lower.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 1.5892%, from 1.615%.
Euro zone yields have largely shrugged off Tuesday's data showing euro zone inflation rose to 2% in May - a sign that markets were confident the European Central Bank would not decide to slow the pace of its bond buys when it meets on June 10.
""Keep a close eye on the U.S. 10-year treasury note – as long as rates stay safely below 2% percent, then relative calm should reign in the stock markets, but a sharp rise in rates could cause a more violent rotation out of tech and communication services and into financials and materials,"" added Independent Advisor Alliance's Zaccarelli.

But Patrick Leary, who serves as the chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital in Minneapolis, said he sees a great deal of uncertainty about inflation.
""The Fed keeps saying that inflation will be transitory, and, for now, markets are comfortable with that narrative,"" said Leary, adding that he sees the central bank as ""intentionally trying to overheat the economy to drive employment lower. Unfortunately, this is also going to lead to inflation.""

According to the Business Research Company, the global hardware market is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR over the next four years. So, we think both DELL and LOGI should benefit from the industry tailwinds.

This change in character is quite positive for the index as it’s now finally gaining ground on the S&P-500, and the best performance for the GDX comes when it’s not only trending higher above its 200-day moving average but when it’s also outperforming the S&P-500. Some investors might think that they’ve missed the move with the GDX up 25% off its lows, but while some names are fairly priced, several others are still trading at very reasonable valuations.

Given this backdrop, lesser-known defense companies L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), Textron (TXT) and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), which have direct ties with the U.S Defense Department, should deliver solid returns. So, let’s discuss these names.The United States’ fraught relationships with China and Russia have driven its rising investments in its defense sector. President Biden recently requested $753 billion for national security funding for his fiscal 2022 budget (which begins October 1, 2021). The amount is 1.6% higher than the amount spent in the previous year. Of the requested amount, $715 billion is earmarked for the Department of Defense.
With China perceived to be the biggest threat given the size of the nation's economy and the country's air drills around neighboring countries, Biden aims to boost the defense budget by 16% to $769 billion. Furthermore, the United States has also played a major role in defusing the Israel-Palestine conflict, through cash and defense equipment funding support.
Thus, the aerospace and defense industry is likely to grow substantially in the coming months. Given this backdrop, the following lesser-known companies with direct ties with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army and Navy should grow significantly: L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency popular among retail investors, surged on Wednesday, benefiting from news that digital asset exchange Coinbase will make the crypto unit available to its users on its trading platform.
Coinbase said on Tuesday it will immediately accept inbound transfers of dogecoin Coinbase Pro, a trading venue for professional traders.
Dogecoin rose 31% on Wednesday to $0.41 in the wake of the Coinbase news. That pushed the cryptocurrency's market capitalization to $54 billion, making it the sixth-largest token, according to data and market tracker CoinGecko.com.
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said dogecoin was nowhere near the level seen leading up to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief Elon Musk's appearance last month on Saturday Night Live, a U.S. comedy sketch TV show.
But this ""dogecoin bounce comes during a period where the cryptoverse is seeing a consolidation of positions, so we should not be surprised if this recent surge fizzles or if it makes another attempt at the moon,"" he added.
Dogecoin lost more than a third of its price after Musk, a big supporter of the currency, called it a ""hustle"" during his guest-host spot on the Saturday Night Live.

The token's rise came during a surge in online trading of stocks and crypto by retail investors, stuck at home with extra cash because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coin has not seen much growth in usage for payments or in commerce.
A boom in usage of online trading apps like Robinhood also fueled the social-media driven rally in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock this year, which pitted retail investors against hedge funds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co is halfway through a campaign to open 400 new bank branches and is closing in on being the first U.S. bank to have a brick and mortar presence in every state except Alaska and Hawaii, a bank executive said on Wednesday.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is already the largest American bank by assets, providing loans, credit cards, savings accounts and other services to nearly half of all U.S. households. 
In 2018, the bank said it would open 400 branches in new markets to try to get more business from existing clients, said head of Chase branch expansion Dan Deegan. 
""In many of the cities we've gone to, the other lines of businesses at JPM had been here for 20 years,"" Deegan told Reuters from outside Boston, where he attended the opening of the 200th new branch in the initiative. ""JPM Chase isn't new to Boston. It's just that we didn't have branches here.""
JPMorgan estimates that it has 1.3 million credit card customers in the Boston area. It hopes some of them will open checking and other Chase accounts. 
JPMorgan has opened branches in 16 new states since October 2018, and it expects to have branches in 48 of the 50 U.S. states by the end of summer. 

The strategy is to open in major metropolitan areas in new states, like Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Portland, Maine.
The initiative will result in the hiring of around 3,000 bank staffers for jobs paying at least $16 per hour, a bank spokeswoman said. Roughly 50% of those hired are women, and most employees live where the branch is located.

So, for now, many people continue to focus on improving their living spaces, including the upgrade of home appliances. Rising disposable income has put more consumers in a position to now purchase smart appliances. We think this trend bodes well for Whirlpool (WHR) and Conn (CONN). Let’s discuss.The dramatic pandemic-induced shift in lifestyles and consumer preferences has led to much greater home improvement activity by people. Home improvement projects to re-organize and repurpose existing living spaces has now become de rigueur. And even though more than 50% American adults are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, people are still spending more time indoors and are redecorating their spaces according to their needs.
This is driving a substantial surge in demand for home appliances. In fact, the global home appliance market size is expected to grow at a 6.1% CAGR over the next five years to hit $932.4 million by the end of 2026.
Rising disposable income and rapid urbanization should further accelerate the growth of the home appliance industry. As consumers continue to choose home appliances that are equipped with advanced technological features and modern looks, we think companies such as Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) and Conn's, Inc. (NASDAQ:CONN), which are investing heavily in developing innovative products, are uniquely positioned to benefit. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

Firms should not abuse the so-called piling-on initiative, launched in 2018, by pressing the Justice Department for no action after seeking deals with other enforcement authorities, said Nicholas McQuaid, acting assistant attorney general for the agency's criminal division. 
""That is not the sort of approach that the 'piling on' policy is designed to encourage, and it is not the sort of approach that will find a receptive audience at the Department,"" Nicholas McQuaid said in remarks at an anti-corruption event.
The warning from a top leader at the Justice Department comes amid U.S. President Joe Biden's push for a broad-reaching anti-corruption agenda. 

Companies need to make ""good faith"" efforts to coordinate with Justice Department officials if they want credit for resolving other investigations, McQuaid said after highlighting the increased collaboration between the agency and foreign governments.
""We cannot and will not restrict the scope of our enforcement actions in response to tactically front-loaded resolutions,"" he said.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 03:42PM ET</span>",Analysis: Hacks force Biden into more aggressive stance on Russia,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A ransomware attack on JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, by a criminal group likely based in Russia has strengthened the Biden administration's resolve to hold Moscow responsible for costly cyber assaults - even if they are not directly linked to the Kremlin.
U.S. President Joe Biden has launched a review of the threat posed by ransomware attacks and he will discuss the issue of harboring such hackers with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month, the White House said on Wednesday.
""President Biden certainly thinks that President Putin and the Russian government has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.
The JBS hack is the third major cyberattack linked to hackers from Russia since Biden took office in January, following attacks aimed at Colonial Pipeline Co and software made by SolarWinds Corp. JBS is a Brazilian company with extensive U.S. operations.
""Biden has indicated his willingness to hold Russia accountable in some way for the pipeline attack, even though it was carried out by a criminal organization,"" said Tom Bossert, a top homeland security adviser to former President Donald Trump. ""That's a big leap forward."" 
The White House plans to use a June 16 summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials said. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say. 
Biden has launched a review of the threat posed by ransomware attacks and he will discuss the issue of harboring such hackers with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month, the White House said on Wednesday.
Russia joined U.N. member states in endorsing a March report https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Final-report-A-AC.290-2021-CRP.2.pdf agreeing to voluntary norms around cyber crime, including a pledge to not conduct or knowingly support cyberattacks in violation of international law that intentionally damage or impairs critical infrastructure. 
Biden, who has repeatedly taken aim at Russia for its jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and a military buildup near Ukraine, will urge NATO allies, EU leaders and the Group of Seven rich countries to back a strong, unified stance on Russia at separate summits before he meets Putin, U.S. officials say.
Consensus is growing among Western allies that stronger action is needed, they say.
The White House said Tuesday it was engaging directly with the Russian government. The statement marks a clear shift toward a new and more assertive U.S. policy against Russia on hacking, say former and current U.S. security officials and analysts. 
The White House response came after Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) and other Republicans criticized the Biden administration for a ""weak"" response to last month's ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, by DarkSide, a group with ties to Russia.
U.S. officials said they sprang into action after both incidents. The White House also started a review of ransomware attacks, including a push to work with allies to ""hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable.""
James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said people who brief Biden had told him they expect strong language from Biden at the meeting.
""Biden is tough. He's going to tell Putin, 'This is enough. You've got to stop or we'll do something back,'"" Lewis said. 
DISABLING HACKER INFRASTRUCTURE 
The U.S. intelligence and military community has long had the capability to damage computer servers used by private hackers in other countries, but largely refrained, given diplomatic concerns about the consequences. 
The JBS hack could signal a turning point. 
Lewis said a surge in ransomware attacks had overshadowed diplomatic concerns in recent months. 
""The Russians don't see any reason to stop. Until we do something, this is going to keep happening,"" he said. Biden's experts are working on a new doctrine. 

Bossert said Russian-based hackers could well increase their attacks on U.S. companies in response to any foreign policy decisions taken at the upcoming G7, NATO and EU summits. That would give the United States more reasons to take down the infrastructure used to launch such attacks.
""The U.S. government should be prepared to use its capabilities to directly take down the infrastructure that would be used - whether belonging to a government or a proxy group - should cyber attacks escalate,"" he said.

Two leaders in this space – PEP and COKE – have been ramping up their production to capitalize on the summer trend.

After years of negotiations over complex arrangements deployed by big companies, G7 finance ministers meeting in Britain on Friday are expected to declare their support for a global accord to address billions of dollars in lost tax revenue. [L2N2NI198]
This push is backed by some large investors, often state-run, who are scrutinising tax bills as well as profits.
""It's not about paying more tax, it's about paying the right amount of tax. We want companies to not engage in practices through transactions and legal structures which contribute to tax evasion,"" Kiran Aziz, sustainability analyst at Norway's KLP which manages $80 billion in pension assets, said. 
Research by the charity ActionAid International estimates that taxing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ""fairly"" on their 2020 profits could potentially generate $32 billion for G20 countries, while a 2018 academic study found global state coffers lose out on $200 billion a year.
The G7 goal is to set rules on taxing cross-border digital activities as well as a minimum tax rate above the level paid if companies channel profits via a low-tax country such as Ireland with its 12.5% corporate levy.
The United States has mooted a 15% rate, down from its original proposal of 21%. [L1N2M71D3] [L8N2MM7I6]
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which has set the pace on many environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues, recently fired a public salvo over what its CEO said was ""aggressive tax planning"" and lack of transparency on tax by selling stakes in seven companies, which it did not name.
Many funds interviewed by Reuters said they are escalating talks with companies and, if necessary, will dump shares.
KLP has quizzed around 100 companies, including Silicon Valley giants, joining hands with other Nordic investors.
""We believe taxes should be paid where actual economic value is generated,"" Aziz said of so-called ""profit-shifting"" whereby companies book income from sources like royalties, software or patents, not where it was earned but where tax rates are lower.
While KLP for now sees engagement as more effective than dropping investments outright, some have already gone that far.
Peter Rutter, head of equities at the 150 billion pound ($213 billion) Royal London Asset Management said he had sold or skipped buying shares in some companies on the basis of tax arrangements - often at the behest of his pension clients. 
""Corporates doing the right thing by way of taxation is a question we are increasingly getting,"" Rutter said. 
'KNOW THE RISK'
Tax has typically played second-fiddle to issues such as climate, pollution and labour rights for investors, while most ESG ratings providers do not assess a company's tax planning while calculating scores. 
Many asset managers enjoy lower tax rates by domiciling funds in countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg.
However, MSCI included tax transparency last November and ESG ratings can be affected if for example tax bills differ significantly from what a company would have paid in its country of operation, its managing director Laura Nishikawa said.
""We are not saying 'divest now' but (urging clients) to be an informed investor. You need to know the risk and that's a fiduciary duty too,"" she added.
Many investors are preparing to investigate tax policies more thoroughly, regardless of when rules are tightened.
Dutch asset manager APG is hiring staff and planning to buy specialist data after its main client, pension fund ABP, established a tax and investment policy, senior corporate governance specialist Alex Williams (NYSE:WMB) said. 
Like KLP, APG has been grilling companies about their tax policies, Williams said. The fund, which manages almost 600 billion euros, recently managed to dissuade the new management of one investee firm from using tax havens. 
OCEANS APART?
Investor pressure over tax has largely emanated from Europe, particularly ESG-focused Scandinavia, with an apparent cultural difference among shareholders based in the United States.
U.S. retirement funds CalPERS, CalSTRS and Texas TRS all declined to comment, but an official at one large U.S. asset manager said tax is ""not an investor issue"" and should ""be led by those who ultimately impose the taxes"".
Tech companies have long defended their tax practices. Google, whose European headquarters is in the Irish capital Dublin, says it pays taxes where it is required to do so by law. 
Sudhir Roc-Sennet, U.S.-based head of ESG at Vontobel Asset Management, while backing moves to close tax-rate gaps, argues against demonising companies for legally using loopholes.
""It does not make sense for pensioners of the future to reduce their savings pot by asking companies to pay more tax,"" Roc-Sennet said.
""Should corporates pay a higher tax rate just because it's ethical? I don't think so. As investors, we think companies should operate to the best interest of their shareholders as long as they stay within the legal framework,"" he added
While that view remains widespread, accountants KPMG and BDO have warned clients of the risk to reputations and returns should tax rules be tightened.
One thing investors do agree on is that only coordinated action will stop companies using lower tax jurisdictions.

""In the absence of regulation it will be difficult to get companies to move. Turkeys are not going to vote for Christmas,"" Fred Kooij, chief investment officer at Tribe Capital, a boutique impact investment firm, said.

In a letter addressed to AbbVie's chief executive officer, Richard Gonzalez, on Wednesday, Wyden noted that the company has consistently reported a net loss in the United States and net income overseas, despite being headquartered in the country. 
AbbVie is already under scrutiny for its drug pricing practices, which U.S. lawmakers questioned last month, accusing the company of profiting from Americans by repeatedly raising U.S. prices on its widely-used rheumatoid arthritis drug, Humira, while cutting prices abroad.
Wyden said in the letter that AbbVie reported a domestic pretax loss of $4.5 billion last year, while reporting a foreign pretax profit of $7.9 billion.
""It appears that AbbVie shifts profits offshore while reporting a domestic loss in the United States to avoid paying U.S. corporate income taxes, and that the current U.S. international tax system seems to encourage that,"" the letter said. 
Among other things, Wyden asked Gonzalez to explain how the provisions of the 2017 tax law allowed AbbVie to reduce its effective tax rate to an average of just 9.5% for tax years 2018 to 2020, from about 20% prior to the law. 

Abbvie did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump passed a law in 2017 that cut the overall corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, and allowed income from overseas to be taxed at about half that rate.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 struggled for direction Wednesday, as energy continued to rack up gains, but a stumble in materials and consumer stocks kept gains in check ahead of the jobs numbers due later this week.  
The S&P 500 was up 0.02%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.06%, or 22 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.14%.
Energy jumped nearly 2%, underpinned by rising oil prices as investors bet on increasing demand over the summer offsetting major oil producer plans to gradually lift production.
Sentiment on oil prices has also been supported by growing expectations Iranian supply to market will be delayed because of talks over a nuclear deal.
""The return of Iranian barrels does not appear to be an imminent issue for the oil market with the fifth round of nuclear negotiations in Vienna failing to produce a major diplomatic breakthrough,"" RBC said in a note Tuesday.
Tech made modest gains as semiconductor and megacap tech stocks were mostly higher.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), were higher, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were below the flatline.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose more than 3%, helping the broader iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) remain above the flatline.
Stay at home stocks were mixed as Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) slipped despite reporting blow out quarterly results.  
""Zoom reported another strong showing in 1QFY22 to start the year…,"" Oppenheimer said. ""Looking ahead, our attention turns to the pace of G2K penetration, new product adoption, and churn for customers with fewer than ten employees.""
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) were mixed. 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), meanwhile, fell nearly 1% despite beating first-quarter expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
Materials were in the red, keeping the broader market in check, paced by a decline in  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE),  Packaging Corp  of America (NYSE:PKG) and Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).
As the week progresses, investor attention will turn to the monthly jobs report for May due Friday. Economists forecast that 650,000 jobs were created in May. 
Ahead of the jobs report, the Fed's beige book highlighted the ongoing labor supply shortage and faster pace of inflation, and suggested both trends are set to continue in the months ahead.   
Reddit-favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) added to gains from a day earlier, doubling in price intraday after launching a communication services, Investor Connect, to take advantage of its expanding retail shareholder base.
Other so-called meme stocks were also in the ascendency. GameStop (NYSE:GME) was up 12% and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was were up 31%.
The U.S.-China trade tensions, meanwhile, were in focus amid reports that President Biden is set to amend former president Trump's blacklist of China stocks to target strategic industries. In May, the Treasury Department delayed a ban on new U.S. investments in certain Chinese companies by two weeks to June 11 from May 27. "
765,By StockNews,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>","2 Auto Manufacturing Stocks to Buy in June, 2 to Avoid","As the global economy gradually gets back on track, sales of commercial and personal vehicles are expected to soar. However, given that the auto industry is currently hamstrung by a global semiconductor chip shortage, automakers have been forced to reduce production. While financially sound automakers Honda Motor (HMC) and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) are uniquely positioned to overcome this challenge and sail through the supply-chain blip, companies like Nio (NYSE:NIO) and GreenPower Motor (GP), with weak fundamentals and growth prospects, will have a harder time doing so and, as such, we think are best avoided now.Auto sales are expected to get a significant boost in the coming months as people continue to avoid public transportation. In fact, optimism surrounding the quick rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the strength of the economic rebound should lead to a substantial surge in commercial fleet sales. Also, the continued recovery of the new light-vehicle market has also enhanced the growth prospects of the automotive industry.
However, with the demand for semiconductors outstripping the supply, the automobile industry is struggling to increase production. Given inefficient supply chains, even if the industry could get chips to move upstream more quickly, it could take a while for the manufacturers to benefit and increase production and deliver thy of their product. This situation has compelled a few automakers to cut production and even close plants.
Although Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC) and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY) are well positioned to navigate these challenges and capitalize on the industry tailwinds, we think  NIO Inc . (NIO) and GreenPower Motor Company Inc. (GP) are suffering from the global chip shortage and could struggle to stay afloat in the near-term.

More and more people will be outside playing sports and swimming, especially with most states dropping mask mandates. That's why David Cohne is recommending  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL), and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS).With the official start date of summer fast approaching, it's time for investors to consider which stocks will stand to benefit from the warmer weather. As most states are returning to normal and lifting mask mandates, the demand for outdoor activities is expected to skyrocket this summer. That means more outdoor sports, more swimming, and generally more fun. 
To determine which stocks will benefit the most and likely see an increase in their stock prices, I took a two-pronged approach. First, I made a list of companies that I believed stand to benefit. These companies include athletic and sporting goods stores, pool supply companies, and outdoor recreation companies. Then I ran each company through the POWR Ratings system to make sure they were rated a Buy or Strong Buy.
This way, I know that these companies passed through all of the POWR Ratings' stringent factors, indicating that they were fundamentally strong and had the potential for price appreciation. That is why I'm recommending Foot Locker, Inc. (FL), Pool Corporation (POOL), and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (DKS) for this summer.

Amid this scenario, we think it could be wise to avoid shares of travel-related companies  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL), Hyatt (H), and Hawaiian (HA) based on their weak financials and unfavorable growth prospects. Read on.The travel industry had a major setback last year as leisure and business travel practically came to a halt and most hotels closed. But as the COVID-19 vaccines developed by companies such as  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna , Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA, it was expected that the travel industry's prospects would soon improve. However, despite more than 50% of American adults now fully vaccinated, the travel industry has yet to see sufficient demand to return to profitability.
The key reason behind consumers’ avoidance of international travel is that several parts of the world are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Also, the vaccine hesitancy of many Americans is creating a challenge for people that may want to travel domestically. Furthermore, several tourist destinations and travel-related companies have increased their charges to stay solvent amid the difficult market situation. The increased charges are hardly an inducement to lure more travelers.
Given this backdrop, we think travel-related companies Royal Caribbean Group (RCL), Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H), and  Hawaiian Holdings , Inc. (NASDAQ:HA) are unfavorably positioned going into the summer because of their weak financials. So, we think it’s wise to avoid their shares now.

Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back to office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank said in March it plans to start bringing workers back to its offices after Labor Day due to the increasing availability of vaccines. The company is evaluating whether to allow certain businesses or functional subgroups in the U.S. to return to the workplace before Labor Day.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank is planning to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase.
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
CEO Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
UNITED KINGDOM:
 Barclays  (LON:BARC)
CEO Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model, and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. 
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC)
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40% as it moves to a hybrid working model for most employees. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) 
Britain's biggest domestic bank is hoping to resume office-based trials and experiments with around 5,000 of its staff this summer, once government restrictions allow. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
NatWest 
CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) 
Germany's largest lender told its investment bankers in the U.S. that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.
SWITZERLAND
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
Credit Suisse in July 2020 launched a global program evaluating various work-from-home options, which are expected to shape its post-pandemic working models. It has been monitoring and adapting work arrangements since launching work-from-home globally in March 2020, taking into account local guidelines.
UBS

UBS Chairman Axel Weber in May said flexibility would remain part of work arrangements at Switzerland's biggest bank going forward, where roles allow. Return to office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines.

Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), also said during an online event that airlines and passengers should be allowed to assess travel risks based on increasingly abundant health data.
The former British Airways head said he was confident Europe could begin to return to normal travel in the second half of the year as vaccination rates rise.
""With sensible testing and screening methods in place we can safely open our borders to regain the freedom that has been taken from us,"" he said.
Ministers and officials from G7 countries are meeting in London on June 4-5 ahead of a leaders' summit next week.
Airlines weakened by 15 months of lockdowns are facing a slower than expected recovery, as lingering travel restrictions overshadow the peak northern summer season. Concern over the spread of more transmissible coronavirus variants also threatens to slow reopening plans.
IATA drew on UK testing data that showed a low incidence of COVID-19 in arriving passengers, during the joint presentation with Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) representatives, who demonstrated digital travel risk models.
""These data tell us we can do better,"" Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the National Health Service - or 1.46% excluding higher-risk ""red list"" countries.
Walsh also singled out Greece, which has largely reopened to foreign tourists, for its use of testing data and artificial intelligence to monitor risk in real time.
""We're seeing more and more countries questioning whether they have the appropriate measures in place,"" he said.
But David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, sounded a note of caution.

""What's really set off governments is the variants, and the fear they will escape the protection offered by vaccines,"" he said during the same event.
""No matter what you show in terms of models they're still going to be concerned about the variants.""

The portfolio will be called the Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF and will invest in the consumer, energy, financial services, healthcare, technologies and utilities sectors, among others, according to a May 28 regulatory filing.
It ""seeks to encourage transformational change at the public companies within its portfolio through the application of proxy voting guidelines,"" the filing said.
There are no details in the filing on the fees the fund plans to charge, how much money it may try to raise or when the Securities and Exchange Commission may make a decision on approving the planned new offering.
Engine No. 1 was founded late last year with roughly $250 million in assets and made an enormous splash when it announced a $40 million investment in Exxon and plans to force the oil giant to improve its financial performance and focus more on clean energy by adding new directors to the board.
Last week, Exxon shareholders elected at least two of Engine No. 1's nominees, with the counting not yet complete.
All along, investors expected Engine No. 1 soon to try to raise fresh cash from institutional and retail clients.
Planning for the ETF was set in motion long before last week's win, according to previous regulatory filings. 
The new portfolio will be managed by Molly Landes, who joined Engine No. 1 in March after having worked for BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, since 2011, the filing says.

Investors have plowed trillions into exchange traded funds over the last decade, according to Morningstar, attracted by their lower costs.
Engine No. 1's planned ETF was first reported by Bloomberg.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell more than 3% Wednesday, bearing the brunt of two adverse developments.
First was its recall of nearly 6,000 vehicles over concerns that their brake caliper bolts might loosen, which could result in a loss of tire pressure.
The recall covers certain 2019 to 2021 Model 3 vehicles and 2020 to 2021 Model Y vehicles, Reuters said.
Tesla's filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had no reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue and that the company will inspect and tighten, or replace, the caliper bolts as necessary.
In the other development, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the SEC told off Tesla for CEO Elon Musk’s ""use of Twitter."" The agency said Musk’s tweets have violated the terms of the settlement agreement that required Musk to get his tweets preapproved by company lawyers.
Musk is prolific with his tweets and has more than 56.3 million followers on the social media platform. His Twitter posts can wildly move prices of tradeable assets, from those of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) and Dogecoin DOGE/USD to listed companies like Samsung (KS:005930) Publishing (KS:068290).
The battle with the SEC dates to 2018, when Musk would often comment on the Tesla share price, causing wild fluctuations. In a settlement reached with the regulator, Musk stepped down as the carmaker’s chairman and was replaced by incumbent Robyn M. Denholm.
But the compulsive tweeter in Musk remained undeterred. It may not entirely be Musk’s doing that people look out for his tweets to place their bets on asset prices and look for directions on various topics but given that he has a disproportionate influence on his social media followers, SEC stepped in again.

CAIRO (Reuters) -Egyptian authorities have presented an amended invitation for tobacco companies to bid for a licence to manufacture cigarettes, a document seen by Reuters showed, after four firms complained the terms were too narrow. 
The license could end a decades-old monopoly by the state-controlled Eastern Company which has a 70% market share.
The cigarette industry contributes more than 60 billion Egyptian pounds ($3.8 billion) to government coffers yearly, according tobacco firms. 
Under the new terms, sent to tobacco companies on June 1, the winning bidder should agree to produce 1 billion cigarettes per year instead of 15 billion per year.

Authorities also scrapped a rule saying they would not be offering any other licenses after the tender for a decade, the updated document from Egypt's Industrial Development Authority showed. 
The deadline to submit offers in the amended tender is Aug. 1. In March, the Industrial Development Authority invited companies to bid for a licence. Four firms - Nakhla Tobacco Co, Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) and Al-Mansour International Distribution Co - complained that the winner would have an unfair advantage over its competitors. Shortly afterwards, the tender was postponed.

LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund missed out on $125.8 billion in potential returns over a three year period by investing in oil and gas rather than green stocks, according to research from Global SWF, an industry data specialist.
The results showed oil and gas equities held by the $1.3 trillion sovereign fund, the world's largest, lost 11% over the three-years to Dec. 31, 2020, while its green stock holdings earned a return of 316%.
That equates to an opportunity cost of $125.8 billion, according to the analysis by Global SWF and non-governmental organisation Framtiden of the 198 so-called black stocks and 91 green stocks the fund held as of Dec. 31, 2020.
Norges Bank Investment Management's (NBIM) balance sheet would be 10% larger today if the fund had fully divested from oil and gas stocks and reinvested the money into renewables in Nov. 2017, the research found.
""Financial profitability has stopped and must stop being an excuse for not investing in green energy,"" Global SWF wrote in a report released this week.
""There is no reason for NBIM not to divest from its (still very significant) portfolio of fossil fuels stocks and use the proceeds to invest more in companies engaged in renewable energy, both listed and private.""
NBIM, which invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fund in 2017 proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, an announcement that sent energy stocks worldwide lower at the time. 
Although it cited a reduction in the exposure of the country's wealth to the risk of a permanent drop in oil prices, environmental campaigners seized on it as example of an investor turning away from the oil industry. The proposal would have affected some 6% of the fund's equity holdings for a then-value of $37 billion. 
It was rejected by the Norwegian finance ministry which instead put forward a different plan, limited to removing only dedicated oil and gas explorers and producers from the fund's benchmark index. 

Parliament voted in 2019 in favour of that plan, which affected 1.2% of the fund's overall equity holdings. 
Many lawmakers were concerned that Norway would be perceived at not having faith in the future of its biggest industry, including Equinor, the oil firm that is majority-owned by the Norwegian state.

GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) are two established companies that offer dividend yields of more than 5%. So, it could be wise to scoop up their shares now.As the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns over rising inflation driven by increasing consumer spending are causing significant volatility in the stock market. President Biden’s proposed global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% is also being viewed skeptically by some investors.
Against this backdrop, investors are turning to dividend yielding stocks to hedge their portfolios against market volatility by ensuring a steady stream of income. Investors’ interest in the dividend stocks is evident in SPDR S&P Dividend ETF’s (SDY) 18.7% returns over the past six months.
So, it could now be wise to scoop up the shares of GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) and Mobile TeleSystems Public Joint Stock Company (MBT) based on their fundamental strength and attractive dividends. Their current dividend payouts yield more than 5%.

Patrick Ryan analyzes two auto parts stocks - Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) and Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) - and explains which one is the better pick.
Auto parts stocks are in the spotlight especially with rising used car prices amid production disruptions. As a result, more people will be repairing their old cars rather than buying new ones. Another catalyst is that as more people drive, they will have to repair their cars more.

These trends are likely to persist until 2022 which means the sector should continue to outperform.

However, challenges related to supply-chains, higher prices for solar cell components, and elevated freight costs make the industry’s near-term prospects look subdued at best. Thus, we think shares of financially weak solar companies SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), and VivoPower (VVPR) are best avoided now. Read on.Favorable government policies to encourage transitions to clean energy, declining installation costs and a federal residential solar energy tax credit should drive the growth of the solar industry over the long term. With most Western governments aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035, investors have been betting on the solar industry’s long-term growth. This is evidenced by the Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF’s (TAN) 139.4% returns over the past year, versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 38.6% gains.
However, with most economies currently focusing on emerging from a pandemic-led recession, the solar industry is likely to remain subdued in the near term. Challenges related to supply-chain, higher prices for components such as glass, steel and aluminum, and elevated freight costs add to the concerns. Indeed, the global smart solar market is expected to grow only slightly over the next seven years.
Consequently, prominent solar stocks SunPower Corporation (SPWR), JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (JKS), and VivoPower International PLC (VVPR) are expected to remain under pressure in the near term due to their weak financials. So, they are best avoided now.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) lobby group on Wednesday backed the European Union's antitrust case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which alleges it distorts competition in the music streaming market.
The European Commission filed its first antitrust charges against Apple in April following an initial complaint by the iPhone maker's rival Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
Apple has rejected the EU charges, saying that its App Store enabled Spotify to become the world's largest music subscription service. It has been given 12 weeks to respond to the charges.

BEUC said it has been allowed to join as an interested third party in the antitrust regulator's case, which could lead to a hefty fine of as much as 10% of Apple's global turnover and force a change to its business practices.
""We look forward to working with the Commission to ensure that Europe's consumers have access to a full range of music streaming services without their choices being unfairly restricted or prices being artificially inflated,"" BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said in a statement.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) shares rose more than 5% Wednesday after a report in The Wall Street Journal said Elliott Management has taken more than 10% stake in the cloud computing company, worth over $100 million.
Elliott is an activist hedge fund that is known for either changing managements or effecting major changes in their strategies for a possible turnaround.
According to WSJ, Elliott has told Dropbox it is the company’s largest shareholder after Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston.
Dropbox, a cloud-computing company with a market value of over $11 billion, went public in March 2018 and has been trading below its IPO price for most of that time. Its modest valuation compared with those of other cloud companies such as Salesforce.com and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has made it a subject of persistent takeover speculation.
The market talk intensified after Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) agreed to buy Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) last year for $27.7 billion. In a deal announced Tuesday, Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) agreed to sell itself to a pair of private-equity firms, namely Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and KKR (NYSE:KKR).

(Reuters) - While traders were flocking to GameStop (NYSE:GME) earlier this year, the stock was also capturing the imagination of U.S. teenagers, according to a survey from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
A third of teens say they are learning financial lessons from the internet and social media, according to the survey of 13 to 17 year olds and parents of teenagers. 
And almost half of the teens say they are more interested in investing thanks to GameStop, whose shares have surged due to its popularity among members of online investor forums.
The survey follows Fidelity Investments' launch earlier this month of a commission-free brokerage account for 13- to 17-year-olds that allows stock trading on a mobile app, as it looks to attract the next generation of investors.
The survey of 318 teens and 304 parents of teens conducted between April 20 and May 3, found that while 57% of teens say they are learning about finances from their parents and 47% say they are learning from school, 35% cite social media and 34% cite websites. 
But parents had a different take with only 12% saying their teens use social media for financial education. 
About 45% of teens said ""the GameStop social media situation"" boosted their interest in investing with 53% of boys claiming increased interest and 40% of teen girls, according to Wells Fargo.
As for cryptocurrency, 50% of parents say their teen knows more about bitcoin than them. However, while 58% of teen boys say they know more about bitcoin than their parents, only 33% of teen girls claimed to be more knowledgeable. 

Still actual investing rates seemed much smaller with 17% of parents saying they opened custodial accounts to invest on their teen’s behalf. 
About 13% encouraged their teen to play a simulated stock game. About 7% gave their teen stocks for educational purposes. However, only 20% of teens say their parents engaged with them on these activities, Wells said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies posted inflows last week after hitting record outflows the previous two, as investors took advantage of price declines in the market, data from digital currency manager CoinShares showed late Tuesday.
Inflows into crypto investment products and funds totaled $74 million last week. That followed record outflows of $151 million the previous two weeks, representing 0.3% of assets under management.
Bitcoin products continued to see outflows last week of about $4 million, CoinShares data showed. This brings the total outflow over the last three weeks to $246 million. For the year, however, bitcoin still showed inflows of $4.4 billion.
The world's most popular currency rose 3% last week and was last up 3.8% at $38,104.
Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and the token used for the Ethereum blockchain, showed inflows of $47 million, with total inflows totaling $973 million.
Its price was up 13% last week, but dropped 41% the week before.
Investment product flows also showed that altcoins, or the non-bitcoin, non-ether tokens, remained popular, with inflows into Cardano and Polkadot and Ripple.

Grayscale remains the largest digital currency manager at $33.6 billion, but their assets under management were down from $47.3 billion two weeks ago.
CoinShares, the second-biggest and largest European digital asset manager, oversaw about $3.9 billion in assets as of last week, down from about $6 billion two weeks ago.

793,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>","Hedge Funds Boost Short Bets, Escalating Retail-Trader Showdown","(Bloomberg) -- Facing another push from day traders targeting the most-shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc., hedge funds aren’t backing down this time.
Professional speculators, who were forced to retreat in late January amid a similar assault, are instead boosting their bearish wagers. Their short positions against single shares climbed for a ninth straight week, reaching an almost one-year high relative to the overall equity holdings, according to prime-broker data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The dynamic contrasts with four months ago, when a rally in meme stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). compelled hedge funds to quickly slash their short exposure to the lowest in five years. Goldman Sachs attributes the opposite reaction to the fact that the current carnage has yet to cause widespread pain for the industry.
Consider a basket of the 50 most-shorted stocks tracked by Goldman. While AMC has quadrupled this quarter in a blow to short sellers, roughly half of the basket’s members are down. The group is up 2.4% in the span, trailing an advance of 6% for the S&P 500. That means gains for any trade that’s short individual companies and long the broader market.
“This confirms that managers have felt more comfortable utilizing single names to express directional views or adjust exposures, as highly shorted stocks and high retail sentiment names broadly underperformed in the past two months,” analysts at Goldman’s prime-broker unit wrote in a note to clients. Despite a sharp rally in stocks favored by retail money, “shorts on the group only saw modest net covering,” they said.
AMC bears reloaded amid last week’s rally. Their short sales have increased to 20% of the total stock outstanding from 17.1% in the middle of last month, according to IHS Markit data.
Short sellers have been raising their bearish wagers as some bets, like those against technology companies, paid off. A Goldman basket of the most-shorted tech stocks has tumbled almost 30% from its February peak.
After notching a record high in early May, the S&P 500 has struggled to make any headways as investors contemplate the growth potential against stretched valuations. Money has shifted among stocks, creating violent price swings in pockets of the market.
“You might have the S&P trading sideways over the next month or two, but you have individual names going all over the place,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management. “That’s an opportunity for them to make large profits.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is considering participating in a planned 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) capital increase at Lufthansa, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters on Wednesday, a move that could help to repay the airline's state-backed bailout.
Reuters last month reported that Lufthansa was working with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on plans for a capital increase in either the summer or autumn.
""We are always taking a close look at this. One thing is clear: if companies have a goal of freeing themselves of a need for state support, we will make that possible,"" said Scholz in an interview.
""Our support was put in place so that companies could survive the crisis and then stand on their own feet again,"" he said. 
The bulk of a government-backed 9 billion euro bailout for the German carrier, hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, consists of a so-called silent participation of 5.5 billion euros which Lufthansa intends to repay in part with proceeds from the capital increase.
The participation of the German government could send a positive signal to markets and help ensure the refinancing is successful and also limit a dilution of the government's 20% stake. 
However, it could also prompt state aid questions from the European Commission, say people in the sector.
Bloomberg first reported the government was considering participating in the capital hike. Citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter, it said the government could sell part of its subscription rights and use the proceeds to purchase new shares. Alternatively, it could make use of more of its subscription rights and spend up to 1 billion euros. 
Scholz said any decision on a capital increase should not be rushed.

Lufthansa and the economy ministries declined to comment.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares rose 5% Wednesday amid heightened online searches by people looking to travel after a year of pandemic-induced lockdown.
In the 7-day period from May 18 to 24, the volume of searches on Airbnb by people in EU member states looking for cross-border stays within the bloc increased by up to 31% compared to the same period in 2019.
On May 24, the company announced the biggest top-to-bottom upgrade of the Airbnb service, influenced by shifts in the way people are choosing to travel. The company effected over 100 upgrades to its platform in preparation for the upcoming travel boom.
In the words of CEO Brian Chesky, “Travel rebound will be unlike anything we have ever seen before.”
Data cited by the company for Europe is an indicator of the impending boom in travel as people look to unshackle themselves.
Of the new listings that were activated and booked in Q1 2021, 50% received a reservation request within four days of activation. For the year ending April 30, 2021, the average annual earnings per homes host who has welcomed at least one guest on Airbnb was about $9,600.

796,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",AMC’s All-In Embrace of Retail Mob Good for Another Big Gain,"(Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. is really leaning into this whole meme-stock phenomenon.
On Wednesday, the movie-theater chain announced that it would reward small-time investors, who have been instrumental in AMC’s wild, logic-defying 1,400% share rally this year, with goodies such as special screenings and free popcorn. It comes a day after AMC took advantage of those meteoric gains to raise $230 million directly from one of its main creditors, Mudrick Capital Management, and shore up its finances.
While Mudrick quickly dumped its entire stake for a tidy profit and called the company massively overvalued, the Reddit retail-trading crowd was having none of it. Buoyed by AMC’s public embrace, the shares soared 27% to an intraday record on Wednesday after jumping 23% the day before. The gains pushed AMC’s market value to roughly $20 billion, surpassing GameStop (NYSE:GME).
“Many of our investors have demonstrated support and confidence in AMC...After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them,” Adam Aron, AMC’s chief executive officer, said in a statement Wednesday.
More than 3.2 million individuals owned a stake in AMC as of March 11, accounting for over 80% of its investor base, according to the statement. Early last month, Aron spoke directly to many of these new investors during AMC’s quarterly conference call, cheering their passion, commitment and enthusiasm.
He then urged the skeptical stock analysts to pay attention to these investors -- “read what these people write,” he told them.

Few, if any, other top executives in America, have welcomed the newfound influence of the retail set like Aron has. Then again, few companies owe as much to them either.
A few short months ago, AMC was on the verge of bankruptcy. That’s before an army of day traders, hellbent on upending old-school conventions about what companies are worth, rallied around its shares. Using online platforms like WallStreetBets, these small-time traders banded together, adopting hashtags like #AMCSTRONG and #AMCSqueeze on Twitter.
Alongside GameStop, AMC has become a poster child of the meme-stock mania that has captivated markets and confounded the Wall Street pros.
Current trading pegs the company’s market capitalization at over $18 billion, even while the chain carries more than $5 billion of debt and shareholder equity that’s negative by more than $5 a share.
“It is clear that fundamentals don’t support common stock levels at all (which makes sense for the Reddit crowd),” Mark Levin of Asterisk Advisors said in a note.
Buy and Sell
Some savvy investors like Mudrick saw the huge share rally as a unique opportunity to turn a quick profit.
Raising cash through an equity sale to a single holder is relatively rare in U.S. markets. Having the holder flip the stock right after buying it is almost unheard of. In this case, Mudrick’s role in the AMC offering bears a passing resemblance to underwriters in a public offering who purchase shares with the specific intent of reselling them to investors.
A representative for Mudrick declined to comment, and AMC, based in Leawood, Kansas, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
In a statement disclosing the offering, Aron said the deal with Mudrick “will allow us to be aggressive in going after the most valuable theater assets, as well as to make other strategic investments in our business and to pursue deleveraging opportunities.”

799,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",U.S. FAA's top safety official stepping down effective June 30,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) top safety official said Wednesday he will step down effective June 30.
Ali Bahrami, the FAA’s associate administrator for aviation safety since July 2017, had faced criticism from some U.S. lawmakers and family members of those killed in two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that led to the plane's 20-month grounding, which was lifted in November. Officials said it was Bahrami's decision to leave the agency.
The FAA said it will begin an immediate search for a successor. Deputy Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety Chris Rocheleau, a longtime FAA employee, will serve as interim head of the Office of Aviation Safety.
""This was not an easy decision,"" Bahrami, who worked at the FAA in various positions for 30 years, told staff in an email. ""I’ve been blessed with an incredible career, and now it’s time for me to spend more time with my family and focus on my next chapter.""
In December, Congress passed sweeping legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes. It also boosts FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requires disclosure of critical safety information and provide new whistleblower protections.
A House of Representatives report released in September said the two fatal 737 MAX crashes ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""
An FAA survey released in August found some FAA employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms that the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
The survey quoted one anonymous employee as saying that the message was, ""Don't rock the boat with Boeing.""
The United States has not had a fatal U.S. passenger airline crash since February 2009 and only one fatality due to a U.S. passenger airline accident in that period.
Bahrami's email said the FAA had ""established a solid foundation to respond to congressional mandates and recommendations stemming from investigations and certification reviews after the two tragic 737 MAX accidents.""

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>","Investor magnet Israel tarnished by Palestinian conflict, but pull still strong","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) -As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's bloodiest chapter in years played out last month, the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund said it was dropping two Israeli companies from its investment portfolio on humanitarian grounds.
Acting on a recommendation by the $1.3 trillion Norwegian fund's ethics committee made in late 2020, the timing of that announcement was a coincidence.
But coming during an 11-day battle in which hundreds of Palestinians died, it offered a brutal reminder of the ethical choices that global investors must make in exchange for parking money in a country that offers the rare combination of high and financially secure returns and an all-but coronavirus-proofed economy. Norway's wealth fund has among the biggest holdings in companies that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) lists as raising most concerns due to their operations in the Palestinian territories, according to Reuters findings based on Refinitiv data to the end of March.
Like other major investors in Israeli assets, the fund shows no signs of a wholesale retreat from a country not subject to international sanctions, and Tel Aviv's tech- and finance-heavy stock market hit a record high on Monday.
But players are drawing some lines, with distance from active participation in businesses linked to possible abuses a common criterion. 
The Norwegian fund dropped Shapir Engineering and Industry for building homes in Israeli settlements on the West Bank, and Mivne Real Estate KD for letting industrial buildings linked to those settlements.
Both investments created ""an unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to systematic violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war or conflict,"" the board of Norway's central bank – which makes decisions based on the fund's ethics watchdog's recommendations - said in its May 19 statement.
A Shapir spokesman said the investment had been about $1 million, adding there was no Israeli company that did not ""operate in or gain from"" the West Bank territories.
A Mivne spokesman said its settlement properties had a mix of Jewish, Palestinian and Israeli Arab tenants and were ""a symbol of coexistence"" between different populations. 
Israel regards the West Bank settlements as legitimate, and the OHCHR does not express a view on the legality of the activities of the companies on its database, which it updated last year.
Other high-profile investors in those firms, which are mostly Israeli, include New Zealand’s sovereign wealth fund, the NZ Super Fund, U.S. asset management giants BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group, money manager  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management (CSIM), and CalPERS, the largest public U.S. pension fund.
PASSIVE TRACKERS
The NZ Super Fund said in March it had excluded five Israeli-owned banks on responsible investment grounds. 
It said it used information other than the OHCHR list in making its investment decisions. ""A key factor is the proximity and importance of the company's actions to that illegal or unethical activity,"" the fund told Reuters. ""We draw a distinction between a company being directly and materially involved ...versus being a supplier of materials or services in the normal course of business."" 
It holds other Israeli companies flagged as a risk by the OHCHR, while data showed its Norwegian counterpart held investments worth $1.3 billion across 81 Israeli companies at end-2020, more than double what they were a decade ago. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the Norwegian fund, declined to comment on its investments in Israel. Vanguard and BlackRock also declined to comment.
CSIM said its index exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds' exposure to firms on the OHCHR list was driven by passive tracking of a benchmark index. ""CSIM does not currently apply any social screens or similar restrictions for specific industries or companies to index funds or ETFs,"" it added. A high proportion of the investments in Israeli stocks are likely to come from such passive funds, which track indices that include them. Israeli equities have a weighting of 0.18% in the MSCI World Index, which has $3.7 trillion in assets benchmarked to it. Israeli equity funds drew inflows through last month's conflict, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. 
'YELLOW LIGHT' APPROACH 
Through the lens of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), Israel also still looks enticing.
Its two largest banks, cited by the OHCHR for financing settlements, score within the top third of banks globally in ESG, according to data from Sustainalytics, an ESG ratings firm which said it would not update its country risk assessment for Israel after last month’s violence.
The U.N. Human Rights Council voted last week to launch an investigation into allegations of crimes committed during it.
Israel said it would not cooperate, having also rejected as ""preposterous"" an April accusation from New York-based Human Rights Watch that Israeli officials had committed ""crimes of apartheid"".
""The more that (term) becomes part of the mainstream, the more difficult it will be for companies and for investment review agencies to physically separate what goes on in Israel from what goes on with its activities in the Occupied Territory,"" Michael Lynk, the UN's Special Rapporteur for the human rights situation in the Palestinian Territories, told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Israel’s robust economy and investment-grade credit rating is on course to withstand the impact of the conflict the ensuing political upheaval, and a weakening coronavirus epidemic against which 80% of adults are fully vaccinated.
So, much as for investors in Saudi Arabian debt who took stock following the 2018 killing in the country's Turkey embassy of investigative journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the financial argument for staying put remains compelling.
""Most investors dodge the issue and will probably continue to do so until asset allocators take a stance,"" said Hasnain Malik, emerging and frontier markets strategy at Tellimer. 
Most international companies were following the ""yellow light"" approach regarding the settlement economy, meaning they were exercising caution but still going ahead, the U.N.'s Lynk added.
Social movements have sought to exert pressure, with Axa having faced some of the loudest calls.

""Our investments in Israeli banks have absolutely no vocation to finance the expansion of the occupied territories,"" the French insurer said in a statement. Retail investors appear similarly unperturbed. Israel-based equity fund manager Alpha LTI has seen little sign of significant outflows or inflows over the past month, said managing partner Sagi Ben Yosef.
It partners with an Australian fund manager offering high-net-worth retail investors exposure to Israeli stocks and is in talks to strike similar arrangements in South Africa and the United States. ""The interest in Israel is much bigger than anything that is happening,"" he said.

After a pandemic-driven surge in sales over the last year, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), among the world's best known e-commerce platforms for handmade goods and vintage items, estimates the U.S. second-hand clothing market alone will be worth $64 billion by 2024.
Chief Executive Officer Josh Silverman said he saw Depop as ""the resale home for Gen-Z consumers"" and believed there was significant potential to scale up its business as he seeks to offset consumers' return to more traditional mall and retail stores over the next year. 
""This (Gen-Z) is an enormous demographic and it's the trendsetter demographic,"" he told analysts on a call to discuss the deal. 
London-based Depop, founded a decade ago by entrepreneur Simon Beckerman for readers of his magazine to purchase featured items, is known for its vintage and street-wear collections and has over 26 million users across more than 147 countries. 
About 90% of its users are under the age of 26 and it is the 10th most visited shopping site among Gen-Z consumers in the United States, according to the company. 
The resale boom has prompted companies including Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and  Vera Bradley  (NASDAQ:VRA) to partner with sector players Poshmark and ThredUp.
Silverman expects Depop to increase Etsy's footprint in apparel, a growing category as people return to work and school. In 2020, Etsy recorded about $1 billion in apparel gross merchandise sales and its overall revenue doubled. 

Neil Saunders, managing director at retail research firm GlobalData, said the deal should give Etsy a new growth avenue as it comes down from a pandemic-led high.
Etsy shares were up about 3% in early trading.

MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of BBVA (MC:BBVA) employees on Wednesday held a one-day strike called by several Spanish unions to protest against the bank's plans for layoffs.
It was the first such work stoppage involving a bank at a national level in 30 years, according to national union Comisiones Obreras, the largest in the financial sector.
The same union also called on Caixabank's staff to go on strike on June 9 against its plan to cut 8,000 jobs, one of the largest in Spanish history.
Spanish banks' staff have recently been holding protests against plans by five lenders to cut around 18,000 jobs.
In April, BBVA said it was planning to cut 3,800 jobs, though it later offered to bring that number down to around 3,300, to adapt to a client shift towards online banking.
""Digitalisation is something that we are imposing on the customers and not the other way around, digitalisation is a lie. Many customers don't want to know anything about it,"" Jennifer Mir, a 42-year-old BBVA employee, told Reuters during protests in front of a bank building in central Madrid.
CCOO demands that any cuts should be through voluntary redundancy and early retirement while calling for greater financial compensation for those who leave BBVA.
The bank has around 2,400 branches in Spain. According to CCOO, between 75% of the offices in northeastern city of Zaragoza to 100% in most areas of Andalusia closed their doors, while more than 70% of its around 23,000 staff went on strike.
BBVA, which declined to give a potential impact from the strike on its retail business, added that 35% of its staff in Spain had joined the one-day stoppage.
""Those of us in the offices are the most affected and under the most pressure to sell financial products such as insurance and investment funds with incredible sales targets,"" Nicolas Munoz, a 56-year-old BBVA employee, told Reuters.
Munoz also complained about the lack of staff.
""There are only two of us in the office and we have to do too many tasks,"" he said.
According to CCOO, thousands of people also took to the streets across 28 Spanish cities to protest BBVA's plans, which have coincided with government calls to rein in the pay of top bankers.

Rebeca Casado, a 43-year-old client, told Reuters in front of a shut BBVA branch in Madrid that she did not really care about the strike as she was used to online channels.
""It is true however that I do go at least once a month to make cash deposits because I don't know any other way to do it.""

It has signed a deal with Switzerland’s Lonza (SIX:LONN) which said a new production line in Geleen, Netherlands, will have capacity to make ingredients for up to 300 million doses annually at 50 micrograms per dose.
Moderna, which has been studying lower-dose versions to help stretch supplies of its vaccine, has been delivering an approved 100-microgram dose to date. Lower doses aren’t approved yet, but the company is hoping they will be.
The drug maker has said early booster shot data for a 50-microgram version showed it helped protect against emerging virus variants. Lower-doses may also be given to children who may not require a full one.
The  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) shot has already been approved for 12-15-year-olds in Europe and the U.S. Moderna is aiming for a similar nod as data showed its shot was found safe.
Under the other announcement, Moderna said it will deliver UNICEF and its procurement partners up to 34 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the December quarter and up to 466 million doses in 2022.
Moderna aims to deliver up to 3 billion doses in 2022, up from 800 million to 1 billion doses this year, Reuters said. It has not yet specified the dosing mix."

Prices of basic materials have been on the rise, backed by strong demand from industrial activities. Amid this environment, we think investors should bet on companies in the basic materials space that possess strong enough pricing power to combat any downturn caused by rising inflation. We believe under-the-radar basic materials stocks Tredegar Corp (TG), CRH Plc (NYSE:CRH),  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB), and Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) possess that characteristic and are worth adding to one’s portfolio now. Let’s take a closer look.The global commodity market is currently on a roll. While basic materials stocks were largely overlooked for much of last year due to global economic weakness, they have rebounded sharply in recent months. Notably, an expected inflationary environment in the United States and the rapid recovery of global industrial activities have been major drivers in pushing commodity prices higher, particularly basic materials.
The basic materials sector includes a wide variety of companies that develop raw materials for other industries, such as manufacturing and mining of chemicals, plastics, construction resources, paper, forest products, packaging products, metals and other minerals. The resumption of industrial operations has been pushing the demand for basic materials to pre-pandemic levels and investors are trading to profit from the flourishing markets. This is evident in the Invesco DWA Basic Materials Momentum ETF’s (PYZ) 29.7% returns so far this year compared to S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 12.2% gains over the period.
Rising commodity prices directly influence the profit margins of basic materials companies. Hence, we think betting on relatively overlooked basic materials stocks Tredegar Corporation (TG), CRH Plc (CRH), LyondellBasell Industries (LYB), and Vedanta Limited (VEDL) could be a great way to survive any stock market decline that rising inflation might cause.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Orsted, the world's largest offshore wind farm developer, is ramping up its investment in renewables to $57 billion by 2027, seeking to become a global leader in green energy and fend off growing competition. 
The Danish firm, which sold its oil and gas business in 2017, has benefited hugely from policies to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, a collective shot at limiting global warming. 
But competition is heating up as utilities and energy firms, including oil majors such as Total, BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), accelerate spending on renewables.
Europe's biggest wind power generator Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) earlier this year pledged to spend 150 billion euros ($182 billion) by 2030 to triple its renewable capacity and double its network assets.
Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), which has installed more than a quarter of the world's offshore wind capacity, said on Wednesday it planned to invest 350 billion Danish crowns ($57 billion) by 2027, up from a previous target of 200 billion crowns by 2025. 
""Our aspiration is to become the world's leading green energy major by 2030,"" Chief Executive Mads Nipper, who joined Orsted in January, told investors at a Capital Markets Day.
The company aims to more than quadruple its installed renewable energy capacity over the next decade to 50 gigawatts (GW), compared with its previous target of 30 GW, and escalate expansion in areas such as onshore wind and green hydrogen.
""The question is if Orsted can keep their profitability when the market is growing and the competition intensifies,"" said Nordnet analyst Per Hansen. 
At 1240 GMT, Orsted shares were down 4.8% at 881.6 crowns, with Citi analysts saying the stock was already pricing in strong growth despite growing competition.
Orsted is moving into more renewable energy areas as customers increasingly ask for integrated green energy solutions with, for example, both solar and wind, Nipper said. 

It aims to become a global leader in green hydrogen - or hydrogen produced by using renewable power - which is seen as crucial in replacing fossil fuels in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping, aviation and heavy industries like mining.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabian oil group Aramco (SE:2222) has lined up banks to help it arrange a sale of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, three sources said, seeking to raise money ahead of large commitments for its major shareholder, the Saudi government.
Aramco was widely expected to become a regular bond issuer after its debut $12 billion bond deal in 2019 was followed by an $8 billion, five-part transaction in November last year.
A large group of banks has been hired for the deal, including First Abu Dhabi Bank , HSBC , NCB Capital and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) , said one of the sources.
The energy giant is expected to raise up to $5 billion and the deal, which would be through sukuk, or Islamic bonds, is expected in the next few weeks.
""There has not been that many dollar sukuk that have been issued of late, so there is clearly demand there,"" the source said.
Aramco, FAB, HSBC and Standard Chartered did not immediately respond to requests for comment and NCB Capital could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The oil company last year maintained a $75 billion promised dividend despite lower oil prices, and is expected to shoulder significant domestic investments that form part of Saudi Arabia's plans to transform the economy.
""I think it was expected. They need the cash to pay the dividends that have been promised, they've done it in the past too,"" said a debt banker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
One of the sources said the deal could happen in the coming weeks. Qatar Petroleum is expected to issue bonds by the end of June that sources have said could go up to $10 billion in size.

""It could well be busy,"" the source said, referring to bond issuance from the Gulf in June.
Bloomberg was first to report the planned bond sale on Wednesday.

Investing -- Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) shares were up in Wednesday’s premarket as traders cheered its attempt to extend its presence in the fast-growing resale space for apparels with its $1.62 billion deal to buy Depop, a privately-held marketplace for unique fashion.
Depop is the 10th most visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the U.S.
Its mostly under 26 users were the lure for Etsy. A release by Etsy said young consumers are adopting second-hand fashion faster than any other audience.
The 2020 gross merchandise sales and revenue of the London-headquartered company were approximately $650 million and $70 million, respectively, each increasing over 100% year-over-year.
Depop is expected to be accretive to Etsy's top line growth rate and modestly dilutive to Etsy's adjusted EBITDA margin.
Etsy’s consolidated revenue for the first quarter ended March 31 was $550.6 million, up 141.5% versus the same period of 2020.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% was up 900 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021."

(Reuters) - Investors have long paid a premium to get hold of scarce green bonds, but record issuance might be about to change that. 
Bonds sold to fund environmentally-beneficial projects have tended to command higher prices and lower yields than conventional bonds. But that differential -- dubbed the greenium -- all but vanished in April in the euro corporate bond market.
Comparing option-adjusted credit spreads on an index of euro green bonds with a comparable index of conventional bonds, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, an industry body, found investors in April paid virtually no premium for holding green corporate bonds. That compares with an average 9 bps premium in 2020. 
Estimates vary, depending on methodology, as most green bonds don't have a directly comparable conventional peer. But market players generally agree greeniums are shrinking.
The driver, it seems, is a big increase in supply. 
Companies in the euro investment-grade corporate bond market, a major source of green funding, have already raised nearly as much through green bonds this year as during the whole of 2020, according to Refinitiv. 
It's good news for investment funds that are under pressure to invest under environmental, social and governance (ESG) tenets. But borrowers may need to re-evaluate the cost advantage of funding themselves via the green market. 
Graphic: Greenium dwindles in 2021: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzxybyvw/BjZVB-greenium-dwindles-for-euro-ig-corporate-bonds-in-2021%20(1).png 
In selling their bonds, green issuers still paid a smaller new issue premium this year than conventional issuers, but the pricing benefit relative to conventional issuance has halved compared to 2020, according to data from ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd). 
The spike in issuance comes as borrowers globally have raised $193 billion from green bonds this year, Refinitiv data to May 25 shows, a record for this time of year and nearly three times the amount raised at this point in 2020. 
""There is a kind of limit to how big the greenium could get. Investors still need to make returns,"" said Barnaby Martin, head of credit strategy at BofA. 
""If there's a lot more supply of green debt, eventually that's going to hit technicals."" 
In another sign that green bonds are becoming less scarce, green issuance comprises 16% of this year's euro investment-grade corporate bond sales -- more than double its share last year, according to Refinitiv. 
Much of the euro issuance is from utilities and real estate firms, ABN AMRO senior fixed income strategist Shanawaz Bhimji said, noting these sectors already have many green bonds outstanding. 
""If there's not much issuance coming from sectors which offer diversification, the market is not going to pay up,"" he said. 
Graphic: Green bond issuance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvebzxmpr/mF9gw-green-bond-issuance-triples-on-this-time-last-year.png 
SCARCITY PREMIUM
In government bonds and in corporate sectors where green debt is rare, the greenium still lingers. For instance, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s green bond offers a credit spread that's seven basis points tighter than a conventional bond due the same year. 
And in the U.S. dollar investment-grade market, with fewer green bonds, green borrowers have commanded a pricing benefit of about 10 bps at issuance since 2020, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), though that is down from 16 bps in 2016-2019.
But on both sides of the Atlantic, the scarcity premium is shifting to social and sustainability bonds, the bank argues.
Social bonds finance expenditures like healthcare or education while sustainability bonds can fund both social and green projects. They are scarcer as issuance really only kicked off after the pandemic erupted last year.
Since last year, such bonds have offered issuers a 20 bp premium on average at issuance in the euro investment-grade market and 36 bps in U.S. dollars, Goldman estimates.

The good news for those who believe in the power of green finance to improve corporate environmental credentials is that the declining greenium has not deterred issuers.
""We hear from corporates it's not purely about the concession. They really want to improve their standing within the investment community,"" said Bhimji at ABN AMRO.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 08:24AM ET</span>",Explainer: Tesla drops radar; is Autopilot system safe?,"By Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has dropped radar sensors from its semi-autonomous driving system, Autopilot, raising concerns over the safety of the camera-only version, Tesla Vision.
Tesla aims to make the driver-assist system fully self-driving, and many in that young industry are skeptical that a vision-only system will work, saying such systems face challenges in darkness, sunny glare and poor weather conditions.
Safety ratings groups have dropped their labels until they test newly configured cars.
Still, Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has surprised the industry before - first and foremost by turning the electric vehicle maker into the world's most valuable car company.
Here are some questions and answers about Tesla's bet on a camera-based system. 
HOW DOES TESLA'S SYSTEM WORK, WITH AND WITHOUT RADAR?
Tesla in May started delivering Model 3 and Model Y with a driver-assist system based on eight cameras mounted around the car and with no radar. The cameras, like eyes, send images to computer networks, like the brain, which recognize and analyse objects. 
Over the years, Tesla's view of radar has changed. 
In May 2016, a Tesla car crashed, killing the driver, when Autopilot failed to detect a white semi-truck crossing in front of it. 
Later that year, Tesla announced a plan to give radar a primary role in navigation while describing a false-alarm problem with some radar systems that needed to be fixed.
""Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar ... it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust,"" Musk tweeted in 2016. Tesla also said radar ""plays an essential role in detecting and responding to forward objects."" Tesla does not use a more expensive lidar sensor, which gives more precise shape information of an object than radar. 
Tesla drivers complained of ""phantom braking"" when their cars stopped abruptly on highways under an overpass or a bridge.
Musk said the new camera-only system will likely be safer than radar because of less ""noise"" or confusing signals, industry news site Electrek reported. 
After the May 2016 crash, Tesla had similar accidents of cars crashing into semi-trucks and stationary police cars and fire trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating 24 accidents involving Tesla cars. 
HOW DO OTHER SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES WORK? 
Most automakers and self-driving vehicle companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo use three types of sensors: Cameras, radar and lidar. 
Radar systems, like cameras, are relatively inexpensive. They work in poor weather but lack resolution to accurately determine the shape of objects. Lidar has higher resolution, but is vulnerable to weather conditions.
""You need to use all the different kinds of sensors and then combine them,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, reflecting a common industry view. 
Tesla's camera-centric system is ""much harder to design, but it is also much cheaper"" than Waymo's laser-based lidar approach, enabling the electric car maker to scale up and further improve its technology, Tesla's artificial intelligence director, Andrej Karpathy, said in a “Robot Brains” podcast in March. 
WHAT DOES TESLA LOSE BY GIVING UP RADAR?
There is a lot of debate on this issue. 
The loss of radar degrades driver-support features enough ""to render them less usable to unusable in adverse weather conditions,"" Steven Shladover, a research engineer at Berkeley University of California. 
""It makes no sense whatsoever technologically - only a way of reducing cost of components,"" he said.
Since radar is good at measuring distances accurately, its loss could affect emergency braking to avoid collisions with slowed vehicles, said Ram Machness, chief business officer of advanced radar maker Arbe Robotics.
""If you drop radar without proving vision alone does that job as well, then you're compromising safety,"" Telanon, a developer of a driver support system, said on Twitter.
Tesla said some driver-assistant features including its ability to maintain speed at the pace of the car ahead may be temporarily limited or inactive upon delivery. It said it would start restoring the features via software updates in the weeks ahead. 
Musk told Electrek that the vision system had improved so much that it was better off without radar.
Last week, NHTSA withdrew its advanced safety features label for new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and Consumer Reports dropped its ""top pick"" label. Both intend to test the vision-only system.

WHO KNOWS BEST?
Tesla's plan runs counter to most of the self-driving industry, but it is difficult to say who is right. No company has yet deployed a fully functional self-driving system in scale, and the entire industry is years behind initial projections.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>",The $15 billion jet dilemma facing Boeing's CEO,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co CEO Dave Calhoun faces a multibillion-dollar dilemma over how to rebuild sales in its core airliner business that has sparked an internal debate and put the future of the largest U.S. exporter on the line, industry insiders say.
Boeing is reeling from a safety scandal following crashes of its 737 MAX airliner and an air travel collapse caused by the pandemic. Those crises have overshadowed a deeper, longer term risk to the company's commercial passenger jet business.
Boeing's share of the single-aisle jetliner market - where it competes in a global duopoly with Airbus - has faded from some 50% a decade ago to roughly 35% after the 737 MAX's lengthy grounding, according to Agency Partners and other analysts.
Airbus' single-aisle A321neo has snapped up billions of dollars of orders in a recently booming segment of the market, as the largest MAX variants struggled to block it.
Without a perfectly timed new addition to its portfolio, analysts warn America risks ceding to Europe a huge portion of that market - valued by planemakers at some $3.5 trillion over 20 years.
But Boeing is not yet ready to settle on a plan to develop a new plane to counter the A321neo, and two leading options - press ahead now or wait until later - come with financial and strategic risks, several people briefed on the discussions said.
""I'm confident that over a longer period of time, we'll get back to where we need to get to and I'm confident in the product line,"" Calhoun said in April as Boeing won new MAX orders.
Asked about the company's discussions and options over a potential new airplane, a Boeing spokesman said it had no immediate comment beyond Calhoun's remarks to investors.
OPTIONS
A weakened Boeing has little margin for error, especially as it tackles industrial problems hobbling other airliners.
Boeing's first option is to strike relatively quickly, bringing to market by around 2029 a 5,000-mile single-aisle jet with some 10% more fuel efficiency. That could potentially be launched for orders in 2023.
""There is no better way to fix their image than invest in the future now, pure and simple,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
A new single-aisle jet would replace the out-of-production 757 and fill a void between the MAX and larger 787, confirming a twist to earlier mid-market plans as reported by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/aircraft-projects-idUSL5N2CF5PN in April last year. The idea took a backseat early in the pandemic, before regaining attention.
It would also be an anchor for an eventual clean-sheet replacement of the 737 family. 
An alternative option is to wait for the next leap in engine technology, not expected until the early 2030s. That could involve open-rotor engines with visible blades using a mixture of traditional turbines and electric propulsion.
Wary of letting short-term product decisions drive strategy, Boeing is also prioritizing a deeper dive into investments or business changes needed to regain the No.1 spot, analysts say. 
TIMING DILEMMA
Both approaches carry risks. If it moves too quickly, Boeing may face a relatively straightforward counter-move. 
Airbus' preference is do nothing and preserve a favorable status quo, European sources say. But it has for years https://reut.rs/3vET9jk harbored studies codenamed ""A321neo-plus-plus"" or ""A321 Ultimate"" with more seats and composite wings to repel any commercial attack.
Such an upgrade might cost Airbus some $2-3 billion, but far less than the $15 billion Boeing would spend on a new plane.
For Boeing, a premature tit-for-tat move runs the risk of merely replicating the strategic spot it finds itself in now.
If it moves too slowly, however, investors may have to bear a decade of perilously low market share in the single-aisle category, the industry's profit powerhouse.
Those urging restraint, including soon-departing finance chief Greg Smith, have a simple argument, insiders say. 
Boeing has amassed a mountain of debt and burned $20 billion in cash lurching from crisis to crisis. 
""It's a different world,"" one insider said. ""How could you possibly be thinking about a new airplane?"" 
However, some engineers at Boeing's Seattle commercial home are crying out for a bold move to reassert its engineering dominance following the worst period in its 105-year history. 
""That should be a priority for Boeing right now,"" said Tom McCarty, a veteran former Boeing avionics engineer. ""To get back in clear leadership of advancing technology.""
ENGINE TALKS
As it weighs up when to act, Boeing has sought initial technical data from engine makers Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), Pratt & Whitney and the General Electric-Safran tie-up CFM International, industry sources say.
A firm competition is not expected for a year or more, they add, a delay that illustrates Boeing's bind. Rolls, which has most to gain as it tries to re-enter the lucrative single-aisle market, said last month it would be ready for any new product.
Watching Boeing's decision from the sidelines is China, where state manufacturer COMAC is working on a C919 narrowbody in a potential challenge to the cash-cow 737 and A320 families. 
Sitting on $7 billion in net cash and a second-mover's advantage, analysts say Airbus appears most comfortable, though it also faces its share of industrial headaches. 
A wild card in the deliberations is growing environmental pressure, mirrored in the priorities of each planemaker.
Airbus has pledged to introduce the first hydrogen-powered small commercial plane in 2035.
The ""zero-emission"" agenda reflects its CEO's conviction that disruptive technology will play a role in next-generation jets. But industry sources say it is no coincidence that such rhetoric also steers Boeing away from launching an interim jet.
Boeing has emphasized quicker gains from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Any new 757-style jet would feature the ability to run 100% on SAF, people familiar with the plan said.
While backing the drop-in fuel for technical reasons, Boeing has left itself enough room to argue that a relatively early new plane would still fit the industry's environmental objectives.
Airbus has meanwhile kept up pressure with proposals last week to almost double single-aisle output within four years.
While some suppliers questioned how quickly the plan was achievable https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-sets-higher-jet-output-targets-recovery-looms-2021-05-27, one industry executive noted it sent a ""message that Airbus exits the crisis as No.1 and intends to stay there"".
One risk is that anything that looks like a grab for market share could trigger the very Boeing jet Airbus hopes to avoid. 

Asked whether he thought Airbus's expansion plans might provoke Boeing into launching a new plane, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury played down the prospect of a new industry arms race.
""If they trust the MAX with the pent-up demand they see for single-aisle then I don't see why they would be in a hurry to replace the MAX. If they are in a different situation they might come to other conclusions,"" Faury told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.
The recall covers certain 2019-2021 Model 3 vehicles and 2020-2021 Model Y vehicles. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had no reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue and that the company will inspect and tighten, or replace, the caliper bolts as necessary.
Tesla said that loose caliper bolts could allow the brake caliper to separate and contact the wheel rim, which could cause a loss of tire pressure in ""very rare circumstances."" The company said that, in the ""unlikely event"" there is vehicle damage from a loose or missing fastener, it will arrange for a tow to the nearest service center for repair.

The filing with NHTSA said Tesla was made aware in December of a field incident involving a 2021 Model Y vehicle with a missing fastener on the driver-side rear brake caliper.

PARIS (Reuters) -European budget airline Wizz Air warned of further losses in its current financial year, amid a slower-than-expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ultra-low cost carrier faces another ""transition year"" as travel curbs linger on, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi said on Wednesday, as the company posted a 576 million euro ($703 million) net loss for the 12 months ended March 31.
""Unless we see an accelerated and permanent lifting of restrictions we expect a reported net loss in full-year 2022,"" Varadi said.
Despite the uncertainty, Wizz and low-cost peers such as Ryanair have used the crisis to add new routes as traditional airline rivals retrench. The Hungarian carrier now has 43 aircraft bases operating or announced, compared with 25 before the pandemic. 
Wizz has also leveraged a strong cash position to continue acquiring new, more efficient jets that will sharpen its competitive edge in an eventual rebound. Its fleet increased by 16 aircraft to 137 at year end.
The airline said it expects to fly around 30% of its pre-crisis capacity in its current first quarter, returning to full schedules only in its 2022-23 financial year.
While holding out hope for progress on an EU digital travel pass, Varadi described as a ""missed opportunity"" the patchwork of travel rules still in place.
""I would have expected the European Union to step up and coordinate,"" he told Reuters. ""Europe has become pretty much a zoo - every country is different.""
The airline's London-listed shares were trading 1.8% lower at 4.79 pounds as of 1032 GMT.
""Commentary from the company suggests the market will need to adjust its expectations down, with this likely to overshadow sentiment in the short term,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said.
The underlying full-year loss excluding fuel hedging deficits amounted to 482 million euros, Wizz said, on a 73% revenue decline to 739 million euros.

Liquidity stood at 1.617 billion euros as of March 31, with the company burning cash at a rate of 84 million euros during the entire last quarter. The cash and earnings numbers were in line with unaudited results published in an April 15 trading statement.

DUBAI (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is in talks to invest in Dubai ""cloud kitchen"" Kitopi's latest funding round through its second technology fund, sources familiar with the matter said.
The Japanese company's Vision Fund 2 has put forward a proposal to lead an investment of about $400 million in Kitopi, said the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is not public.
SoftBank declined to comment. Kitopi also declined to comment.
So-called cloud kitchens are facilities built to prepare food specifically for delivery and they have benefited from the shift to online services during the coronavirus crisis.
These “dark”, “cloud” or “ghost” kitchens have no physical presence as a restaurant, and offer delivery-only services from a centralised location through a mobile app.
Kitopi, which is headquartered in Dubai, operates more than 60 kitchens and has more than 1500 employees.
Allied Market Research in India has estimated that the global cloud kitchen industry could be worth about $71 billion by 2027 compared with $43 billion in 2019.
Kitobi hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) earlier this year to help with the fund raising round, a source has told Reuters, expected to generate $150 million to $200 million of financing to expand into Southeast Asia.

SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which has targeted $108 billion in fundraising, was seeded with $38 billion from SoftBank's own funds.
Kitopi has raised $117.2 million since its inception from investors including Dubai-based venture capital firm BECO Capital and U.S.-based Lumia Capital.

“Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it,” the chief executive officer tweeted Wednesday. “Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.”
Musk, 49, said during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April that the chip shortage was a “huge problem” and one of the most difficult supply-chain challenges the company had ever experienced. Last month, the consulting firm AlixPartners estimated automakers will lose about $110 billion of sales this year due to the dearth of semiconductors, almost double an earlier projection.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said last month it plans to increase production of microcontroller units by 60% this year to help relieve carmakers. Still, chip companies, auto manufacturers and their parts suppliers have warned chip supplies will remain tight into next year.
Tesla has been raising vehicle prices because of rising raw-material costs and supply-chain pressures, Musk tweeted earlier this week. The company also elected to remove a lumbar-support feature from the passenger seats of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV, though the CEO said this was related to limited customer usage.
Other carmakers have stripped out features such as navigation systems and blind spot-monitoring mirrors due to the chip shortage.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 06:17AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil probes U.S. oil trader Freepoint in alleged bribery scheme,"By Gram Slattery and Sabrina Valle
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Authorities in Brazil are investigating senior employees at Connecticut-based trading house Freepoint Commodities for their alleged role in a bribery scheme involving state-run oil company Petrobras, Reuters has learned.
Federal police here suspect Freepoint, through an intermediary, routed bribes to Petrobras employees for a roughly seven-year period ending in 2018. Reuters pieced together the purported kickback operation from three people close to the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and hundreds of pages of previously unreported court documents filed by Brazilian investigators.
At least two high-ranking Freepoint employees, including Robert Peck, head of the company's global oil business, are suspected to have participated in the purported scam, according to the sources and court documents reviewed by Reuters, which Brazilian police submitted last year to a federal judge overseeing the probe. Those documents include bank records, invoices, e-mails and WhatsApp messages exchanged between alleged co-conspirators, including Peck. In Brazil, judges routinely are involved in criminal cases from the early stages of an investigation to the sentencing phase.
The Brazilian investigation hasn’t been previously reported. No charges have been filed, and it remains unclear whether any will be. As part of the probe, authorities are investigating Freepoint itself, which could lead to potential fines or other civil penalties if the company is found to have engaged in wrongdoing.
In response to questions about the Brazil probe from Reuters, a Freepoint spokesperson said in an email the company ""is strongly committed to following the laws everywhere we do business."" It declined further comment.
Freepoint declined requests to make Peck available for an interview. Peck did not respond to questions sent to him by Reuters via LinkedIn. A woman who answered the telephone at his home declined to comment.
Petrobras said in an e-mail it has ""zero tolerance in relation to fraud and corruption"" and that employees involved in wrongdoing in its trading unit “were immediately fired for just cause in 2018.” It added that it has aided Brazilian authorities extensively with various corruption-related probes.
Brazil's federal police force did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on whether it is investigating the Freepoint matter.
The Freepoint investigation comes amid a broader law enforcement crackdown on commodity trading firms engaged in alleged corruption, particularly in resource-rich Latin America.
In December, a U.S. subsidiary of Switzerland's Vitol SA, the world's top independent oil trader, agreed to pay $164 million to resolve allegations by U.S. and Brazilian authorities that it paid bribes in Brazil and other Latin American countries between 2005 and 2020 to boost its trading business. In November, Brazilian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against Trafigura AG, alleging the Geneva-based trader and at least two subsidiaries paid Petrobras employees more than $1.5 million in bribes in 2012 and 2013. 
A spokeswoman for Vitol wrote in an e-mail that the company is ""pleased the matter has been resolved.""
Trafigura, in an emailed statement, said it ""strongly denies"" the allegations leveled by Brazilian authorities and that it has a zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. The company said outside counsel it hired to investigate ""found no basis to conclude that Trafigura's current management were involved in, or had knowledge of, alleged improper payments to Petrobras.""
Freepoint is the first major U.S. energy trader to come under recent scrutiny in Brazil. The Stamford-headquartered firm buys and sells all types of fuel through operations on three continents and employs more than 500 people worldwide.
THE ALLEGED SCHEME
The Freepoint probe is part of a larger investigation by Brazilian authorities known as Operation Car Wash. Begun in 2014, Car Wash centered on contracting graft at Petrobras, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
Car Wash officially ended in February, but some remaining investigations in advanced stages - including that of Freepoint - have continued, according to two people with knowledge of the probes.
At the center of the Freepoint investigation is an ex-Petrobras employee named Rodrigo Berkowitz, who formerly worked as a fuel trader for the Brazilian oil giant in Houston.
In February 2019, Berkowitz agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering for accepting kickbacks from fuel trading firms doing business with Petrobras. The identities of those companies were not revealed as part of the plea. Berkowitz, who still lives in Houston, is awaiting sentencing.
He is now collaborating with U.S. and Brazilian authorities in ongoing investigations into the commodities trading industry, according to his lawyer Jorge Camara, who declined further comment.
Berkowitz described the alleged Freepoint kickback scheme in the presence of both U.S. and Brazilian investigators in December 2019, according to court filings summarizing his testimony that were submitted by Brazilian police in March 2020 and October 2020 to the judge overseeing the probe.
Petrobras, the world's seventh-largest oil producer, routinely auctions large shipments of various fuels to ensure it gets the best price possible for its products. According to Berkowitz's testimony, the former fuel trader tipped off Freepoint about the amounts competitors bid in those auctions. That knowledge allowed Freepoint to edge out competitors, while still allowing Freepoint to pay less than it otherwise might have bid, Berkowitz said.
In exchange for that information, according to Berkowitz’s plea bargain testimony and invoices obtained by Brazilian police and seen by Reuters, the fuel trader received bribes from Freepoint through a middleman - a businessman named Eduardo Innecco. Innecco performed consulting work for Freepoint from roughly 2012 until late 2018, when he abruptly left South America over concerns that investigators were closing in, Brazilian police allege in the court filings reviewed by Reuters.
Innecco, through a representative, declined to comment. He has not been charged with a crime. Innecco currently resides in southern Europe, the representative said.
Freepoint allegedly compensated Innecco with commissions that were inflated to cover the cost of the bribes, according to Berkowitz’s testimony, bank records obtained by police and seen by Reuters, and the people familiar with the investigation. Innecco, in turn, passed those kickbacks to Petrobras employees, including Berkowitz, according to the people and documents. Freepoint funneled nearly $500,000 in bribes through Innecco between August 2017 and November 2018 alone, Berkowitz said in his testimony.
Innecco's principal contact at Freepoint was Glenn Oztemel, according to hundreds of WhatsApp messages exchanged between the men obtained by police and seen by Reuters. According to publicly listed business intelligence platform ZoomInfo, Oztemel held the title of Fuel Oil Book Head for Freepoint's U.S. operations.
Oztemel didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Freepoint said Oztemel retired in late 2020. He has not been charged with a crime.
He and Peck, head of Freepoint's global oil business, knew of the illicit nature of Innecco's dealings with Petrobras, Brazilian police allege in the court filings.
In WhatsApp messages exchanged between the three men obtained by law enforcement and viewed by Reuters, Innecco frequently told Oztemel and Peck precise details of competitors' bids on Petrobras fuel and said the information came from Berkowitz.
According to Berkowitz's testimony, he met with Peck and Innecco in London in February 2015 to pass sensitive commercial information about Petrobras' fuel business to Peck.
THE DOWNFALL
Those involved in the suspected Freepoint scam were aware of the risks they were taking as the Car Wash dragnet widened, police allege.
On Sept. 1, 2018, Innecco sent a WhatsApp message to Berkowitz, suggesting the fuel trader transfer his wealth offshore to shield it from authorities in the event their scheme was discovered, according to Berkowitz's testimony and a copy of the message reviewed by Reuters.
Innecco later expressed contrition for stoking panic.
""I want to apologize for perhaps for going too far with my suggestions about how to proceed in case things get complicated,"" Innecco wrote to Berkowitz via WhatsApp on Sept. 11, 2018. ""It's just that I got very worried.""
Three months later, on Dec. 5, 2018, Brazilian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Berkowitz for accepting bribes from commodity trading firms. He would plead guilty to parallel charges in the United States in February 2019. Freepoint was not mentioned by Brazilian authorities in that warrant or by U.S. authorities in Berkowitz's plea agreement.
On Dec. 6, 2018 Innecco flew from his home in Uruguay to Madrid, according to travel records obtained by Brazilian police and seen by Reuters.

No arrest warrant was issued for Innecco. Still, Brazilian investigators believe he fled out of fear that his arrest was imminent, according to filings they submitted in October 2020 to the federal judge overseeing the Freepoint investigation.
Police allege Innecco dispatched an associate to purchase him a burner phone, made hurried arrangements to sell his real estate holdings in Uruguay, and applied for Italian passports for himself and his family. Brazilian authorities now consider him a fugitive, the filings show.

825,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 05:48AM ET</span>","Meme Stocks Surge Premarket, AMC Ignores Mudrock Exit For One More Pop","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing -- Meme stocks AMC (NYSE:AMC) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) posted double digit gains in premarket Wednesday, as the craze for them refuses to die.
AMC was up 32%, on track to open at a record high, while Blackberry (TSX:BB) added 19% and the original darling, GameStop (NYSE:GME) rose 5%.
Tuesday’s exit of Mudrock Capital Management from AMC, within a few hours of putting in $230.5 million equity in the multiplex operator, seemed of little significance as its shares seemed set for another blockbuster day.
The company will use the cash proceeds to revamp its existing outlets and create more leases. Investor interest in the stock has also heightened as people set out to shop and visit theatres and restaurants after being holed up home for a year.
The company has raised $658.5 million equity through two separate exercises in less than a month.
AMC, GameStop and Blackberry, have been at the center of an almost six-month-long battle with retail traders on one side and hedge funds and other big institutions on the other.
While the big boys have been short on the stock, the small retail traders, using various chat applications and social media chat platforms like Reddit to coordinate their action, have come together to cause a short squeeze on the stocks – a phenomenon where the stock begins to rise against an expected fall, causing losses to those who were positioned to trade on the fall.
AMC last week replaced GameStop as the favorite of the Reddit gang, according to Bank of America findings.
Many experts have warned that the small savers, who are looking for quick money, could end up hurting themselves as the fundamentals of the companies aren’t strong enough to justify those valuations.
The warnings have made little difference as the stocks have mostly maintained their elevated levels, in AMC’s case still making new highs.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Leaders of South Korea's largest conglomerates urged President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday to pardon Jay Y. Lee, the jailed vice chairman of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, to maintain the country's edge in the chip industry. 
The plea was made during a luncheon between Moon and chiefs of four major business empires - Samsung (KS:005930), Hyundai, LG and SK - designed to boost economic cooperation after Moon and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to bolster the global supply chain for high-tech manufacturing.
Lee, the 52-year-old heir of the world's biggest memory chip maker and second-largest contract chip manufacturer, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison after being convicted of bribery, embezzlement and other offences.
SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won asked Moon to consider a petition for Lee's release that was submitted in April jointly by five business lobbies including the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry headed by Chey, according to Moon's spokeswoman Park Kyung-mee. 
Moon replied that he ""understood"" difficulties for the companies, Park said. He did not elaborate, but appeared more open to the idea after simply saying at a news conference in March that he would consider public opinion before deciding.
Moon had vowed to not pardon serious economic crimes such as bribery and embezzlement before taking office in 2017. 
Legal experts believe Lee is eligible for parole, as he has served more than half of his 30-month sentence. South Korean law allows parole to be granted after one-third of the sentence has been served, with the detainee showing exemplary behaviour. 
Business leaders have highlighted the need for Lee to be active to retain South Korea's leading position in the chip industry amid global shortages.
""Semiconductors require large-scale investment decisions, and leaders can only make such decisions in a swift manner,"" said Kinam Kim, vice chairman and CEO of Samsung's device business. 
Biden has called for greater South Korean investment, and Samsung confirmed a plan to funnel $17 billion into a new plant for chip contract manufacturing in the United States during Moon's trip to Washington.
Lee is in a unique position overseeing all three of Samsung's divisions -- chips, smartphones and home appliances, said Park Jea-gun, a professor at Hanyang University in Seoul. 

""It's hard to make big business decisions if not the owner,"" Park said. 
But the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, an activist group that resists pardoning chaebol chiefs, issued a statement saying releasing Lee would ""abuse the legal system to justify corporate crimes.""

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>",Activist fund asks French watchdog to probe Vivendi's music spin-off,"PARIS (Reuters) - Activist fund Bluebell has asked France's markets regulator to look into disclosures by media company Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) around its Universal Music Group spin-off, arguing the company did not reveal some steps around the transaction to shareholders. 
Vivendi, controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, is planning to cash in on its crown jewel, the world's biggest music label, by spinning off the entity to existing shareholders - for which it is seeking investor approval. 
In Bluebell's letter to the Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), which was seen by Reuters, the fund questioned why Vivendi pressed ahead with merging two entities within Universal before getting approval for the spin-off as a whole. 
The AMF could not immediately be reached for comment. Vivendi declined to comment. 
Bluebell, which has not revealed the size of its stake in Vivendi, last week called on the company to sweeten the terms of the spinoff by adding a dividend payout in cash. The fund, which recently led an activist campaign to oust the boss of French food group Danone, said the distribution-in-kind penalised minority shareholders from a tax perspective.
Vivendi's controlling shareholder Bollore would be one of the big winners of the Universal spinoff, which entails distributing 60% of the label's capital to shareholders. 
The music group, which is behind artists like Lady Gaga and has benefited from the growth of streaming revenues, is 80% owned by Vivendi. It is valued at 33 billion euros.

In its letter, Bluebell said it was asking the AMF to ""closely assess the reported facts and circumstances for this case, and take the appropriate corrective steps to ensure that Vivendi's shareholders are provided with sufficient disclosures in advance of the 22th of June 2021 shareholder meeting.""
Bloomberg first reported the AMF approach.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>",Tesla to buy more than $1 billion of Australian battery minerals a year,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it expects to spend more than $1 billion a year on battery raw materials from Australia given the country's reliable mining industry and responsible production practices.
Robyn Denholm, chair of the U.S. carmaker, said on Wednesday that Australia, which is rich in minerals used for batteries like lithium and nickel, is poised to benefit as developing supply chains for electric vehicle batteries and the green energy age focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG).
""We expect our spend on Australian minerals to increase to more than $1 billion per annum for the next few years,"" Denholm, an Australian, told a Minerals Council of Australia event.
Tesla already sources three quarters of its lithium feedstock from Australia and over a third of its nickel, Denham said, without specifying a dollar figure. 
""Australian mining companies do have a good reputation, great expertise, professionalism and are preferred by manufacturers increasingly concerned about meeting both today’s and the future’s ESG requirements,"" she said in Canberra. 
The comments are in line with a new policy underway by U.S. President Joe Biden's Administration to rely on allies to supply of the bulk of the metals needed to build electric vehicles.
The U.S. will then focus on processing those metals domestically into battery parts, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists, two administration officials with direct knowledge told Reuters last month.
Australia, alongside Canada and Brazil, are among the countries expected to benefit. 
Australia's exports of hard rock lithium known as spodumene are expected to hit A$1 billion ($773 million) this year while its nickel exports are expected to be valued at A$4 billion, government figures show. 

Tesla also supplies batteries to Australia to store energy captured from rooftop solar panels which shore up reliability in its energy network. Australia has the world's highest per capita density of rooftop solar panels.

""The Asian market is a natural fit for this category with traditional plant-based products like tofu already entrenched in the culture,"" Tan Sun, president, Tyson Foods Asia-Pacific, said in a statement.

Tyson Foods, the biggest U.S. producer of animal meat by sales, said on Tuesday it would first roll out plant-based nuggets, strips, and bites in Malaysia under its First Pride brand, with a view to expand into other markets.
The Jimmy Dean sausage maker launched its plant-based products late last year from its Raised & Rooted brand in Europe.

Shares in the Seoul-based company that owns 18.57% in the song’s producer SmartStudy Co. climbed as much as 10%. The gains have helped the stock more than quadruple since the end of 2018 as the song became popular.
Musk tweeted during Asian trading hours Wednesday “Baby Shark crushes all! More views than humans,” with a video clip of the song attached. His tweet triggered another rally in the shares, again underscoring the influence the billionaire co-founder of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. commands on asset prices from crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin to equities including the so-called meme stocks.
Baby Shark (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo)” became a YouTube sensation in 2018. It has been viewed nearly 8.7 billion times and has made it to the Billboard Hot 100 chart on multiple weeks.

Speaking at the company's annual technology presentation to clients and investors, held online for the second straight year because of the pandemic, CEO C.C. Wei said the planned factory remains on track to start volume production of chips using the company's 5-nanometer production technology starting in 2024.
TSMC is expected to be one of several companies, including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, competing for some of the $54 billion in subsides for the chip industry that advanced in the United States Senate last week.
Reuters previously reported that TSMC plans to build as many as six factories at the Arizona site over a 10- to 15-year span.
TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract, has taken centre-stage in the global supply chain equation amid a worldwide shortage of chips that is hurting industries from automobiles to consumer electronics.
Its shares have soared since the COVID-19 pandemic began, making it Asia's most valuable manufacturing company with a market capitalisation of $563 billion, more than twice that of Intel's. 
TSMC announced in April a $100 billion investment plan over the next three years to increase capacity at its factories. Wei reiterated that number, which will include $30 billion in spending this year, at the presentation.
""That will give us enough manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our clients,"" he said. 

Wei also said the company has developed a version of its 5-nanometer chipmaking process certified for use by automakers for advanced applications like artificial intelligence, though the new offering is unlikely to alleviate the current chip shortages because the shortages are of less advanced chips.
He said TSMC's next generation of 3-nanometer chipmaking technology remains on track to start volume production at the company's ""Fab 18"" factory in Tainan, Taiwan, in the second half of next year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning, with Australia reporting a better-than-expected GDP. Investors also remained concerned about the U.S. Federal Reserve withdrawing stimulus measures earlier than expected, as economic recovery continues with data on it expected on Friday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.77% by 10:49 AM ET (2:49 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day said that Gross Domestic Product grew 1.8% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2021.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.18%, with the country’s Consumer Price Index rising 2.6% year-on-year in May, above April’s 2.3% growth.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.48% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.06%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.46% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.07%. The offshore yuan remained unchanged after the People’s Bank of China forced banks to hold more foreign currencies in reserve in order to stem the yuan’s surge.
Investors also remained concerned that central banks will pair back their stimulus measures earlier than expected due to the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 in the U.S., China, and parts of Europe.
In the U.S., data released on Tuesday said the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose 61.2 in May, higher than the 60.9 figure in forecasts prepared by investing.com and April’s 60.7 reading. However, it also indicated supply shortages and labor constraints.
The labor shortage has hindered the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 in the U.S., according to U.S. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard, who added “for all these reasons, the supply-demand mismatches in the labor market are likely to be temporary, and I expect to see further progress on employment in coming months.”
Brainard also reiterated that the central bank is not set to change its current dovish monetary policy for a while. ""Remaining steady in our outcomes-based approach during the transitory reopening surge will help ensure the economic momentum that will be needed as current tailwinds shift to headwinds is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions,"" she said.
Investors now await key U.S. economic data to be released on Friday, including non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate in May, to gauge the economic outlook.
“Investors would see a surge in payrolls growth as a sign that the Fed is more likely to move,” Lauren Goodwin, portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, told Bloomberg."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - AirAsia X Bhd shareholders have approved the Malaysian budget airline's debt restructuring, it said on Tuesday, allowing it to pursue a scheme it viewed as key to survival.
Shareholders of the long-haul affiliate of AirAsia Group Bhd approved all resolutions at an extraordinary general meeting, including a rights issue and a share subscription for new investors to raise 500 million ringgit.
AirAsia X last October proposed restructuring its 64.15 billion ringgit ($15.6 billion) debt into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit and having the rest waived.
The airline said in a separate statement that the resolutions were passed with at least a 99.8% margin, and marked a major milestone in its restructuring progress.
""These approvals have been obtained simultaneously with final negotiations being held with creditors,"" it said, adding that with advisers New York-based Seabury Capital it had been ""in active and productive"" talks with lessors and others.
A Malaysian court in February granted the airline leave to convene separate meetings with its different groups of creditors within six months, to vote on its scheme.
The meeting is scheduled for late July or August, AirAsia X said.
In March, the court also granted AirAsia X a three-month order against any proceedings that may be filed against it, which could have slowed down its restructuring.
Planemaker Airbus last year joined more than a dozen creditors to challenge the debt restructuring plan, telling the court it stands to lose more than $5 billion worth of orders if the proposal goes through.
Other challengers include lessor BOC Aviation (BOCA), which called for a debt-to-equity swap.
Airbus said it cannot comment on the airline's ongoing restructuring plan, while BOCA said it does not comment on individual customers.

AirAsia X in February proposed a separate restructuring programme for its aircraft lessors that aims to address their concerns about forward commercial agreements and the viability of the airline's business after recapitalisation.

CHICAGO/ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) told the U.S. government that a ransomware attack on the company that disrupted meat production in North America and Australia originated from a criminal organization likely based in Russia, the White House said on Tuesday.
JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, said on Tuesday night it had made ""significant progress in resolving the cyberattack."" The ""vast majority"" of the company's beef, pork, poultry and prepared foods plants will be operational on Wednesday, according to a statement, easing concerns over rising food prices.
The cyberattack followed one last month by a group with ties to Russia on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, which crippled fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast. 
JBS halted cattle slaughter at all its U.S. plants on Tuesday, according to union officials. On Monday, the attack caused Australian operations to shut down. 
""Our systems are coming back online and we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat,"" said Andre Nogueira, chief executive of JBS USA.
With North American operations headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, JBS controls about 20% of the slaughtering capacity for U.S. cattle and hogs.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States contacted Russia's government and that the FBI was investigating.
""The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,"" Jean-Pierre said.
JBS sells beef and pork under the Swift brand, with retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) carrying its pork loins and tenderloins. JBS also owns most of chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Co, which sells organic chicken under the Just Bare brand. 
Ongoing shutdowns of JBS plants would threaten to raise meat prices further for American consumers during summer grilling season and to disrupt meat exports at a time of strong demand from China.
""The supply chains, logistics and transportation that keep our society moving are especially vulnerable to ransomware, where attacks on choke points can have outsized effects and encourage hasty payments,"" said threat researcher John Hultquist with security company FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE).
The disruption quickly had an impact on Tuesday, industry analysts said. U.S. meatpackers slaughtered 22% fewer cattle than a week earlier and 18% than a year earlier, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Pork processing was also down.
Prices for choice and select cuts of U.S. beef shipped to wholesale buyers in large boxes each jumped more than 1%, the USDA said.
The USDA contacted several major meat processors to encourage them to keep supplies moving and slaughter additional livestock when possible, according to a statement. The agency also urged meatpackers to make their IT and supply-chain infrastructure more durable.
Federal agencies including the USDA and Department of Homeland Security are closely monitoring meat and poultry supplies, a White House official said. The agencies are also working with agricultural processors to ensure no price manipulation occurs as a result of the cyberattack, the official said.
AFFECTED SYSTEMS SUSPENDED
JBS said it suspended all affected systems, notified authorities and that backup servers were not affected. A representative in Sao Paulo said there was no impact on Brazilian operations.
The company said Sunday's cyberattack affected its North American and Australian IT systems and ""resolution of the incident will take time, which may delay certain transactions with customers and suppliers.""
U.S. beef and pork prices are already rising as China increases imports, animal feed costs rise and slaughterhouses face a dearth of workers. Any further impact on consumers will depend on how long JBS plants remain closed, analysts said.
JBS Beef in Cactus (NYSE:WHD), Texas, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that there would be no production for fabrication, slaughtering or rendering on one shift on Wednesday. Another shift will have regular start times for employees.
An early shift was also canceled on Wednesday at JBS' beef plant in Greeley after the cyberattack, but a later shift was scheduled to resume normally, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 said in an email.
A pork plant in Ottumwa, Iowa, will have no ""harvest production"" on its first or second shifts on Wednesday, according to a Facebook post that said the company was ""continuing to work through our IT issues."" Some other aspects of the plant are operating, according to the post.
JBS Canada said in a Facebook post that it operated a shift at its beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, on Tuesday, after canceling shifts earlier in the day and on Monday.
The United States Cattlemen's Association, a beef industry group, said on Twitter that it had reports of JBS redirecting livestock haulers who arrived at plants with animals ready for slaughter.

Last year, cattle and hogs backed up on U.S. farms and some animals were euthanized when meat plants were shut during coronavirus outbreaks among workers.
Over the past few years, ransomware has evolved into a pressing national security issue. A number of gangs, many of them Russian speakers, develop the software that encrypts files and then demand payment in cryptocurrency for keys that allow the owners to decipher and use them again.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 07:22PM ET</span>",EU reaches deal on tax transparency for multinational firms,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union government and parliament negotiators reached a deal on Tuesday on rules that will force large multinational companies to disclose how much revenue and tax they pay in the 27-nation bloc and how much in countries considered tax havens by the EU.
The new law, proposed by the European Commission in 2016, is part of the EU's efforts to fight tax avoidance by large international companies at a time when the EU badly needs cash to finance an economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the new law, multinational corporations with a turnover of more than 750 million euros ($916 million) annually in two consecutive years will have to declare profits, tax and number of employees in EU countries and in countries on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions.
But data on tax paid in other countries outside the EU and not on the tax havens blacklist will only be given in aggregated form as EU governments did not want to agree to a more detailed country-by-country breakdown.
The Oxfam charity group criticised that saying many of the world's tax havens were not on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions and therefore would avoid scrutiny.
""Transparency for only the 27 EU member states and the 21 currently blacklisted or greylisted jurisdictions means keeping corporate secrecy for over 3 out of 4 of the world's nearly 200 countries,"" the Oxfam charity group said.  
""EU legislators have granted multinational corporations plenty of opportunities to continue dodging taxes in secrecy by shifting their profits to tax havens outside the EU, like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Switzerland,"" Oxfam's tax expert Chiara  Putaturo said.
She said the deal also offered companies a reporting exemption for commercially sensitive information for five years, providing a way to avoid disclosure and noted the large turnover requirement would exclude up to 90% of multinationals.
But some members of the European Parliament who negotiated the deal said it would still help make the tax system fairer.
""These tax transparency measures will help to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share and can bring some fairness to how they operate,"" said Greens MEP Ernest Urtasun of the parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee.
According to the Tax Justice Network think tank, EU countries are responsible for 36% of tax lost globally to corporate tax abuse, costing countries worldwide over $154 billion every year as profits are shifted to low tax jurisdictions like Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

The text of the agreement must now go through formal adoption in two European Parliament committees and the parliament’s plenary and in the Council of EU governments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global equities set both an intraday high and record close on Tuesday as investors weighed the latest U.S. economic data for signs of a rebound and rising inflation, while Wall Street's main indexes wavered before ending little changed.
Energy shares were among the best performing during the session as the OPEC+ alliance agreed to hike output in July and gave a bullish forecast. U.S. crude futures rose to their highest in more than two years. The dollar ended little changed, while Treasures, gold and bitcoin slipped. Financial shares countered declines in healthcare.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.75% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.32%.
Emerging market stocks rose 1.06%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.87% higher, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.16%.
""The major equity market indices may have finished the day roughly unchanged, but look no further than energy and oil markets for evidence that the reopening trade is alive and well,"" said Elyse Ausenbaugh, a global market strategist and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Private Bank.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.86 points, or 0.13%, to 34,575.31, the S&P 500 lost 2.07 points, or 0.05%, to 4,202.04 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.26 points, or 0.09%, to 13,736.48.
Investors cheered signs of an improving economy ahead of a week packed with major data they hope to cast light on the economic recovery, analysts said.
U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in May, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Tuesday, as its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.2 last month from 60.7 in April. Pent-up demand amid a reopening economy has boosted orders, but unfinished work has piled up because of shortages of raw materials and labour.
""Markets are letting the macroeconomic data lead the way with Treasury prices lower and yields higher after strong numbers this morning,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, adding that news of oil supplies rapidly drawing down, which will lead to higher oil prices, has prompted traders.
""They are interpreting higher yields as a signal to sell technology holdings and buy cyclical companies in the Energy, Materials and Financials sector,"" Zaccarelli said.
New U.S. jobs data on Friday should also give a firmer steer on near-term Fed policy action.
OIL GAINS
Brent futures settled up 93 cents, or 1.3%, to $70.25 a barrel after hitting $71 earlier in the session - its highest intra-day price since March 8. U.S. crude ended $1.40, or 2.1%, higher at $67.72. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing supply curbs through July. Meanwhile, Americans escaped their pandemic doldrums over this past three-day holiday weekend, taking to the skies and roads and spurring hopes for a recovery in U.S. fuel demand. [O/R]
""Memorial Day just brought the Transportation Security Administration's busiest day since the start of the pandemic, and data from GasBuddy suggested that we saw the highest Sunday demand for gasoline in the U.S. since the summer of 2019,"" added Ausenbaugh of JP Morgan Private Bank.
This week's main event is Friday's U.S. payrolls data, with markets looking for a signal from the Federal Reserve on when it will start tapering its bond-buying programme. Median forecasts are that 650,000 jobs were added in May, but the outcome is uncertain following April's unexpectedly weak 266,000 gain. Though U.S. inflation data last week exceeded estimates, another big miss on the jobs front would delay prospects for any wind-down of stimulus, analysts say. As traders awaited clues on Fed direction, the dollar index rose 0.136%, with the euro down 0.08% to $1.2215, while the yield on U.S. 10-year government debt last fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.6096%, from 1.593% 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.118 points or 0.13%, to 89.913.

Concerns about global inflation have driven gold up 8% this month to comfortably above $1,900.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is failing to do its part to protect national security and keep sensitive technology out of the hands of China's military, according to a U.S. congressional advisory report seen by Reuters. 
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report, due to be published on Tuesday, said the Commerce Department had been slow to create a list of sensitive technology that should be scrutinized before export to China. 
    The lag in developing the list of emerging and foundational technologies, as required by a 2018 law, may exacerbate national security risks, the report said.
    The Commerce Department, entrusted to strengthen U.S. export control laws, ""has, to date, failed to carry out its responsibilities,"" said the report, titled, ""Unfinished Business: Export Control and Foreign Investment Reforms.""
    In a statement, the Commerce Department declined to directly respond to the lack of a list, but noted it had published four rules on controls on emerging technologies and more are pending.
It also said it had expanded the military end user rule and added companies to its entity list, which restricts U.S. suppliers from selling to companies like Huawei Technologies and Hangzhou Hikvision. 
    In 2018, Congress tightened U.S. export policies and the process for screening foreign investment in response to efforts by Chinese entities to obtain sensitive U.S. technology and use civilian innovation for the military. 
    The report questions whether a more-than-two-year delay in developing the list should be investigated by the Commerce Department's inspector general. It also asks whether the authority to enforce export controls should be delegated to another agency. 
    Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to make it harder to export key technologies to adversaries like China. 
    The law directed the Commerce Department to work with other agencies to identify emerging, or cutting edge, technologies and so-called foundational technologies essential to making key items like semiconductors, that should be controlled.
    In November 2018, the department published 45 examples of emerging technologies, including face and voice recognition, but no list was ever finalized. And it has yet to propose a list of foundational technologies, instead asking for input in August about how to define the category.
Eric Hirschhorn, a former Commerce under secretary, said the criticism of the agency was unfair. ""They’re already controlling emerging technologies to the extent that it can be done, which is limited by the need to be specific,” he said. “Foundational technologies are, by definition, widely available outside the United States, which makes controlling them difficult, if not impossible."" 
    The report did note some actions by Commerce. 
The department has proposed to regulate software for gene editing, which can make it easier to develop biological weapons, but the rule has not been finalized. It also released an interim rule on geospatial imagery involving AI neural networks.

    Advanced surveillance technology has received some attention as well, including on export controls to promote human rights, given its use in Xinjiang for the detention of minority Muslim Uyghurs. But the department still does not control newer types of advanced surveillance software, the report says.
The U.S.-China commission was created by Congress two decades ago to report on the national security implications of trade with China. It is now chaired by Carolyn Bartholomew, who was appointed by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

Zoom became a household name and investor favorite in the past year, as businesses and schools switched to its services for virtual classes, office meetings and socializing. 
But with rapid vaccination efforts and life slowly returning to normal, analysts are skeptical of the sustainability of Zoom's growth, especially with rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) snapping at its heels. 
""The extent to which Zoom can compete sustainably with the likes of Cisco and Microsoft remains to be seen over the next few quarters as we begin to enter true COVID comparable quarters,"" said Joe McCormack, senior analyst at Third Bridge.
However, the San Jose, California-based company assuaged some of those concerns by forecasting current-quarter revenue in the range of $985 million to $990 million, above Wall Street's estimate of $931.8 million, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
Shares of the company were up 2%, after falling as much as 5% in after-market trading on higher costs. In the first quarter ended April 30, costs jumped 155% to $265 million.
The surging number of free users on Zoom's platform has led to higher costs for the company, which operates some of its own data centers.

Zoom, which had come under scrutiny for security related issues, is shifting focus on its two-year-old cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms as bigger players Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google amp up their video products.
Zoom posted adjusted profit of $1.32 per share on revenue that nearly tripled to $956.2 million in the quarter, compared with estimates of a profit of 99 cents and $906 million in revenue.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 dipped on Tuesday, with declines in healthcare and tech shares countered by energy and financial gains, as investors weighed the latest U.S. economic data for signs of a rebound and rising inflation.
The S&P 500 financial sector hit a record high, while expected growth in fuel demand boosted oil prices and helped lift the energy sector 3.9%, its biggest one-day gain in nearly four months. The heavyweight tech sector fell while the healthcare sector was dragged down by a weak profit forecast from  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT).

""So this is a microcosm of what we are already hearing about and seeing in the overall economy and it's just a reminder that inflation remains a concern.""
Stock markets on Friday brushed off a surge in key inflation readings for April following reassurances from Federal Reserve officials that the central bank's ultra-loose monetary policy would remain in place.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari and Fed Vice Chair for supervision Randal Quarles on Tuesday reiterated the view that higher prices would be transitory.
This week's focus will be on a raft of economic data, culminating with U.S. payrolls due on Friday.

A group of ""meme stocks"" extended gains from the previous week, with shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc up 22.7% after the movie theater chain said it sold $230 million of its stock.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",AMC shares soar nearly 23% after fund buys and flips $230 million stake,"(Reuters) -A hedge fund that helped AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings raise $230 million quickly sold its stake in the world's largest cinema chain at a profit, according to a source on Tuesday, when the ""meme stock"" soared more than 20%.
The move by Mudrick Capital Management to flip 8.5 million shares of the movie theater chain immediately after buying them in a private placement from the company shows how Wall Street is getting bolder about making a quick buck off a trading frenzy that has helped fuel big rallies in several stocks favored by retail investors.
Easy money from the Federal Reserve has ""created an almost video game-like atmosphere in the stock market and investing,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. ""There's money flowing everywhere and this is a great illustration of that.""
AMC said earlier Tuesday it issued https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-074526 8.5 million shares to Mudrick, the chain's latest share sale this year as it cashes in on a big jump in its stock in 2021.
Mudrick has sold its AMC stake at a profit, believing the company's shares are overvalued, the source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Additional details could not be immediately determined.
AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mudrick's divestiture reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
AMC said it would invest the proceeds in its existing theaters, which are set to benefit from a recovery in demand as more states lift COVID-19 restrictions on social gatherings.
""This can be a real way for AMC to grow again, creating immediate value for AMC shareholders,"" Chief Executive Adam Aron wrote in a Twitter thread https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1399683077660721152. ""This is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company.""
AMC's stock closed up nearly 23% at $32.04, leading a rally in other meme stocks.
The muted response in AMC shares to news of Mudrick's flip ""shows you that this isn't a stock that moves on fundamentals,"" said Kim Caughey Forrest, Chief Investment Officer at Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. ""It's a lottery ticket to the buyers of the stock.""
AMC's stock is up more than 1,400% so far this year in a meme stock rally that has picked up in recent weeks, including video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other favorites frequently discussed on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum.
GameStop shares, which rallied more than 1,600% in January, closed up more than 12%.
AMC has so far raised about $1.35 billion through share sales since December 2020.
Jason Mudrick founded London and New York-based Mudrick Capital in 2009 after leaving investment firm Contrarian Capital Management, where he had focused on distressed investing for eight years, according to the hedge fund's website.
Mudrick's firm, which managed $3.8 billion in assets as of last month, specializes in long and short investments in distressed credit, its website said.
Hedge funds like Mudrick will sometimes take down a share sale and quickly flip it as long as no lockup provision bars that for a specified period, said one U.S. based hedge fund.
""I don't know if it happens every day, but it's certainly a common practice.""
Sentiment around AMC was also supported by strong weekend box office collections in North America, led by John Krasinski's post-apocalyptic thriller ""A Quiet Place Part II,"" one of the first major theatrical releases since last year.

The Memorial Day holiday is also expected to have boosted ticket sales as widespread vaccinations bring in more Americans to theaters.
The share sale shows that AMC is ""obviously forward-leaning here and trying to be opportunistic,"" said Mike Hickey, an analyst at The Benchmark Company. ""There's concern on dilution and there's concern on leverage but if you can raise money ... you'd be a fool not to.""

848,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>",Senators criticize U.S. airlines over voucher expiration dates,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senators on Monday criticized seven major U.S. airlines for failing to make all pandemic-related flight credits valid indefinitely and vowed to pursue legislative or regulatory actions in response.
Democrats Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the airlines trade group had ""refused to offer any commitment to expand cash refund policies or eliminate expiration dates for pandemic-related flight credits.""
The lawmakers said the airlines ""continue to sit on more than $10 billion in unused flight credits and are still refusing to return consumers' hard-earned money, more than a year after the pandemic began.""
Without removing expiration dates, ""your company may be encouraging travelers to fly before they feel safe boarding a plane, lest they lose tickets that they have already purchased,"" they added.
On Friday, trade group Airlines for America representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and others told the senators in a letter that major U.S. airlines issued $12.84 billion in cash refunds to customers in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic upended the travel industry.
The group declined further comment Monday.
Airlines have faced criticism over their handling of redemptions for flights canceled during the pandemic.
In the letter, reviewed by Reuters, Nicholas Calio, the group's chief executive, said U.S. airlines had maintained a steadfast commitment to the traveling public during the pandemic and issued refunds in accordance with all federal laws and regulations.

The cash refunds, which accounted for about 20% of airline revenues last year, came on top of billions of dollars of travel credits that are now being used ""at a rapid clip"" to book fresh flights, he said. 
The redemption of vouchers currently accounted for 10% to 15% of carriers' monthly ticket sales and was expected to increase in coming months as the pandemic winds down, Calio added.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 06:06PM ET</span>","KKR, CD&R take data analytics firm Cloudera private for $4.7 billion","By Chavi Mehta and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -Private equity firms Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC (CD&R) and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) will take Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) Inc private for $4.7 billion, the cloud-based data analytics company said on Tuesday.
Shares of Cloudera jumped 23.9% to $15.93, near the offer price of $16 per share in cash.
Cloudera provides cloud-based software and platforms to enterprises in highly regulated industries, including financial firms and government agencies. Its largest shareholder is Carl Icahn, who holds about 17.8% of Cloudera's total shares, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of the Palo Alto-based company have largely underperformed since it went public in 2017. The company's quarterly revenue rose 7% to $224.3 million and its net loss per share narrowed to 14 cents, it said on Tuesday. 
Once a high-growth company, Cloudera has struggled to make money and maintain its growth rate. As it doubles down on hybrid cloud solutions that operate across cloud providers, Cloudera thinks it's easier to do so without the pressure of quarterly reporting. 
""We believe in hybrid cloud and want to continue to invest to expand our offerings. Being a private company can help us go through the transition more smoothly,"" said Mick Hollison, president at Cloudera.
With an uptick in demand since the COVID-19 pandemic last year, major cloud services providers including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been pushing to provide similar services to those offered by Cloudera. 
Bloomberg reported last June that Cloudera had been exploring a sale after getting takeover interest.
The deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, includes a 30-day ""go-shop"" period, which allows the company to consider alternative offers without penalty. 

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Cloudera, while GCA Advisors, BofA Securities, William Blair, Perella Weinberg Partners, Cowen and J.P. Morgan advised KKR and CD&R.
Separately, Cloudera said it would acquire software-as-a-service platforms Datacoral and Cazena to boost its public cloud offering. The terms of the deals were not disclosed.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 06:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rebuffs J&J appeal over $2 billion baby powder judgment,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s bid to overturn a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's baby powder and other talc products.
The justices turned away a J&J appeal and left in place a Missouri state court ruling in litigation brought by 22 women whose claims were heard together in one trial. 
The Missouri Court of Appeals, an intermediate state appellate court, last year ruled against J&J's bid to throw out the compensatory and punitive damages awarded to the plaintiffs but reduced the total to $2.12 billion from the $4.69 billion originally decided by a jury.
J&J, which will make a payment of $2.5 billion this month including accrued interest, said in a statement that there are unresolved legal issues that will continue to be litigated. It previously has said it faces more than 19,000 similar claims.
""The matters that were before the court are related to legal procedure, and not safety. Decades of independent scientific evaluations confirm Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer,"" the company said.
J&J shares were down about 1.2% at $167.23.
J&J has argued that a decision by a Missouri circuit court judge to consolidate disparate baby powder-related claims from the plaintiffs - including 17 women from outside the state - for a trial before a single jury violated the New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company's due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. J&J also has argued that the size of the jury's damages award violated its due process rights.
The Missouri Supreme Court, the state's highest court, in November declined to hear J&J's appeal of the Missouri Court of Appeals ruling, prompting the company to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
""This was a victory not just for the amazing women and their families who we were privileged to represent, but a victory for justice,"" said Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
DISPUTE OVER JURISDICTION
The plaintiffs, nine of whom have died and are now represented by their estates, have argued that Missouri courts have jurisdiction over out-of-state claims like those brought in this litigation. One of the products that the out-of-state plaintiffs said they had used was manufactured in Missouri. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs also have argued that the large punitive damages awarded by the jury in this case were justified by J&J's conduct. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in court papers it is common practice for courts to consolidate cases at trial when the facts in each claim are essentially the same.
The Missouri Court of Appeals concluded that it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that J&J ""disregarded the safety of consumers"" in its drive for profit despite knowing its talc products caused ovarian cancer. It also found ""significant reprehensibility"" in J&J's conduct.
In addition to reducing the damages, the Missouri Court of Appeals dismissed two of the 17 out-of-state plaintiffs.
In court papers, J&J said the case followed a ""winning formula"" devised by plaintiffs' lawyers of bringing claims in jurisdictions where they can get dozens of out-of-state plaintiffs to testify in a single trial, prejudicing the jury and resulting in ""outsized"" damages awards.
In the Missouri trial, the company said, the jury awarded each plaintiff an identical punitive damages award of $25 million, regardless of the facts specific to each plaintiff or whether they were alive or dead. The company also said the jury awarded punitive damages much larger than the ""already staggering"" compensatory damages, which J&J has called a further violation of its due process rights.
Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the appeal, likely because he owns J&J stock. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose father - now retired - was a longtime lobbyist for the toiletries industry, also did not take part. The justices do not explain why they step aside in certain cases.

A 2018 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer found that J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a carcinogen, was present in its talc products. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.
The company said in May 2020 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-babypowder/johnson-johnson-to-stop-selling-talc-baby-powder-in-u-s-and-canada-idUSKBN22V32U it would stop selling its baby powder talc in the United States and Canada, citing changes in consumer habits and what it called ""misinformation"" about the product's safety amid numerous legal challenges.

Should that happen, we think it would be wise to bet on established tech stocks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), SAP (SAP), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and STMicroelectronics (STM) at lower valuations. The products and services these companies deliver are essential to the world and, hence, in the event of a broad market swoon, their stocks should rebound and deliver significant returns. Let’s discuss.While most tech stocks soared to unprecedented highs last year driven by investor exuberance, investors have been rotating out of tech stocks this year. This change in sentiment can be attributed to the reopening economy, which is motivating investors to seek undervalued cyclical stocks that have the potential to gain from the economic recovery at the expense of expensive tech stocks. Investors’ pessimism on tech stocks is evident in Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) 6.5% gains so far this year compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 12.4% returns.
Given rising inflation, many analysts are speculating a stock market crash in the near term. Should that happen, it would be wise to scoop up the shares of quality tech stocks companies that look expensive now but might trade at a discount at that time. After all, the tech industry has the potential to rebound quickly from any slump given the increasing demand for its products and services. According to GoRemotely, the tech industry is expected to hit a $5 trillion market value by the end of 2021.

JBS declined to comment on the decision handed down by Judge Marcelo Silva Porto, saying it does not discuss ongoing lawsuits. 
Porto's ruling also called for modifying work schedules to reduce the number of workers per shift at JBS' plant in the Ana Rech district of Caxias do Sul, where it processes poultry. Workers at that plant should also be provided with protective masks, individual lockers and should stay at least two meters apart, the ruling said, according to a statement from the labor prosecutors. 
In the United States, the company has also faced claims that it failed to protect employees from the virus. 
For example, in September 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed $15,615 in penalties be imposed on JBS Foods Inc, after it found the company's plant in Greeley, Colorado, did not protect employees from exposure to the novel coronavirus. 
Brazil's Ana Rech unit became the site of the first indoor outbreak of the coronavirus in Caxias do Sul, which led to the temporary shutdown of the plant in June 2020, the prosecutors said. 
Mandatory testing of all employees was also carried out at the facility when the outbreak occurred, the statement noted. Of the 1,538 tests performed, 410 gave positive results. 

JBS may appeal the ruling, prosecutors said.

Given this backdrop, we think  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and BioNTech (BNTX) should witness significant growth in the coming months.The biotech industry has been caught squarely in the limelight since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, as companies worldwide have raced to develop a vaccine. While several vaccines have been launched in the international markets since last year, an acute global vaccine shortage is the biggest concern now. Consequently, popular biotech companies with highly effective vaccines have been trying to expand their production capacities to meet the demand. Furthermore, the demand for drugs used in the treatment of this infection has also risen over time as several countries have witnessed the changing nature of the disease and its side effects.
In the United States, nearly 164 million people, or 49.5% of the population, have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The Biden administration’s $10 million investment to expand access to the COVID-19 vaccines in the hardest hit communities in March has been a major driver in the country’s fast-paced vaccination program. Nevertheless, with some 50% of the population yet to be fully vaccinated, biotech companies with a vaccine candidate are expected to generate substantial revenues in the coming months. In addition, many companies have made major breakthroughs in the treatment of life-threatening ailments, thanks to the advancements in the field of biotechnology. And the industry’s focus on critical ailments is increasing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black, the billionaire who until recently had led private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc for more than three decades, was sued on Tuesday by a woman who accused him of defamation and subjecting her to sexual violence.
Guzel Ganieva said Black lied by denying her March 17 accusations on Twitter that he had ""sexually harassed and abused"" her ""for years,"" when he told news media in April he had ""foolishly had a consensual affair"" with her and that she extorted him.
The complaint said Black subjected Ganieva over several years to numerous instances of unwanted sexual conduct. It referred twice to his alleged ""sexual assaults and rapes"" of her, and specifically described one alleged rape from 2014.
""Ms. Ganieva's allegations of harassment and other inappropriate behavior are categorically untrue,"" a spokesman for Black said in a statement. ""Mr. Black emphatically denies each and every spurious allegation put forth in this lawsuit and looks forward to disproving them in court."" 
The spokesman also said Black made ""substantial monetary payments"" to Ganieva based on her threats to go public about their relationship. He did not specify a dollar amount.
Ganieva said in her complaint that she received unspecified ""regular payments"" from Black for 5-1/2 years after she signed a nondisclosure agreement in October 2015.
She said Black moved to silence her for his alleged misconduct by coercing her into signing the agreement, in exchange for forgiving $960,000 of loans he had made and which she could not repay.
Black, 69, stepped down this year as Apollo's chief executive and chairman, after an independent review conducted by the Dechert law firm said he had paid the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning.
The Dechert report found Black was not involved with Epstein's criminal activities. Black said at the time he deeply regretted his involvement with Epstein.
Ganieva, a Russian native now in her late 30s, said Black picked her out of a crowd at a 2008 International Women's Day event, and later accompanied her to top restaurants, Broadway shows, cultural events and private parties.

""He didn't try to keep her a secret,"" Ganieva's lawyer Jeanne Christensen said in a telephone interview.

Indeed, according to a Meticulous Research report, the EV market is expected to grow at a 33.6% CAGR over the next six years.
However, the production costs for EVs are increasing in-part because of a global semiconductor chip shortage.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed flat Tuesday, struggling for direction as an energy-led jump in value stocks was offset by weakness in tech and healthcare.
The S&P 500 fell 0.05%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.14%, or 46 points, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1%.
Energy jumped 4% as U.S. oil prices rose to their highest levels since October 2018 on bets of increasing energy demand after OPEC and its allies reportedly agreed to raise production by about 450,000 barrels per day starting July.
Financials, mostly banks were boosted by a rise in Treasury yields, which tend to boost the interest income earned by banks.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 1%.
The strong start to the shortened trading week for cyclicals comes as investors continue to bet the economy has plenty of room to grow.
""Strong economic growth prospects lead us to a cyclical bias. We favor the Communication Services, energy, financials, industrials, and materials sectors,"" Wells Fargo said.
But some, however, have cautioned against making overly bullish bets that a strong economy will lead stocks higher.
""Last year, we had this big divergence between what was happening in the economy, and what happened in the stock market,"" Phillip Toews, CEO & Portfolio Manager of Toews Asset Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. ""I think that's worth paying attention to, because there's not necessarily a correlation between a growing economy and a rising stock market.""
The broader market, meanwhile, could also have a difficult road ahead if the ongoing rotation from growth to value continues to keep a lid on tech amid an overvalued market that has been driven by momentum.
""We're overvalued … the focus should be on valuations, and they're high,"" Toews added. ""Ultimately, if tech does suffer and turn into a bigger bear market that will draw the rest of the market lower.""
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), traded lower, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were mixed.
Tech will continue to be driven by expectations about U.S. government bond yields amid an ongoing debate on whether inflation is transitory.
The Federal Reserve has maintained its stance that the factors driving the spike in inflation are transitory, but some market participates including Allianz (DE:ALVG) chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian warned again Tuesday that the Fed is behind the curve and could ultimately be forced to rein its accommodative monetary policy measures more aggressively and sooner than many expect.
""I would agree with El-Erian that capacity issues and supply shortages are all signs of classic inflation,"" Toews added.  ""Normally, the Fed was very concerned about making sure they were in front of it [inflation] and they're not now."" ""The Fed is so used to weighing in on trying to support the economy, that maybe they're not balancing that enough on the other side of equation [in terms of inflation] which is one of their mandates.""
Healthcare, meanwhile, was dragged more than 1% lower by a slump in  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). 
Johnson and Johnson fell more than 2% after the Supreme Court rejected the company's appeal seeking to overturn the $2.1 billion damages claim over allegations that its talc powder products, including baby powder, causes cancer.
The Reddit meme trade, meanwhile, picked up from where it left off last week, led by a 23% surge in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) even as the theatre chain sold 8.5 million common shares to Mudrick Capital Management, raising about $230.5 million.

DENVER (Reuters) - Small U.S. oilfield service companies are selling equipment and shutting their doors as business activity shrank last year and contract prices have remained below profitable levels despite oil-price gains. 
The companies that provide equipment and services to the shale oil industry were among the hardest hit after the coronavirus pandemic sent oil prices reeling to record lows last year. The departures of loss-making businesses have raised the hopes of larger firms that industry margins will rise. 
The exit of those firms could help pricing recover across the industry. Discounted prices offered by less powerful competitors have hurt what larger service companies can charge, said Chris Wright, chief executive of hydraulic fracturing company Liberty Oilfield Services (NYSE:LBRT), in an interview. 
""You're always impacted by pricing from competitors,"" said Wright, whose firm is the second largest U.S. fracker. ""Weaker and lower-tech competitors are struggling to get work. They offer very low prices, and not prices they can sustain for the long-term. We do not match those prices.""
Oklahoma City-based fracking company Legend Oilfield & Energy Services in May said it was ceasing some operations and laid off 118 employees at it Longview, Texas, facility. The company operates oilfield equipment in Texas and North Dakota. 
Permian International Auctions this month will auction off all of ABC Rental Tool Company's equipment in New Mexico in a sale that includes real estate. In Louisiana, S3 Pump Service last week auctioned off its equipment in a complete liquidation of its business, according to a brochure from Superior Energy Auctioneers. 
A person who answered the phone at Legend Energy Services declined to answer questions. S3 Pump Services and ABC Rental Tool could not be reached for comment. 

""We're at about the bottom for pricing that we expected,"" said Mark Chapman, vice president of oilfield services intelligence at consultancy Enverus. ""There are some indications that [an increase] is around the corner."" 
Larger service firms have been disciplined about not putting equipment to work without reasonable returns, Chapman said, while smaller companies ""have been more desperate.""

As a result, two prominent specialty apparel manufacturers—The Gap (GPS) and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO)—have reported revenue and earnings growth for the last quarter. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.The Gap, Inc. (GPS) and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO) are two of the most popular retail apparel manufacturers based in the United States. With an international market presence, both companies are known for their distinctive products and garments, which they sell through retail stores and e-commerce platforms.
To remain profitable amid a pandemic, the global apparel industry has been adapting to shifting industry trends over the past year. E-commerce sales accounted for most of the revenues generated by companies last year, given the social distancing protocols. However, traditional brick-and-mortar apparel stores are witnessing a gradual rise in foot traffic lately as the mass vaccination drive and gradual easing of social distancing restrictions drive increasing demand for trendy outdoor apparel. Furthermore, with people engaging in more social activities this summer given the high pent-up demand for such pursuits, sales of trendy garments are increasing. Consequently, the global apparel market is expected to grow at a rate of 20.5% year-over-year to $635.17 billion in fiscal 2021.
AEO has gained 271.4% over the past year, while GPS returned 248.8%. In terms of year-to-date performance, AEO is the clear winner with 76.5% gains vs GPS’ 65.7% returns. AEO gained 91.5% over the past six months, compared to GPS’ 53.8% gains.

(Reuters) -Discovery Inc said on Tuesday that the recently announced global entertainment and media business created with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and WarnerMedia assets will be named Warner Bros. Discovery.
Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav made the announcement during a meeting with WarnerMedia employees at the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, Calif., the company said. WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar asked Zaslav questions, according to a source familiar with the meeting, in which Zaslav introduced himself and Discovery to WarnerMedia employees.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and Discovery said in May that they would combine content from WarnerMedia - including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, news network CNN and sports programming - and Discovery's unscripted shows from lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC.
The deal underscores the movement of TV viewership to streaming, where scale is required to take on the likes of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.
Discovery's Zaslav will lead Warner Bros. Discovery, which is expected to see $3 billion in cost synergies with no plans to sell any assets. The deal is anticipated to close in mid-2022, pending approval by Discovery shareholders and regulatory approvals. 
The enterprise value of the combined company will be more than $120 billion, carrying $58 billion in debt, including $43 billion from WarnerMedia and $15 billion from Discovery.
AT&T said it will use the $43 billion proceeds from the tax-free spin-off of its media assets to pay down its more than $160 billion of debt.

On a call with reporters May 17, executives said additional details - including how the combined properties and services will be arranged - have yet to be worked out. 
During an internal meeting on May 27 Kilar said that he plans to remain in his role through this year and will reassess his options in 2022, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Warburg on Tuesday became the first banker to be jailed over a multi-year scam to bilk the German state of billions of euros by filing bogus claims for tax rebates on stock dividends.
A court in Bonn handed down a sentence of five years and six months for tax evasion against the banker, a spokeswoman said. Two months were docked from the sentence of the banker, who was not named, due to the length of the trial.
The court also did not identify the banker's attorney. Unless defendants are publicly well known, their identity can be protected under German law to avoid prejudicing legal proceedings.
The regional court is hearing several cases over the so-called ""cum-ex"" scandal, in which bankers are accused of helping clients claim multiple rebates by shuffling ownership of shares on the day dividend payments fell due.

Two British bankers received suspended sentences in March 2020 for their part in the cum-ex fraud. Tuesday's sentence, which can be appealed, is the first jail term to be imposed in the saga.
M.M. Warburg, which is based in Hamburg, said the sentence would have no financial impact on it. The bank, which has already settled tax dues owed from the years 2007-11, was dropped as a defendant in the case in February.

However, not all stocks are expected to benefit from the industry tailwinds. As such, we think it is wise to avoid Lightspeed (LSPD),  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN), and Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) due to their weak financials. Read on to learn why.Companies that provide cloud-based services grew exponentially last year as COVID-19-pandemic-led restrictions compelled most businesses to operate remotely. With continuing innovation in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), among others, the cloud industry is expected to gain in the long-term also. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 17.9% CAGR between 2021- 2028.
Nevertheless, investors are rotating away from expensive tech stocks into cyclical stocks amid the economic recovery and this is driving cloud stocks to weak performances as well. This is evident in First Trust Cloud Computing ETF’s (SKYY) 1.9% loss over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 10.4% gains. Also, companies that offer cloud-based services face privacy and security concerns regarding data losses, data breaches, application vulnerabilities and online cyber-attacks.
With increasing competition in the cloud space, not all stocks are great buys. So, we think fundamentally weak cloud stocks Lightspeed POS Inc. (LSPD), Anaplan, Inc. (PLAN), and Appian Corporation (APPN) are best avoided now.

Underpinned by strong economic and consumption growth, these companies are poised to soar in the coming months. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Even though Beijing’s ‘crackdown’ on major tech companies has caused a decline in their stocks recently, the industry holds immense potential. According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, China’s technology stocks are attractive despite near-term uncertainty related to the regulatory crackdown.
Because the government is potentially curtailing these companies’ most lucrative businesses, such as fintech for e-commerce, they are now investing heavily in new areas of growth, such as cloud computing, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. Although the chances of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delisting Chinese stocks remain high, the threat does not seem to be impeding the companies’ business operations nor investor enthusiasm for the names.
Furthermore, because China’s economic recovery is happening faster than other major economies, investors are extremely bullish on Chinese stocks. Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts predict financially-solid Chinese stocks Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), Baidu, Inc. (BIDU), and HUYA Inc.

(Reuters) -Canopy Growth Corp's chief executive reassured investors that the world's most valuable pot producer is on track to be profitable within a year, shrugging off a slightly weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter performance.
The company - which sells a range of products from dried flowers to gummies, to chocolates and drinks mixed with weed - posted a near 38% surge in revenue to C$148.4 million in the quarter but missed estimates of C$151.8 million, according to Refinitiv IBES.
The company's revenue growth was subdued by a fresh round of COVID-19 related lockdowns in Canada and Germany, Canopy's CEO David Klein told Reuters in an interview.
While the company is ""a little concerned"" that the lockdowns, especially in Canada, might also hold back growth in the current quarter, Klein said the company was still on track to be profitable by the end of its current fiscal year.
""The way it looks, there will be sequential improvement (in adjusted EBITDA) throughout the year,"" Klein said.
A host of cost-cutting through last year helped Canopy narrow its quarterly adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to C$94 million from C$102 million.
""You have a company that is building on revenue growth success ... and a lot of their strategic initiatives are paying off when it comes to the brands they have in their portfolio,"" Global X analyst Andrew Little said.
Global X, which owns about 600,000  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) shares, runs a cannabis focused ETF.
Klien said the focus was now firmly on the U.S. market, where expectations were rising for federal marijuana reform.

""We're very happy with our portfolio in Canada and with the ability of that portfolio to travel to the U.S. ... wouldn't see us doing much more in the way of M&A in Canada"", Klein said on a post-earnings call.

Faced with stiff domestic opposition to the pact, the cabinet said last week it would break off talks with the bloc, which surrounds landlocked Switzerland.
""Failure to update the bilateral relationship between Switzerland and the EU will lead to the gradual erosion of existing accords and lower Swiss economic growth over time than would otherwise have been the case,"" Fitch said. 
""However, Switzerland’s wealthy, flexible, competitive economy should be fairly resilient and the government’s ample fiscal space remains an important shock absorber,"" it added.
Fitch said the failure of the framework agreement would impact the Swiss economy in several ways. 
Lapsing agreements, for example on cross-border trade, will increase trading costs for Swiss companies, while uncertainty over the future relationship will make Switzerland less attractive as a business location, it said.

Switzerland will also miss out on opportunities to gain additional access to the single market in areas such as the forthcoming energy union, Fitch said.

China's announcement on Monday to allow married couples to have up to three children - from the previous limit of two - also sent brokerage analysts scrambling to recommend stocks, despite a widely-shared perception that the policy shift won't have a sudden impact on the country's declining birth rate.
Shares in toy maker Goldlok Holdings (Guangdong) Co jumped to their 10% daily limit for the second day, as did shares in Jinfa Labi Maternity & Baby Articles Co. 
Other baby-related stocks, including milk powder maker Beingmate Co, baby products maker Shanghai Aiyingshi Co and toddler care equipment maker Ningbo David Medical Device Co also soared. 
An index tracking the so-called ""third baby concept"" stocks, newly compiled by Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday, while China's benchmark stock index was roughly flat. 
Hu Yunlong, a Beijing-based hedge fund manager, said the sharp gains in such stocks were the result of ""short-term speculation,"" as he sees limited immediate impact on corporate fundamentals. 
China lifted the cap on births in a bid to stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population. But analysts say the policy by itself is unlikely to boost many couples' willingness to have more children, given high childcare costs. 
Still, Xu Qi, investment adviser at Guosheng Securities, said Luolai Lifestyle Technology Co, which makes home textile products such as quilts and pillows, stands to benefit from the new policy. He also recommends Zhejiang Semir Garment Co, which makes children's clothes.
Essence International suggested investors pay attention to China Feihe Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed maker of infant milk formula products. 
Meanwhile, Chinese listed companies fielded questions from investors anxious to learn how their businesses will be affected by the new policy. 
Thinker Agricultural Machinery Co Ltd, a maker of rice harvesters, was asked if the company was a ""third-child concept"" stock.
""Thanks for your humorous question,"" the company replied in an online investor relations platform. 

The indirect relationship is that ""an increase in population will increase grain consumption...and demand for harvesters.
""But the precondition is...people are willing to have a third child.""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Shares of  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) fell more than 8% Tuesday as a falling number of Covid-19 cases has reduced demand for its testing-related business, forcing it to lower its full-year guidance.
Abbott President and Chief Executive Officer Robert B. Ford said there has been a rapid decline in demand for its testing services, and since they anticipate the trend to continue, they are now revising their guidance.
Full-year diluted earnings per share under GAAP are now seen at $2.75 to $2.95. These were expected to be $3.74 at least as per Abbott's April 20 forecast.
The company follows a calendar year.
“This (latest forecast) has been driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and, most recently, U.S. health authority guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals,” Abbott said in a note.
Global Covid-19 testing brought the company $2.2 billion in sales in the first quarter, about one-fifth of its total sales of $10.45 billion and more than half the $4.01 billion in revenue from diagnostics.

This has allowed the stock to gain in triple digits year-to-date. However, the company’s growth prospects look bleak, making its current valuation unsustainable. Let’s take a closer look. Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL) is a Canadian adult-use cannabis producer and supplier. The company achieved a milestone on May 11, as it reported positive earnings from operations for the first time in the most recent quarter ended March 31, 2021. Its earnings from operations came in at C$1.70 million ($1.41 million), indicating a substantial improvement from the negative year-ago value. Adjusted EBITDA stood at C$3.30 million ($2.73 million) compared to a loss of C$5.60 million ($4.64 million) in the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to a substantial decline in operating and SG&A expenses.
As a result, the stock gained 104.9% year-to-date, making it one of the top performers in the cannabis market. Shares of SNDL gained 10.2% over the past year, and 160.8% over the past six months. However, if we take a closer look, SNDL’s stellar financials for the fiscal first quarter is not a result of its operations.

Demand for the mountain is pent-up, consumers are rolling in it and that should lead to explosive growth. 
""We see MTN as being well positioned to tap into both of these themes, particularly since destination visitation to its western U.S. resorts (and Whistler) was subdued during the 2020-'21 ski season but appears poised to rebound strongly as Covid trends in the U.S. continue to trend lower,"" said analyst Chris Woronka, according to StreetInsider.
Earnings and sales got slammed by the pandemic with no one traveling for a long, long time. But that pent up demand has prompted shares to more than double since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.

While investors worry that higher inflation could force the European Central Bank to dial back its stimulus measures, policymakers have said in recent weeks that the rise in prices is transitory and have reaffirmed continued support.

Engine No. 1, which shocked investors and analysts last week by taking the board positions at Exxon’s annual shareholder meeting, is now planning to launch its first exchange-traded fund. The Transform 500 ETF’s goal is to encourage changes at the companies it holds through proxy voting, according to a regulatory filing.
“Some people think of ETFs as run by asset managers that passively track indexes and rubber stamp corporate decisions,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. “While that narrative isn’t based on reality, this pending ETF will provide those investors an alternative in hopes of changing corporate behavior.”
With the new fund, Engine No. 1 will aim to measure how companies are investing in their employees and the environment, using metrics like workforce diversity, employee health and safety, carbon emissions and land use. It will use a passive strategy involving companies in the Morningstar U.S. Large Cap Select Index.
Officials at the firm haven’t responded to a request for comment.
“Engine No. 1 hired some superstars from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and is now looking to become a force in the ETF marketplace,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital.
Hedge-fund veteran Chris James founded Engine No. 1 late last year, with a goal of pressing for change in the public and private companies it invests in. The San Francisco-based firm had about $250 million of internal money at its start, and plans to raise capital from retail as well as institutional investors.
It may face an uphill battle in the ETF realm. There are currently more than 2,400 products in the U.S. market, with about 90 of them focused on ESG investing. Inflows into equity-focused ESG ETFs have already reached almost $15 billion this year. If that pace keeps up, it could break 2020’s record of $31.1 billion.
Still, ESG advocates are heralding Engine No. 1’s recent victory as a sign that climate sustainability issues are becoming impossible to ignore. That’s bringing increased name recognition to the once-unknown firm.
The win “marks the first successful proxy fight with a focus on environmental or social issues,” Rob Du Boff, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note published last week. “This is key not just for Exxon and other oil majors, but for ESG investors at large.”

LONDON (Reuters) -Credit Suisse has lost a key dealmaker in Europe, two sources familiar with the move said, as a pay-driven exodus of top investment bankers which began in the United States spreads.
Switzerland's second-largest bank is struggling to retain staff after trimming bonuses to tackle losses of more than $5 billion stemming from the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos and the impact of suspending funds linked to collapsed British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital in April.
Armando Rubio-Alvarez, who heads the Swiss bank's financial institutions (FIG) franchise in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, is moving to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), the sources said.
His appointment follows the departure of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s global head of financial institutions, Alejandro Przygoda, who recently announced plans to move to Jefferies alongside three other bankers in his New York-based FIG team.
Rubio-Alvarez, whose move will be effective after the summer, will take on European responsibilities at Jefferies in addition to leading the bank's coverage of some of its biggest financial clients.
Credit Suisse declined to comment and Jefferies was not immediately available for comment.
Rubio-Alvarez became sole head of Credit Suisse's EMEA FIG team in December after an internal reorganization which saw the former unit co-head, Max Mesny, dropping his managerial role to take on a client-facing job as chairman of EMEA FIG and global fintech.
His departure is another blow to the scandal-hit bank where four other FIG bankers in New York - Tim Devine, David MacGown, Chris Eby and Nick Daly - recently quit to join rivals including  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the sources said.
Chris Williams (NYSE:WMB), who rejoined Credit Suisse in October from boutique advisory firm Perella Weinberg Partners, will temporarily lead the bank's FIG team in Europe in a move aimed at avoiding further defections, one of the sources said.
Credit Suisse has been plagued by an outflow of talent in recent weeks, mostly in the United States where 15 bankers including global industrials head Stephanie Ruiz, transportation specialist Jason Wortendyke and healthcare managing director Leo Reif have left since May.

In Europe, Stephane Gruffat, a 20-year Credit Suisse veteran who was in charge of its equity capital markets syndicate franchise, recently joined  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Another senior managing director in Paris, Bruno Angles, who oversaw all the bank's franchises across France and Belgium, quit in April to take on a role at insurer AG2R La Mondiale.

In April Stellantis, which was formed at the beginning of this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, said additional gigafactories in Europe and in the United States would be decided this year.
""Discussions are just at the stage of an exchange on the principle of creating a gigafactory in order to cover (Stellantis') future needs. These conditions will have to be studied with Italian authorities,"" the source said, adding that nothing had yet been decided.
Italy is one of the carmakers main manufacturing hubs.
Stellantis declined to comment.
In its 205 billion euro ($251 billion) recovery plan, Italy will spend almost 24 billion euros on the transition to cleaner energy and sustainable mobility. As part of this, Rome plans to invest 1 billion euros to enhance its battery, and solar and wind power industries.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares and Chairman John Elkann held a virtual meeting last week with Italy's industry minister Giancarlo Giorgetti.
""An exchange took place on the principle of the coverage of Stellantis needs in batteries, and given the group produces numerous vehicles in Italy, there would be a shared interest in discussing the conditions of a gigafactory in Italy,"" the source said. 
A government source said the minister and Stellantis had discussed last week about a possible contribution by Rome, through funds from Italy's Recovery Plan, to the production of batteries for electric mobility. 
Stellantis has said it would offer electric versions of almost all of its European line-up by 2025, and that by 2030 battery-hybrid and full-electric cars should make up 70% of the group's European sales.
The group currently has two gigafactory projects in Europe, one in France and one in Germany, in a joint venture with a subsidiary of TotalEnergies . 
The two sites represent a total investment of 5 billion euros and should allow production of batteries for 1 million cars per year on the basis of a cumulative 48 GWh capacity.

In January the European Union approved a plan which includes giving state aid to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries, helping the bloc to cut imports and compete with industry leader China.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 11:39AM ET</span>",Kyrgyzstan in full control of Kumtor gold mine as Centerra takes legal action,"KUMTOR MINE, Kyrgyzstan (Reuters) - Authorities in Kyrgyzstan said they are in full control of the giant Kumtor gold mine after taking over management of the mine from Canada's Centerra Gold which has taken legal action over the seizure.
Kumtor, the largest foreign investment project in Kyrgyzstan, was operated by Centerra Gold until last month when Kyrgyz lawmakers passed a law giving the state power to temporarily take control of the mine and appoint ""external management"" to address alleged environmental and safety problems.
The move came months after nationalist politician Sadyr Japarov, a long-time supporter of Kumtor nationalisation, won a landslide victory in a presidential election in January. 
""All units are working without interruptions at the moment,"" Nurdin Usenov, acting chief production officer at the mine, told reporters during a government-sponsored media tour to Kumtor last Friday.
The mine will stick to output plans approved under Centerra Gold, he said, which amounted to 470,000 to 510,000 ounces, or 14.62 to 15.86 tonnes, this year.
Centerra Gold said this week its Kyrgyz units, Kumtor Gold Co and Kumtor Operating Co, had commenced bankruptcy proceedings in a U.S. court following the nationalisation of the mine by the former Soviet republic.
Kyrgyzstan has a long history of disputes with Centerra Gold over how to share profits from the country's biggest industrial enterprise.
Dinara Kutmanova, the head of state environment and climate committee, said during the media tour the operator of one of the world's highest-altitude mines had damaged nearby glaciers by dumping more than a billion tonnes of waste rock there.
Scott Perry, Centerra Gold president and chief executive, said the accusations were without merit.
""If you look at our operating activities ... it's approved annually by the government's regulatory authorities and related agencies and they've never asked us to make any changes to the way we operate the mine,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""Unfortunately I have to say that it really appears to be a concerted effort to falsely justify a nationalisation of the mine.""

Centerra said bankruptcy proceedings would prevent further efforts by the Kyrgyz government to strip Kumtor Gold of its assets or otherwise ""improperly dispose"" of the Kumtor mine in violation of its investment agreements with the company.
The company had earlier initiated international arbitration proceedings against Bishkek.

American Tower Corp - one of the world's largest tower companies - finalised on Tuesday its purchase of 6.2 billion euros' worth of European mobile masts from Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) as part of a wider deal to acquire over 30,000 towers, including some in Latin America, from the operator's Telxius division.
The American buyer added that it hoped this first package of assets would bring in around $145 million in gross margin for the remainder of 2021, and that the income stream would increase immediately after the consolidation of the AFFO (adjusted funds from operation) per share.
American Towers will then lease the phone masts back to Telefonica, leaving the Spanish group only owning tower assets in Britain - but able to reduce its debt levels by around 3.4 billion euros, Telefonica said in a statement.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 11:12AM ET</span>",Three Exxon refineries top the list of U.S. polluters,"By Tim McLaughlin
BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s U.S. oil refineries pump out far more lung-damaging soot than similarly-sized facilities operated by rivals, according to regulatory documents and a Reuters analysis of pollution test results.
The Texas-based firm's three largest refineries - two in Texas and one in Louisiana - are the nation's top three emitters of small particulate matter, according to the analysis of the latest tests submitted to regulators by the nation's 10 largest refineries.
The three Exxon refineries together averaged emissions of 80 pounds per hour, eight times the average rate of the seven other refineries on the top-ten list, some of which are larger than Exxon's plants, the analysis shows. The top polluter, Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery, averaged 138 pounds per hour. (See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3i4mU9j)
The performance reflects the firm's inadequate spending to cut emissions, said Wilma Subra, a Louisiana-based scientist who formerly served on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Environmental Justice Advisory Council.
""Exxon has all the resources in the world to lower its pollution rates dramatically,"" she said.
The company has taken heat for years for its environmental performance. This week, Exxon lost at least two seats on its board of directors to an activist hedge fund seeking to force the firm to reckon with climate change.
Exxon said in a statement that it tries to comply with environmental laws and has invested billions of dollars to reduce emissions over the last two decades.
Oil-and-gas pollution has a disproportionate impact on poor and minority communities, which are often located near industrial sites. Reuters interviewed nearly three dozen residents in the predominantly Black neighborhoods near Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery. About a third said they either had breathing problems or knew someone who did.
Small particulate matter is among the most harmful pollutants. Made up of particles 50 times smaller than a grain of sand, it can bond with other toxins, infiltrate the blood stream, and damage the heart, lungs and nervous system. A small increase in long-term exposure to small particulate matter also leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rates, according to a recent Harvard University study.
""Particulate matter pollution is deadly, but you're not going to see it written on anyone's tombstone,"" said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington D.C.-based watchdog group.
The EPA requires plants to restrict small particulate matter emissions to 1 pound or less for every 1,000 pounds of coke burned in a refinery's catalytic cracking units.
But Exxon's Baton Rouge plant is the only major U.S. refinery that doesn't have to meet that standard because of an EPA rule that exempts ""cat crackers"" that were built before 1976 and haven't been modified since.
Refineries also have to meet state standards for particulate-matter pollution. But those limits can vary widely among states - and among different facilities within states - based on the strictness of state regulators and whether a refinery has agreed to tighter limits to settle lawsuits. And Louisiana regulators allow much higher pollution levels at Exxon's Baton Rouge plant than at other state refineries.
“There is a surprising amount of unevenness among states"" in enforcing pollution limits, said Philip Mattera, research director at Good Jobs First, a Washington-based watchdog group. “People don’t realize how much the EPA delegates responsibility on big environmental laws to state agencies.” 
OLD POLLUTION SCRUBBERS
Exxon’s two big oil refineries in Texas – in Beaumont and Baytown – are also among the top three polluters identified by Reuters. But Exxon's 517,000-barrel-per-day Baton Rouge plant produces far more soot.
The plant's emissions of small particulate matter hit a peak of 350 pounds per hour during an independent test conducted in January 2020 by an engineering firm Exxon hired to demonstrate its regulatory compliance.
Emissions averaged 255 pounds per hour during the test. That exceeded a limit, imposed on the refinery by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), of 234 pounds per hour – one of the highest limits in the country, according to regulatory documents. Other similarly-sized refineries in Louisiana and other states have state soot emissions limits closer to 50 pounds per hour.
The LDEQ declined to comment on the pollution limits it sets for Exxon's Baton Rouge plant.
Exxon officials blamed the refinery's high emissions on low water pressure in its 1970s-era wet gas scrubber, according to company correspondence with the LDEQ. Exxon told the state it had since resolved the issue.
Maintenance on such scrubbers, commonly used to control pollution, can lower emissions but requires shutting down a cat cracker for several weeks, hurting profitability, according to Exxon disclosures to the LDEQ. Completely new systems can cost more than $1 billion.
Because the Baton Rouge refinery's two catalytic crackers were built during World War Two – among the first such units in the country – they are exempt from federal EPA standards.
'GIVE US GOOD AIR'
The Baton Rouge refinery, more than a century old, borders neighborhoods with sky-high rates of childhood asthma. 
Seabell Thomas, 77, whose home is separated from the refinery by Interstate 110, said her son's asthma was so bad that he routinely visited the emergency room as a child. She has since been campaigning to pressure Exxon to clean up.
""When I wake up each morning, I have to confront two demons: pollution from the highway and the Exxon refinery,"" she said. ""We, as Black people, ask, 'God, how long can you allow this? Please, give us good air to breath.'""
In a group of census blocks that includes Thomas' home, childhood asthma rates were more than double the statewide average, according to a 2019 report by the Louisiana Health Department. Emergency-room visits for childhood asthma in the area also more than doubled the statewide rate.
""I grew up thinking asthma was an African-American disease because so many kids in the neighborhood had inhalers,"" said Sonyja Renee Thomas, the daughter of Seabell Thomas. ""Only later, as an adult, did I realize how much pollution factored into it.""
EXXON RIVALS RUN MUCH CLEANER
Big refineries run by Exxon's rivals are doing much better at controlling soot. Ironically, many of them are using technology invented and licensed by Exxon, according to disclosures by Exxon and environmental regulators.
Specialists in industrial pollution say the differences in performance can be attributed to any of a number of factors: rivals' equipment could be newer; maintenance schedules may be more frequent; and refining processes before wet gas scrubbing may also be optimized to reduce soot.
All of that takes money. In many cases, it also takes lawsuits.
Companies such as  BP  plc (LON:BP), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) have made agreements with the EPA in recent years to slash emissions below federal standards to help settle pollution-related litigation, regulatory disclosures show. 
These more restrictive limits are laid out in so-called consent decrees, which cover the operations of scores of U.S. refineries and influence permitted pollution levels set by states.
For example, Marathon's refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, operates an Exxon scrubber which has undergone numerous upgrades since being installed in 1979, company spokesman Jamal Kheiry said. The refinery's permit limit, set by the state, is 0.6 pounds per 1,000 pounds of burned coke, well below the EPA limit of one pound. During its latest test, Garyville's small particulate matter emissions were just 0.11 pounds. The plant is slightly larger than Exxon Baton Rouge.
""The low emissions numbers reflect robust emissions controls we have implemented,"" Marathon's Kheiry said.
Exxon's three largest refineries also operate under a consent decree, signed with the EPA in 2005 after the company was sued by the EPA and Justice Department for alleged Clean Air Act violations. But the agreement includes only a voluntary target for Exxon to limit soot emissions to half the EPA standard, which it has not done.
For locals around the Baton Rouge refinery, pushing for Exxon to reduce pollution can be difficult given its economic and political clout as a major Louisiana employer.

Sidney Poray, 60, has lived near the refinery for nearly 30 years and has worked with activist groups to monitor the refinery's emissions. But he's not optimistic their work will make much difference.
""Of course, I care about pollution,"" Poray said. ""But what am I going to do? We're talking about Exxon.""

The justices turned away a J&J appeal and left in place a Missouri state court ruling in a lawsuit brought by 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's baby powder and other talc products.
The company couldn’t convince the Supreme Court that the single judge’s decision to consolidate unrelated baby powder-related claims from the plaintiffs – including 17 women from outside the state – violated its due process rights.

Home goods stocks should see their shares rise as the summer provides the perfect environment for more home improvements, which is why David Cohne is recommending  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), and  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK).As most people spent the majority of 2020 stuck at home, many realized that they wanted to spruce up their surroundings. If they were going to spend so much time at home, why not take some of that extra free time from not commuting and add some upgrades into their homes. This created a strong demand for a variety of products, such as lumber, furniture, carpet, and tools.
As the economy has continued to open up and return to normal, more people are headed back into their offices. However, the demand for home improvement hasn’t slowed down. Driven by low rates, fiscal stimulus, and a strong housing market, demand for home goods is still high. As we head into the summer, I believe there will be a further uptick in demand as the warmer months are a great time to do repairs and remodeling.
This demand should keep driving growth higher for home goods stores.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: Chasing yield, U.S. private equity firms nudge up risk on insurers","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firms have spent nearly $40 billion buying U.S. insurance companies in recent years, promising to earn higher returns on the mountains of money that insurers set aside to pay policyholders years or decades from now.
The firms are moving some of the money out of traditional low-yield investments such as government bonds into riskier, harder-to-sell assets such as private loans and equity.
The shift has caught the eye of regulators and raised concerns about a cash crunch if asset managers had to liquidate large portfolios in a hurry to meet insurance claims.
PE-insurance marriages can be joyous: Asset managers have skills and access to investments that insurers lack, and insurers provide cheap funding. PE firms also earn significant fees, even though their investments do not always capture outsized returns.
But PE firms are nudging up risk on a large pool of money. They now own 7.4% of all U.S. life and annuity assets, or $376 billion, double the tally in 2015, credit agency AM Best said. Pending deals could add $250 billion this year, pushing PE ownership to 12%. 
(Graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/PRIVATEEQUITY-INSURANCE/RISKS/oakpebgyyvr/) 
The higher-yielding investments do not necessarily increase the risk of default but tend to lose more money if they do default, compared with plain-vanilla portfolios, said a senior structured finance expert who works closely with state insurance regulators.
LIQUIDITY, STRUCTURING RISK 
Strategies vary widely.  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said it has put the approximately $5 billion of insurance money it manages into buyout funds, credit and alternative investments. The money is part of Fortitude Group's $43.7 billion portfolio. Carlyle bought a majority stake in Fortitude from American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) last year.
Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc runs all $186 billion in assets of annuity provider Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd, a portfolio that accounts for 40% of Apollo's total managed assets and 30% of the firm's fee-related revenue.
Apollo says buying the 65% of Athene it doesn't already own will make both companies the most ""aligned"" with policyholders in the industry. The purchase also shows Apollo's commitment to safe investments, since Apollo's shareholders are exposed to any additional risk. None of Athene's money is in Apollo's flagship private equity funds.
""Insurance companies are ideally situated to take a certain amount of liquidity and structuring risk,"" Apollo Chief Executive Officer Marc Rowan told Reuters. ""Excess return (is earned) through accepting less liquid securities rather than taking on credit risk."" 
Recent deals that Athene calls ""high-grade alpha"" provide a window into Apollo's strategy of seeking 100 to 200 basis points above similarly rated public securities on about 15% of the portfolio.
Athene loaned $2 billion to bankrupt rental-car company Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc in November, and $1.4 billion to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), secured by office and apartment buildings in September.
Athene's Hertz loan is 85% investment grade and 15% speculative, or junk, grade. The loan earns an interest rate of 3.75%, according to loan documents reviewed by Reuters and two people familiar with the matter. 
Fees that Athene earned for structuring the loan boost Athene's yield above 4.75%, these people said. That compares with 3.2% for investment-grade and 4.8% for speculative debt when the loan was made, according to a bond index and Federal Reserve data. Hertz plans to exit bankruptcy in a deal that includes Apollo. 
The Middle Eastern real estate provides a revenue stream for 24 years, after which ownership reverts to ADNOC, which kept a 51% stake. Reuters could not determine the return, but brokers said occupancy has been falling from relatively high levels.
ADNOC declined to comment.
REGULATORS WATCHING
The build up of difficult-to-sell investments has drawn attention from U.S. regulators and raised concerns that insurers may lack cash to pay a surge of claims in a crisis. The Federal Reserve recently flagged this as a concern. 
""What the Fed is concerned about is that these risky assets may not be liquid enough, or they may go down in value sufficiently to endanger policyholders,"" said Joshua Ronen, an accounting professor at New York University whose research focuses on capital markets and financial statements. 
The Fed declined to comment.
Insurers still appear well-capitalized despite the past year's economic upheaval. While the pandemic hit industry profits, it did not weaken capital, analysts said.
Athene's credit rating, for example, was upgraded this month to ""A+"" with a positive outlook by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. About 7% of Athene's investments are rated speculative, compared with 6% for all insurers, according to S&P Global Ratings. 
Still, concern about risk has affected some deals. When Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) went to sell its life and annuity business recently, it looked for firms not aggressively redeploying assets to riskier investments, Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson told Reuters.

In January, Allstate agreed to sell 80% to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and the rest to Wilton Re, an insurer owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Both sales are expected to close this year.
""There are some people out there who take these assets, they assume the insurance regulators won't pay that much attention to them. And they swing for the fences. We chose not to even talk to people like that,"" Wilson said. ""We want our customers to be paid, even though they're not our customers anymore.""

Investing.com -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose almost 3% after getting an upgrade from Cowen as our return to the skies bolsters demand for airplanes. 
Analyst Cai von Rumohr bumped the stock to outperform from market perform, StreetInsider reported. He increased the price target to $290 from $240.
“Beyond traffic, aircraft demand is bolstered by (1) better economics of new planes, (2) low interest rates, and (3) lower carbon emissions,"" von Rumohr wrote in a note. 
Boeing's had a tough time of it with a series of problems plaguing the plane maker, including with its 737 MAX that was grounded after two fatal crashes killed more than 340 people in 2018 and 2019. Boeing admitted to defrauding the public and agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion after getting criminally charged by the Department of Justice. In April, dozens of MAX aircraft were pulled from service after Boeing warned of an electrical insulation fault in a backup power control unit, and inspections are revealing similar problems in other parts of the plane, Reuters reported. 
“Now that U.S has hit a 50% vaccination rate, air traffic/indicators are accelerating. Europe & China are likely to reach ~50% in two and five months, respectively; and IATA now expects air traffic to top 2019's level by 2023. This has encouraged Airbus to hike its A320 supplier rate guide to 64/month in Q2:23 after paring rates just last January. Because airlines fly either A320’s or 737’s and switching costs are high, 737 demand also should benefit,” the analyst said in a note sent to clients.
The analyst adds that there’s a strong set up for replacement demand. Widebodies especially should be in demand as those in service tend to be older than narrow bodies in services, and less fuel efficient. 
The analyst raised 2022-23 estimates and sees 737 MAX reaching 525 deliveries in 2024 versus Airbus's estimate of more than 650.
The second quarter, however, will probably be a ""miss,” but it'll be short-term.
“FAA halt to delivery of 737's and now 787's (again) will restrain Q2. It's a lingering overhang but should ease in H2 as FAA comfort grows with revised approval steps. Timing of China's MAX OK also is a concern. Approval delay by China (~20-25% of MAX deliveries) looks tied to political issues since regulators' work is mostly complete and domestic traffic has recovered. But it's not in U.S. or Chinese interest to hold trade hostage to their differences; hence, China seems likely to OK the MAX at some point,” the analyst said.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) wrapped up Canadian banks' quarterly results reporting on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates, thanks to fewer-than-expected provisions to cover loan losses and an increase in domestic loan growth.
But Scotiabank's global banking and markets unit posted a slight profit decline, the only one of Canada's six biggest banks to do so.
And pre-tax, pre-provisions (PTPP) earnings rose a muted 3% from a year ago, as a decline in its Pacific Alliance-focused international banking unit offset an increase in Canada, where business lending expanded more than rivals' at about 4% from a year earlier.
Scotiabank shares fell 1.1% to C$80.30 in morning trading in Toronto, after hitting a three-year intraday high earlier. The Toronto stock benchmark rose 1.25%. 
Canada's No. 3 lender reported adjusted net income of C$1.90 a share in the three months ended April 30, from C$1.04, a year earlier. Analysts had expected C$1.76 a share, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.
Canada's six biggest lenders have reported better-than-expected earnings driven by strong capital markets and wealth management, and lower provisions than analysts had predicted, as a raft of government and bank measures since the start of the coronavirus pandemic helped keep a lid on soured loans. 
The lender took provisions for credit losses of C$496 million, down from C$1.8 billion a year earlier. 
While that included a recovery of about C$696 million of provisions on performing loans, Scotiabank set aside nearly C$1.19 billion to cover higher retail loan write-offs in its Latin American operations. Executives said on the call that these have peaked.

Scotiabank expects overseas loan growth to improve in the second half, with 10% expansion ""very likely"" in 12 to 18 months, Chief Executive Brian Porter said on an analyst call.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 09:02AM ET</span>",Unipol's move opens new chapter in Italian banking M&A saga,"By Valentina Za, Andrea Mandala and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) - A small investment by Italian financial group Unipol in a local bank could put an end to the waiting game in Italian bank consolidation, aiding Rome's efforts to finally cut its stake in ailing Monte dei Paschi (MPS).
Successive Italian governments have pushed healthier banks to take on struggling rivals to reduce the number of weak lenders in the country. But Italy has reached an impasse in trying to find a buyer for MPS, which it bailed out in 2017.
Bankers say Unipol's surprise decision to raise its stake in tiny Banca Popolare di Sondrio to 9% over the past week could trigger a chain reaction that facilitates a solution for MPS.
The Treasury has long identified UniCredit as the best partner for MPS. 
However a source briefed on the discussions with Treasury officials said new Unicredit (MI:CRDI) Chief Executive Andrea Orcel would only consider a double deal where his bank would take over in stages both MPS and Italy's third biggest lender Banco BPM. UniCredit declined to comment.
Banco BPM's CEO Giuseppe Castagna, reluctant to be engulfed by a bigger lender, has been working to clinch a merger with smaller peer BPER Banca. 
But talks broke down, several people close to the discussions said, adding Castagna and Carlo Cimbri, the head of BPER's top shareholder Unipol, had never hit it off on a personal level.
With the expansion of his firm's stake in the bank, Cimbri is now more likely to steer BPER towards a tie-up with Popolare di Sondrio, said two banking sources familiar with the matter, as well as pursuing other similar bolt-on deals.
These could include a potential tie-up with Genoa-based Carige and the purchase of some of MPS' assets.
With BPER looking elsewhere, Castagna risks succumbing to supporters of a UniCredit takeover inside Banco BPM and among its shareholders, several people close to the matter said. ""Unipol's move has certainly opened a new chapter,"" Rony Hamaui, a professor at Milan's Catholic University and former banking executive, said. ""I don't think Unipol would open its wallet without strategic reasons behind it. It's not a conclusive move but it kicks off a process."" 
NEW CHAPTER
Cimbri's change of tack could play into Orcel's hands as he weighs up M&A options to spur profits.
UniCredit's domestic market share has shrunk to half that of Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) after the rival last year snatched up UBI, another mid-sized northern lender like Banco BPM.
With its roots in the wealthy Lombardy region, Banco BPM would help UniCredit address the issue of its historically small presence in an area that makes up a fifth of domestic output. 
""UniCredit must definitely grow on its home turf. Its market share is too low, it can't just sit tight,"" Hamaui said. 
The prospect of a double round of dealmaking for Orcel appeared to gain traction last month when beefed-up tax incentives were proposed that would have yielded 7 billion euros ($8.5 billion) in benefits for UniCredit from a MPS-Banco BPM takeover.
The Treasury in May drafted measures that raised the cap on existing tax credits for bank mergers the previous government had introduced to ease a sale of MPS, while giving lenders three years instead of one to complete the transaction.
It also considered allowing banks to tap the scheme for more than just one merger.
The draft bill sent Banco BPM's Castagna scrambling to Rome to complain to the government, where some back the creation of a third large banking group next to Intesa and UniCredit, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. 
Two government ministers told Reuters the beefed-up incentives were shelved before the cabinet had a chance to discuss them because they were considered too beneficial to UniCredit. 
While the last word on MPS' future lies with Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the Treasury is still working to ease the three-way deal and could revisit the scheme, a government source said.
Though it is yet to solve MPS' legal woes, the Treasury would ideally like to have a solution in hand by the end of July, when the outcome of banking health checks will throw the bank's fragility to the fore. 
MPS last month confirmed cash needs of up to 2.5 billion euros pending the results of the stress tests.

""A solution for MPS has to be found. There's a deadline for the state to get out and as time passes, expectations grow the Treasury will line up sufficient incentives to clinch a sale,"" Italian academic Andrea Monticini said.

OSLO (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co's electric Mustang Mach-E topped Norway's car sales in May, the first full month of registrations for the crossover vehicle in the small but influential Nordic market, national data showed on Tuesday.
Battery electric vehicles made up 60.4% of all new cars sold in Norway last month, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said, up from 43.1% a year ago as the country seeks to become the first to end the sale of petrol and diesel engines by 2025.
By exempting fully electric vehicles from taxes imposed on internal combustion engines, Norway has turned its car market into a testing ground for automakers seeking a path to a future without fossil fuels.
A total of 1,384 electric Ford Mustangs were registered in May for a 10% share of Norway's overall car market, ahead of Toyota's RAV4 hybrid vehicle and Skoda's electric Enyaq. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Model 3 took sixth place.
""Our realistic goal is to remain prominent in the sales statistics for several months to come,"" Chief Executive Per Gunnar Berg of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Norway said in a statement.
In 2020, electric cars grabbed a 54% share of the overall Norwegian market, outselling the combined volume of petrol, diesel and hybrid engines for the first time on a full-year basis. 
By contrast, cars with diesel-only engines have tumbled from a peak of 75.7% of the Norwegian market in 2011 to just 8.6% last year.
The introduction of new models will frequently give a brand a boost as pre-orders are shipped in large numbers, such as the 2019 launch of Tesla's Model 3, the top selling car in Norway that year.

Ford first presented its Mustang Mach-E to the public in late 2019, giving the U.S. automaker well over a year to build a backlog of orders before customers could receive them.
Ford earlier this year said its car line-up in Europe will be all-electric by 2030.

Investing -- Nio (NYSE:NIO) shares were up 4% in Tuesday’s premarket following a near doubling of sales in May that also led the Chinese maker of electric vehicles to say it will be able to accelerate its June deliveries.
The positive commentary from the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival prompted Citi to upgrade the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ with a target of $58.30, a 51% rise from its Friday close.
Nio sold 6,711 vehicles in May, up 95% compared to a year ago.
The company said it vehicle delivery was adversely impacted for several days in May due to the volatility of semiconductor supply and certain logistical adjustments.
But it said “based on the current production and delivery plan, the company will be able to accelerate the delivery in June to make up for the delays from May.”
Nio also maintained and reiterated the delivery guidance of 21,000 to 22,000 vehicles for the second quarter of 2021."

(Reuters) -Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd has resumed recruiting pilots with residency rights in the territory as part of medium- to long-term planning, the airline said on Tuesday, despite having much of its fleet parked due to the pandemic.
The move, which came just weeks after Cathay said it would close a pilot base in Canada and hours before the airline on Tuesday evening said it would proceed with plans to shut its pilot bases in Australia, points to a move away from a long-term strategy of employing many expatriates.
Last year Cathay closed its regional arm Cathay Dragon, putting hundreds of pilots out of work, many of them citizens and permanent residents in Hong Kong.
""While we are still not seeing immediate, meaningful signs of growth, the recruitment we are conducting at this stage is about forward planning,"" Cathay said in a statement.
""We will be looking to hire qualified talent who are already in Hong Kong and have the right to live and work here.""
Expatriates can gain permanent residency after seven years in Hong Kong.
Cathay pilots with temporary work visas have received shorter than usual renewals since the closure of Cathay Dragon, said two sources who were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. 
The airline said it had supported each application for visa renewal and was actively following up on their status with the Hong Kong Immigration Department.
Most airlines only hire locals and permanent residents, but Cathay, like many of the large Middle Eastern carriers, has typically relied heavily on foreign pilots. 
However, last year Cathay made its Hong Kong-based pilots agree to permanent pay cuts to keep their jobs, making living in the expensive city a less attractive proposition.
The airline, which lacks a domestic market at a time when international borders are largely shut, reported a fall of 99.3% in April passenger numbers, compared with pre-pandemic levels in April 2019.

The new pilot recruitment drive, including online advertisements for first and second officers, was first reported by the South China Morning Post newspaper.

The group, headquartered in Germany, said internal polling found that 94% of staff wanted to take advantage of greater working flexibility, while nearly half planned to work in the office for one or two days a week in the future.
""It gives employees 100% flexibility,"" Julia White, SAP's recently appointed chief marketing and solutions officer, told Reuters in an interview.
White, who was 'onboarded' remotely in the United States, only met Chief Executive Christian Klein and other top managers face to face last week on her first visit to Germany since joining from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in January.
And, while getting to know co-workers personally is vital, White also said that, as a single mother, she valued the flexibility that enables her to meet both her professional and personal commitments.
In an email to staff on Tuesday, SAP said it was adopting a ""flexible and trust-based workplace as the norm, not the exception"".
Employees will be able to work from home, at the office or remotely, and it will be possible for them to set flexible schedules. The company will redesign its offices to make more space for teamwork and collaboration.

SAP's decision to make flexible work its policy follows moves by some technology companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to permanently adopt remote work even after coronavirus lockdowns ease.
Its ""pledge to flex"" seeks to account for the range of preferences expressed by staff, with 16% saying they would like to work only remotely while 6% planned to come in to the office five days a week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's investment industry has called on the G7 to do more to improve corporate reporting on climate-related risks, adding to pressure from the financial sector as it grapples with the uncertainties and escalating costs of extreme weather events.
In a letter to the Group of Seven leading economies ahead of a meeting this week, the Investment Association (IA) said it was vital that climate risks were disclosed by companies so asset managers can help them in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Specifically, the IA said it wanted the G7 to help the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation move ""at pace"" to develop sustainability reporting standards, and increased regulatory cooperation to implement them.
National regulators should also commit to implementing economy-wide reporting by companies using the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework, which guides companies on what information to disclose to the market.
International standards also needed to be agreed on the issuance of so-called ""green gilts"", or sovereign debt issued to help fund environmentally friendly projects, said the IA, which represents the UK's 8.5 trillion pounds ($12 trillion) investment industry including the likes of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen.
Lastly, governments needed to set out the pathways that each sector needed to take if it wanted to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate, which aims to cap the increase in global temperatures by mid-century.
""The meeting of the G7 is a prime opportunity for the world’s largest economies to take a coordinated, global approach to tackling climate change,"" said Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association.

""Ensuring high-quality and comparable data on the risks that companies face from climate change is key to achieving this and meeting the net zero targets.""
Officials from the G7 - comprising the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - are set to meet in London on June 4-5.

Investing -- Another week but it was business as usual for meme stocks as the likes of AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were up again in premarket Tuesday.
AMC, the latest top draw for the Reddit crowd after replacing GameStop in the league, was up 8%. Blackberry (TSX:BB), a relatively new entrant, was up 7% while the video games retailer was up 3%.
In the case of AMC, there was some news too. The theatre chain said it has raised $230.5 million from sale of 8.5 million Class A Common stock at approximately $27.12 per share.
This is AMC’s second big fund raise in less than three weeks. It had then raised $428 million via sale of 43 million shares at $9.94 apiece. Since the May 13 announcement, the shares have trebled below closing a trifle lower Friday.
The story mostly began in January, when some Reddit followers decided to take on the big hedge funds who were short on GameStop. That unexpected coming together of widely distributed retail investors resulted in a short squeeze in the stock and created trouble for the institutional traders. One even went under.
Since then, the battle between the big institutional guys and the small retail traders, large number of whom are on Robinhood, has waged on.
There was a lull in between but last few weeks have brought back the invisible fight between the small, mostly young, retail traders and the big boys.

OSLO (Reuters) - Financial services company Nasdaq and Finnish state-owned utility Fortum have joined forces to develop a trading platform for carbon removal credits, they said on Tuesday.
Various forms of carbon trading have gained traction as tackling climate change has become urgent and industry is under pressure to cut or offset its emissions by buying into carbon reduction schemes, such as tree planting or emissions sequestration.
Backed by Fortum, Puro.earth was founded in 2019 and offers verifiable and tradable carbon removal credits on an open, online platform, with existing corporate clients including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the companies said. 
Puro.earth's CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) are based on technologies for long-term carbon removal, such as storing carbon in a solid structures made from industrial waste.
This allows companies to reduce their carbon footprint, in some cases to less than zero.
Nasdaq is taking a majority stake in the Puro.earth platform for an undisclosed sum, they said. 
""The partnership with Puro.earth will provide our global network of corporate clients access to a unique marketplace for carbon removal and will allow Puro.earth to scale its platform through the Nasdaq network and technology platform,"" Bjoern Sibbern, Executive Vice President and President of European Markets at Nasdaq, said.
Puro.earth seeks to help its customers reach ambitious emissions goals, Chief Executive Antti Vihavainen said.

Carbon offset credits are traded in small, bilateral and typically project-specific deals but exchanges are increasingly exploring opportunities to standardise trading.
Offsets are voluntary initiatives, differing from mandatory emission trading systems set up as policy tools to help cut emissions by putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. Here, participating companies are required to buy and render certificates for all or a share of their carbon dioxide emissions.

The deal, for assets with production capacity of 9 gigawatts, marks BP (NYSE:BP)'s first independent investment in solar since buying a stake in Europe's largest solar developer, Lightsource, in 2017. 
BP said the new assets will be developed and operated through its 50-50 joint venture with Lightsource BP.
BP CEO Bernard Looney last year launched a strategy to sharply reduce carbon emissions by 2050 by reducing oil output and growing its renewables business 20-fold between 2019 and 2030 to a capacity of 50 gigawatts (GW).
The deal will grow BP's renewables pipeline from 14GW to 23GW. The company expects to start developing around 2.2 GW of the acquisition's pipeline by 2025.
BP will integrate the new solar output into its large U.S. power trading business, which includes onshore wind and natural gas electricity. In future, it will also have offshore wind from a project it is developing off the East Coast with Norway's Equinor, Dev Sanyal, BP head of gas and low carbon energy, told Reuters.
BP is confident it can reach returns on investment of 8% to 10% on its renewable investments, Sanyal added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Daimler has agreed to pay Nokia (NYSE:NOK) for using its patents, ending a row that highlighted a battle between tech and car companies over royalties for key technologies.
Nokia, which makes 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in licensing revenues every year, and carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) had sued each other in German courts in recent years, with mixed results.
Tech firms want automakers to pay royalties for technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars, but the latter say their suppliers should pay instead, which could reduce the fees for patent holders.
The agreement announced jointly on Tuesday marks the latest win for Nokia which in April struck a deal with China's Lenovo under which the world's biggest PC maker would make a net balancing payment to the Finnish telecoms equipment maker and resolve all pending litigation.
That followed a deal with Samsung (KS:005930) the previous month in which the South Korean company agreed to make royalty payments for its technologies related to video standards. 
Nokia and Daimler did not disclose the terms of their patent licensing deal, but said they would halt litigation. The German carmaker has to date never paid Nokia for using its patents.
""We welcome the settlement, from an economic point of view and because we avoid lengthy ... disputes,"" a Daimler spokeswoman said.
The deal is good news for Nokia, said Danske Bank analyst Mads Rosendal.
""The revenue stream is not likely to be material but at the very least it will be very stable and high margin. Also, ending of the dispute should save a fair amount of legal costs going forward. Slightly credit positive for Nokia, in our view,"" he said.
According to sources familiar with the settlement, Nokia receives fees of a little over $2 per vehicle under patent licensing deals for similar technologies. 
The end of the dispute means a German court's request last year to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice, Europe's highest, for guidance on the issue will be moot.
However, German car parts maker Continental, which together with Daimler, Bury Technologies,  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Thales-owned  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) complained about Nokia's patent fees to EU antitrust regulators in 2019, said it was not dropping its complaint nor legal fight in the United States.
It urged the European Commission to set out a binding patent licensing framework.
""It must ... define this framework otherwise European companies will face an insurmountable competitive disadvantage in the future market of the Internet of Things compared to Asian and American market participants,"" Continental board member and head of its vehicle networking and information business unit Helmut Matschi said in a statement. 

Audi, Bentley, BMW, Mini, Porsche, Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Volvo already pay patent fees to Nokia.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc said on Tuesday drivers were gradually returning to its ride-hailing platform, allowing for a modest decrease in passenger wait times as the company seeks to take advantage of a post-pandemic return in travel demand.
Uber said the week of May 17th marked a new record for drivers returning to the road since the start of 2021, with active driver hours increasing 4.4% from the previous week.
Overall, Uber said 33,000 drivers joined its U.S. platform during the week of May 17th. Most of them had stopped working last year over health concerns and a lack of customers.
Uber declined to say how that number compared to pre-pandemic times, but in California alone Uber reported 209,000 quarterly drivers through the end of 2019.
""With the economy bouncing back, drivers are returning to Uber in force to take advantage of higher earnings opportunities from our driver stimulus while they are still available,"" said Carrol Chang, Uber's head of U.S. and Canada driver operations, in a statement.
Getting drivers on the road quickly is crucial for Uber's efforts to recoup revenue and achieve its target of adjusted profitability by the end of the year.
The company also faces customers who complain online about long wait times and high booking costs.

Uber has tried to lure drivers back through COVID-19 vaccine partnerships and said in April it would invest $250 million to boost driver earnings and offer payment guarantees.
Including those incentives, median hourly driver earnings in several U.S. cities exceeded $35 before tips, Uber said. The company has urged drivers to take advantage of the incentives before pay drops to pre-COVID-19 levels as more drivers return to the platform.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, continuing the strong tone seen at the end of last month, amid growing optimism over the country’s economic recovery. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 200 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 45 points, or 0.3%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just short of 2% in May, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.6%, to mark their fourth consecutive positive months. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite gained just over 2% last week to post its best weekly performance since April, but it actually lost 1.5% in May, breaking a 6-month winning streak.
Confidence is growing about the strength of the country’s economic improvement as the country’s reopening accelerates, based on a ramped up vaccination program.
More than half the U.S. population has now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccination, according to CDC data posted Sunday, while there were just over 12,000 new cases on Saturday, the lowest since March 2020.
Friday’s May employment report is the major release on the week’s economic data slate, but ahead of that, May’s ISM Manufacturing PMI release is due at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT). This is expected to show a continued improvement in the sector, with the headline figure seen coming in 60.9, versus 60.7 in April.
Earlier Tuesday, data showed that Eurozone manufacturing activity expanded at a record pace in May, while China's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace this year.
In the corporate sector, the quarterly earnings season is largely at an end, but  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) are set to report results after the bell.

Crude oil prices were sharply higher Tuesday, with the international benchmark Brent topping $70 a barrel, amid growing optimism about the outlook for demand growth ahead of a meeting of major producers.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 2.9% at $68.23 a barrel, while Brent was up 2.2% at $70.83, after earlier hitting the highest intra-day price since March 8.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, is due to meet later in the day. The cartel is widely expected to continue to gradually ease fuel supply curbs as planned over the next two months, particularly after one of its committees estimated that the oil glut built up during the pandemic has almost gone, and that stockpiles will diminish rapidly in the second half of the year.

The fund aims to help firms on a case-by-case basis with loans or equity injections so that businesses that were viable before the pandemic but now have strained balance sheets can get back on their feet.
""The aim is not to dilute shareholders, it's not the state's role to become French companies' main shareholder,"" Le Maire told a news conference.
""Our aim is to ensure the transition from the crisis so companies can rebound,"" Le Maire said.
The fund is part of a series of new measures which include fast-track restructuring of small firms' debts and giving firms more time to pay back tax arrears and payroll contributions.
French companies saw their debt surge by 230 billion euros last year - more than 10% of gross domestic product - as they took out state-guaranteed loans en masse to help cope with collapse in cashflow during the crisis.
Although many firms ended up not having to use the money they borrowed, the ministry wants to avoid a wave of insolvencies.

Among other new measures, the finance ministry is using algorithms on tax and payroll data to detect fragile firms and reach out to them early.

MANILA (Reuters) -Philippine food maker Monde Nissin Corp is pinning its future on the fast-growing alternative meats business on the back of a 48.6 billion pesos ($1 billion) initial public offering (IPO), which marked the country's largest-ever listing.
On its market debut on Tuesday, the family-controlled company's shares ended trading at 13.48 pesos versus the 13.50 pesos IPO price. The issue was Southeast Asia's second-largest this year after the $1.8 billion IPO of Thailand's PTT Oil and Retail Business.
The four decade-old group's market leading position in the Philippines, with its ubiquitous Lucky Me! instant noodles and SkyFlakes biscuits, has propelled the family behind the conglomerate to the ranks of the richest in the Philippines.
The owner of Britain's meat alternative Quorn, which it acquired for about $830 million in 2015, is ramping up capacity and is also targetting a big jump in sales in U.S. markets.
""We still have a lot of possibilities to raise even more (capital) in the next few years,"" Henry Soesanto, Monde's CEO, told Reuters in an interview.
The IPO was covered nearly six times and comes ahead of planned listings of real estate investment trusts and  National Grid  (LON:NG) Corp of the Philippines. These will take the country, a historical laggard in IPOs, to the top regional spot this year.
Bringing in strategic investors in its Quorn business at a later stage might be one of the options for Monde to raise more funds, Soesanto said.
The IPO process was codenamed 'Taurus' after a bull, signifying a sustained bull run, the 69-year-old said.
The global meat substitutes market has surged in recent years on consumer concerns about health, sustainability and animal welfare, helping firms such as Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods to attract record investments.
Quorn contributed 22% to Monde's net sales of $1.4 billion last year.
""We are going to push very, very hard and invest significantly to grow the top line,"" said David Nicol, chief strategy officer at Monde, adding that Quorn was also developing local flavours for U.S. markets.
""There will be explosive growth,"" he said, citing industry studies stating the protein market will grow multifold over the next couple of years.
The IPO was supported by 11 cornerstone investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and fund managers Eastspring Investments and Capital Group.
Monde's shares were the most actively traded on Tuesday and rose as high as 13.56 pesos. Monde Nissin ended the day with a market value of $5 billion in a steady broader market.

Analysts previously said the food maker had priced its IPO conservatively in a market that so far this year has lost 7%, making it the region's worst performer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cruise LLC, the autonomous vehicle (AV) company majority-owned by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), has urged President Joe Biden to back efforts to speed thousands of self-driving cars to U.S. roads, saying the country risks lagging behind China, according to a previously unreported letter seen by Reuters.
The chief executive of Cruise, Dan Ammann, in a letter to Biden dated May 17, asked him to back legislation raising the cap on the number of vehicles that a company can seek to have exempted from safety standards that do not meet existing federal requirements that assume human drivers are in control.
The cap, Ammann wrote, ""acts as a U.S.-only impediment to building these vehicles at scale in the United States."" Cruise provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.
""China’s top down, centrally directed approach imposes no similar restraints on their home grown AV industry,"" Ammann wrote. ""We do not seek, require or desire government funding; we seek your help in leveling the playing field,"" he said, citing research that AVs are ""estimated to create and sustain 108,000 jobs over the next five years.""
The White House declined to comment on Monday.
Senators John Thune and Gary Peters have been working for several years on efforts to ease restrictions on AVs. An amendment to a bill designed to address U.S. competitiveness against China proposed by Thune to raise the cap stalled last week amid opposition from labor unions and plaintiffs attorneys, but Thune and Peters are expected to continue to pursue the issue.
Thune and Peters in April circulated language for potential legislation to grant the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the power to lift the cap and initially exempt 15,000 self-driving vehicles per manufacturer, rising to 80,000 within three years. The NHTSA would need to certify self-driving vehicles exempted are at least as safe as human-driven ones.
Ammann, in his letter to Biden, said that ""without your support and congressional action to revise these self imposed barriers, the U.S. AV manufacturing industry will lag, AI development will stall, and our foreign competitors will race ahead.""
The auto industry, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and others have been pushing for years to convince Congress to speed self-driving vehicle deployment.

Reuters reported May 11 that Waymo and California-based Cruise have applied for permits needed to start charging for rides and delivery using autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, citing state documents.
In October, Cruise said it planned to seek NHTSA approval to deploy a limited number of Cruise Origin vehicles without steering wheels or pedals. The Origin, which was developed with GM and Cruise investor Honda Motor, has two long seats facing each other that can comfortably fit four passengers. Production is expected to begin in early 2023.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese public-interest group said on Tuesday it is suing Tencent over what it alleges is inappropriate content for minors in the top global game developer's flagship video game, Honor of Kings.
Beijing Teenagers Law Aid And Research Center said it filed the lawsuit in a Beijing court on Tuesday, to mark the implementation of an amended protection of minors law.
The suit, whose content Reuters could not independently confirm, also coincides with an unprecedented antitrust crackdown by Beijing on some of China's biggest tech companies that sources told Reuters includes Tencent.
The company, which declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, has progressively lowered the recommended age limit for the game from 18 in 2017 to 12 this year, the public-interest group said. 
In a posting on its social media account, it said some of the game's characters wore low-cut clothes and that its storyline tampered with historical figures and showed a lack of respect for traditional culture - all of which made the game inappropriate for young users. 
""Game characters' clothing is too revealing, while there is a lot of ... low-taste content that is inappropriate for teenagers on its website and forums,"" the group said in the posting.
An in-game raffle also made young players more likely to play the game for longer, it said.
Citing concerns about eye damage, Chinese authorities have sought to limit hours that teenagers can spend playing video games, and companies including Tencent have put in place anti-addiction systems that they say cap young users' game time.

Tencent said last November that Honor of Kings, which is free to download but has paid-for in-play content, had a record 100 million daily active users worldwide.
Sources told Reuters in April that China is preparing to fine Tencent, probably in excess of $1 billion, for anticompetitive practices in some businesses and for not properly reporting past acquisitions for antitrust reviews.

PARIS (Reuters) - French sugar producer Tereos is seeking to exit its ventures in China and Romania as part of a wider move by the new management to divest some international assets to lighten the group's heavy debt and boost profitability, sources close to the matter said.
Tereos, the world's second largest sugar producer by volume, reshuffled its top management since an extraordinary meeting in December dismissed its chief executive. 
The new team, which had expressed strong concern about losses at some of Tereos' international activities before taking over, said it was considering selling non-profitable or non-core assets but that it first wanted to do an audit of the group.
Tereos is in advanced talks with Singapore's Wilmar International to sell its 49% stake in their starch joint venture in China, three sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters. 
The cooperative group is also seeking to exit its loss-making Romanian sugar activities, one of the three sources close to the matter, and another source, said. 
Tereos declined to comment. Wilmar also declined to comment.
The joint venture with Wilmar, launched in 2012, operates two large starch plants in China.
Talks with the agri-food giant, had started even before Tereos' new management took over but had failed due to the low price offered by Wilmar before resuming this year, two of the three sources close to the matter said. 
One source said they were close to completion and that although the final price of the deal remained unclear the sale would still be made at a significant loss for Tereos.
Wilmar is ""in serious talks"" to buy a stake in Tereos' starch business in China, said one Singapore-based source familiar with the negotiations.
Tereos, which is made up of 12,000 cooperative members, purchased Romanian sugar maker Ludus in 2012, as part of a wide international expansion. But the unit has posted losses every year since 2014, according to company records.
The new management wants to stop the losses and has hired an international advisor to help it find a solution, with a sale seen as the first option, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
The advisor has made initial approaches to potential buyers, one source said.
But a sale of the Romanian business could prove difficult because of its poor results but also because the region is not very attractive in terms of sugar beet yields, the sources said.
If no buyer was found for the Romanian business, Tereos could halt it altogether, a second source, close to Tereos management, said.
The source said if a way could be found to keep the business, but staunch the losses, Tereos would consider that, but this scenario seemed unlikely. 
Tereos reported a debt of 2.7 billion euros ($3.30 billion) at the end of last year, for annual sales of around 4.5 billion euros. 

The group's new management is due to unveil its new strategy on Wednesday when the cooperative group releases its yearly results, a spokeswoman said.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Global company tax could bring EU multi-billion-euro windfall,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could get an extra 50 billion euros in tax from multinational companies if there is agreement in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on a minimum global effective corporate tax of 15%, a study showed.
The report, prepared by the EU Tax Observatory for European institutions, said the revenue would more than triple to 170 billion euros if the agreed global minimum tax rate were 25%.
The United States proposed in May a minimum tax rate of 15%, a level backed by many EU countries, and seen as the more likely compromise level than a much higher rate of 25%. 
If agreed, it would be part of a reworking of rules for taxing multinational corporations and big technology firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which now often pay very little tax, despite huge revenues, by setting up offices in low-tax countries like Ireland, Luxembourg or the Netherlands.
But the final minimum tax rate will depend on a deal in the OECD, and will also include an agreement on where multinationals are taxed - whether all revenue is taxed in their home country or in the country where revenue is generated. 
Many countries are pushing for an agreement at the G20 finance ministers meeting in July. 
The EU Tax Observatory report noted, however, that the EU could get more money from raising taxes on its own companies than from taxing those from outside the 27-nation bloc.
The report also said that it was not necessary for all countries to agree to the higher tax for it to be effective.
""If sufficiently many parent countries applied a substantial minimum tax, tax havens couldn’t attract activity or profits anymore by offering low rates,"" the report said.
""They would thus be encouraged to raise their own tax rates — as not doing so would mean leaving tax revenues on the table for the parent countries to collect.""

Tax-havens would no longer be able to exist if major economies decided to tax their firms, the report said.
""The spiral of international tax competition can be stopped even if tax havens do not increase their tax rates, and the European Union could be the world leader in this process,"" it said.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>","Australian banks, led by CBA, set to return record $15 billion cash to investors","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's big banks are likely to return a record $15 billion or more of cash to investors over the next two years, with investors betting Commonwealth Bank will move first and helping drive shares of the top lender to all-time highs.
Commonwealth Bank and its smaller rivals Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) and  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp have made a remarkable comeback, from being shamed in a public inquiry and shunned by investors three years ago to being sought-after investments now.
The banks have come out of the COVID-19 crisis relatively unscathed as Australia has kept the pandemic under control and its A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy has hummed along. They are now writing back hefty provisions made last year, resulting in comfortable cash buffers.
Investors are sensing a bonanza is on the cards through share buybacks and dividends.
Shares of Commonwealth Bank hit a record high of A$101.5 on Monday, and are the best performing over the past three months among banks valued at more than $50 billion in Asia-Pacific, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
That makes Commonwealth Bank one of only eight listed Australian companies commanding share prices of over A$100 - equivalent to about 20 times its forecast 2022 earnings, which also makes it one of the most expensive banks globally, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Commonwealth Bank is seen as ""the best bank in Australia ... (and) is absolutely flush with capital so they are in a great place to be able to return capital to shareholders,"" said Matthew Haupt, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which owns shares of all four top banks.
""Probably around August, they'll come out with a market buyback with a large franking credit portion,"" Haupt added, referring to income tax credits to avoid double levies on profits. ""They should be leading the charge in capital management.""
A spokesman for the bank, which holds about A$11.5 billion in excess capital above the minimum 10.5% core capital required by regulators, declined to comment beyond what it said in its trading update in May.
Commonwealth Bank said last month it had the flexibility to consider ""capital management initiatives"" with timing dependent upon the economy and regulatory guidance.
Banking analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) expect Commonwealth Bank to announce an off-market buyback of between A$5 billion and A$5.5 billion and hike its dividend payment when it announces fiscal 2021 earnings on August 11. 
Banking analysts also expect the other three banks will follow Sydney-based Commonwealth Bank with buybacks or special dividends worth about A$15 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2023. It would be the biggest ever cumulative capital return made by the four banks. 
ANZ, NAB and Westpac could start announcing their capital return programmes as early as November or in the first half of next financial year if Australia's economic recovery continues and once the banking regulator releases an expected update to its capital rules.
At  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), senior banking analyst Jarrod Martin expects about A$26 billion in buybacks from the four banks in the next two fiscal years. 
BofA Securities banking analyst James Ellis said the big Australian banks are not only attractive economic recovery stories but also offer enticing dividend yields. The Big Four offer an expected dividend yield of about 4.4% compared with 2.8% for the broader Australian market, according to Eikon data. 

""Anybody that screens for dividend yields the world over is quite likely to come up with Australian banks featuring high in that screening,"" said Ellis.

But Rainer Beaujean told ProSieben's annual general meeting: ""Our own strategy is clear and does not need any help from outside.""
Beaujean, who took the helm as the COVID-19 pandemic struck, has led ProSieben into a recovery and is pushing to diversify out of its core entertainment franchise into dating and e-commerce.
That has tested the patience of Italy's Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), which has built an economic stake of 23.5% in ProSieben and has called for management to engage in its push to consolidate the European broadcasting industry.
""We will not close our minds to any reasonable idea. If we are asked to enter into strategic talks, we will of course listen to the proposal with an open mind,"" Beaujean told the AGM.
Any proposal should be advantageous to ProSiebenSat.1 and all of its stakeholders, Beaujean added, reiterating his view that it was ""almost impossible to achieve"" cost synergies via cross-border media mergers.
Beaujean said ProSieben's core commercial TV business was performing strongly, with advertising revenues up by 40% in April and by 60% in May, putting them in line with the figure from the same month two years ago.
He noted that ProSieben's shares had not only outperformed those of other European media companies over the past year, but also beaten the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Top Glove Corporation's plan to list in Hong Kong and raise up to $1 billion has been delayed as the world's largest rubber glove maker seeks to resolve a U.S. import ban on its products, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The delay is another setback to the Malaysian company from a ban on imports on its products imposed in July by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) citing forced labour practices. That ban has taken the shine off Top Glove, which otherwise posted a record profit in its latest quarter due to booming demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Top Glove, which is already listed in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, flagged in April it would sell 793.5 million shares in the listing, half what it proposed in its application to the Hong Kong bourse in February.
Before that, in March Reuters reported that  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and UBS Group opted out of working on the deal due to the labour practice concerns.
However, the deal has now stalled as the company awaits word from CBP on whether the ban would be lifted any time soon, the sources told Reuters.
Potential investors questioned Top Glove and its advisers on the sanctions during preliminary briefings ahead of the listing, they said.
Top Glove had hoped to complete the listing by the end of the second quarter in 2021, said the sources, who could not be named as the information was not yet made public.
Top Glove told Reuters in an emailed statement it could not comment on the listing process due to regulatory reasons.
""However, Top Glove remains committed to the proposed IPO in Hong Kong and where appropriate, material developments regarding this will be announced on the relevant stock exchanges,"" it said.
Top Glove shares were down 2.3% in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday afternoon. They have lost about 17.3% so far in 2021 after their near four-fold gain last year. 
SHIPMENTS SEIZED
U.S. Customs prohibited the import of Top Glove products last year, saying it had found reasonable evidence at the company's production facilities across Malaysia indicative of forced labour practices.
Top Glove said in April it has resolved all indicators of forced labour in its operations and that this had been verified by the London-based ethical trade consultant Impactt Limited.
But Customs had two of Top Glove's shipments seized in May and said it had found evidence of multiple forced labour indicators in Top Glove's production process, including debt bondage, excessive overtime, abusive working and living conditions, and retention of identity documents.
CBP, in an emailed response to Reuters, said the length of the review process varies with the individual facts and circumstances of each case. 
""CBP will not modify or revoke a Forced Labor Finding until it has information that all indicators of forced labor identified by the agency have been fully remediated and it is demonstrated that forced labor is no longer being used to produce the goods targeted,"" it said.
The North American market accounts for 22% of Top Glove's total sales volume, according to its latest accounts.
Analysts had largely kept their earnings forecasts for the company intact and said diversion of trade to other markets could cushion the impact of sales loss in the U.S. market, as the pandemic continued.

The company has argued a Hong Kong listing is not urgent as it has 2.36 billion ringgit ($573.09 million) cash on its balance sheet, the sources said.
Instead, a listing is being pursued to diversify the firm's shareholder base and take advantage of the increased liquidity in Hong Kong's markets compared to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, one of the sources added.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Digital insurance startup Wefox said on Tuesday it had raised $650 million from investors, in what it called a record-breaking round for a so-called ""insurtech"" company that valued the business at $3 billion.
The funding means Berlin-based Wefox has grown in value threefold since tapping investors in 2019. The move follows big raises by local startups Trade Republic, an online stockbroker, and quick-delivery firm Gorillas.
Wefox founder and CEO Julian Teicke told Reuters the Series C round had drawn strong investor demand because Wefox was growing both rapidly and more profitably than rival online insurers that are losing money.
He put that down to Wefox's strategy of offering digital tools that enable insurance agents to streamline and automate labour intensive processes. Agents sell nine out of every 10 policies in Europe, leaving direct-to-consumer competitors like Lemonade fighting for a smaller piece of the market.
“Most insurtech says that insurance agents are dead. We say: They are more alive than ever,"" Teicke said.
Wefox, which is present in Germany, Switzerland and Poland, will use the money raised for European expansion.
The company aims to increase revenues to $350 million this year, from $143 million in 2020, as it builds its branded sales team and product portfolio to complement the existing platform that hosts independent insurance brokers.
CFO and co-founder Fabian Wesemann said Wefox's own-brand portfolio, launched in 2018, already accounted for 30% of revenue last year. Commissions made up the rest.
Wefox expects an even split between premium income and commissions from next year, driven by the expansion of its branded products into life and health, in addition to household, liability and motor.
On the cost side, advanced data analytics and its ability to automate more than 80% of customer interactions mean Wefox is able to process claims more quickly and cheaply than established players.
Wefox lays off some exposure from its own product portfolio to partner Munich Re, enabling it to run a so-called capital-light model.
The investment was led by Berlin venture fund Target Global, whose General Partner Yaron Valler said he looked for Wefox to focus on growing in Europe before launching in the United States and Asia in the year ahead.
""My goal is really world domination in this category,"" Valler told Reuters. “I haven’t found another player in any of these geographies that figured it out as well as Wefox.”

Centerra said the Chapter 11 filing would have no financial or operational impact on it or any other areas of its business, including the Mount Milligan mine in Canada, the Oksut Mine in Turkey and its molybdenum business in North America.
Kumtor, Kyrgyzstan's largest foreign investment project, was operated by Centerra. However, the government of the Central Asian country seized the mine, prompting the Canadian miner to seek redress in an international court.
Kyrgyz lawmakers in early May passed a law giving the state power to temporarily take control of the mine and appoint ""external management"" to address alleged environmental and safety problems.
Centerra said bankruptcy proceedings would prevent further efforts by the Kyrgyz government to strip Kumtor Gold of its assets or otherwise ""improperly dispose"" of the Kumtor mine in violation of its investment agreements with the company.
Representatives for the Kyrgyz government could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.
Centerra said the court-supervised restructuring provides for a worldwide automatic stay of all claims against the Kyrgyz business units, which it said are currently solvent.
The Canadian miner said that while it hopes the process will facilitate talks, it will continue to pursue arbitration proceedings to enforce agreements with the Kyrgyz government.
""Those agreements are governed by New York law, and we expect the U.S. court proceedings will serve to further protect Centerra's interests under their terms pending a restructuring or other resolution of the dispute,"" Centerra Chief Executive Scott Perry said in a statement.

Centerra has suspended its 2021 production guidance and three-year outlook for Kumtor, which last year produced more than 556,000 ounces (15,762 kg) of gold.
The miner said it would also conduct a strategic review of its ownership of the subsidiaries ""in light of recent events involving the Kumtor mine"".

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Tuesday morning as investors digested more Chinese economic data released earlier in the day, and await key U.S. economic data, due later in the day, to gauge the country's economic outlook.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.26% by 10:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.02%. The People's Bank of China forced banks to hold more foreign currencies in reserve for the first time in more than a decade in order to curb the appreciation of the yuan.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.38%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.32% while South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.68%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.48% as investors await the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to hand down its policy decision later in the day. Investors expect that RBA will maintain its loose monetary policy but is likely to be closed to a decision on whether the economy is strong enough to join a group of central banks, including the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, in reducing its emergency stimulus measures.
In China, data released earlier in the data said the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) in May was 52, slightly higher than the 51.9 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and April’s figure. The Caixin reading was also higher than the manufacturing PMI’s 51.0 reading released on Monday by China’s National Bureau of Statistics. But both manufacturing PMIs were above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Although the U.S., China and parts of Europe continue their economic recovery from COVID-19, investors remain concerned that price pressure will force central banks to slow down their stimulus measures earlier than expected.
“We believe the market has been premature in scaling back the reflation trade simply because some commodities and U.S. Treasury yields have experienced a correction,” Eric Robertsen, chief strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank, told Bloomberg.
A slew of U.S. Federal Reserve officials is due to speak on Wednesday, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan. This is the last chance for officials to speak on policy before a backout period beginning Jun. 5. The Fed’s next meeting will be on Jun. 16.
On the data front, investors are now focusing on U.S. data, including the Institute of Supply Management Manufacturing PMI, due later in the day. Further data include nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate  in May, due to be released on Friday."

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) examined the first batch of yuan-denominated carbon-neutral bonds issued this year by giant state-owned energy corporations such as China Energy Investment Corporation (CEIC) and the China Huaneng Group.
It said 30% of proceeds from the bonds were to be allocated to the working capital of the issuers.
""The promise of green bonds is that they can help channel capital to energy transition investments,"" IEEFA researcher Christina Ng said. 
""But potentially the proceeds raised by the SOEs from these bond deals could be spent on maintaining a steady or growing coal business, particularly as they have new coal assets in the pipeline."" 
Neither CEIC nor Huaneng responded immediately to a request for comment. 
Green financing has become one of China's top priorities as it tries to pay for the clean energy infrastructure required to bring emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.
China central bank advisor Ma Jun said in January that China would require at least 100 trillion yuan ($15.7 trillion) to meet its 2060 carbon neutrality pledge.
China overtook the United States when it came to issuing green bonds in the first quarter of this year, raising $15.7 billion, but analysts said more policy support was needed.
Companies were previously allowed to apply for green finance to fund ""clean coal"" projects, even though they still produced large amounts of carbon dioxide. 
The central bank has since excluded ""clean coal"" from the list of projects eligible for green bonds, but up to 50% of green bond proceeds can still be allocated to working capital and used to finance coal, Ng said. 

""One hundred percent of green bond proceeds should be going to green projects,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The bulk of share trading in the European Union takes place on exchanges with relatively little inside banks, an industry body said on Tuesday in a bid to stop what it called bourses seeking to ""perpetuate their dominance"".
The EU is reviewing its stock and bond trading rules, known as MiFID II, triggering a battle between exchanges and their top customers, the banks and large asset managers, over competition.
The EU's securities watchdog ESMA has estimated that nearly half of trading is off an exchange, prompting bourses to call for this part of the market to face tougher curbs so that more trading goes onto 'lit' venues like the main exchanges.
But the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), which represents wholesale market participants like banks and investment firms, said a report it commissioned from consultancy Oxera shows that 83% of share trading is on fully transparent venues like exchanges, with only 17% inside banks or other off-exchange platforms.
Oxera said it stripped out ""technical trades"", which represent a significant part of off-exchange trading but do not determine prices generally, to give a true picture of underlying activity.
(Oxera AFME Graphic 1: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnryamvl/Oxera%20AFME%20Graphic%201.PNG) 
AFME Chief Executive Adam Farkas said the report showed how raw data from ESMA can be used to inaccurately represent the trading landscape and influence policymaking, with the risk of perpetuating the dominance of exchanges in share trading.
The spat over statistics has led to the EU's executive European Commission to say it will first drill down into what it calls a ""dog's dinner"" of trading data before deciding on any changes in rules later this year.
Much of Europe's off-exchange trading has been based in Britain, which left the EU on Dec. 30, leading to chunks of trading leaving to City of London for Amsterdam, turning the Dutch capital into Europe's biggest share trading centre.

The UK-venue share of overall European trading activity fell from around 40% from the first quarter of 2020 to around 20% in the same quarter this year, Oxera said.

""Cyberpunk 2077,"" featuring Hollywood star Keanu Reeves, was one of the most anticipated games last year. It was delayed three times, and after a bug-ridden premiere it has been delisted from Sony's PlayStation Store for more than five months.
CD Projekt did not say how many units of ""Cyberpunk 2077"" it sold in the quarter. The company's chief financial officer, Piotr Nielubowicz, told a conference call that about 60% of first-quarter product sales came from Cyberpunk sales, without providing details.
Analysts have said sales were likely low, due to Cyberpunk's absence from the PlayStation Store and release of a major patch just in late March.
""The general situation as long as we are not back on the Sony store has not changed. One of the leading marketplaces for us is not available and we generate most of the sales on the PC/digital channels,"" a company official told the conference call.
Net profit in the first quarter fell 64.7% to 32.5 million zlotys, well below the 80 million zlotys expected by analysts, impacted by depreciation of Cyberpunk 2077 development expenditures and work on fixing the game. Revenue fell 2% to 197.6 million zlotys ($53.94 million). 
Selling costs rose 79.6% to 62.1 million zlotys in the quarter.
Battered by Cyberpunk's launch, CD Projekt plans to start parallel high-budget developments from 2022, as well as look for merger and acquisition opportunities.
Future sales growth, though, depends on its ability to re-engage Cyberpunk players. It confirmed plans to publish free downloadable content and update both Cyberpunk and The Witcher 3 to next-generation consoles in the second half. 
Last year, the company's shares hit an all-time high of 464.2 zlotys in the run-up to Cyberpunk's launch, but have lost over 60% of their value.

Volkswagen had said in March it would claim damages from Winterkorn over the scandal as it tries to draw a line under its biggest-ever crisis.
Business Insider, citing a draft contract, reported that an agreement between the carmaker, Winterkorn and other former executives could be signed this week.
Volkswagen's supervisory board is scheduled to discuss an agreement over the weekend, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. An annual general meeting of shareholders in July would then need to sign off on it.
Volkswagen declined to comment. A spokesman for Winterkorn didn't answer the phone when called for comment.
The German company had said in March that following a far-reaching legal investigation it had concluded Winterkorn had breached his duty of care. Winterkorn has denied being responsible for the scandal.
Volkswagen in 2015 admitted using illegal software to rig diesel engine tests in the United States. The scandal has cost it more than 32 billion euros in fines, refits and legal fees.

Winterkorn resigned as chief executive on Sept. 23, 2015, a week after the scandal broke.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday ordered officials to inspect coronavirus-related safety protocols at Renault-Nissan's Tamil Nadu car plant, where workers are on strike over allegations that social distancing rules are not being followed.
Workers at the southern Indian factory, jointly owned by  Renault  (PA:RENA) and alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor, did not report for duty on Monday over COVID-related safety concerns, the workers' union said.
Nissan, which owns a majority stake in the plant, denied the workers' safety allegations and told an Indian court it followed all guidelines. The company also said it would cooperate with the state government during the inspection and would reopen the factory gradually.
""Nissan continues to hold the safety and wellbeing of employees at the heart of our operations,"" a spokeswoman said, adding it will continue to add measures to safeguard employees and their families.
The Renault-Nissan plant has been shut since Wednesday.
The standoff is a sign of the challenges companies face in resuming operations when new infections in India are rising. Tamil Nadu state is one of the worst affected, with more than 30,000 new cases a day. 
Hundreds of workers near the auto manufacturing hub of Chennai have fallen ill with COVID-19 and dozens have died, labour unions say. 
Renault-Nissan, Ford and Hyundai halted work at their plants last week after workers protested and some went on strike. 
Hyundai Motor Co suspended one of its three shifts at a plant near Chennai for three weeks due to the coronavirus, according to an internal note to employees seen by Reuters and two sources familiar with the matter.
A spokesman confirmed Hyundai would operate two shifts from Monday, adding it was ""closely monitoring the pandemic situation in the state"" and adhering to safety guidelines.
Renault-Nissan workers refused to resume work on Monday saying in a letter to the companies that their demands - including social distancing, rehabilitation of families of dead workers and medical treatment of those affected by COVID-19 - had not been met.
COVID-19 PROTOCOLS
A two-judge bench ordered a senior government official in charge of industrial safety to visit the plant on Tuesday for an inspection, while also asking workers to resume their duties.
Distancing norms have to be maintained without exception, the court said, directing the management and workers to arrive at an amicable solution.
The Tamil Nadu state government on Saturday allowed carmakers near Chennai to keep operating, but asked them to ensure adherence to social distancing protocols.
One of the judges noted that one factory inspected by the state's industrial safety departments was served a notice asking to ""show cause"" for purported discrepancies with standard operating procedures.
A report by the Office of Director of Industrial Safety on  Wipro  (NYSE:WIT) Infrastructure Engineering, seen by Reuters, noted social distancing was not fully followed.
The report also said sanitization facilities were unavailable at many places within the factory and there was no full-time medical officer.
Reuters was unable to reach Wipro Infrastructure for comment.
Renault-Nissan said it had reduced production at the Tamil Nadu plant, its only manufacturing base in India, to 7,129 cars during the 13 working days in May against a target of 18,852. In April, it manufactured 17,207 cars. 

""They are disrupting the work which will impact the business and lives of thousands of people including the workmen's own dependents,"" Renault-Nissan said in a filing dated May 31.
The case will next be heard on Friday.

MILAN (Reuters) -A large majority of Atlantia's investors on Monday backed the sale of the group's stake in its motorway unit to Italian state lender CDP and allies, drawing a line under a dispute triggered by a deadly bridge collapse in 2018.
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), together with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Macquarie, put forward an offer last month valuing Atlantia's Autostrade per l'Italia unit at 9.3 billion euros ($11 billion).
The proposal is backed by the government, which has been seeking to regain control of Autostrade ever since a bridge run by the toll-road company in the port city of Genoa gave way on Aug. 14, 2018, causing the death of 43 people.
Atlantia, controlled by the powerful Benetton family, said in a statement the offer won 86.86% support in a shareholder vote, adding turnout was 70.4%.
The outcome confirms what sources had told Reuters.
Investor advisers Glass Lewis, ISS and Frontis Governance all recommended Atlantia's shareholders give their go-ahead to the sale of the infrastructure group's 88% stake in Autostrade to the CDP consortium.
Atlantia said later on Monday its board would meet on June 10 to give its final assessment of the offer. It is expected to rubber stamp Monday's decision.
The sale will free up capital and management time for the group to pursue new initiatives after nearly three years of impasse.
The transaction was approved despite criticism from some shareholders, including TCI. The activist fund repeatedly said that Autostrade was worth at least 11 billion euros.
TCI had also backed an attempt by Spain's Florentino Perez to study a rival offer for Autostrade through infrastructure group ACS, but the entrepreneur - who is president of soccer club Real Madrid - did not win the support of the Italian government to move ahead with a binding bid.
The activist fund did not disclose how it voted on Monday.
Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) and funds DIF, EDF (PA:EDF) Invest and China's Silk Road Fund, which own the remaining 12% of Autostrade, have an option to sell their stakes to the CDP consortium under the same conditions. 

Citi and UniCredit helped CDP on the offer for Autostrade, while Rothschild and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) advised Macquarie and Blackstone respectively. Atlantia worked with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and Merrill Lynch on the deal.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) and Eni are in talks over the future of their oil and gas assets in Algeria as the two groups increase efforts to refocus their businesses to tackle falling margins, rising debt and climate pressures, three sources said. Europe's top energy companies are cutting back their oil and gas portfolios to keep only the assets most likely to be profitable and redeploy capital for a transition to clean energy as uncertainty mounts over future demand for fossil fuel.
Earlier this month, they announced they were in talks to forge a joint venture to run their combined operations in Angola. 
The sources, asking not to be named, said BP and Eni are in early-stage talks for the Italian group to take over BP's assets in Algeria. 
The sides are exploring an outright sale as well as an option for BP to receive stakes in Eni assets around the world, possibly in its flagship liquefied natural gas development in Mozambique, one of the sources said. 
They have also looked at the idea of creating a joint venture in the North African country similar to the Angolan model, the sources said. 
BP and Eni declined to comment. 
The deal would help BP to dispose of its Algerian assets after its failure since 2019 to sell its 45.89% stake in the In Amenas natural gas plant. BP also holds a 33% stake in the In Salah gas plant.
LOWER PROFIT, HARDER TO SELL 
In Algeria, as in Angola, international groups that operate or own stakes in oil and gas fields earn fixed royalties based on the output from fields, in what are known as production sharing agreements (PSAs). 
That makes them less profitable than elsewhere and harder to sell.
One of the sources said BP had tried to sell, but it had proved difficult.
For Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa with strategic interests in Libya and Egypt, acquiring BP's assets would turn Algeria into a hub. 
BP's net share of production in Algeria in 2020 was 141 million cubic feet (mcf) of gas per day and 6,000 barrels of oil per day, its annual report said. 
Eni, which has long-term gas import contracts in the country, produced 81 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020, including 152.5 mcf of gas. 
BP and Eni have set out plans to transform their businesses in the coming decades, shifting away from oil and gas to renewable energy, power markets and low-carbon businesses. 
Eni, which has pledged to raise its green energy capacity by some four times to 4 gigawatts in 2024, has 5 MW of solar capacity in Algeria. 
As renewable energy generates smaller returns than oil and gas, majors face a dilemma as they seek to reform and balance investment in new activities while protecting ratings, keeping heavy debt under control and maintaining dividends. Eni has said its oil output will start tapering off after 2025 while BP has pledged to cut oil output by 40% by 2030. 

As part of the strategy, the companies aim to focus operations on the most profitable fields, such as the Gulf of Mexico in the case of BP, and Egypt’s giant offshore Zohr gas field for Eni. 
Eni has signed a series of deals with BP in Africa, including stake sales in the Nour and Shorouk fields in Egypt and a big commercial contract for LNG from Eni's Coral South project in Mozambique.

Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker has criticised Airbus without giving details of the dispute, but the sources said it involves the latest in a series of quality-control spats between the airline and Airbus.
Qatar Airways and Airbus declined to comment.
""We are in constant talks with our customers. The content of these discussions we keep confidential,"" an Airbus representative said.
Qatar Airways boasts exceptional scrutiny to detail in line with a premium brand, but aerospace executives have accused it of seizing on such details in the past to delay taking delivery of jets it no longer needs, a suggestion it has often denied.
The clash over paint quality comes at a sensitive time as Airbus tries to enforce delivery of dozens of jets built for airlines that either can't or won't take delivery amid a slump in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Airbus has sent out dozens of ""default notices"" or legal warnings to airlines over undelivered jets since the crisis began.
Chef Executive Guillaume Faury has threatened legal action against airlines that refuse to take deliveries.

Qatar Airways' Al Baker was quoted by Bloomberg earlier on Monday as saying the airline would refuse to take new aircraft from Airbus if it was not able to resolve the dispute.
Last year Al Baker said the airline would not take deliveries of any aircraft in 2020 or 2021 due to the coronavirus crisis. He later said the airline had reached an agreement with Airbus over delays. Details were not disclosed.

974,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>","Porsche, Piech families weigh direct stake in possible Porsche IPO-sources","By Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Porsche and Piech families, who control Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s largest shareholder, are prepared to take a direct stake in Porsche AG should the luxury carmaker be separately listed, two people familiar with the matter said.
Such a move would loosen the families' grip on Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen, in favour of direct ownership of the iconic sports car brand, founded by their ancestor Ferdinand Porsche, which dates back to 1931.
Speculation about a listing of the unit earlier this year included estimates of a standalone valuation of Porsche AG ranging from 45 billion to 90 billion euros ($55 billion-$110 billion), compared with 135 billion for the Volkswagen group.
While saying that a possible initial public offering (IPO) of Porsche AG is not high up on the agenda, Volkswagen continues to weigh scenarios for a listing, the people said, adding that the key obstacle remained VW's complex stakeholder set-up.
That set-up was carefully crafted in the wake of a failed takeover of Volkswagen by Porsche in 2009, which resulted in Volkswagen acquiring the well-known brand while the Porsche and Piech families became VW's most influential investors.
No decision has been made by Volkswagen on whether to separately list Porsche AG and there is no guarantee that such a move will happen, the people said.
Today, the families hold all ordinary shares of Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which owns more than half of the voting rights as well as a 31.4% equity stake in Volkswagen.
Shares in Volkswagen rose as much as 1.8% to the top of Germany's blue-chip DAX index following the news. Porsche SE's stock gained as much as 1.9%.
Porsche Automobil Holding and Volkswagen declined to comment.
Selling some voting rights in Volkswagen to co-shareholder Lower Saxony, which holds a 20% voting stake, would be one way for the families to gain direct ownership in the namesake brand while keeping activist investors out, Stifel analysts say.
""We believe this scenario would satisfy all parties,"" they wrote, adding that while the families would regain some control of Porsche AG, Lower Saxony would have a blocking minority and unions would be happy about the cash inflow.

Asked about a possible listing earlier this month, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said the group's current cash flow was sufficient to fund an ambitious turnaround to become the world's largest maker of electric vehicles.

975,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",Retailers and unions agree on 3-month extension to Bangladesh workers' safety accord,"By Victoria Waldersee and Ruma Paul
LISBON/DHAKA (Reuters) - Retailers and unions negotiating over a legally binding workers' safety accord in Bangladesh due to expire on Monday reached a tentative deal to extend it by three months, unions involved in discussions said, provided the around 200 signatory retailers agree on the extension.
The signatories - which include top apparel retailers like Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) - have until June 10 to state whether they agree, a spokesperson for UNI Global Union, one of the unions involved, said.
At least 10 have given their consent, according to UNI Global Union, including H&M, which confirmed it had agreed to the extension. 
Inditex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Unions said they will pull out of the organisation now running the accord - called the RMG Sustainability Council (RSC) - if retailers do not commit to the legally binding portion of the agreement, obliging them to fund the accord's operations and banning them from working with factories until they are deemed safe by accord inspectors.
""Without a legally binding agreement, no factory is safe,"" Babul Akter, president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, said. ""Bangladesh's garment industry will go back to square one ... we will have another Rana Plaza,"" Akter said, referring to the deaths of at least 1,100 in the collapse of garment production centre Rana Plaza in 2013. 
But industry representatives from factory owner association BGMEA, who form a third of the RSC board, said the most important thing was to strike an agreement that as many brands as possible would join.
""The industry wants every brand to sign on,"" BGMEA director Rubana Huq said. ""That's our stance.""
RACE TO THE BOTTOM?
The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, signed in 2013 after the Rana Plaza disaster, created an independent body to run inspections at factories and obliged retailers to sever business ties with factories that did not carry out repairs, providing emergency funds, low-interest loans or upfront payments where necessary. Firms could be tried in court in the country where they are domiciled if they failed to meet their obligations. 
Two retailers - which could not be named under terms of the settlement - were taken to court and forced to pay large sums, said Alke Boessiger, deputy secretary-general of UNI Global Union.
North American retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Macy's (NYSE:M), reluctant to sign onto a deal that risked legal cases at home, created a parallel Alliance on Workers' Safety in Bangladesh valid for five years in which members held each other to account without court involvement.
Sources close to the negotiations said that the Brand Association, a legal entity representing retailers in the RSC, wanted to reach an agreement that North American retailers would also sign onto.
But workers' rights groups said this could create a race to the bottom. 
""We want the RSC to be the industry initiative, but that doesn't mean we are prepared to lower our standards,"" Boessiger said.

A Brand Association representative was not available for comment. The organisation said in a statement on Sunday it was ""open to any brand sourcing from Bangladesh who is committed to securing the continued high safety standards within the membership framework.""
UK retailer Asos and German retailer Tchibo have also publicly committed to signing an extension of the legally binding agreement, with others declining to comment before the end of negotiations.

976,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Pulling power: the green lure of Sweden's industrial far north,"By Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Long home to polluting industries, the hydro and wind power of Sweden's far north is set to reduce the country's carbon footprint as it lures low-emission manufacturers and creates thousands of jobs for those willing to brave the dark and cold.
Known internationally for reindeer and spectacular views of the Northern Lights, the region also has a surplus of cheap, renewable electricity needed by energy-intensive industries under pressure from shareholders and regulators to help curb global warming.
Planned investments, including the production of fossil-free steel and electric vehicle (EV) batteries, will exceed 1,000 billion crowns ($120 billion) in the next decade, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson estimates.
""Job creation from the green transformation is not something that will happen in the future, it is happening in Sweden now,"" she said in a presentation in May.
EVs are a major part of the European Union's roadmap to reach net zero emissions by 2050. 
The bloc aims to have at least 30 million zero-emission vehicles on its roads by 2030 as it tackles the quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions that come from the transport sector.
The need for the industry to meet legally-binding EU environmental standards, made Sweden's far north and its green energy an obvious choice for battery maker Northvolt, partly-owned by auto giant Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
It is initially investing around 4 billion euros ($4.88 billion) in a gigafactory in Skelleftea, some 800 km (500 miles) due north of the capital Stockholm, to produce batteries with 40 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by 2024 - enough to power between 700,000-800,000 electric vehicles. 
""Access to the hydropower infrastructure ... in Skelleftea was really essential,"" Northvolt CEO Peter Carlsson said, citing local electricity costs of around one third of those in Germany and one fifth of those in China.
The jobs created are an opportunity for the relatively small local population and are also drawing in newcomers. 
""Of course, I wish it were a little warmer,"" said Senior Director Of Commissioning at Northvolt Christopher Gorelczenko, a U.S. citizen who arrived late last year to set up the gigafactory. 
CHEAP AND CLEAN
Sweden invested heavily in hydro power in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, with the aim of containing costs for its industry and being globally competitive. Many of the power plants are in the far north.
Over the last decade, the focus has been wind power, which provides around 20% of Sweden's electricity.
Carlsson, a former executive at Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., estimated the overall carbon footprint for Northvolt's batteries would be around a quarter of that of an equivalent power pack from China.
Cheap renewable energy was a also major draw for Hybrit, a joint venture between ore miner LKAB, state-owned energy company Vattenfall and steel-maker SSAB, which aims to produce fossil-free steel in Gallivare, above the Arctic Circle.
Rival H2 Green Steel aims to produce five million tonnes of fossil-free steel by 2030 in Boden, just south of the Arctic zone and not far from Lulea, where Hybrit has a small-scale, pilot fossil-free steel plant. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s first data centre entirely powered by renewable energy is in Lulea, where it has invested more than 8.7 billion crowns.
SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME
""I think it is a bit of window into the future, of what industrial development is going to look even in other countries,"" Mikael Nordlander, state-owned utility Vattenfall's Head of R&D portfolio, Industry Decarbonisation, said. 
Norrbotten county - which includes Lulea - and where LKAB's and Boliden's giant Kiruna and Aitik mines are located - accounted for around 11% of Sweden's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016, the local authority said.
""Previously, it was industry that was dragging down our climate work,"" Carina Sammeli, mayor of Lulea, a city of around 80,000, said. ""But now it's industry that is driving the change.""
Sweden emitted 4.26 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita in 2017 compared to a global average of 4.8 tonnes per person, the Our World In Data website shows. Fossil-free steel production alone could reduce Sweden's emissions by around 10%, Hybrit says.
The boom has created thousands of jobs, both direct and indirect. 
""If you are looking for a job, it might be time to look at moving to the North,"" Employment Minister Eva Nordmark said in April.
Unemployment in Norbotten and Vasterbotten - the top third of Sweden geographically - was the lowest in the country at 6.7% and 6.4% respectively, in 2020 against a national average of 8.5%, Sweden's Public Employment Service said, partly because of the transition to green industry.
H2 Green Steel reckons its plant in Boden - around 40 kilometers from Lulea - will create 10,000 new direct and indirect jobs. 
Sammeli says Lulea - where daylight can be as short as 3-1/2 hours in winter but where in summer, it does not really get dark - will need an extra 25,000 new residents to fill the demand for labour over the next 20 years. 
""We haven't grown much for years and haven't really needed to build much until recently,"" she said. ""Now we have big challenges in terms of planning, water and sewage capacity in order to build new residential areas.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World equities were firmly on track to post a fourth straight month of gains on Monday, while the dollar struggled broadly ahead of European and U.S. data this week that will provide a clearer picture on the global economy's recovery path.
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks drifted 0.1% higher, putting the gauge on track for a 1.4% gain for May. It is the longest monthly rising streak for the index since August 2020, when it marked a five-month run of gains, according to Refinitiv data.
But U.S. stock futures (ESc1) edged lower and European cash equities trading was subdued on Monday due to holidays in the United States and Britain, with benchmark indexes sticking to well-worn ranges.
May has proven to be a decent month for asset markets, but policymakers are increasingly faced with the dilemma that inflation is running hot while the underlying structural economy is still struggling to gain traction.
The main event of the week will be U.S. payrolls on Friday with median forecasts at 650,000, but the outcome is uncertain following April's unexpectedly weak 266,000 gain. 
Although U.S. inflation data last week was above estimates, another big miss on the jobs front would heap pressure on the Fed to postpone plans to wind down its stimulus.
""The question is, therefore, whether by September the Federal Reserve will be in a position to announce a tapering of its bond purchases starting next year, and the odds are quite decent though it might be delayed to December,"" said Sebastien Galy, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
The Fed next meets on June 16, and this week will be the last chance for members to discuss policy before a pre-meeting blackout period starts on June 5.
So far, investors have taken the Fed at its word that the labour market needs to improve a lot more before it speaks of tapering. That helped yields on U.S. 10-year notes ease to 1.58% with Fed funds futures pricing in a first rate hike by the first quarter of 2023.
Asian shares edged higher, and in Europe indexes consolidated gains after last week's record close ahead of manufacturing PMI data on Tuesday.
Among central banks debating inflation trends, the European Central Bank is perhaps the outlier with both policymakers and investors on the same page when it comes to expecting a return to below-target inflation, according to Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
That was evident in the bond markets too, where yields on benchmark German debt remained well below recent highs.
YUAN PRESSURE
A dovish Fed has also put the greenback under pressure against its rivals with the dollar recouping some of its losses after hitting a three-year low against the Chinese yuan.
The yuan was the big mover in global currency markets after policymakers directed financial institutions to hold more foreign exchange in reserve, a move that analysts say was aimed at curbing yuan strength.
In the offshore markets, the yuan weakened 0.2% versus the U.S. dollar with analysts at ING saying that Beijing's latest move will slow the currency's rise but will not halt it completely.
Concerns about global inflation and slowing growth have proved to be a boon for gold, with prices for the yellow metal rising 8% this month, vaulting comfortably above $1,900.
Oil prices were firm after gaining more than 5% last week to reach two-year closing highs as expectations of a rebound in global demand outweighed concerns about more supply from Iran once sanctions are lifted. [O/R]
All eyes will be on OPEC this week as it reviews its supply agreement, and any hint of an increase in output could pressure prices.

Brent added 1.4% to $69.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 39 cents to $67.28.
Unusually quiet cryptocurrencies showed some signs of volatility in holiday-stricken trading with bitcoin rising 4% to $37,000 while its smaller rival Ethereum climbed 8% to $2,578.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) said it would not seek confrontation at ProSiebenSat.1's annual general meeting on Tuesday but the German broadcaster's largest shareholder pressed home its call to collaborate on strategy.
The Italian media group, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, wants to bring about cross-border consolidation to enable European broadcasters to compete more effectively for advertising dollars.
It has built up a stake of nearly a quarter in ProSieben in support of that goal, but the broadcaster of ""Germany's Next Topmodel"" has repeatedly rebuffed its overtures, instead diversifying out of entertainment into dating and e-commerce.
""Mediaset is a long-term shareholder,"" Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani told Reuters in an interview on Monday. 
""Our position as a long-term shareholder is not to apply pressure. We would love to have more engagement,"" he added, offering to support the development of ProSieben's entertainment business. 
Mediaset said it controls a stake of 23.5% in ProSieben via shares and other financial instruments. Of that, it owns a direct voting stake of 12.4%, based on disclosures by the German company.
Giordani said Mediaset would back management's resolutions at Tuesday's AGM, saying: ""It's not the time for fireworks, but rather the time to build the right strategy for all ProSieben shareholders.""
But he said Mediaset took a flexible position on its holding in ProSieben. It had increased its direct shareholding in ProSieben in January and that process would continue.
DUTCH PLANS ON TRACK
Mediaset's plans to establish a new business base in the Netherlands, to be called MediaforEurope (MFE), received a boost when it ended a long-running legal dispute with shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY).
With the French media group lending its support, MFE should be established in September, creating ""a company that can start to consolidate the market"", said Giordani. 
Time is short, he said, pleading for Europe's commercial TV industry to build a common advertising platform that can compete with the dominant digital advertisers, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He dismissed in-country mergers, such as the recent deal struck in France between RTL's Groupe M6 and TF1, which is controlled by  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), as failing to address the industry's revenue weakness.
“It’s pretty easy to find fast synergies on costs. But the media’s problems in Europe are not costs – they are revenues,"" said Giordani. 
""If you want to compete with the large sellers of advertising, you have to offer a continental product.”

Giordani said he was sure that European consolidation would happen: ""We want to be part of this consolidation. We want to propose and explain how our consolidation will be the successful one.""
He also said that, after a strong first quarter, Mediaset's second quarter would be better. ""We are very happy about how the business is performing today.""

TORONTO (Reuters) -Two recent decisions by Canada's telecom regulator are freezing out competition in the country's highly concentrated industry, critics argue, making it even harder to bring down prices for mobile and internet service. For years, Canadian consumers have complained about high cellular bills, which rank among the steepest in the world, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has threatened to take action if the providers failed to cut bills by 25%. On Thursday the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ruled that it would not significantly lower the rates that small companies must pay to access the high-speed broadband networks of larger rivals, including BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc, Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp and Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc, known as the Big Three. That followed a CRTC ruling in April when it asked large telecoms firms to offer wholesale wireless access to so-called Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), smaller outfits that can then resell the capacity at reduced retail prices and pass on the savings to consumers, but with several stipulations that were seen as wins for big companies. While the two decisions were intended to foster competition, critics say they will only marginalize the smaller players.

Thursday's ruling will allow the big carriers to charge rates similar to the prices originally set in 2016 for wholesale access to their broadband networks. The decision overturns a 2019 ruling - which was still under appeal - that would have forced large telecom operators to lower their wholesale rates and make retroactive payments to small companies.
The Thursday ruling will result in much lower retroactive payments. TekSavvy, an internet service provider with around 300,000 subscribers across Canada, said it was petitioning the federal government directly to overrule the CRTC’s decision on broadband access rates, one of several avenues open to contest the ruling. It is also asking that CRTC Chair Ian Scott be removed from his role. Andy Kaplan-Myrth, a vice president at TekSavvy, told Reuters, ""I never heard this scenario discussed seriously, and never really considered that they would do this."" He described the ruling as a ""tombstone on the grave of telecom competition in Canada."" The Big Three operators control 89.2% of subscribers and 90.7% of revenue in Canada's telecom industry. Lawmakers and analysts have warned the concentration will only intensify if Rogers' planned $16 billion acquisition of Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) Inc is allowed to proceed. FALLING SHORT TekSavvy said it would pull out of the upcoming 3500mHz spectrum auction in June, the frequency required for 5G rollout, and scrap plans to launch a mobile service, as a result of the broadband ruling. Critics also said measures to allow MVNOs fell short of what was needed to encourage robust competition. ""The CRTC itself actively acknowledges just how concentrated the market is, and yet their decisions continue to not just uphold the status quo, but tip the scales even sweeter in big telecom's favor,"" Laura Tribe, executive director of OpenMedia, a community organization that advocates for affordable and accessible internet, said. Scott, the CRTC's chair, in an interview with Reuters defended the latest decision, stating that ""we make determinations that we believe are balanced and in the public interest."" Rogers and Telus did not respond to requests for comment on the Thursday decision. BCE said it was pleased with the ruling. Michael Geist, an internet law expert at the University of Ottawa, said the Trudeau government's hands-off approach to the issue - passing decisions back to the CRTC, Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne declining to push for significant legislation - sent a signal to the market that the government would not be a strong voice for consumers. Champagne's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment but his office previously said it was reviewing Thursday's ruling. Geist called the current atmosphere ""a dark period"" for smaller companies. ""But obviously it's 'happy days are here again' for the Big Three,"" he added.

The newspaper said it had seen an internal presentation circulated among top executives early this year stating that more than 60% of Nestle's mainstream food and drinks portfolio could not be considered healthy under a ""recognised definition of health"". 
The paper said this assessment applied to about half of Nestle's overall portfolio because categories like medical nutrition, pet food, coffee and infant formula were excluded from the analysis.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said that including these categories would significantly reduce the proportion of products potentially considered unhealthy. 
""Given the group’s confectionery, ice cream, and pizza businesses, the real figure for the group based on 2021 estimates would be 28%, which is hardly a surprise,"" he said in a note. He said the report could point to changes in the product portfolio, notably an exit from mainstream confectionary.
Nestle said in a statement it was working on a ""company-wide project"" to update its nutrition and health strategy and was looking at its entire portfolio to make sure its products helped meet people's nutritional needs. 

It said it had reduced sugars and sodium in its products by about 14-15% in the past seven years and would continue to make its products healthier.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish online second-hand shop Sellpy, which is majority-owned by fashion giant H&M, said on Monday it was opening in 20 more European countries, in a bet demand for sustainable fashion will keep growing. 
The start-up handles the entire sales process from picking up the goods from sellers' homes, to photographing, selling and shipping. The expansion will take its number of markets to 24 after it first launched in 2014 in Sweden.
Sellpy said in a statement second-hand was one of the fastest growing market segments within the fashion industry. 
""Every garment bought pre-owned saves resources for our planet. Demand in our new markets is growing rapidly"", Head of Expansion Gustav Wessman said.
As consumers become increasingly conscious about the origins and sustainability of their clothes, the fashion industry is coming under scrutiny for fuelling a throwaway culture. 
The H&M group, which is on the outlook for additional revenue streams following a few rough years with slowing sales in many H&M stores, bought its first stake in Sellpy in 2015. 
H&M has invested more than 20 million euros ($24.38 million) in Sellpy and owns around 70% of the company, Wessman told Reuters. 
Sellpy said it had started a collaboration with H&M that gives it access to an H&M warehouse in Poland, as well as service around distribution, quality control of garments and order handling.
Earlier this month, Lithuania-based Vinted raised 250 million euros ($305 million) to expand further in Europe and beyond, and said the fundraising put a pre-money valuation on the business of 3.5 billion euros.
Sellpy said more than nine million garments had been sold in total on its platform.

986,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2021 01:06AM ET</span>","U.S. tyre maker Goodyear faces allegations of labour abuse in Malaysia, documents show","By Mei Mei Chu and A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -American tire manufacturer Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is facing accusations of unpaid wages, unlawful overtime and threats to foreign workers at its Malaysian factory, according to court documents and complaints filed by workers.
In interviews with Reuters, six current and former foreign workers, and officials with Malaysia's labour department, say Goodyear made wrongful salary deductions, required excessive hours and denied workers full access to their passports. 
The department confirmed it had fined Goodyear in 2020 for overworking and underpaying foreign employees. One former worker said the company illegally kept his passport, showing Reuters an acknowledgement letter he signed in January 2020 upon getting it back eight years after he started working at Goodyear.
The allegations, which Reuters is the first to report, initially surfaced when 185 foreign workers filed three complaints against Goodyear Malaysia in the country's industrial court, two in 2019 and one in 2020, over non-compliance with a collective labour agreement. The workers alleged the company was not giving them shift allowances, annual bonuses and pay increases even though these benefits were available to the local staff, who are represented by a labour union. 
The court ruled in favour of the foreign workers in two of the cases last year, saying they were entitled to the same rights as Malaysian employees, according to copies of the judgement published on the court's website. Goodyear was ordered to pay back wages and comply with the collective agreement, according to the judgement and the workers' lawyer.
About 150 worker payslips, which the lawyer said were submitted to the court as evidence of unpaid wages and reviewed by Reuters, showed some migrants working as many as 229 hours a month in overtime, exceeding the Malaysian limit of 104 hours.
The foreign workers are claiming about 5 million ringgit ($1.21 million) in unpaid wages, said their lawyer, Chandra Segaran Rajandran. The workers are from Nepal, Myanmar and India. 
""They are put in a situation where they are being denied their full rights as what is provided for (by law),"" he said, adding that it amounted to ""discrimination"".
Goodyear, one of the world's largest tire makers, has challenged both verdicts at the high court. The appeal decision is expected on July 26. The verdict for the third case, over the same issues, is due in the coming weeks. 
Goodyear declined to comment on any of the allegations, citing the court process. According to the court ruling last year, Goodyear Malaysia argued that foreign workers are not entitled to the benefits of the collective agreement because they are not union members.
According to the ruling, a union representative testified that foreign workers are eligible to join and are entitled to the benefits in the collective agreement even if they are not members. The court agreed that the foreign workers' job scope entitled them to those benefits.
Goodyear told Reuters it has strong policies and practices relating to and protecting human rights.
""We take seriously any allegations of improper behaviour relating to our associates, operations and supply chain,"" a representative said in an email.
The union - the National Union of Employees in Companies Manufacturing Rubber Products - did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the workers' complaints. 
Goodyear's Malaysia operation is jointly owned by the country's largest fund manager, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, which directed queries to Goodyear.
FINES AND VIOLATIONS
Workers said they faced intimidation from Goodyear after they filed the lawsuits. Goodyear declined to comment.
""The company had different rules for different sets of workers,"" said Sharan Kumar Rai, who filed one of the lawsuits and worked at Goodyear in Malaysia from 2012 until last year.
The foreign workers filed the first two lawsuits in July 2019. Soon afterward, Goodyear asked some to sign letters, without their lawyer’s knowledge, that they would withdraw from the legal action, according to their lawyer, police complaints filed in October 2019 and a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. Reporting a complaint to police does not always result in criminal charges but can trigger an investigation.
Industrial court chairman Anna Ng Fui Choo said in her ruling that the letter ""was an act of unfair labour practice"".
Malaysia's labour department told Reuters it had investigated and charged Goodyear in 2020 over nine violations of labour laws, unrelated to the lawsuits, regarding excessive hours and wrongful salary deductions. It fined Goodyear 41,500 ringgit ($10,050), it said.

Malaysia has in recent years faced accusations from its own Human Resources Ministry and authorities in the United States of labour abuse at its factories, which rely on millions of migrant workers to manufacture everything from palm oil to medical gloves and iPhone components.

Pat Gelsinger told a virtual session of the Computex trade show in Taipei that the work-and-study-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a ""cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors"" that has placed huge strain on global supply chains. 
""But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components.""
Gelsinger had told The Washington Post in an interview in mid-April the shortage was going to take ""a couple of years"" to abate, and that it planned to start producing chips within six to nine months to address shortages at U.S. car plants.
Intel announced a $20 billion plan in March to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity, building two factories in Arizona and opening its plants to outside customers.
""We plan to expand to other locations in the U.S. and Europe, ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply chain for the world,"" Gelsinger said, without elaborating.

Intel's plans could directly challenge the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
The two have come to dominate the semiconductor manufacturing business, moving its centre of gravity from the United States, where much of the technology was once invented, to Asia, where more than two-thirds of advanced chips are now manufactured.

The company plans to issue A$245 million worth of new stock while current shareholders including EMR Capital Advisors are offering as much as A$364.1 million of existing shares, according to terms of the deal obtained on Monday by Bloomberg News.
The listing could revive a strong start to the year for IPOs in the country, where three prospective offerings potentially worth almost A$900 million were recently withdrawn. A hopeful sign for the market came Friday when Link Administration Holdings Ltd. forged ahead with a A$1.18 billion listing plan for its unit Torrens Group Holdings Pty, despite fielding a private equity offer for the business.
Existing shareholders will own about 45% of 29Metals after the IPO, the terms show. The company is set to start taking investor orders on Friday and to begin trading on the Australian Securities Exchange on June 23.
29Metals’ assets include the Golden Grove copper mine and Capricorn Copper, both in Australia, and Redhill in Chile, according to its website.
The offering comes after spot copper prices touched their highest in almost a decade last month, as investors focus on commodities critical to stimulus-driven infrastructure building and the green-energy transition. 29Metals also joins a tide of resources IPOs in Sydney that have succeeded despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The Australian market outshone other major capital markets for mining including Toronto and London by the number of offerings in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Monday morning as investors digested the possibility of a slowdown in the Chinese economic recovery from COVID-19.
They also continue to keep an eye on possible tapering talks caused by price pressure and await key U.S. economic data, including the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing PMI to be released on Tuesday, to gauge the economic recovery.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.23% by 10:45 PM ET (2:45 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.29%. Data released earlier in the day said that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 51 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55 in May. Although both figures remained above the 50-mark indicating growth, the manufacturing PMI was slightly below expectations.
The offshore yuan slipped after Sheng Songcheng, former director of People’s Bank of China statistics department, said the rise of yuan will not last, while the central bank said separately on Sunday that the currency may depreciate in the future.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.29%.

Investors remain concerned that the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 and stimulus measures around the world will lead to runaway inflation, which will force central banks to reduce support earlier than expected.
“There is likely more upside to go on the inflation scare front in the months ahead as base effects, the lagged impact of commodity price hikes and bottlenecks continue to feed through, but there are now a few more signs that it will be transitory,” Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital, said in a note.

On the data front, investors now await U.S. data for May, including Nonfarm Payrolls and the Unemployment Rate, due on Friday.
Investors continue to bet that the Fed will only start tapering talks when there is a significant improvement in the labor market.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Workers at the Renault-Nissan plant in southern India will not report for work on Monday over coronavirus-related safety concerns, according to a union letter to the company seen by Reuters, and two sources familiar with the matter.
Ford and Hyundai have also shut plants in the south over the last week following protests over COVID safety concerns.
""It will not be secure for workers to report to work on Monday the 31st of May, 2021,"" the Renault-Nissan India workers union said in a letter sent late on Sunday.
Two sources said the union would continue to discuss its demands on Monday. They did not wish to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Hundreds of workers near Chennai have fallen ill with COVID-19 and dozens have died this year, labour unions say. 
On Sunday, union leaders told Renault-Nissan its demands on adequate social distancing measures, rehabilitation of families of deceased workers and on medical treatment of those affected by Covid-19 had not been met.
""The union's request ... to ensure social distancing through reduced footfall has not been accepted,"" the letter to Renault-Nissan's managing director and vice-president of human relations read.
The union also said Renault-Nissan had only vaccinated 200 workers with a first dose. The company told a local court last week the plant had a workforce of more than 8,000.

Nissan (OTC:NSANY), which owns a majority stake in the plant, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The company said last week it had vaccinated employees over 45 years and was willing to inoculate those under 45 based on availability.
The state government on Saturday allowed carmakers to continue operating despite protests by workers, but urged companies to follow social distancing protocols and vaccinate all employees within a month.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cinemark and Regal Cinemas said on their websites that movie goers who are not fully vaccinated will be asked to continue wearing masks, and that other social-distancing measures and cleaning protocols will remain in place.
""In accordance with CDC guidelines, masks are not required for guests who are fully vaccinated,"" AMC said on its website, referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""If you are not fully vaccinated, we ask that you continue to wear a mask throughout the theater unless actively enjoying food or drinks.""
Similar updates to mask policy were made on Regal and Cinemark websites. All three chains said they would follow state and local mandates on mask wearing, which may be different from the CDC guidelines.
The changes for movie theaters come two weeks after the CDC said that fully vaccinated people need not wear masks in any setting.
Movie-going has begun ramping up in the United States after lengthy pandemic-related closures and a lack of new film releases.

Movie studios and theater chains last week launched a ""big screen is back"" campaign, previewing a summer filled with blockbusters including the new ""Fast & Furious"" movie and the superhero film ""Black Widow.""
Hollywood studios are closely watching box office receipts for two major films being released this weekend - ""Cruella,"" a prequel story about the villain in ""101 Dalmatians,"" and the thriller ""A Quiet Place Part II.""

CHENNAI (Reuters) -Carmakers in the Indian automobile hub of Chennai will be allowed to keep operating, the state government said on Saturday, amid protests by workers who fear catching COVID-19 in one of the country's hardest-hit states.
Tamil Nadu's government on Friday extended a near-total lockdown as coronavirus infections and deaths rise in the southern state, where average cases are running at more than 30,000 a day, official figures show.
But a government order issued on Saturday said so-called continuous process industries, which include auto factories, would be allowed to function in accordance with measures such as social distancing to stem the virus's spread.
It also urged vehicle manufacturers to initiate immediate action to vaccinate all their employees within a month.
Tamil Nadu authorities have ramped up vaccination in recent days, and companies including carmakers have organized vaccination drives.
Hundreds of workers in and around Chennai - often dubbed India's Detroit - have fallen ill with COVID-19 and dozens have died, labour unions say.
Manufacturing plants run by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Hyundai Motor Co near Chennai were shut this week after workers protested over unsafe working conditions.
Renault-Nissan shut its manufacturing unit after workers threatened to boycott work, saying social distancing norms were being flouted, while Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield shut its three units over safety concerns.
Union sources at Hyundai, Ford and Renault-Nissan said they were continuing to talk with the companies.
""We're scared about working. The company is citing government orders and asking us to report for work. The government needs to think about the welfare of workers,"" a senior union leader at Hyundai said.
Tamil Nadu's government also gave permission for units near Chennai with export orders, such as construction and mining equipment maker  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn, to operate their plants with 50% worker capacity.

Global carmakers operating in Chennai have said they will prioritize worker safety and adherence to social-distancing protocols.
""Health and safety of our societies, partners and employees is our topmost priority,"" Biju Balendran, managing director at Renault-Nissan India, said in a statement earlier this week.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's Mahindra & Mahindra expects it will take at least another two years for car sales to return to their pre-pandemic peaks, but a slow pace of vaccinations could hurt recovery prospects, its chief told Reuters in an interview. 
Battered by the pandemic in 2020 and an economic slowdown in 2019, passenger vehicle sales in India fell to 2.7 million units in the last fiscal year - their lowest level in six years and well below the peak of 3.4 million units in fiscal year 2019.
Mahindra Chief Executive Officer Anish Shah said sales would rebound by fiscal year 2023 if a majority of the country's population is inoculated and new COVID-19 cases ease, helping the economy recover.
""Getting back to full normal is going to depend on vaccinations ... (else) we will always have the fear of the next wave coming in and disrupting things again,"" Shah 
The world's second-most populous country has recorded 28 million cases so far, second only to the United States. Infections have surged in recent weeks, and in May India recorded its highest monthly COVID-19 death toll since the pandemic began. 
Yet, only about 3% of India's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated, the lowest rate among the 10 countries with the most cases.
Car sales had started to pick up in the January-March period but a second, more deadly wave of infections forced lockdowns again. This time consumer sentiment has taken a hit and discretionary spending is likely to take longer to recover.
The virus is also spreading to rural India, which was relatively protected during the first wave and had offset the low demand automakers saw in urban centres.
Mahindra, which has 6% share of India's passenger vehicles market and is the country's biggest tractor maker, saw robust growth in its farm sector revenues last year but sales in the hinterlands have dipped in May, Shah said. 
This time, urban and rural buyers are holding back until the crisis passes.
""This year we have seen our customers also worry about putting up money and buying anything, saying what happens in case someone (in the family) gets COVID,"" he said.

Shah expects the pace of vaccinations in India to pick up in June but said if that does not happen it would be concerning. 
""It is about reaching a certain point where we don't have to get into lockdowns once more,"" he said. ""If that happens, we will continue to be in this phase of two steps ahead and one step back.""

The Florida trial is the second to address allegations 3M hid design flaws, fudged test results and failed to instruct the military in proper use of the earplugs, which were used by the army between 2007 and 2013. 
The two decisions are in ""bellwether"" cases, where the parties select a set of cases from the thousands that are pending to test the strength and weaknesses of the claims. The next such trial begins on June 7. 
3M said it will continue to defend itself in upcoming trials, adding that its ""Combat Arms Earplug Version 2 product is and has always been safe and effective to use"".

Plaintiffs' attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement, ""We continue to believe that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that 3M knew their CAEv2 earplugs were defective, yet allowed our servicemembers who relied on them for hearing protection to suffer from preventable hearing loss and tinnitus.""
In April, three veterans who had accused the company of covering up design defects in its earplugs were awarded $2.1 million each in punitive damages and a total of $830,500 in compensatory damages for their medical expenses, lost earnings and pain and suffering.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc should review how it is addressing racial justice and equity after a shareholder proposal on the topic won strong backing, New York state's top pension official said on Friday.
A filing on Friday showed 44% of votes cast supported a call for a review of the company's impact on equity, diversity and other areas proposed by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s annual meeting on May 26, a high total for such a measure. 
DiNapoli said the measure would have received a majority but for the 14% stake held by CEO Jeff Bezos, a sign of investor dissatisfaction at the leading online retailer.
""Shareholders sent a loud message to Amazon that they want the company to do more to address racial diversity, equity and inclusion. It's time for Amazon to listen to its investors,"" DiNapoli said in an emailed-statement.
Amazon had previously said the measure did not win a majority but it did not give the voting breakdown.
An Amazon representative said the company has ""initiated numerous programs to assess and address racial justice considerations across key aspects of our operations that we believe fully address the objectives of this proposal.”
The call for the racial equity audit received the highest level of support among 11 shareholder proposals at Wednesday's meeting.
Another, calling for Amazon to consider adding an hourly worker to its board of directors received support from 17% of votes cast, the filing showed.

Proposals with such low levels of support are rarely adopted, although the figure was about twice what similar calls for workers-on-boards have received at other companies in recent years.
The measure, which received a rare endorsement from Institutional Shareholder Services, was closely watched at the annual meeting after a union organizing effort at the company failed in April.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Exasperation with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) following a string of scandals is prompting Switzerland to rethink a system in which top bankers have been largely untouchable.
Credit Suisse's heavy losses from the collapse of family office Archegos and the decimation of billions of client investments backed by insolvent British financier Greensill have angered regulators and triggered a rare discussion among lawmakers about fining bankers.
The debate, the biggest public discussion about banking reform since the financial crash, centres on ending the current laissez-faire regime, where fines on bankers are not possible, to copy Britain's stricter rule book.
""Bank directors don't take responsibility for their action because there is no need to. There are no real sanctions for mismanagement,"" said Gerhard Andrey, a Green member of the Swiss parliament. 
""The scandals that have hit Credit Suisse, from Mozambique to Greensill, are damaging for Switzerland's reputation. We have proposed a reform ... that would mean if something goes wrong, then the manager is on the hook,"" he said.
Andrey's proposals, which follow the ground-breaking British model that makes top management of financial firms directly accountable for their actions, are set to be discussed by Swiss lawmakers in the coming days. 
The debate has unfolded after Credit Suisse lost more than $5 billion from the collapse of family office Archegos and faced a barrage of legal action over $10 billion of client investments linked to Greensill.
A bank spokesman said its board of directors had launched investigations that would ""reflect on the broader consequences"" of those events, adding that it had made management changes in investment banking and risk controls.
The string of scandals angered officials at supervisor FINMA, who struggle to hold bankers to account because Swiss rules only allow it sanction directors if directly involved in wrongdoing rather than for general managerial lapses.
A FINMA spokesman told Reuters that it welcomed a discussion about ""optimising"" ""questions about personal responsibility"", adding that other financial centres ""go significantly further than Switzerland"".
He said current Swiss rules allowed penalties, such as banning bankers from working, only if there was a direct link between the manager and wrongdoing, and that it was not enough to show that person was simply in charge.
Despite more than $15 billion in writedowns and penalties at Credit Suisse and multiple scandals, FINMA has struggled to get the bank under control and dissenting shareholders also failed to oust its chairman, Urs Rohner, before he retired this year.
As well as Archegos and Greensill, Credit Suisse's has had other problems, including a spying scandal that forced the departure of its former CEO.
Its bankers also faced proceedings in Britain and the United States related to loans granted to Mozambique that plunged it into a debt crisis.
U.S. prosecutors last year said they were investigating Credit Suisse's role in the $2 billion corruption case, which stems from loans the bank helped arrange to develop Mozambique's coastal defences. The bank has said it is cooperating with the enquiry.
Commenting on its most recent setbacks, the bank said it had suspended some pay to employees involved, including executive board members so that it would be able to claw back the money if needed. 
Monika Roth, a Swiss lawyer and compliance expert, said it was prohibitively expensive for bank shareholders to seek justice by pursuing directors over failings in Swiss courts and that it should be made possible for supervisors to claw back director pay.
Any reform, however, is likely to meet resistance. The Swiss Banking Association said that current supervision was ""well-balanced"" and rigorous and that any improvements should take into account the ""peculiarities"" of Swiss banking.

Dominik Gross, of the Swiss Alliance of Development Organisations, predicted that Swiss lawmakers would be reluctant to change. 
""There is an understanding that a strong financial centre is part and parcel of Switzerland - just like watches and chocolate. A large part of the population profits from the money that comes in.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Friday as investors brushed off a stronger-than-expected inflation reading, as both the Dow and S&P 500 indexes clinched their first weekly gain in the past three weeks.
Consumer prices, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.7% in April, topping analysts' 0.6% estimate and after a 0.4% increase in March. PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.
In the 12 months through April, the core PCE price index surged 3.1%, smashing through the Fed's 2% target, as the reopening economy unleashed pent-up demand.
Investors have been closely watching economic data and comments from Fed officials for signs of runaway inflation and the possibility the central bank may begin to pull back on its massive stimulus measures.
""The data is going to remain volatile as well, the inflation data that we saw this morning with core PCE was a high print, but really not that far ahead of consensus,"" said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
""Base effects definitely play a role, distorting the takeaways from some very large year-over-year type of numbers,"" he added. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.81 points, or 0.19%, to 34,529.45, the S&P 500 gained 3.23 points, or 0.08%, at 4,204.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.46 points, or 0.09%, at 13,748.74. 
Graphic: U.S. inflation heats up, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/xlbvgkrdxvq/chart_eikon.jpg 
For the week, the S&P rose 1.17%, the Dow gained 0.94% and the Nasdaq advanced 2.06%. For the month, the S&P climbed 0.55%, the Dow added 1.94% and the Nasdaq lost 1.53%.
Fed officials have repeatedly maintained in recent days that the central bank is not ready to adjust its monetary support, although some have suggested they are open to begin discussing scaling back its bond-buying plan. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said the labor market was tighter than many realize.
Despite the data showing a rise in inflation, U.S. Treasury yields fell and helped lift high-growth technology stocks. Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) climbed 5.43% after raising its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, helped by increased demand for its cloud-based software during the pandemic.
Inflation concerns have persisted for several weeks and weighed on growth names, many of which reside in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, and the index posted its first monthly decline since October.
Volatility has risen even as the S&P 500 has rebounded to less than 1% below its May 7 record high, and the index saw its smallest monthly gain in the past four in May.
The U.S. stock market will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. Analysts cautioned against drawing strong conclusions from Friday's lightly traded market.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.32 billion shares, compared with the 10.52 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co fell 1.47% after the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the planemaker halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliners, adding fresh delays for customers following a recent five-month delivery suspension due to production problems.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 108 new highs and 23 new lows.

(Reuters) -Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) closed lower on Friday, snapping a four-day rally that saw them gain 116% on the week.
After vaulting to a record high during the session, AMC's shares finished down 1.5% at $26.12. The stock's weekly gain was its largest since January. 
Shares in GameStop (NYSE:GME), meanwhile, closed down 12.6% on Friday at $222 after hitting a session peak of $268.79. For the week, GameStop shares registered a gain of 25%, their biggest weekly advance since mid-March.
The video game retailer has been at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail-trading mania this year.
""This is confirmation we're seeing retail investors coming back into the equity market after being sidelined,"" said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist for Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. ""It feels like a deja-vu of what happened in January,""
Investors betting against AMC and Gamestop had a rough week with AMC short-sellers suffering $1.2 billion in mark-to-market losses for the week while GameStop shorts were down $518.6 million, according to the latest data from S3 Partners. 
Retail traders' shift into so-called meme stocks - shares favored by the denizens of online communities such as Reddit's WallStreetBets - comes on the back of a selloff in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies whose prices have slumped in recent weeks.
Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, was up about 1% for the week.
AMC saw some $127 million in net inflows from retail investors on Thursday, its biggest single-day net inflows since Jan. 27, according to data from Vanda Research. AMC rose 35.5% on Thursday, adding more than $3.3 billion to its market value, according to data from Refinitiv. 
With 656 million shares changing hands on Friday, AMC was the most traded stock on U.S. exchanges for the second day in a row. 
Data also showed the cinema operator was the most traded stock on brokerage Robinhood's popular trading app, as well as on that of UK-based Freetrade, where buy orders have outnumbered sell orders two-to-one.

On trading-focused social media site Stocktwits (ST), message volume related to AMC spiked by nearly 40%, with more than 97% of messages reflecting positive sentiment towards the stock.

The United States and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the attack.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Eleven U.S. airlines issued $12.84 billion in cash refunds to customers in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic upended the travel industry, the head of industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A) said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday.
Airlines have faced a backlash from passengers and some lawmakers over their handling of redemptions for flights canceled during the pandemic.
Earlier this month, Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal called on carriers to issue cash refunds whether flights were canceled by the airline or traveler.
Nicholas Calio, A4A chief executive, acknowledged that many carriers encouraged customers to accept vouchers for future travel instead of cash, but said it was not done with ""ill intent"" but rather to prevent potential bankruptcy declarations.
""The facts clearly show that U.S. airlines have maintained a steadfast commitment to the traveling public over the course of the pandemic and routinely issued refunds in accordance with all federal laws and regulations,"" Calio wrote in a letter to the two senators.
Calio said the cash refunds, which accounted for about 20% of airline revenues last year, came on top of billions of dollars of travel credits that are now being used ""at a rapid clip"" to book fresh flights. 

The redemption of vouchers currently accounts for 10% to 15% of carriers' monthly ticket sales and is expected to increase in coming months as the pandemic winds down and markets and venues re-open, Calio said in the letter, seen by Reuters.
A forecast surge in summer leisure travel as more Americans become vaccinated against the coronavirus is expected to help airlines return to positive cash flow after record losses last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government advised airlines on Friday to use ""extreme caution"" when flying passengers over Belarus after authorities from that country forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and arrested a dissident journalist on Sunday.
The Federal Aviation Administration's ""Notice to Airmen"" does not apply to cargo carriers such as  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) and Fedex Corp that fly over Belarus.
United Airlines flies a route to India that sometimes is routed near Belarus but no other U.S. passenger carrier typically flies through the former Soviet republic's airspace.
A United spokeswoman said the airline would ""be complying with"" the directive and declined further comment.
The FAA did not issue a formal advisory like some other nations did discouraging transit over Belarus. One issue is carriers that avoid Belarusian airspace will need to fly over Russia, requiring Moscow's approval to change routing.
Still, the FAA note is the latest sign of Western dismay after Belarusian air traffic control informed the Ryanair pilot of a hoax bomb threat and Minsk scrambled a MiG-29 fighter to escort the jetliner down, and then arrested Roman Protasevich, a blogger and critic of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

The FAA said airlines should ""exercise extreme caution until the agency can better assess Belarus' actions surrounding the May 23 diversion of a passenger jet and the potential for Belarus to repeat similar actions in the future."" 
It added it is ""working closely with other U.S. agencies to determine whether any additional measures may be necessary, and will evaluate an international investigation report to determine the risks for U.S. passenger airlines flying in that area.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As millions of Americans gear up for a summer of vacation flights, Ben Wallander is hitting the books and the simulator. 
The 27-year-old is one of hundreds of pilots Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are rushing to train after a surge in travel bookings spurred by COVID-19 vaccinations. 
Thousands of pilots at Delta and American have lost their active status, which lapses after 90 days of not flying, at some point over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on air travel and brought airlines to their knees.
But a long U.S. Memorial Day weekend from Friday is expected to usher in a forecast surge in summer leisure travel that will test the ability of airlines to manage a long-awaited comeback.
While the airlines have already retrained many of their pilots, the travel revival has forced Delta and American to seek more simulators and flight instructors to expedite training and unblock a logjam, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Both airlines are beneficiaries of three COVID-19 relief packages worth $54 billion mostly in free money the industry argued was necessary to keep workers like pilots with costly training requirements ready.
Analysts warn that failing to ensure a smooth travel recovery could lead to flight cancellations and delays in generating cash needed to repay pandemic debt.
""It's quite the puzzle,"" McKinsey aviation consultant Vik Krishnan said of the pilot training logistics, likening them to a game of Tetris.
Delta and American must train pilots who flew on fleets retired due to the pandemic as well as those filling vacancies on different aircraft types after colleagues took buyouts, in addition to annual recurrent training requirements.
""Our pilot training has remained on track with our scheduled operational plans and continues to be,"" Delta spokesman Anthony Black said.
American spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said: ""We have the training capacity ready and are able to meet the anticipated increase in flying.""
BOOM AND BUST
Before the coronavirus crisis, global air travel was growing at a record 5% a year, generating a need for 804,000 pilots over the next 20 years, based on Boeing (NYSE:BA) estimates.
But volatility in pilot availability has plagued the airline industry, which lurched from worldwide shortages before COVID-19 to unemployment or furlough schemes during the pandemic and now renewed concerns about bottlenecks in the key U.S. market.
The problem has snowballed during the industry's worst ever crisis, leading to yet another squeeze.
Delta has around 12,600 pilots and has posted 1,600 internal positions for captain and first officer, memos show.
Wallander, an Airbus A220 pilot, was recalled by Delta in March, but is not scheduled for training until June. 
He told Reuters he has decided to stick with the A220 for his return to the cockpit as this means he does not ""have to go through a long training course"".
Courses can range from days to weeks depending on how long pilots have been away and whether they are upgrading positions or switching plane types.
All pilots must spend time in simulators, of which airlines own a finite number, followed by flights alongside a training captain, who signs off on their return. 
However, many of these ""check"" pilots in turn need training on different aircraft types following fleet changes or have retired, leaving a gap in knowledge and resources.
""All of this creates a cascading effect on training,"" said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 pilots at American.
United Airlines, the other major international U.S. airline, struck a deal with its pilots union that helped nearly 12,000 maintain active flying status through the pandemic. 
Among measures to boost training, American is renting simulators owned by Canada's CAE (NYSE:CAE) in its Texas home base while Delta is conducting more training beyond its Atlanta base and adjusting briefings around simulator time to squeeze in about 25% more sessions per day, sources said.

American plans to fly around 90% of its pre-pandemic domestic schedule this summer. Delta is also ramping up flights and expects its planes to be about 90% full this weekend.
""We slammed on the brakes really fast and now we're coming back even quicker,"" Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets rose while the U.S. dollar rebounded against major currencies on Friday as new data strengthened concerns about surging inflation and more heated economic activity from pent-up demand. 
A U.S. Commerce Department report showed that consumer prices accelerated 3.1% in the year to April, blowing past the Federal Reserve's 2% target and posting its largest annual gain since 1992.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, also rose at an 11.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, positioning the economy for strong growth as rising vaccinations eases COVID-19 pandemic's grip.
The dollar index of major currencies rose 0.043% to 90.053 after making gains in early morning trading. The index is down 1.34% for the month.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was lower at 1.5807% from 1.61% late on Thursday, compared with 1.6310% at the end of April.
""It's another indication that we continue to see accelerating inflation remains a concern to many investors, but the markets are showing us that people are comfortable with it,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks rose 0.31% to 711.15. It was up 1.4% for the month. European stocks gained 0.57% to 448.98 and 2.65% in May.
Investors have watched this week as multiple Federal Reserve officials came out to calm inflation jitters ahead of the release of Friday's report and signal a possible start to talks about tapering stimulus.
On Thursday, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, Randal Quarles, joined the chorus, saying he was ""fully committed"" to keeping monetary policy running at full throttle while jobs recover.
All major indexes were making gains on Wall Street in the early afternoon, led by technology, healthcare, real estate, and financial stocks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.19%, to 34,529.45, the S&P 500 gained 0.08%, at 4,204.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.09%, at 13,748.74.
For the month, the Dow added 1.94%, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.55%, and the Nasdaq shed 1.53%.
Overnight in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei leapt more than 2%, ending the month 1.17% higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.46% on Friday and 0.3% for the month.
""The market is taking the Fed at its word for the time being, but if the numbers keep coming like this, that narrative will be challenged, as only scaling back asset purchases may not be enough,"" said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network in Boston.
Gold reversed rose above the key $1,900 level on Friday, after data showed rising U.S. consumer prices in April and boosted bullion's appeal as an inflation hedge.
Spot gold rose 0.38% to $1,903.3383 per ounce, having earlier dipped as much as 0.8%. It has risen as much as 7.6% during the month.

Oil prices inched higher on Friday, with Brent holding near $70 a barrel as strong U.S. economic data and expectations of a rebound in global demand outweighed concerns about more supply from Iran once sanctions are lifted.
Brent rose 0.27%, to settle at $69.65 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 0.36%, to settle $66.61 a barrel. Brent and U.S. crude are up 3.57% and 4.31% respectively in May.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Auto data startup Wejo, backed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), will go public through a reverse merger with blank-check company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp in a deal that values the British company at $800 million including debt, the companies said on Friday.
The deal will raise $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, the companies said. That includes $230 million from Special-Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Virtuoso and another $100 million referred to as Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE). 
Wejo Chief Executive and founder Richard Barlow said institutional investors make up most of the PIPE, but declined to identify the firms involved. An additional $25 million could be raised within the next month as talks continue with other potential investors, he said.
Investors in the PIPE include No. 1 U.S. automaker GM, which previously invested in Wejo, as well as data management company Palantir Technologies Inc, which billionaire Peter Thiel co-founded, Wejo and Virtuoso said. The sizes of their investments or stakes were not disclosed.
The $800 million enterprise value for Wejo implies an estimated $1.1 billion pro forma equity value. 
""The future is data and this is a company that's sitting there right in the middle of this incredible wave of data that's coming,"" Virtuoso CEO Jeffrey Warshaw said in an interview. ""All this opportunity to monetize it, it's almost limitless."" 
The merger with Virtuoso is expected to close in the second half of the year, the companies said. The new company will trade under the symbol ""WEJO"" but the stock exchange has not been determined. Reuters had previously said Wejo and Virtuoso were in talks.
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep a traditional initial public offering (IPO) to enter public markets. 
The valuation is down from the more than $2 billion that sources told Reuters in March Wejo had hoped to achieve.
The SPAC market has cooled off recently amid fears of frothy valuations and last month the SEC suggested warrants issued by SPACs should be accounted for as liabilities instead of equity instruments. 
Manchester-based Wejo organizes data from almost 11 million vehicles connected to the Internet through embedded modems for such clients as GM, Hyundai Motor Co and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF). 
Automakers can use the data generated from that connection to develop apps and services for fleets, smart cities and individual consumers, including advertising, fleet management, insurance, remote diagnostics, roadside assistance, parking availability and traffic information.
""Getting the data-software piece right is going to be critical for making the next best product,"" Palantir global head of business development Kevin Kawasaki said. 
Founded in 2014, Wejo, which stands for ""we journey,"" has raised almost $200 million according to PitchBook from such investors as GM, which acquired a significant stake in 2019, German auto supplier Hella, DIP Capital and the British government.

Wejo estimates that by 2030, the connected vehicle data market will be worth $500 billion, creating an opportunity for revenue streams and more services for automakers and their customers, as well as greater efficiency for companies in product development. Wejo's technology platform, ADEPT, allows automakers to organize the data collected in those vehicles.
On Feb. 1, Wejo's Israeli rival Otonomo said it would go public in a SPAC merger with Software Acquisition Group Inc II.

Consequently, Wall Street analysts expect the biotech industry to grow significantly soon, with the biotech stocks Organogenesis (ORGO),  BioDelivery  Sciences (NASDAQ:BDSI) and  Champions Oncology  (NASDAQ:CSBR) gaining more than 45% in the near term. So, let’s evaluate these companies more closely.With more than 50% of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated for COVID-19 (according to the CDC), biotech companies have shifted their focus to research and development projects for other critical ailments. As a result, the global biotechnology market is expected to grow at a 15.8% CAGR over the next seven years to hit a $2.44 trillion market size by 2028.

Against this backdrop, we believe popular pet care companies Zoetis (ZTS) and Elanco Animal (ELAN) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Zoetis Inc .

The company sells its products to third-party distributors, veterinarians, and farm animal producers, and dairy farmers, and provides aquaculture operations.
Remote lifestyles gave rise to increased pet adoption during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Precious metals are a proven medium of exchange, portable, divisible, interchangeable, durable, and valued across the world. It’s remarkable that human civilizations of different eras, cultures, and geographies - all valued gold and silver, even though they had wildly different beliefs and ways of life. It almost seems as if the value of these assets is wired into our DNA. 
Until 1971, all major currencies were backed by gold reserves, however, this changed under the Bretton-Woods agreement which severed the link between fiat currencies and gold. Now, gold and silver are less seen as money and more viewed as an investment option to protect purchasing power and tend to outperform during periods of high inflation and weak economic growth. Besides investment demand, there is also industrial demand for gold and silver due to their antimicrobial properties and ability to conduct electricity.
While many investors choose to invest in precious metals through ETFs, coins, or bullion, another option is to invest in gold and silver mining stocks. During bull markets, miners are the best performing group in the precious metals complex as any gains in the price flow straight to the bottom line. Of course, the key is to find miners with low costs and increasing production. 5 gold and silver miners with these characteristics are Alamos Gold (AGI), AngloGold Ashanti (AU), Yamana Gold (AUY), Gold Fields Limited (GFI), and B2Gold Corp.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed modestly higher Friday, snapping a two-week loss on rising technology stocks as falling U.S. bond yields suggests they may be starting to buy the Federal Reserve’s bet that the turn-up in inflation will prove transitory.
The S&P 500 rose 0.08%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.19%, or 64 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.09%.
The personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose 3.1% in the 12 months through April.
The sharp uptick in inflation was driven by a boost in demand for the services sector of the economy, including air travel, recreation and accommodation as the reopening gathered pace. But this services-led push in inflation will likely fade.  
“As demand rotates from the supply-constrained goods sector to the labor intensive service sector, this should help ease inflationary pressures and accelerate employment growth,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Against the backdrop of increasing expectations that inflation could prove transitory, U.S. bond yields slipped, paving the way for growth corners of the market like tech to shine.
Tech notched a second weekly win as investors digested mostly positive earnings from sector heavyweights including Salesforce.
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) jumped more than 5% after the enterprise software company reported first quarter results that topped expectations, and raised guidance amid ongoing demand for cloud services that is set to continue.
“The work from home shift clearly accelerated growth prospects, however the longer term trend around cloud is a massive market for cloud transitions and digital transformation initiatives for CRM as the company continues to be front and center on many of these projects in both the public and enterprise sectors,” Wedbush said in a note.
Chip stocks also played a role in the broader rally in tech, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally more than 5% following it’s better-than-expected quarterly results released earlier this week. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) an  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) were up close to 1%.
The day of green for tech stocks came at the expense of cyclicals, with financials, industrials and energy underperforming the broader market.
But cyclicals are up sharply since the start of the year as investor appetite has broadened out beyond tech. History suggests this broadening out in the market is good news for stocks.
""We're not going to see the market crashing if, in fact, investors are broadening out and buying more and more,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday.
“Market crashes tend to be characterized by a narrow market … a few big stocks going up, while the average stock doesn’t. But that doesn’t seem to be what we’re seeing now, so that is good news,” Brown added.
The short-squeeze on Reddit-linked stocks including AMC, GameStop, SPCE continued. The Redditors are set to close out the week with a big win as traders betting against AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME), Virgin Galactic Inc (NYSE:SPCE) have lost a staggering $2.8 billion since Monday. 
AMC, which has more doubled this week, has inflicted the most pain on short-sellers, who have lost about $1.5 billion, according to data from S3 Partners."

""Given the recent uptick in industry-wide incidents of passenger disruptions inflight, we have made the decision to pause the previously announced re-start of alcohol service onboard June (Hawaii flights) and July,"" said Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz.
After airlines resumed travel following easing of COVID-19 led restrictions, they had mostly suspended in-flight services on domestic flights to avoid having passengers remove their masks while eating or drinking.
Southwest Airlines' decision comes following an incident where a passenger assaulted a flight attendant verbally and physically, during a flight from Sacramento to San Diego on Sunday. The passenger was later taken into custody by Law Enforcement Officials.
""We realize this decision may be disappointing for some customers, but we feel this is the right decision at this time in the interest of the safety and comfort of all customers and crew onboard,"" Mainz said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) drug for lung cancer patients with a specific mutation in a gene known as KRAS whose disease has worsened after treatment with chemotherapy or other medicines.
The drug, sotorasib, which will be sold under the brand name Lumakras, shrank tumors with the KRAS mutation in around 36% of patients in clinical trials.
The medication is designed to target a gene mutation known as KRAS G12C that occurs in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer.
Amgen estimates that around 25,000 U.S. patients a year will be eligible for the drug. The KRAS mutation is also found in 1% to 3% of colorectal and other cancers.
Lumakras is part of a growing trend of precision medicines that target gene mutations driving cancer regardless of which organ the disease originated.
""Today's approval represents a significant step towards a future where more patients will have a personalized treatment approach,"" Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, said in a statement.
Amgen said the drug will have U.S. list price of $17,900 per month. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect 2022 sales of $240 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of Amgen were up $3, or 1.3%, at $238.35 in late trading on Nasdaq. 
The approval, which comes more than two months before the FDA's target decision date, is for a daily 960 milligram pill.
The agency is also requiring Amgen to conduct a post-approval study to see if a lower dose could be effective.
Cancer drugs are typically developed at the highest tolerable dose, but some oncologists have urged the FDA to do more to require drugmakers to optimize dosing https:// 
""Our sense is this is going to become more common in oncology,"" Amgen research chief David Reese told Reuters in a phone interview.
He said Amgen is studying Lumakras in combination with other drugs as an initial treatment for NSCLC patients who have the KRAS mutation, as well as for other types of cancer.

Amgen is also seeking regulatory approval of the drug in Europe, Japan and several other jurisdictions, he said.
Other companies, including Mirati Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MRTX) Inc, are also developing cancer drugs targeting KRAS mutations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's proposed budget would give an 11% funding increase to the Federal Trade Commission as well as a hefty boost to the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, both of which filed major lawsuits against big tech companies last year.
The agencies, which review mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law and other enforcement, have been at the center of a political storm, with progressives and some Republicans accusing them of being too lax.
Under the Biden budget, released Friday, the FTC, which has about 1,140 people and also investigates companies accused of deceiving consumers, would see its staff increase to about 1,250 in the 2022 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1.
The Biden budget for the next fiscal year envisions the agency spending $389.8 million. That's an increase from $351 million this year, or about 11%.
Under Biden's plan, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division would see its budget increase from $185 million to $201 million, an increase of 8.6%. 
The president's budget is generally seen as a statement of intent in terms of policies. 
In addition to being at the center of a policy debate, the agencies filed major antitrust lawsuits last year. The Justice Department sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google while the FTC sued Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

One big expense has been the cost of expert witnesses at big trials, such as coming fights with Google and Facebook.

LONDON (Reuters) -The world's biggest asset manager and top BP (NYSE:BP) investor BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said on Friday it had backed a shareholder resolution calling for faster climate action which the energy company's board opposed.
BlackRock's vote at BP's annual general meeting earlier this month points to growing pressure on both major oil companies and investors to accelerate efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions. BlackRock holds a 6.8% stake in BP, according to Refinitiv data. 
""While recognizing the company's efforts to date and direction of travel, supporting the resolution signals our desire to see the company accelerate its efforts on climate risk management,"" BlackRock said in a vote bulletin.
The asset manager said, however, that it voted in favour of Total's energy transition strategy at the company's AGM on Friday, which won over 90% of shareholder support.
It also supported management at Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in a non-binding vote on the company's energy transition strategy at its AGM this month. Refinitiv data showed BlackRock is also the biggest investor in the company.
Managing $9 trillion in assets, BlackRock's vote has been a key focus for campaigners and investors alike, as pressure builds on the world's biggest oil companies to put in place a plan aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.
BlackRock said it had backed the BP shareholder resolution put forward by activist group Follow This, which asked for the company to set deeper climate targets.
Although the Follow This resolution was rejected, the 20% support it won was seen as a signal that a growing number of investors want CEO Bernard Looney to accelerate his plan to cut BP's emissions from its oil and gas production to net zero by 2050, which will see it reduce oil output by 40% by 2030.
BlackRock said it supports BP's climate strategy but that it also supported the Follow This resolution ""because we see it as a means to reiterate our expectation that BP progressively refine its GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction targets.""
BP declined to comment on BlackRock's vote. 
Criticised by campaigners for too often siding with management, BlackRock has toughened its stance with some companies in recent months, and this week backed boardroom change at  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) over its climate inaction.
With Total's annual meeting bringing an end to the European oil majors' AGMs for this year, BlackRock released voting bulletins for all four, detailing how it voted and why.
Before the AGM season began, BlackRock had warned companies it wanted to see them set climate related targets and report against them, or they could vote against the board. They also flagged a willingness to support more shareholder resolutions.
In the case of Royal Dutch Shell, BlackRock said it supported a non-binding resolution filed by the company on its energy transition strategy and also voted against a shareholder resolution calling for Shell to set deeper short- and medium-term carbon reduction targets.
BlackRock said it backed the company because ""it meets our expectations that companies have clear policies and action plans to manage climate risk and provides a roadmap towards the company’s stated climate ambitions and targets."" 
""We prefer the annual 'say on climate' advisory vote offered by management as a mechanism for shareholders to give feedback on the company’s climate strategy,"" it said.

At Norway's Equinor, the asset manager backed two shareholder proposals, against the advice of management, one calling for the company to set short-, medium- and long-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and one to report on climate and nature risk.
With regard to the targets, BlackRock said it backed the resolution in the hope that it would further speed up the company's progress on climate risk management.

Let’s discuss.The untethered cryptocurrency market is slowing down following a spectacular rally over the past year. Bitcoin (BTC) has retreated more than 40% since hitting its $64,863.10 all-time high on April 14 due to multiple factors. A recent Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in the country following the launch of digital Yuan, and China’s goal of reducing its carbon footprint have been key factors driving down bitcoin prices in the past couple of weeks. This is because most of the bitcoin mining operations are concentrated in China.
The U.S. earlier this month also announced actions regarding the trading of bitcoins. The U.S. Treasury Department has released a new rule stating that any cryptocurrency transaction of more than $10,00 must be reported to the IRS. Rising environmental concerns surrounding cryptocurrency mining has also contributed to the decline by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Also, on May 12, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder and CEO Elon Musk suspended the purchase of vehicles using bitcoins due to environmental concerns regarding bitcoin mining, following which bitcoin saw more than $365 billion in market capitalization wiped away. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also raised concerns regarding the potential environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.
Because ESG investing is gaining prominence worldwide and regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies are increasing, we think the crypto market correction is likely to continue for some time. In light of this, we think overvalued cryptocurrency stocks Silvergate Capital Corporation (SI), Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT), and Bit Digital, Inc. (BTBT) are best avoided now.

1023,By StockNews,"<span>May 28, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",4 Tech Stocks Under $10 Rated Strong-Buy,"Even though investors have been rotating away from tech stocks with the economy’s gradual recovery, the industry is well positioned to resume its rally due to the rising demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G-enabled products and services. So, we think it could be wise to invest now in low-priced tech stocks United Microelectronics (UMC), AU Optronics (AUOTY), Seiko Epson (OTC:SEKEY), and Richardson Electronics (RELL) to capitalize on their solid financials and immense growth potential. Read on.Most tech stocks soared to new highs last year due to a COVID-19-led dependency on technology. However, the ongoing economic recovery and fears about rising inflation have been motivating investors to rotate away from expensive tech stocks into quality cyclical stocks. This is evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 5.5% gains over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 10.2% returns.
This has created an impressive opportunity to buy fundamentally sound tech stocks at reasonable prices. Continued digital transformation and increasing use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), 5G technology and other innovations could drive a rebound in the technology sector in the near to mid-term.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to bet now on United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), AU Optronics Corp. (AUOTY), Seiko Epson Corporation (SEKEY) and Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (RELL). They are all currently trading at less than $10 but hold considerable upside potential.

1024,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2021 02:18PM ET</span>",Biden Tax Plan Is Forecast to Bring in $3.6 Trillion Over Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s proposed tax hikes are forecast to bring in $3.6 trillion over the next decade, the Treasury Department said Friday, a key funding source for the $4 trillion he hopes to spend remaking the American economy and social safety net.
The figure, representing the sum of all tax increases if enacted by Congress, came as is part of the “Greenbook” report that accompanies the White House’s $6 trillion 2022 budget request, also released on Friday. It effectively serves as the revenue side of the ledger, against Biden’s spending priorities in the budget.
After accounting for the $1.2 trillion in tax credits for clean energy, electric cars, low-income families and housing investment, the plan would net Biden about $2.4 trillion to invest in other economic priorities. The White House has said that the $4 trillion combination of its American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan would be fully paid for over 15 years.
The Greenbook, which hasn’t been released since President Barack Obama’s final year in office, is the most comprehensive look at the tax and revenue proposals the administration endorses.
The document spans the gamut of Biden proposals, including a global minimum corporate tax, an increase in the levy on capital gains at death and closing the carried interest tax break for fund managers, all of which Biden has already outlined in his funding proposals for his longer-term spending plans.
The top income tax rate would increase to 39.6% from 37% starting in 2022, according to the proposal. Married couples earning $509,300, individuals earning $452,700 and heads of households earning $481,000 would be affected by the increases.
The Greenbook proposal assumes the capital gains increase would take effect on the date it was announced, a Treasury official said on a call with reporters. That proposal was announced in late April.
The reason for doing that is to prevent acceleration of gains during a temporarily low tax rate, another official said. But Treasury will work with Congress to determine the appropriate effective date, the person said.
Tax Credits
The Greenbook also includes key tax-credit proposals that Democratic lawmakers see as crucial to campaign on during the 2022 midterm elections. The administration is calling for an extension of an expanded child tax credit through 2025, as well as benefits for green energy and electric vehicles.
While Congress is unlikely to enact Biden’s tax ideas wholesale, the Greenbook has political significance by detailing the proposals that have the support of the White House.
Democrats will likely have to scale back some of the ideas to be able to pass them through their razor-thin majorities in Congress. Some Senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, have expressed concerns about Biden’s corporate tax rate and capital gains plans.

The document wills serve as a starting point for congressional Democrats to begin turning Biden’s agenda into legislation. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden have already begun sifting through Biden’s broad outlines and preparing to move legislation later this year.The discrepancies between the proposal’s projected cost and revenue raisers will present a challenge for Congressional Democrats as they look to enact Biden’s economic agenda, which he says he wants to fully pay for. Pressure from moderates to pare down the tax proposals and procedural rules in the Senate puts limits on how much the legislation could cost could both prove to be stumbling blocks as Democrats negotiate.
The president’s proposal also omits a key priority for some House Democrats, an expansion of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. More than 20 lawmakers from high tax states have said they would oppose Biden’s economic agenda unless it also included an expansion of that write-off, which is currently capped at $10,000.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>",Mexican president says Constellation will build new beer factory,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president said on Friday that U.S. brewer Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) will build a new brewery somewhere in the southeastern part of the country, following a deal he said his government has reached with the company.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador made the announcement during his regular morning news conference, but did not offer further details on the project.
Constellation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president's remarks.
Last year, a previous plan by Constellation to build a brewery in the northern city of Mexicali, near the border with the United States, was rejected in a local public referendum. 
On Friday, the president touted plentiful water supplies in Mexico's southeast, which was a major sticking point when the project was slated for the arid north.

Constellation brews several brands of Mexican beer, including Corona and Pacifico, exclusively for the U.S. market, which was one factor that made the original border location attractive logistically.
In April, local media reported that Constellation told its shareholders it was searching for a new site in Mexico but did not specify possible locations.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>","Microsoft says group behind SolarWinds hack now targeting government agencies, NGOs","By Kanishka Singh and Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The group behind the SolarWinds cyber attack identified late last year is now targeting government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said on Thursday.
""This week we observed cyberattacks by the threat actor Nobelium targeting government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations"", Microsoft said in a blog https:// 
Nobelium, originating from Russia, is the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in 2020, according to Microsoft.
The comments come weeks after a May 7 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline shut the United States' largest fuel pipeline network for several days, disrupting the country's supply. 
""This wave of attacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations"", Microsoft said on Thursday.
While organisations in the United States received the largest share of attacks, targeted victims came from at least 24 countries, Microsoft said.
At least a quarter of the targeted organisations were involved in international development, humanitarian issues and human rights work, Microsoft said in the blog.
Nobelium launched this week's attacks by breaking into an email marketing account used by the United States Agency For International Development (USAID) and from there launching phishing attacks on many other organisations, Microsoft said.
In statements issued Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and USAID both said they were aware of the hacking and were investigating.
The hack of information technology company SolarWinds, which was identified in December, gave access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the attack as ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen"".
This month, Russia's spy chief denied responsibility for the SolarWinds cyber attack but said he was ""flattered"" by the accusations from the United States and Britain that Russian foreign intelligence was behind such a sophisticated hack.
The United States and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the hack which compromised nine U.S. federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies.

The attacks disclosed by Microsoft on Thursday appeared to be a continuation of multiple efforts to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts, Microsoft said.
The company said it was in the process of notifying all of its targeted customers and had ""no reason to believe"" these attacks involved any exploitation or vulnerability in Microsoft's products or services.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Friday as investors continued to clamour for technology stocks as falling U.S. bond yields suggests they may be starting to buy the Federal Reserve’s bet that the turn-up in in inflation will prove transitory.
The S&P 500 rose 0.28%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.33%, or 113 points, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.37%.
The personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose 3.1% in the 12 months through April.
The sharp uptick in inflation was driven by a boost to demand from the services sector of the economy including air travel, recreation and accommodation as the reopening gathered pace. But this services-led push in inflation will likely fade.  
“As demand rotates from the supply-constrained goods sector to the labor intensive service sector, this should help ease inflationary pressures and accelerate employment growth,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Against the backdrop of increasing expectations that inflation could prove transitory, U.S. bond yields slipped, paving the way for growth corners of the market like tech to shine.
Tech was up nearly 1%, as investors digested mostly positive earnings from sector heavyweights including Salesforce.
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) jumped 6% after the enterprise software company reported Q1 results that topped expectations, and raised guidance amid ongoing demand for cloud services that is set to continue.
“The work from home shift clearly accelerated growth prospects, however the longer term trend around cloud is a massive market for cloud transitions and digital transformation initiatives for CRM as the company continues to be front and center on many of these projects in both the public and enterprise sectors,” Wedbush said in a note.
Chip stocks also played a role in the broader rally in tech, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally more than 5% following it’s better-than-expected quarterly results released earlier this week. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) an  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) were up close to 1%.
The day of green for tech stocks came at the expense of cyclicals, with financials, industrials and energy underperforming the broader market.
But cyclicals are up sharply since the start of the year as investor appetite has broadened out beyond tech. History suggest this broadening out in the market is good news for stocks.
""We're not going to see the market crashing if, in fact, investors are broadening out and buying more and more,” Melissa Brown, Managing Director of Applied Research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday.
“Market crashes tend to be characterized by a narrow market … a few big stocks going up, while the average stock doesn’t. But that doesn’t seem to be what we’re seeing now, so that is good news,” Brown added.
The short-squeeze on Reddit-linked stocks including AMC, Gamestop, SPCE continued. The Redditors are set to close out the week with a big win as traders betting against AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME), Virgin Galactic Inc (NYSE:SPCE) have lost a staggering $2.8 billion in losses since Monday. 
AMC, which has more doubled this week, has inflicted the most pain on short-sellers, who have lost about $1.5 billion, according to data from S3 Partners.

The figure as of Thursday includes 174 new reports since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided an update in April, Georgy Genov, the chief of the watchdog's safety monitoring operations, said during a briefing on Friday.
The EMA has been looking into cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) since March and has found a possible link to the vaccine developed with Oxford University, Vaxzevria, and to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-dose shot.
It has, however, maintained that overall benefits of both the vaccines outweigh any risks posed by them. 
Genov said a further 19 million people had received the first dose of Vaxzevria in the EEA since the April update, adding that the frequency of TTS has not changed - it is still extremely rare - but the fatality rate following symptoms has decreased. 

He said the drop in death rates possibly indicated that awareness among those vaccinated and those administering the vaccine and treating patients had gone up, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. 
The European Economic Area comprises the 27 countries in the European Union, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

1029,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2021 01:27PM ET</span>",Charting Global Economy: Confidence in European Recovery Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- Confidence in Europe’s economy is building as governments gradually lift pandemic-related restrictions, while fresh data on business investment and consumer spending point to solid growth prospects for the U.S.
At the same time, the firming of demand is generating faster inflation that includes higher commodity prices. An increase in risk appetite may also explain the recent pickup in input costs, according to Bloomberg Economics.
Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:
Europe
Confidence in the euro-area economy improved in May to the highest level in more than three years as restaurants, hotels and shops across the region start to reopen and faster vaccine roll-outs support the recovery.
Annika Saarikko became Finland’s new finance minister, bringing the number of women in that role in the European Union to six.
U.S.
Orders placed with U.S. factories for business equipment rose in April by the most in eight months, marking yet another robust month of capital investment fueled by a broader reopening of the economy.
Personal spending rose at a steady, yet moderate pace in April after a stimulus-fueled binge a month earlier. The reading is consistent with sustained growth in the biggest part of the economy and partly reflects faster inflation.
Asia
China’s strong economic momentum eased slightly in May, as surging raw material prices squeezed profits, businesses turned more cautious and property and car sales underperformed.
South Korea last year registered more deaths than births for the first time in recent history.
Emerging Markets
Surging prices of tortillas and other ingredients of Mexico’s widely consumed tacos are squeezing consumers and becoming a headache for policy makers.
Costa Rica became a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the 38th country in the Paris-based entity that was founded six decades ago.
World
Bloomberg Economics’ model shows movements in commodity prices this year have been mainly driven by risk appetite, not fundamental demand or shortages of supply.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. agencies on Friday said a planned $11.6 billion project to reconstruct and add a new tunnel between New York City and New Jersey reached two key milestones that will allow it to advance and receive federal funding.
The Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Transit Administration jointly issued the final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision for the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Tunnel Project, key steps for the project that is a crucial economic link in the U.S. Northeast.
""This is a big step for the Northeast, and for the entire country, as these tunnels connect so many people, jobs, and businesses,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.
Approximately 450 trains every weekday use the Hudson Tunnel and, before COVID-19, approximately 200,000 daily passenger trips took place. 
The Hudson Tunnel Project is one component of the Gateway Program, a major project to overhaul much of the aging rail infrastructure in the New York City area.
In April, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak asked Congress for $16 billion for Gateway, including $6.7 billion over five years for the Hudson Tunnel project. The project would result in four modern tubes connecting New Jersey to New York Penn Station in Manhattan.
Amtrak President Stephen Gardner said the project will improve reliability in the important Northeast Corridor, ""positively impacting the lives of thousands of daily commuters and intercity passengers."" 
The New York City-area rail tunnel, which opened in 1910, was damaged in 2012 when Superstorm Sandy flooded parts of the city.
The department noted no federal funding has been dedicated for the Hudson Tunnel project to date. Completion of these two steps is a prerequisite for either agency to direct future federal funding to advance this project through pre-construction activities such as engineering, final design development, property acquisition and construction. 
The Hudson Tunnel project includes building a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and rehabilitating the existing tunnel, known as the North River Tunnel, once the new tunnel is complete. 
When rehabilitation is complete, both tunnels would provide redundant capacity and increased operational flexibility for both Amtrak and NJ Transit.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure spending that includes $39 billion for modernizing the northeast rail corridor.
In total, Amtrak is seeking $31 billion from Congress over five years to overhaul the Northeast Corridor, the Boston to Washington, D.C., corridor that is the busiest passenger rail route in the country.

So, we think betting on these stocks will likely ensure a steady stream of income. Read on.Stronger-than-expected labor-market-data drove the stock market higher yesterday, but investors are skeptical about President Biden’s proposed global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, and inflation concerns are expected to contribute to their discomfort. Therefore, the market is far from being stable and continued volatility is surely in the offing. So, for investors looking to generate a steady stream of income from their investment portfolios, stocks that are a part of the prestigious dividend aristocrats group could be the best bets now.
While the dividend aristocrats may not deliver high dividend yields, these companies enjoy steady profits and have consistently increased their dividends for at least the past 25 years. Because several companies cut or suspended their dividends last year, the interest in the dividend aristocrats has been growing given their long-term consistency. Investors’ interest in these companies is evident in the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF’s (NOBL) 14.3% gains over the past three months compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 10.2% returns.

However, the solar space is now under some pressure due to supply chain issues amid record demand. As such, SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG), Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN), Sunnova Energy (NOVA) and ReneSola (SOL) have recently experienced a sell-off and their share prices are expected to continue declining. Hence, we think it is wise to avoid these stocks for now. Read on.Growing concerns about climate change are forcing global leaders to focus more on transitioning their countries to sustainable-energy-based economies. On the domestic front, the Biden administration has proposed to spend $2 trillion-plus on infrastructure development, including clean energy. Massachusetts lawmakers recently proposed a bill that would require rooftop solar panels on new residential and commercial buildings, and the federal government plans to add more than 500 million solar panels to America’s energy infrastructure over the next five years.
Hence, with the rising focus on clean energy, the industry is well-positioned for multi-decade growth. To put things in perspective, solar energy contributed nearly 4% of total renewable generation in 2016. This is expected to increase to 17% by 2030. However, the industry has been seeing a sell-off lately because companies are facing supply chain constraints and higher shipping costs amid record demand for solar panel installations. The mounting pessimism over the industry’s near-term prospects is evident in the Invesco Solar ETF’s (TAN) 21.7% loss over the past three months compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 10.2% gains.
Furthermore, investors expect the Fed to increase interest rates sooner than expected, thanks to rising inflationary pressures. This is a huge negative for the solar industry because solar projects require huge upfront costs, which are typically financed with debt. So, acknowledging these near-term headwinds, we believe shares of SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG),  Sunrun Inc . (RUN),  Sunnova Energy International Inc . (NYSE:NOVA) and ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) could remain under pressure for some time, and so it’s wise to avoid these stocks for now.

As long as demand for oil and gas continues to rise as life returns to normal, the industry's top players stand to benefit. Even if sales of electric vehicles skyrocket in the years ahead, it will take more than a decade for the majority of the world's drivers to hang up the gas pump for good in favor of rechargeable batteries.

Shares dropped almost 6%.
The retailer, which got price target increases from firms like RBC Capital and Citi, reported a profit per share of 48 cents versus an expected loss per share of 6 cents on sales of $3.99 billion, also better than the estimated $3.41 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Gap also forecast fiscal 2021 earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.75, versus the consensus of $1.38, StreetInsider reported. 
“Gap Inc. delivered sales growth of 8% over 2019 pre-COVID levels, with particular strength at Old Navy and Athleta, a healthy and growing Gap business in North America, and market share gains that outpaced the industry,” said Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal. “As stores traffic came back, we sustained our digital dominance with 82% online growth versus 2019. And while Active and Fleece continue to soar, we saw a resurgence in summer fashion with dresses rebounding.”

Investing – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell nearly 2% Friday on a WSJ report that said the jet maker had halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner planes as regulators have asked for more information on its proposed solutions to previously identified quality issues.
The U.S. plane maker's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical and other issues since late last year, and it only resumed deliveries of the 787s in March after a five-month hiatus.
""Boeing still needs to show that its proposed inspection method would meet FAA’s federal safety regulations. The FAA is waiting for additional data from Boeing before determining whether the company’s solution meets safety regulations,"" the FAA said in a statement, according to Reuters.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was slated to receive a Dreamliner this week, but that delivery isn’t expected until at least next week now, the WSJ report said.
The latest setback is likely to delay Boeing CEO David Calhoun’s plan to deliver 10 to 12 Dreamliners every month.

(Reuters) -National Bank of Canada beat analysts' second-quarter profit estimates on Friday, driven by higher earnings in its personal and commercial business and a large drop in funds set aside to cover potential loan losses.
National Bank became the fifth Canadian bank to beat expectations for earnings in the quarter through April, with all the lenders releasing provisions on performing loans on improving economic expectations, and healthy capital markets and wealth management units.
The smallest of Canada's six big banks took provisions on credit losses of C$5 million ($4.1 million), versus analysts' estimates of C$81 million. This included the release of C$62 million previously set aside for performing loans that could have soured.
Shares in National Bank fell 2.9% to C$94.19, after earlier touching a record high, while the Toronto benchmark rose 0.4%.
National Bank saw increases of 7% in personal loans and 5% in commercial lending, and profits rose at its wealth management and U.S. specialty finance and international businesses.
But earnings excluding the impact of provisions and taxes in its financial markets unit fell 10% from the year-ago period.
National Bank's net income excluding one-off items rose to C$2.25 a share in the three months through April, compared with C$1.01 a share a year earlier. Analysts had expected C$2 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Separately, smaller lender  Canadian Western Bank  (TSX:CWB) posted adjusted earnings per share of 84 Canadian cents a share, versus expectations of 75 cents on higher net interest margins and loan growth, while making fewer provisions than expected.

Earlier the pro-government daily Magyar Nemzet reported that the Orban government, which has expanded state ownership in several key sectors, was eyeing a majority stake in the airport, citing unspecified industry sources.
The airport's majority owner is now Canadian pension investment management group PSP with just over 55%. Singapore's GIC Special Investments and Canada's Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec each hold about 20%.
The Hungarian state currently has no stake in the airport, which was privatised in 2005.
""It has since become quite evident that the sale was against Hungary's strategic interests and (the sale) also made investments to enhance the quality of service for passengers exceedingly difficult,"" the government said in its statement.
Budapest Airport is a fast-growing, medium-sized airport that has benefited from a boom in low-cost travel, but is facing a difficult market due to the coronavirus pandemic that has sharply reduced the number of travellers.
The government said it has assigned the task of acquiring a majority stake for the Hungarian state to Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics. He will be in charge of the process as government commissioner from June 1.
Budapest Airport's press office did not immediately respond to emailed questions for comment.
Orban, a nationalist often at loggerheads with the European Commission on a range of issues, has previously said he wants to see the airport in domestic hands, but until now its owners have expressed no interest in selling it.
Hungarian media last year reported that local real estate management group Indotek was part of a consortium in talks to buy Budapest Airport, citing Indotek owner and CEO Daniel Jellinek.

Indotek was heading a consortium of Hungarian and U.S. companies, Jellinek said at that time, adding that none of the members have political connections.
Indotek did not immediately reply on Friday to emailed Reuters requests for comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The international response to the grounding of a Ryanair jet in Belarus and arrest of a dissident on the flight has delivered a heavy blow to state-run airline Belavia and its expansion plans. 
Only last month Belavia took delivery of a new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX as part of its strategy to offer more transit flights via Belarusian capital Minsk.
Since the forced landing of Sunday's flight in Minsk, most of Belarus's neighbours and many other European nations have banned its flights. The EU has proposed closing its airspace to Belavia and stopping it from landing at EU airports.
A Belavia plane bound for Barcelona on Thursday was unable to fly out of Belarus because France had banned Belarusian flights over its territory.
Belavia is the only airline in the ex-Soviet economy of 9.5 million people. It was emerging bruised but ambitious from a COVID-19 pandemic that cut its passenger traffic last year to 1.7 million people, down more than 58% from 2019. 
This month it reported a 2020 net loss of 92 million roubles ($36 million), against a profit of 68.3 million roubles in 2019, but said it was securing new demand from people travelling to and from Europe via Minsk. It listed routes from Vilnius to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and London. 
All those routes are now closed.
Belavia says it has been banned from flying to Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, France, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The list could grow. 
On Friday Ukraine announced it would ban Belarusian aviation from its airspace. 
The Belarusian capital has become a popular transit stop for Ukrainians and Russians travelling between their nations since direct flights were banned after their relations plunged into acrimony in 2014. 
SIGNIFICANT DEBT
Belavia accrued significant debts as it built up its fleet of 30 planes, half of which are leased.
At the end of last year Belavia reported total debt of about $400 million, including leasing obligations of more than $220 million. Part of those obligations are with Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corporation (ALC), having signed a contract in July 2018 for five Boeing 737 MAX jets. 
ALC was not immediately available for comment. 
""The company is facing very difficult times,"" Oleg Panteleev, head of Russian aviation analysis agency Aviaport, said of Belavia. 
Belavia, which was founded in 1996 two years after authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko came to power, employed 2,100 people at the end of 2020. 
The carrier will almost certainly have to make large-scale cost cuts, including its staff and fleet, Panteleev said. 
""On the other hand, Belarus will not abandon its national carrier,"" he said, suggesting the government could step in with support. 
Belavia on Wednesday said that there were no plans for mass layoffs, but it acknowledged that cost cuts and an ""optimising"" of staffing levels are unpleasant but necessary steps. 
The head of Belavia has exchanged emails about the Minsk incident with international airline body IATA, of which Belavia is a member.

""Nobody has suggested they (Belavia) were in any way involved in this,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh told Reuters.
""I've made clear that we condemn what the government of Belarus has done. For the hard-working people at the airline, I think you do have to have some sympathy because they didn't do anything, but they are suffering as a result.""

Supportive government policies and regulations worldwide should also contribute to the industry’s growth. As a result, Wall Street expects the shares of EV makers Fisker (FSR) and Electrameccanica (SOLO) to gain more than 80% over the next 12 months. Read on for details.After experiencing a slump on concerns over overvaluation and a semiconductor chip shortage, electric vehicle (EV) stocks are gradually regaining investors’ attention in-part because President Biden’s $174 billion spending pitch for EVs--as part of his $2.3 trillion infrastructure spending proposal--is expected to boost the industry’s growth.
Furthermore, the demand for EVs is expected to continue increasing in the United States because Biden's proposed legislation would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs that are assembled in the United States. These factors, together with increasing investments to address the semiconductor chip shortage, should boost the industry’s growth in the United States. As a matter of fact, the global EV market is expected to grow at a 33.6% CAGR between 2020 - 2027, to hit an aggregate $2.5 trillion, according to Meticulous Research.

PARIS (Reuters) -Oil and gas group Total won more than 90% backing for its climate plan to gradually reduce its emissions on Friday, when shareholders also voted overwhelmingly in favour of its rebrand as TotalEnergies to mark its shift to renewable energy.
Some shareholders had campaigned to reject Total's green goals as not ambitious enough, echoing growing investor rebellions in the sector. 
Demands for oil companies to speed up the shift from fossil fuel reached a crescendo this week as a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to greatly increase greenhouse emission cuts and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) battled with an activist investor over its record on climate change. 
Total's climate strategy, which lays out its aim to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, was backed by 91.88% of shareholders voting at its annual meeting. 
""This outcome is, I think, the best response to commentators who predicted, and in some cases even hoped for an investor rebellion against the company, and responds to those who act more as activists than shareholders,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said. 
The rebranding, which takes effect immediately, was backed by 99.88% of votes. 
Total is investing in a pivot towards renewable energy with solar or wind power projects. 
It is seeking to derive revenues from electricity production, and reduce its reliance on oil products, including with staggered targets to 2030, and mirroring moves by rivals to try to cut emissions.
'GREEN ENERGY MAJOR'
Pouyanne said he wanted the company to become a ""green energy major"", but said a more radical shift would not be appropriate as the company needs to fund its transition from revenues derived from fossil fuels. 
The International Energy Agency has said new fossil fuel projects must stop this year if the world wants to reach net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century, a faster pace than envisaged so far by oil producers, including Total.
""Without new oil projects, global oil production is set to naturally drop by about 4% to 5% every year,"" Pouyanne told the shareholder meeting, while oil demand was projected to only start tailing off from 2030. ""Without new oil projects, it's highly likely that oil prices would reach new highs,"" he said.
Non-governmental organisations and some investors spoke out against what they saw as an overly conservative approach.
Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at the governance advisory arm of asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), which holds shares in Total, said he had not supported the transition plan.

""The challenge is there's just not sufficient evidence it's aligned with the Paris goals,"" he said, referring to the U.N. accord on curbing climate change.
Lucie Pinson, founder and executive director at Reclaim Finance, a non-governmental organisation, accused Total of greenwash and said its shareholders had ""voted willingly for climate chaos"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had temporarily halted deliveries of 787 Dreamliners as the agency waits for more data to determine if the planemaker's planned inspection method meets federal requirements.
""Boeing still needs to show that its proposed inspection method would meet FAA’s federal safety regulations. The FAA is waiting for additional data from Boeing before determining whether the company’s solution meets safety regulations,"" the FAA said in a statement.
""Since the FAA has not approved Boeing’s proposal, Boeing chose to temporarily stop deliveries to its customers.""
 Boeing Co  said earlier it was providing the FAA with more information on its undelivered 787 Dreamliners but that there was no impact on planes already in service. The FAA noted it had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes.
The U.S. planemaker's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical and other issues since late last year, and it only resumed deliveries of the 787s in March after a five-month hiatus. 
""We are working to provide the FAA with additional information concerning the analysis and documentation associated with the verification work on undelivered 787s,"" a Boeing spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
""We continue to work closely with the FAA in a transparent and timely manner. There is no impact on the in-service fleet.""
Boeing shares were down 1.9% in early trading to $247.63. 
Two key U.S. lawmakers said last week they were seeking records from Boeing and the FAA on production issues involving the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.
The FAA said in September it was investigating manufacturing flaws involving some 787 Dreamliners. Boeing said in August airlines operating its 787 Dreamliners removed eight jets from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues.

In March, the FAA said it was taking ""a number of corrective actions"" to address multiple 787 production issues, including retaining authority to issue approval certificates for four specific aircraft.
On Thursday, Boeing agreed to pay $17 million in penalties under an FAA settlement after it installed equipment on 759 Boeing 737 MAX and NG aircraft that contained sensors that were not approved. That fine also covers Boeing's submission of 178 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for airworthiness certification when the aircraft potentially had non-conforming slat tracks installed, and improperly marked those slat tracks.

The Wall Street bank joins several other foreign banks that are looking to take full ownership of their Chinese businesses after Beijing scrapped foreign ownership limits in the securities and mutual fund industry on April 1 last year.
Outright ownership could allow foreign banks to expand their operations in the multitrillion-dollar Chinese financial sector, and better integrate them with their global businesses.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s partner Shanghai Chinafortune Co said on Friday it is selling a 39% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities and its entire 36% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management Co to the Wall Street bank through the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange.
The deal, which still requires regulatory approval, means Morgan Stanley will own 90% of the securities joint venture – which houses the bank's mainland investment banking and trading businesses – while Chinafortune will maintain a 10% stake.
The Wall Street bank will now own 85% of the funds business.
""These are important steps forward for Morgan Stanley as we look to build a leading, fully integrated financial services firm in China,"" Morgan Stanley said in a statement.
""China continues to be an important strategic priority for Morgan Stanley and we are encouraged by the accelerated pace of opening up of China’s financial markets.""

Furthermore, the company is expected to gain roughly $2.4 billion from Winter Storm Uri, which knocked out power and halted the distribution of natural gas in Texas, and is thus expected to be one of the biggest winners from the storm among a group of natural gas suppliers and pipeline companies.
With increasing demand for its products and services, ET’s value is expected to continue heading north in the coming months.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) shares rose another 28% Friday on top of a 35% gain a day earlier as Reddit traders can’t have enough of it.
According to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Thursday, the stock has replaced GameStop (NYSE:GME) as the most popular stock on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum. The two are part of the meme stocks gang that have developed a cult following.
GameStop shares were up over 1%.
Shares like AMC and GameStop have attracted heavy short-selling bets because of their struggles during the pandemic. But with small and enthusiastic traders coming together on platforms like Reddit and driving a trading frenzy, short sellers have had to rush to cover their positions, with panic buying only sending the shares higher.
This act has been playing with varied frequency over the last five months or so as retail traders band together to fight Wall Street giants.
The fundamentals of these companies don’t necessarily justify the valuations, but none cares when there’s unprecedented liquidity sloshing around.
AMC had to shut theaters last year and only recently has been able to reopen in its most important markets of New York City and Lost Angeles. The multiplex operator raised $428 million in equity at an average price of $9.94 per share in May. The shares are up more than two-and-a-half times since.
AMC has around $5 billion in debt and $450 million in deferred lease repayments.

(Reuters) - Investment into U.S. exchange traded funds (ETFs) has risen to record levels this year, driven by a rally in equities and investor preference for passive index-tracking funds over actively managed peers.
According to Refinitiv data, U.S. ETFs attracted a record inflow of $324 billion in the first four months of this year, which was 180% higher than the same period of last year. At the same time, U.S. mutual funds received an inflow of $318 billion, which was a 58% drop.

This surge in inflows is evidence of growing investor interest in ETFs, due to their lower fees and tax liabilities, and better returns compared with active funds in recent years.
Analysts said proposals by the Joe Biden administration to increase the U.S. capital gains tax had also fuelled interest in ETFs.
""Over the last six months, flows have continued to be robust as the elevated savings pile of the private sector found its way into financial assets, benefitting ETFs,"" said Komson Silapachai, vice president at investment management firm, Sage Advisory Services, based in Austin.
""The expected increase in capital gains tax later this year should result in a higher preference for ETFs versus mutual funds for the highest tax brackets.""
As most ETFs are passively managed, there is less amount of buying and selling taking place, which leads to lower capital gains and taxes.
Also, ETF redemptions take place through a mechanism called ""in-kind transfer"" in which ETFs have to deliver baskets of securities to authorized brokers instead of paying cash, which precludes them from being taxed.
According to Refinitiv data, U.S equity ETFs saw a cumulative inflow of $149.6 billion in the first four months of this year, while debt ETFs obtained $283.6 billion.

The Vanguard 500 index fund led this year's inflows seeing net purchases of $20.7 billion, while iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund procured $11.8 billion and $9.6 billion respectively.

Analysts said the higher inflows were also due to the availability of a variety of ETFs which are focused on certain themes or sectors.
The surge in ETFs was prompted by an SEC rule in 2019 that eliminated some exemptive relief requirements that has made ETF launches expensive and time-consuming. 
""The relaxation of the exemption rule requirements has allowed ETFs to be structured to cover narrower segments of the market such as marijuna stocks, 'high conviction' stocks, crypto-focused, etc.,"" said Warren Ward, founder of financial planning firm, Warren Ward Associates in Houston.
""I suspect this is the main driver of the higher inflows, he said.
""Why choose a single stock if you can utilize a small basket of them instead?""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Shares of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) fell by more than 6% in Friday’s premarket as the company’s warning that the semiconductor chip shortage would limit its ability to supply personal computing devices and printers at least until the end of the year overshadowed its robust quarterly earnings.
Notwithstanding shortage of raw materials that go into devices, the maker of desktops, laptops, printers and other IT peripherals retains a bullish outlook about the overall demand.
But the company’s caution only added to what many have been fearing and that is that sales of its PCs might have peaked. The contention is that increasing vaccinations will bring more people back into their offices, diluting the need for personal computers as they no longer work from home.
According to TheStreet, analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) pointed to HP not getting “… the full sales upside to flow through the EPS,” which “will likely raise a new question for investors: “Is this the peak?”
Still, Citigroup has a buy rating on the stock and a year’s target of $40, TheStreet said. This is approximately 25% higher from its last close of $32.10.
HP reported second quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.93 on revenue of $15.9 billion which rose 27.3% from a year-ago period.
For the third quarter, HP estimates non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85.
For fiscal 2021, non-GAAP diluted net EPS is seen between $3.40 and $3.50.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 08:02AM ET</span>","After Colonial attack, energy companies rush to secure cyber insurance","By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) -U.S. energy companies are scrambling to buy more cyber insurance after this month's attack on Colonial Pipeline disrupted the U.S. fuel supply, but they can expect to pay more as cyber insurers plan to hike rates following a slew of ransomware attacks.
The Colonial ransomware attack on May 7 shut the largest fuel pipeline network in the United States for several days, crippling fuel delivery to most of the U.S. East Coast. Pipeline companies rely on electronic networks, putting them at risk of additional attacks that could hamper delivery of crude oil or other fuels.
Insurers are preparing to increase cyber insurance premiums by 25% to 40% across many industries because of the number of claims, insurance companies and brokers have said. But energy companies should expect rate increases at the higher end of the spectrum as the Colonial attack exposed their vulnerabilities and exposed insurers to losses.
Only about half of the nation's pipeline companies currently buy cyber insurance even though ransomware attacks have become more frequent, according to Nick Economidis, vice president of cyber liability at insurer Crum & Forster.
""Since the Colonial outage, submissions from energy companies are up across the board,"" said Economidis, adding that he started getting calls the day after the Colonial attack.
Anthony Dagostino, cyber insurance broker at Lockton Companies, said his Houston office has been fielding a large number of calls from energy companies in recent weeks.
""Before the attack, the energy sector had some of the lowest interest in purchasing cyber insurance of all industries, but in the past two weeks, now they're very interested,"" Dagostino said.
Regulators are working with pipeline companies to strengthen protection against attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said this week. The energy industry's ""cyber risk management and mitigation practices are not as advanced"" as other major sectors like banking or real estate, raising the risk of successful attacks, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said in a May 10 report.
Cyber attacks can be particularly damaging for the pipeline sector compared with other companies in the energy sector because fuel supply cannot be easily rerouted, Moody's said, and pipeline operators have increased their use of digital technologies to manage delivery. 
To date, many companies have not bought cyber insurance because of high premiums and difficulties in quantifying the costs from incidents, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-477.pdf, a federal watchdog, on Monday. 
""A lot of operators have not done the business impact assessments that banks and big retailers do to determine overall costs of being down for a certain period of time,"" said Dagostino. 
Colonial had cyber insurance coverage of only about $15 million, according to one media report. Last year, the company had net income of $420 million on $1.3 billion of revenue, according to regulatory filings.
Cyber insurance typically covers ransom payments and insurers often provide staff to negotiate with the hackers, in addition to IT and public relations services.
The average ransom paid is $1.9 million, but in recent months cyber criminals have extracted ransoms as large as $40 million from a single company, according to a Bloomberg News report.
Companies that have cyber insurance often retain the initial loss that can range from $500,000 to $10 million, depending on the policy. Then the insurance kicks in to cover the ransom, which in Colonial's case was $4.4 million, its chief executive told the Wall Street Journal. 
Insurance also covers business interruption costs, and costs from supply-chain partners after a waiting period of eight to 24 hours.

Colonial, which carries about 2.5 million barrels of fuel a day, could have lost $9 million to $15 million in revenue from the six-day outage, depending on the waiting period, according to calculations by Reuters. Colonial has not commented on its losses.
Companies started to buy cyber insurance in recent years after state laws began requiring them to notify consumers of data breaches. Pipeline companies, however, have little consumer data, which may have prevented them from purchasing protection, Economidis said.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 07:52AM ET</span>",Funds recommended cutting equity exposure in May to lowest level this year,"By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Funds recommended the lowest equity exposure this year in May, citing risks from the expected pull-and-push between reflation trades and dovish central banks, but most respondents in Reuters polls said a near-term correction in stock markets was unlikely.
While global shares have see-sawed in May, with technology-related stocks taking a hit, the MSCI world equity index breached an all-time high and European bourses were near record highs, helped by policymakers allaying inflation concerns.
Still, Reuters polls of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan, taken May 10-27, showed the lowest recommended equity allocations since December - averaging 48.7% of the model global portfolio, down from over a three year high of 49.8% last month.
""We have entered an uncertain and riskier environment – volatility is rising and equity-bond correlation is turning positive. It is important to stay cautious and lock in some gains in risk assets,"" said Pascal Blanqué, group chief investment officer at Amundi, in Paris.
""Equities will do ok in absolute terms as long as inflation is not breaking the anchored territory. In stocks, investors should seek some protection against the bursting of the tech bubble. This means being cautious in interest rate sensitive shares, while preferring dividend yielding ones.""
When asked about the likelihood of a correction in global stocks over the next three months, 57% of fund managers, or 12 of 21, said it was unlikely. While the remaining nine said it was likely.
""We still believe that the return potential for equities is skewed to the upside on a one-year year time horizon,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""However, as the investment cycle matures, valuations rise and sentiment improves, prospective returns should steadily diminish.""
In response to another question, 70% of 20 asset managers said a hunt for yield trades would sway financial markets over the next three months rather than safe-haven bets.
INFLATION
""Many of the factors supporting risky assets are and will remain in place over the (European) summer. The reopening of economies will continue to support the recovery in earnings,"" noted the investment team at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners.
""On the other hand, we are aware of the increasing concerns over inflation and the possible implications on monetary policy. That said, we rather see these factors causing some volatility and possibly an acceleration of the rotation theme within equities towards value-exposed markets/sectors.""
Echoing those views, findings of a separate Reuters poll of about 300 equity strategists showed world stocks were predicted to rise modestly this year, with a near-term correction unlikely.[EPOLL/WRAP]
In the latest polls, all 21 wealth managers in response to another question said corporate earnings would rise for the rest of the year, including over 65% of them expecting a significant rise. None predicted company earnings to decline.
""We will see a significant rise in corporate earnings. However, that is unlikely to be across all sectors but more likely from those that were hurt the most due to the lockdown,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum. 
""Given we are likely to see a pick up in consumer spending over the next few months there could be some significant upgrade in earnings for some of those consumer-led sectors.""
Treasury yields were up on Thursday, bolstered by expectations for more debt issuance following a report which showed U.S. President Joe Biden was likely to announce a $6 trillion budget, the largest spending since the second world war.
Fund managers suggested an increase to fixed-income allocations to the highest this year, accounting for 40.3% of the balanced global portfolio, from 39.5% in the previous month, which was the lowest since February 2019. 
While comments from multiple Federal Reserve officials have tried to calm inflation worries recently, policymakers have also signalled a possible start to talks to end the central bank's bond buying program.

""Inflation is taking the driver's seat of markets. It is difficult to see inflation just picking up for a few months and then returning to about 2% quickly. This is the start of a journey towards a period of higher inflation and lower growth compared to the current consensus,"" added Amundi's Blanqué. 
""The consensus points to a Goldilocks scenario, buying into the view that this is a temporary inflation pick up, we think this is a risk. In the end, something structural is just something temporary that has lasted. Fears of inflation can become inflation.""

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC said on Friday the United States remains key to its growth plans, a day after announcing the sale of its mass market retail U.S. banking business in a country where it has long struggled to make a strong profit.
HSBC's business in the United States will focus on internationally-oriented corporate customers, chief executive Noel Quinn told the lender's annual shareholder meeting in London.
""The U.S. is key to our international network and an important contributor to our growth plans,"" Quinn said. 
HSBC announced on Thursday its long-awaited U.S. retail exit as it shifts its business more towards Asia, where it has had greater success making money.
The lender is also seeking to sell its French retail banking operations as part of the same strategy, and has entered final negotiations to sell that business to private equity firm Cerberus, Reuters reported in March.
A small group of protesters outside the meeting criticised HSBC for not forgiving poor countries' debt to allow them to better cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, something charities have called on the private sector to do.
G20 governments have frozen many low-income countries' loan repayments under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) during the pandemic.
Nearly 550 private sector bonds issued by 62 low- and middle-income countries total some $691 billion in principal and will cost around $330 billion in debt servicing over the next five years, a report said this week.
HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said the lender has not received any specific requests from a country to cancel its debts.
The bank also faced questions from shareholders at the meeting on Friday over the pace at which it is halting funding to coal power projects.
HSBC in March said it would phase out support for the coal industry in the developed world by 2030, bowing to investor pressure to speed up its exit from fossil fuel funding. 

Investors managing some $2.4 trillion in assets who earlier this year filed a resolution that would bind the bank to make stronger commitments, withdrew it in a sign they had reached a compromise with Europe's biggest bank.
HSBC's Tucker said the lender believes it is better to help clients transition away from fossil fuels, rather than simply stop working with them.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) shares were higher by more than 5% in Friday’s premarket as a record first quarter pushed the company to raise its revenue guidance for the 2022 fiscal year to $25.9 billion to $26 billion.
Online software providers like Salesforce are reaping the reward of more companies continuing with the work from home option or going for a hybrid model even as economies open up amid increasing vaccination rates.
The company expects full-year adjusted profit (non-GAAP) between $3.79 and $3.81 per share.
Salesforce Chair & CEO Marc Benioff attributed the revised guidance to “incredible momentum throughout our core business.”
The company benefited from increased demand for its core CRM solutions and Customer 360 platform, riding out of the pandemic while grabbing new opportunities.
It had earlier forecast a revenue of $25.65 billion to $25.75 billion for the year.
Salesforce President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver reiterated the company is keeping “pace toward our goal of $50 billion in revenue in FY26.”
The company also initiated second quarter revenue guidance of $6.22 billion-$6.23 billion, up approximately 21% year-over-year.
Total first quarter revenue was $5.96 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, Salesforce earned $1.21 per share, beating estimates of 88 cents per share.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Dutch court's decision to force Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to make deeper, faster cuts to its climate warming emissions on the basis of human rights could set a precedent, especially in European countries, according to lawyers and activists.
The court on Wednesday ordered the Anglo-Dutch company to slash its global greenhouse gas emissions, which stood at around 1.6 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019, by 45% by 2030. Shell said it would appeal the decision forcing it to cut by an amount roughly equivalent to four times Britain's annual emissions. 
(Graphic: Shell's greenhouse gas emissions, https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-EMISSIONS/yzdvxeoznpx/chart.png)
""We expect a ripple effect into other jurisdictions. Now that we have this first established liability, it definitely creates a momentum we can build on,"" said Roger Cox, lawyer for activist group Friends of the Earth, which brought the case along with Greenpeace, other activists and Dutch citizens. 
They brought the lawsuit in the Netherlands, where Shell's headquarters are based.
The court held that Shell violated its duty of care under Dutch law because its policies and emissions contributed to dangerous climate change.
Shell had argued that its global emissions were not subject to Dutch law, that the plaintiffs' claims were a matter for lawmakers and that the company was acting lawfully and its emissions were permitted. The company also said the plaintiffs could not establish that reducing Shell's emissions would have an impact on climate change. 
Michael Burger, a litigation specialist who represents local U.S. governments in climate cases including against Shell, said while Wednesday's decision was based on Dutch law, the concept of a duty to care exists in legal systems in Europe and around the globe.
""I think it's quite likely that we'll see other lawsuits filed in other jurisdictions, seeking to accomplish the same thing,"" he said, noting a similar case is pending against Total in France.
Myfanwy Wood, dispute resolution partner at law firm Ashurst, said duplicating the approach will depend on the standard of care that applies to corporations in other jurisdictions.
Dutch climate rulings have inspired global climate litigation before.
In 2019, the country's High Court ruled that the government had to commit to stronger climate targets in a case brought by the Urgenda Foundation. That decision, which paved the way for the Shell case, established that the government had a duty of care to significantly reduce emissions.
The case ""sparked a wave of similar lawsuits around the world against governments, and we can expect that with the decision yesterday,"" said Louise Fournier, a climate lawyer for Greenpeace.
There are about 425 pending climate lawsuits in various countries and about 1,375 lawsuits in U.S. courts, according to the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.
The U.S. cases target the industry, while most cases in other jurisdictions take aim at governments. 
Experts said the Dutch ruling will have no legal impact on the U.S. cases, which are generally based on different laws and accuse the industry of misleading the public about climate change and seek financial damages.
However, the Dutch ruling could still influence the U.S. cases, said Karen Sokol, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. She said the Dutch decision reassures U.S. judges that climate change involves more than policymaking.
“The industry has done everything it can to scare courts into 'you have no role,'” said Sokol. “It is going to get demystified and courts will get comfortable with it.” 
European legislators are working on a raft of new rules on what type of investments should be labeled sustainable and how to reduce planet-warming leaks from natural gas infrastructure.

""This ruling (...) increases the pressure on large polluters and helps us in Europe to tighten climate policy for them as well,"" said the Greens' European legislator Bas Eickhout, Vice Chair of the European Parliament's Environment Committee.
""They can no longer escape the climate crisis: International climate targets must also apply to them.""

1066,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>","U.S. lawmakers probe Kabbage, BlueVine and partner banks over pandemic loans -letters","By Koh Gui Qing
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have opened an investigation into financial technology companies Kabbage Inc and BlueVine and their partner banks for their roles in distributing billions of dollars in pandemic aid to small businesses, according to letters seen by Reuters.
The investigation, due to be announced on Friday, highlights how an unprecedented $780 billion loan program launched by the U.S. government to help companies weather the COVID-19 economic shutdown has led to legal and regulatory woes for lenders.
The loan scheme, known as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has drawn criticism from regulators and the media for failing to implement adequate checks, resulting in widespread fraud.
Representatives for Kabbage Inc, which also goes by the brand K Servicing, and BlueVine did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday evening. 
Under the PPP, lenders dispensed loans to small businesses hurt by the pandemic. If the borrower spent it on payroll and other business expenses, the government repaid the lender on the borrower's behalf. Some fintechs and banks teamed up, with the fintech processing the loan applications and the bank handling the loan.
The U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis has asked Kabbage, BlueVine and their partners Cross River Bank and Celtic Bank, respectively, to provide documents and information to detail the fraud controls and compliance systems they implemented for the PPP, as well as the revenues they earned in facilitating the program, the letters showed.
The Congressional requests for information do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing or mean the companies will incur penalties.
Representatives for  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), which last year bought most of Kabbage's assets other than its loan portfolio, Cross River Bank and Celtic Bank did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday evening. The letters, dated May 27, were addressed to the companies' chief executives and requested a response by June 11.
""I am deeply troubled by recent reports alleging that financial technology lenders and their bank partners failed to adequately screen PPP loan applications for fraud,"" said the letters, which were signed by Democratic U.S. representative James Clyburn, chairman of the subcommittee. 

The U.S. Department of Justice's civil division is also investigating fintechs including Kabbage over whether they miscalculated how much PPP aid borrowers were entitled to due to confusion over how to account for payroll taxes, Reuters reported earlier this month. Sources with knowledge of the matter said at the time that fintechs have attracted regulatory scrutiny in part because of a high incidence of fraud associated with their loans. Government data shows fintechs issued around $26.5 billion in PPP loans.
According to the letters, Kabbage issued $7 billion worth of PPP loans between April and August of last year, making it the second-largest PPP lender by application volume. BlueVine is estimated to have issued over $4.5 billion in PPP loans, ranking it among the top 10 PPP lenders by application volume. Lenders have said they were under enormous pressure to make millions of loans quickly, while keeping up with ever-changing PPP rules.

According to Refinitiv data, money market funds received an inflow of $53.2 billion, the highest in four weeks.
The higher inflows came as investors were watchful ahead of the report on core personal consumption expenditures to be released on Friday. 
Forecasters expect that prices for personal consumption goods excluding food and energy rose at a 2.9% annual rate in April, which would be the highest reading since June 1993, and beyond the Fed's 2% inflation target.
Various Fed officials have said they expect a pop in inflation to be temporary, and signalled policy will remain ultra-loose for some time, but markets are on edge.

However, that didn't deter the inflows into equity markets. 
According to the data, global equity funds attracted inflows of $8.84 billion, a 46% increase over the previous week, as stocks rallied somewhat, after U.S. Federal Reserve officials reaffirmed a dovish monetary policy stance. 
U.S. equity funds received $2.87 billion, while European equity funds and Asian equity funds obtained $2.47 billion and $1 billion, respectively.
Data showing Eurozone's business growth accelerating at its fastest pace in over three years in May also boosted sentiment.
Among equity sector funds, tech funds attracted inflows worth $546 million after three straight weeks of outflows, while financial sector funds faced their first outflow in 16 weeks, hit by a decline in bond yields.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, amid growing optimism over the economic recovery with President Biden set to unveil a fiscally-expansive budget.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 180 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 60 points, or 0.4%.
Wall Street has pushed higher this week, with the broad-based S&P 500 up 1.1% week to date, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8% higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining nearly 2%.
Confidence is growing about the health of the world’s largest economy, with first-time jobless claims falling to a new pandemic low. Also helping were reports that President Joe Biden is set later Friday to unveil a budget that would increase federal spending to $6 trillion in the coming fiscal year.
The economic data slate is full Friday, with personal Income and consumer spending set to be released along with the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, the core PCE price Index. The PCE is seen increasing 2.9% in April year-over-year, considerably above the central bank’s nominal 2% target.
In the corporate sector, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will be in focus Friday, with its stock up 5% premarket, after the software company raised its full-year forecasts, following increased demand for its cloud-based software due to a pandemic-led shift to remote work.
HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock fell over 5% premarket after the computer giant warned the ongoing computer chip shortage could impact its ability to meet demand for laptops this year, even as it reported better-than-expected second-quarter results.
Crude oil prices edged higher Friday, on course for another monthly gain in May, the fourth of five this year, as investors wager that progress in combating the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, will spur energy consumption, although gains are light ahead of a meeting of top producers early next week and with the return of Iranian exports still a possibility.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude was up 0.5% at $67.21 a barrel, while Brent was up 0.4% at $69.49. The contracts are both on track to post weekly gains of 5% to 6%.
Iran and global powers are continuing to negotiate in Vienna over the return of the Persian Gulf nation to adherence with the 2015 nuclear pact. If agreement can be reached and sanctions on its oil exports are lifted, primarily by the U.S., Iran could add around 1 million barrels a day of crude to the market.
This is something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, have to take into account when they get together on Tuesday.

The European Commission had fined ICAP 14.9 million euros in 2015 but Europe's second top court in 2017 dismissed part of the regulatory ruling and scrapped the fine, citing flaws in the European Commission's decision.
The Commission subsequently appealed to the Luxembourg-based EU Court of Justice but lost. 
""Today's decision, correcting the procedural error and including a detailed reasoning on the fine calculation, imposes fines on the three entities of ICAP having participated in the five infringements at the time,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.

The Commission's 2015 ruling said ICAP rigged the yen Libor financial benchmark in several cartels with Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old), UBS,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) at various periods.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 06:48AM ET</span>",Jailed HK tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to 14 months for Oct. 1 illegal assembly,"By Jessie Pang and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Jailed Hong Kong media tycoon and Beijing critic Jimmy Lai was given a new prison sentence of 14 months on Friday over his role in an unauthorised assembly on Oct. 1, 2019, during one of the city's pro-democracy rallies that year.
This month, Lai - who is already serving sentences adding up to 14 months for participating in similar demonstrations on Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, 2019 - and nine other activists pleaded guilty in District Court to organising an unauthorised assembly.
He has been in jail since December after being denied bail in a separate national security trial. He faces three charges under the new law, introduced by China in 2020 in response to the protests, including collusion with a foreign country.
Lai's repeated arrests have drawn criticism from Western governments and international rights groups, who raised concerns over waning freedoms in the global financial hub, including freedom of speech and assembly.
Beijing sees him as a traitor and an anti-China instigator.
China says the sweeping security law, which punishes anything Beijing considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, was vital to restore stability and prosperity.
Judge Amanda Woodcock, who handed Lai his previous illegal assembly sentence in April, delivered the sentence on Friday. She said part of the new sentence would be served consecutively, meaning Lai faces a total of 20 months in prison so far.
There were major clashes On Oct. 1, China's national day, including a live round shot by a policeman at a protester swinging a long stick, the first use of a handgun after months of demonstrations.
""They did call for a peaceful, rational and non-violent procession but how naive and unrealistic was that considering what was happening on a daily basis was the opposite,"" Woodcock said. ""This is not with hindsight. The risk was very real every day at that time.""
The other nine defendants, including activists Figo Chan, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho and Leung Kwok-hung, who is known in Hong Kong as Long Hair, were sentenced to up to 18 months. Two received suspended sentences.
""Your Honour, for over 40 years I have strived for democratic reform in China,"" Lee told the court this week during one of the hearings. ""This is my unrequited love, the love for my country with such a heavy heart.""
Activist Tsang Kin-shing, present at the court, condemned the ""heavy"" sentencing received by Long Hair, his colleague in the League of Social Democrats.
""We’re all trapped now in a prison city where freedom of expression is not allowed,"" Tsang told Reuters.
The sentence comes two weeks after authorities froze assets belonging to Lai, including bank accounts and his 71.26% stake in media publisher Next Digital.

Hong Kong's security chief sent letters to Lai and branches of HSBC and Citibank this month threatening up to seven years in prison for any dealings with the billionaire's accounts in the city, according to documents seen by Reuters.
The moves could imperil any attempt by the democracy activist to move offshore assets back home to prop up Next Digital's troubled Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid, a staunch government critic, one of Lai's financial advisers said.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -JD Logistics Inc shares closed 3.3% higher in their first session on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Friday, after trading up by as much as 18.3% on debut.
The company, spun out from Chinese e-commerce firm JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, priced its shares at $HK40.36 each and the stock closed at HK$41.70. 
They hit a peak of HK$47.75 but then steadily gave up those gains.
The Hang Seng closed 0.04% higher after trading higher for most of the day. 
JD Logistic's 15% drop from its peak to closing price was the result of intense retail investor activity late in the day, according to Kingston Securities executive director Dickie Wong. 
The company's securities filings showed the retail portion of the IPO was oversubscribed 715 times, making it one of the hottest IPOs of recent times in Hong Kong.
""There was a lot of retail investor interest in this deal so when those people see the stock is starting to fall they will start to divest because they want to take their profits,"" Wong told Reuters.
There were 1.36 million individual applications for stock in the deal but only 289,004 – or one fifth - of those received any shares in the IPO, regulatory filings showed.
JD Logistics is being watched closely as an indicator of appetite for big IPOs in Hong Kong and of companies closely connected to China's internet economy, which is facing antitrust scrutiny.
Speaking at a briefing in Beijing on Friday to mark the listing, JD Logistics CEO Yu Rui said the scrutiny by regulators would bring it more opportunity as it was differentiating itself by spending on technology. 
""We are going to use the funds raised from the IPO to further improve our networks, including in the lower-tier and suburban areas in China, and the infrastructure of the overseas markets,"" Yu said.
JD Logistics' successful IPO and stock listing comes after the planned IPO of financial technology firm JD Digits, an affiliate of JD.com, was terminated last month. 
The IPO is the second largest in Hong Kong in 2021 and only the third to raise more than $1 billion in the city this year.
The other two were Kuaishou Technology, which leapt 161% on debut in January, and Linklogis Inc, which gained 9.9% in April on opening day.

Shares of JD Logistics' close rival S.F. Holding Co Ltd have fallen about 20% this year after vaulting 137% last year. It has a market value of about $50 billion.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",Three Exxon refineries top the list of U.S. polluters,"By Tim McLaughlin
BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s U.S. oil refineries pump out far more lung-damaging soot than similarly-sized facilities operated by rivals, according to regulatory documents and a Reuters analysis of pollution test results.
The Texas-based firm's three largest refineries - two in Texas and one in Louisiana - are the nation's top three emitters of small particulate matter, according to the analysis of the latest tests submitted to regulators by the nation's 10 largest refineries.
The three Exxon refineries together averaged emissions of 80 pounds per hour, eight times the average rate of the seven other refineries on the top-ten list, some of which are larger than Exxon's plants, the analysis shows. The top polluter, Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery, averaged 138 pounds per hour. (See graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3i4mU9j)
The performance reflects the firm's inadequate spending to cut emissions, said Wilma Subra, a Louisiana-based scientist who formerly served on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Environmental Justice Advisory Council.
""Exxon has all the resources in the world to lower its pollution rates dramatically,"" she said.
The company has taken heat for years for its environmental performance. This week, Exxon lost at least two seats on its board of directors to an activist hedge fund seeking to force the firm to reckon with climate change.
Exxon said in a statement that it tries to comply with environmental laws and has invested billions of dollars to reduce emissions over the last two decades.
Oil-and-gas pollution has a disproportionate impact on poor and minority communities, which are often located near industrial sites. Reuters interviewed nearly three dozen residents in the predominantly Black neighborhoods near Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery. About a third said they either had breathing problems or knew someone who did.
Small particulate matter is among the most harmful pollutants. Made up of particles 50 times smaller than a grain of sand, it can bond with other toxins, infiltrate the blood stream, and damage the heart, lungs and nervous system. A small increase in long-term exposure to small particulate matter also leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rates, according to a recent Harvard University study.
""Particulate matter pollution is deadly, but you're not going to see it written on anyone's tombstone,"" said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington D.C.-based watchdog group.
The EPA requires plants to restrict small particulate matter emissions to 1 pound or less for every 1,000 pounds of coke burned in a refinery's catalytic cracking units.
But Exxon's Baton Rouge plant is the only major U.S. refinery that doesn't have to meet that standard because of an EPA rule that exempts ""cat crackers"" that were built before 1976 and haven't been modified since.
Refineries also have to meet state standards for particulate-matter pollution. But those limits can vary widely among states - and among different facilities within states - based on the strictness of state regulators and whether a refinery has agreed to tighter limits to settle lawsuits. And Louisiana regulators allow much higher pollution levels at Exxon's Baton Rouge plant than at other state refineries.
“There is a surprising amount of unevenness among states"" in enforcing pollution limits, said Philip Mattera, research director at Good Jobs First, a Washington-based watchdog group. “People don’t realize how much the EPA delegates responsibility on big environmental laws to state agencies.” 
OLD POLLUTION SCRUBBERS
Exxon’s two big oil refineries in Texas – in Beaumont and Baytown – are also among the top three polluters identified by Reuters. But Exxon's 517,000-barrel-per-day Baton Rouge plant produces far more soot.
The plant's emissions of small particulate matter hit a peak of 350 pounds per hour during an independent test conducted in January 2020 by an engineering firm Exxon hired to demonstrate its regulatory compliance.
Emissions averaged 255 pounds per hour during the test. That exceeded a limit, imposed on the refinery by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), of 234 pounds per hour – one of the highest limits in the country, according to regulatory documents. Other similarly-sized refineries in Louisiana and other states have state soot emissions limits closer to 50 pounds per hour.
The LDEQ declined to comment on the pollution limits it sets for Exxon's Baton Rouge plant.
Exxon officials blamed the refinery's high emissions on low water pressure in its 1970s-era wet gas scrubber, according to company correspondence with the LDEQ. Exxon told the state it had since resolved the issue.
Maintenance on such scrubbers, commonly used to control pollution, can lower emissions but requires shutting down a cat cracker for several weeks, hurting profitability, according to Exxon disclosures to the LDEQ. Completely new systems can cost more than $1 billion.
Because the Baton Rouge refinery's two catalytic crackers were built during World War Two – among the first such units in the country – they are exempt from federal EPA standards.
'GIVE US GOOD AIR'
The Baton Rouge refinery, more than a century old, borders neighborhoods with sky-high rates of childhood asthma. 
Seabell Thomas, 77, whose home is separated from the refinery by Interstate 110, said her son's asthma was so bad that he routinely visited the emergency room as a child. She has since been campaigning to pressure Exxon to clean up.
""When I wake up each morning, I have to confront two demons: pollution from the highway and the Exxon refinery,"" she said. ""We, as Black people, ask, 'God, how long can you allow this? Please, give us good air to breath.'""
In a group of census blocks that includes Thomas' home, childhood asthma rates were more than double the statewide average, according to a 2019 report by the Louisiana Health Department. Emergency-room visits for childhood asthma in the area also more than doubled the statewide rate.
""I grew up thinking asthma was an African-American disease because so many kids in the neighborhood had inhalers,"" said Sonyja Renee Thomas, the daughter of Seabell Thomas. ""Only later, as an adult, did I realize how much pollution factored into it.""
EXXON RIVALS RUN MUCH CLEANER
Big refineries run by Exxon's rivals are doing much better at controlling soot. Ironically, many of them are using technology invented and licensed by Exxon, according to disclosures by Exxon and environmental regulators.
Specialists in industrial pollution say the differences in performance can be attributed to any of a number of factors: rivals' equipment could be newer; maintenance schedules may be more frequent; and refining processes before wet gas scrubbing may also be optimized to reduce soot.
All of that takes money. In many cases, it also takes lawsuits.
Companies such as  BP  plc (LON:BP), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) have made agreements with the EPA in recent years to slash emissions below federal standards to help settle pollution-related litigation, regulatory disclosures show. 
These more restrictive limits are laid out in so-called consent decrees, which cover the operations of scores of U.S. refineries and influence permitted pollution levels set by states.
For example, Marathon's refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, operates an Exxon scrubber which has undergone numerous upgrades since being installed in 1979, company spokesman Jamal Kheiry said. The refinery's permit limit, set by the state, is 0.6 pounds per 1,000 pounds of burned coke, well below the EPA limit of one pound. During its latest test, Garyville's small particulate matter emissions were just 0.11 pounds. The plant is slightly larger than Exxon Baton Rouge.
""The low emissions numbers reflect robust emissions controls we have implemented,"" Marathon's Kheiry said.
Exxon's three largest refineries also operate under a consent decree, signed with the EPA in 2005 after the company was sued by the EPA and Justice Department for alleged Clean Air Act violations. But the agreement includes only a voluntary target for Exxon to limit soot emissions to half the EPA standard, which it has not done.
For locals around the Baton Rouge refinery, pushing for Exxon to reduce pollution can be difficult given its economic and political clout as a major Louisiana employer.

Sidney Poray, 60, has lived near the refinery for nearly 30 years and has worked with activist groups to monitor the refinery's emissions. But he's not optimistic their work will make much difference.
""Of course, I care about pollution,"" Poray said. ""But what am I going to do? We're talking about Exxon.""

1074,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Betting against volatile stock market makes comeback as summer nears,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are revisiting a popular trade that has largely been out of favor since last year’s market tumble: betting against stock market turbulence.
Assets in the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, a popular vehicle for betting against stock market gyrations, have nearly doubled over the last six months to $562 million.
Investors have also reaped big gains betting against products designed to profit from volatile markets. 
Short sellers targeting the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN logged paper profits of $319 million, or 48%, making VXX one of the most profitable shorted ETFs this year, S3 Partners data through May 14 showed.
Betting against volatility was a popular strategy in the months of placid trading leading up to the pandemic, until markets tumbled and volatility surged as COVID-19 spread around the globe.
More than a year later, “people are slowly coming back into it,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital.
Volatility has steadily declined as the S&P has climbed 90% since its March 2020 nadir, with the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, now hovering near a 15-month low.
Several factors are fueling investors’ bets that the market's gyrations will remain contained. The Federal Reserve has doubled down on its commitment to maintaining unprecedented monetary stimulus despite a recent surge in inflation, while President Joe Biden's administration is pushing trillions more to stimulate the economy. 
Meanwhile, events with the potential to spark big market moves - such as last year's presidential election and the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoff, are now in the rearview mirror.
""There are not a lot of events on the calendar,"" Tallbacken's Purves said. ""Show me a giant volatility catalyst there.""
A countrywide vaccine rollout has also driven down coronavirus infections and helped fuel an economic reopening and rebound in growth.
Investors next week will be keeping an eye on Friday's non-farm payrolls for clues on the progress of the economic recovery and pace of inflation.
Last month's report showed U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely curbed by shortages of workers and raw materials.
Traders have also shown increased interest in recent sessions in selling equity options, both overwriting and underwriting - strategies that rely on calm markets, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
""Volumes have dried up this week ahead of the Memorial Day weekend, and we are seeing major indices trade in tighter ranges and a notable trend of summer volatility selling,"" he said, referring to both stock and options volume.
To be sure, betting against volatility can be a risky strategy. 
One notable blowup came in February 2018, when a sharp fall in stocks cratered several short volatility exchange traded products, most notably the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note (XIV), which lost nearly $2 billion.
Many of the world’s biggest banks have also said trading may be more turbulent in the coming months as U.S. growth is expected to peak, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) among those forecasting headwinds.
Seth Golden, chief market strategist at investment research firm Finom Group, who had been shorting ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF shares from last year has trimmed his position in recent weeks, wary that the Fed may send a hawkish message when global central bankers meet at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in August.
""Come then I think the opportunity to short volatility would be ideal,"" he said.
Others, however, believe the time to bet against volatility has already arrived.

""We are in this in-between phase where volatility is low compared with where it has been in the past six months but it could go much lower,"" said Jay Wolberg, founder of Trading Volatility, a data and analytics provider focused on volatility exchange traded products and financial derivatives.
Wolberg's actively-managed $9 million Switchback Dynamic Volatility Fund 1, flipped to a net short volatility position in mid-May, after growing worries about a rise in inflation prompted a minor pullback in stocks.

""Of course our offer is still valid. After all we have carefully weighed and thought through our decision for Lamborghini and the attached offer and concept,"" Rea Stark told Reuters.
""And if there is willingness to negotiate -- whether that's investments, guarantees or the purchase price -- then of course we are still prepared.""
Stark said that in addition to the 7.5 billion euro bid, first submitted to Volkswagen in late February but only made public this week, Quantum has offered 1-2 billion euros to cover investments and guarantees for jobs and sites at Lamborghini.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea aims to use a global climate summit it is hosting virtually next week to burnish its leadership credentials on environmental issues, despite its patchy record at home. 
Diplomats say they expect few major announcements at the summit on Sunday and Monday in Seoul, but organisers are looking for participating countries to take steps to implement sweeping emissions goals made at other climate summits. 
The 2021 Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030, or P4G, summit is the second of three major international conferences on the environment this year, and brings together a dozen partner countries, international organisations, and private companies.
Some non-member countries, including the United States and China, are expected to participate, including in the form of video speeches by national leaders or senior officials. 
Established in 2018, P4G focuses on public-private partnerships, especially in developing countries, in contrast to the more inter-governmental pledges and commitments featured at the Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden in April. 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is expected to conclude several pacts to protect wildlife, call for cooperation regarding marine pollution, and discuss aspects of his country’s ""Green New Deal"" including hydrogen fuel and batteries. 
A general session on ways to become carbon neutral will feature South Korean conglomerates such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and LG Electronics Inc, as well as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, a South Korean official said.
""South Korea will demonstrate an inclusive leadership, encompassing both advanced and vulnerable countries ... and join the ranks of advanced nations in climate response in the international community,"" the official at the presidential Blue House told a briefing on Thursday.
Moon has set goals for South Korea of net-zero emissions by 2050, an end to funding of overseas coal plants, and the introduction of a carbon tax.
A coalition of 11 environmental groups said that despite the new promises, if existing planned coal-powered plants were completed, they would likely be in operation well after 2050, and would make carbon neutrality by then impossible. 
""Against this backdrop, we are left in serious doubt as to whether the country will be able to lead a worthwhile discussion on green growth and sustainable development,"" the coalition including Greenpeace said in an open letter to Moon.
LOOKING FOR PRACTICAL STEPS
Ahead of the summit some countries had hoped South Korea would set the pace with a more ambitious national emissions target or more commitments around coal, but this was now unlikely, one diplomatic source told Reuters. 
South Korea appeared to have decided to make smaller announcements at each competing climate conference this year, rather than a grand commitment all at once, the source said.
""That said, I’m sure that Korea will judge the event to be a success based on high-level participation alone - numbering around 40 heads of state,"" the source said, requesting anonymity in order to speak frankly.
""The good news is that Korea appears to be heading on a green trajectory even if it may not be turning green as quickly as we would like.""
Ian de Cruz, P4G’s global director, told Reuters South Korea was well positioned to be a leader in public-private efforts because of its many heavy industries like shipbuilding and automotive manufacturing.
He said he was expecting more near-term steps from South Korea toward a green transformation of its heavy industries. 

Overseas coal financing, for example, was not only about ending financing, but also reallocating funding for developing countries to boost investment in renewables, smart technology, battery swaps, and electric vehicles, he said.
""If that happens tangibly, then that positions Korea as a leader,"" de Cruz said.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 02:20AM ET</span>",Environmentalists condemn Biden's backing of Alaska oil drilling project,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Environmental groups have condemned the Biden administration's defense of a proposed ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) oil development in Alaska, a drilling project approved under former President Donald Trump.
Climate activists had previously said they were encouraged that upon taking office in January, President Joe Biden signed an order to rejoin the Paris Accord and revoked federal permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Both issues were priorities for environmental activists.
However, the administration's backing of the Alaska oil drilling project on Wednesday brought scathing criticism from environmental groups.
""It is a serious misstep to pass on administrative authority to constrain an out-of-control oil industry while simultaneously punting to a deadlocked Congress for climate action,"" John Noel, a senior climate campaigner with Greenpeace USA, told Reuters. 
In February, an appeals court blocked construction of ConocoPhillips' $2 billion-plus Willow crude oil project in Alaska. Wednesday's backing of the project by the Biden administration in a court filing comes after Interior Secretary Deb Haaland had opposed the project last year when she was a member of Congress.  
The project has been pushed by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, who along with another Republican senator, Dan Sullivan, discussed the project during a meeting with Biden on Monday, according to Politico.
""They are opening up a lane for the oil and gas industry to cause irreparable harm to Arctic communities' public health and wildlife habitats"", Gregory Stewart, legal chair of the executive committee of the Alaska chapter of the Sierra Club, told Reuters in an email.
Another environment group, Earthjustice, said the oil drilling project is at odds with Biden's historic climate leadership while the Alaska Wilderness League said the decision ignored the concerns of indigenous communities and was ""incredibly disappointing"".
Biden had united a range of U.S. environmental groups behind his successful presidential campaign, with the groups pouring money and effort into his run for president.
Environmental political action committees, including the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, EDF (PA:EDF) Action and the Sunrise PAC, spent more than $1.5 million in the 2020 federal election cycle - mostly for Biden and other Democrats. 

The Trump administration approved the Willow development plan in October. Permits to mine for gravel and build roads were issued on the morning of Jan. 20, just before Biden was sworn in as the 46th president.
Environmental groups had sued late last year, making the argument that the government failed to take into account the impact that drilling would have on fragile wildlife.

In its first phase, China's long-awaited national ETS, seen as a key Beijing policy lever to achieve the country's net-zero emission pledge, will cover some 2,225 power plants across China, responsible for about 4 billion tonnes of carbon emission each year.
The Securities Times cited Lai Xiaoming, the Chairman of the Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange, in its report. Lai also said limits for block deals in national ETS will be set at 30% of price moves at the beginning, and adjusted in accordance to market movements.
While Lai's exchange will host trading, the Wuhan exchange will manage the ETS registry platform. 
Financial institutions or individual investors will not be allowed to participate in trading in the early stage of the national ETS, restricted to carbon-emitting utilities, but as soon as the trading mechanism matures, institution investors would be included, said Lai.
At a conference last Saturday, Lai said China is looking to bring two more sectors into carbon emission verification this year and include them into the national ETS next year.
China had aimed to cover eight high-emission industries, including petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, non-ferrous, papermaking, steel, power generation and aviation, into the national trading scheme.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Hyundai to slash combustion engine line-up, invest in EVs - sources","By Gilles Guillaume and Heekyong Yang
PARIS/SEOUL (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Group will slash the number of combustion engine models in its line-up to free up resources to invest in electric vehicles (EVs), two people close to the South Korean automaker told Reuters.
The move will result in a 50% reduction in models powered by fossil fuels, one of the people said, adding the strategy was approved by top management in March.
""It is an important business move, which first and foremost allows the release of R&D resources to focus on the rest: electric motors, batteries, fuel cells,"" the person said, without giving a timeframe for the plan.
While Hyundai did not specifically address a Reuters query on its plans for combustion engine models, it said in an email on Thursday that it was accelerating adoption of eco-friendly vehicles such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and battery EVs. 
Hyundai added it will try to improve the efficiency of its internal combustion engine vehicle line-up in emerging markets. 
The automaker added that it aims to gradually expand battery EV offerings in key markets such as the United States, Europe and China with a goal for full electrification by 2040. 
Hyundai Motor Group, which houses Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp and Genesis, aims to sell about one million EVs per year by 2025 to achieve a 10% share of the global EV market.
Facing tightening CO2 emission targets in Europe and China, all major automakers are accelerating their shift to EVs. 
The huge cost of developing electric motors and increasing the driving range of car batteries has already led some to say their days of investing in conventional engines are over.
""Hyundai has stopped developing new powertrains for internal combustion engine cars,"" one of the people said.
PSA Group said in November, shortly before merging with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis, that it was no longer investing in combustion engines.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) has recently revamped its combustion engines and executives say the new generation will see it through the electrification process.
Some car makers have already announced plans to go fully electric, with Sweden's Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, saying it would do that by 2030.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co says its line-up in Europe will be fully electric by the same date.
For Hyundai, which together with Kia is one of the world's top ten auto groups, the move is particularly important because it has one of the broadest ranges of engine and transmission technologies in the industry.
The group will finalise its strategy to switch to all electric models within the next six months, one source said.
In April, Hyundai said it would cut the number of its gasoline models in China to 14 from 21 by 2025, while launching new electric models every year starting in 2022.

In February, the group said it was no longer in talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop an autonomous vehicle.
Sources familiar with the matter said the idea of the group becoming a contract manufacturer for Apple encountered strong internal opposition.

Investing.com – China’s logistics firm JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics Inc.'s shares soared on its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which raised $3.2 billion in the bourse’s second-largest listing in 2021 to date.
JD Logistics shares jumped 10.75% to HKD44.7 ($5.76) by 12:42 AM ET (4:42 AM GMT), after surging up to 18% earlier in the session. Parent company JD. Com Inc.'s (HK:9618) Hong Kong shares were down 0.21%.
The company raised $3.2 billion in its initial public offering. The stocks had been priced at HK$40.36, the lower end of its offered range, leading to concerns about demand for new listings in the city.
The retail portion of the IPO was oversubscribed 715 times by individual investors, who were competing for just 3% of the stock on offer, according to a company filing.
The institutional investor part was 10.18 times oversubscribed by 580 investors. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp.'s (T:9984) Vision Fund, Temasek Holdings and BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) were among the cornerstone investors who took 48.3% of the shares.
JD Logistics, the delivery arm of JD.com, was founded in 2007 and spun off a decade later. With a network of over 900 warehouses, JD Logistics will expand into less-developed regions in China and new markets globally following the listing.
“Frankly speaking, the focus for next few years will still be growth… we will focus on business expansion and revenue growth for the next several years. Our net margin will keep improving in the long-term,” JD Logistics Chief Executive Officer Yu Rui told Bloomberg.
JD Logistics takes up just a 2.7% share of the logistics industry in China and is planning to expand overseas, including Europe. It will likely set up logistics centers on the continent within a year, Yu added.
The company is still loss-making, reporting CNY4.1 billion ($642.21 million) in a net loss in 2020, according to its prospectus.
The listing comes as China is tightening scrutiny on internet platforms, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and Meituan.
“JD Logistics is doing better than any other companies in B2B sector in terms of ensuring the benefits of our front-line workers and regulatory compliance…From our point of view, we don’t see much potential risks in regulation,” said Yu."
1082,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",When is a sausage just a sausage? Controversial ads fuel S.Korea's sexism debate,"SEOUL (Reuters) -This month three South Korean companies and the Seoul police have had to pull ads and other content after men's rights groups claimed that ""small penis"" symbols were used, insulting men.
The offending images? Hands with the thumbs and the index fingers pinching towards each other illustrating the reaching out for an object. But the gesture is also often used to indicate something small in size and in South Korea, it is associated with a strident, albeit now defunct, feminist group that used the image in its logo.
Exacerbating the problem, one ad and a menu involved were also advertising sausages.
Following its ad, South Korea's largest convenience store chain, GS25, saw a handful of members from the men's group ""Man on Solidarity"" protest outside the firm's headquarters. The group's YouTube channel, which posts videos of its protests, has gained more than 200,000 subscribers in just two months.
GS25 withdrew its ad and fried chicken chain Genesis BBQ pulled its menu, issuing apologies and stating they had no intention to demean men. Kakao Bank Corp has apologised for a hand drawn similarly in one of its ads and the Seoul Metropolitan police also removed a hand from a road traffic ad saying it wanted to avoid any misunderstanding.
The controversy is the latest flare-up in long-running tension over gender rights in South Korea that has pitted men and women's groups against each other and which has also resulted in police looking into whether female comedian Park Na-rae broke any laws with a ribald joke made in March.
The joke on a YouTube video involving a Stretch Armstrong action figure whose arms were brought near his genital area resulted in a storm of complaints that a similar joke by a male comedian would never have been acceptable.
Park, 35, and her agency JDB Entertainment issued statements apologising and her YouTube channel was scrapped. Police are obligated to look into the matter after a complaint was filed on a website set up to address citizens' grievances, though it remains unclear if charges will be filed.
Park and her agency did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the potential police action.
Kim Garo, director of the women's policy division at the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, said while the problems of misogyny and misandry were not new in South Korea, the recent targeting of companies and individuals was.
She said it was difficult for the government to interfere when protests took the form of consumer action but it would continue with outreach programmes that invited young men and women to discuss issues such as gender equality and jobs.
POLITICAL FALLOUT
When President Moon Jae-in came to power in 2017, he pledged to be a president for gender equality, vowing to do more to fix disadvantages for women in South Korea. 
South Korea has one of the largest wage gaps of any OECD country and low political representation for women who hold just 19% of parliamentary seats. Since Moon, women have seen some improvement in wages and are also eligible for bigger government subsidies than men when starting a new business.
Political scientists say, however, many young men now feel their own needs and rights are not being sufficiently acknowledged, adding to widespread discontent over the lack of job opportunities for young people.
""Anti-feminist sentiment is strong among men in their 20s and early 30s, as well as the generation that is becoming adults,"" said Jeong Han-wool, a senior fellow at Hankook Research Company. Research for a 2019 book he co-authored found 58.6% of Korean men in their 20s said they strongly opposed feminism. 
That complicates the outlook for the ruling Democratic Party as it seeks re-election next year when Moon's single five-year term ends. 
The party has also lost support among women after multiple sexual abuse scandals involving politicians, contributing to crushing defeats in recent mayoral elections for Seoul and the port of Busan.

Park Jun-young, a 27-year old engineering graduate school student, says he is among those who think men are now at a disadvantage.
""Feminism in South Korea started with gender equality, allowing women the same access and to break the glass ceiling, but it's turned into something where the nowadays young men - who aren't better off than women the same age - have become a target of criticism,"" he said.

Malaysian firms, which includes some of the world's biggest palm oil and rubber glove producers, have faced increasing scrutiny in recent years over reports of labour abuses. 
Employment and Social Development Canada told Reuters in an email that its Labour Programme was ""actively researching a number of forced labour allegations in different countries and sectors, including palm oil and glove manufacturing in Malaysia."" 
It declined to provide further details or name specific companies being probed.
Malaysia's human resources ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the last year, the United States has banned imports from three Malaysian firms on suspicions of forced labour. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said it found forced labour indicators such as excessive hours, abusive living and working conditions, debt bondage, intimidation, physical and sexual violence, and retention of identity documents at these companies. 
The sanctioned companies include Top Glove, the world’s biggest latex glove maker, and the two of the world’s top palm oil producers, Sime Darby Plantation and FGV Holdings. 
Top Glove said in April it has resolved all indicators of forced labour found at its factories. 

Sime Darby has said it is committed to combating forced labour and has robust policies to protect workers' rights. 
FGV has said it has taken concrete steps in recent years to demonstrate commitment to respect human rights and uphold labour standards.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Friday morning after the U.S. released solid economic data. U.S. President Joe Biden also reportedly plans to propose a $6 trillion budget for the 2022 fiscal year.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.20% by 11:25 PM ET (3:25 AM GMT). The country plans to extend its current COVID-19 state of emergency that covers eight prefectures, including Tokyo. If implemented, the state of emergency will be extended to June 20, a month before the Tokyo Olympic Games are due to begin.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.74% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.13%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.68%, with the city passing a bill to amend its electoral systems on Thursday.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% and the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.04%.
Biden will reportedly propose the budget in the coming fiscal year later in the day.
“The White House has decided to release what is arguably the most important policy document of the year on a Friday afternoon before a three-day weekend at the start of a congressional recess, when it is likely to receive little attention, rather than the traditional Monday morning release when Congress is in session,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note.
Investors have already been worried that the scale of stimulus measures will lead to inflation, which eventually forces the Fed to taper asset purchases and tighten lending rates faster than expected. However, more spending will help world growth, global equities increase, and investors’ confidence, according to Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG.
""This is a market that’s blown off a little bit of froth over the last three weeks, but there’s nothing that’s occurred to suggest that the bull market in stocks is under any imminent threat... maybe momentum has slowed down, and that could remain the case for a little while, but the bull market is still pretty strong,"" Rodda told Reuters.
On the data front, U.S. data released on Thursday said GDP increased by 6.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2021, the same as the previous quarter but slightly below the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Other data released on the same day included Initial Jobless Claims, which fell to a 14-month low of 406,000 during the past week. April’s Pending Home Sales, which contracted 4.4% month-on-month, was below forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 1.7% growth.
Investors now await further data, including April’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index and Personal Spending, due later in the day.
The continuous economic recovery from COVID-19 boosted investors' sentiment and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s insistence that the central bank will not hike interest rate faster than expected also eased investors’ concerns.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said on Thursday that price pressures will be transitory, although inflation is likely to persist through the end of 2021 before fading.
“My judgment right now is the recent inflation we’ve seen will be temporary, it’s not something that’s endemic…I expect it to last, however, for several more months, and to see high annual rates of inflation through the end of this year,” said Yellen.
On the COVID-19 front, investors are hoping that the accelerating vaccination rates will help ease a recent rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in several countries."
1085,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>","Biden pledges to tackle monopolies, supply shortages as prices rise","By Andrea Shalal and Trevor Hunnicutt
CLEVELAND (Reuters) -President Joe Biden pledged on Thursday to root out anti-competitive business practices and ease construction materials shortages and transportation backups that are causing price hikes across the country.
""In the coming weeks, my administration will take steps to combat these supply pressures, starting with the construction materials and transportation bottlenecks, and building off the work we're doing on computer chips,"" Biden said in a speech at Ohio's Cuyahoga Community College.
""We're also announcing new initiatives to combat anti-competitive practices that hurt small businesses and families.""
In recent weeks, the United States has faced shortfalls and bottlenecks from lumber to computer chips to port cargo backlogs. Together with labor shortages, those issues are making homes, cars and consumer goods pricier and harder to get. 
U.S. economic data on Friday is expected to show that a closely watched gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and energy, increased 0.6% in April.
The price hikes and related inflation fears threaten to undermine Biden's argument that the U.S. economy needs trillions in government spending to grow and create jobs in the years to come.
Biden did not specify on Thursday which policies he is considering. But the administration has been looking for ways to combat industry concentration and monopolies and ease shortages in goods like lumber and steel, and is studying the impact of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.
Lumber shortages have sent prices skyrocketing, and homebuilders worry they could go still higher if the U.S. Commerce Department finalizes a preliminary decision that could double tariffs on Canadian wood imports.
""We would like to see the president lift tariffs on key construction materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum,"" said Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America. 
The administration is set next week to wrap up an initial supply-chain review https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains intended to shore up U.S. access in four key areas: computer chips, electric-vehicle batteries, pharmaceuticals and minerals used in electronics.
""You can't reboot a global economy like flipping on a light switch,"" Biden said, adding there would ""be ups and downs in jobs and economic reports. There's going to be supply-chain issues - price distortions on the way back to a stable and steady growth."" 
The remarks come a day before Biden releases a multitrillion-dollar budget wish list to Congress that includes proposed new spending on infrastructure, manufacturing subsidies, childcare and climate change.

Biden argues that those investments are necessary for the United States to compete with key rival China, squash inequality and trim the ranks of the unemployed following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Republicans object to much of Biden's extra spending and his plans to pay for it by hiking taxes on high-income earners and big corporations.

However, shares of Dell fell 1%, while those of HP dropped as much as 6%, after both companies warned the ongoing computer chip shortage could impact their ability to meet demand for laptops this year. 
""The component supply situation remains constrained,"" Dell Chief Financial Officer Thomas Sweet said in post earnings call, adding that rising costs to procure these chips would hit its operating income in the current quarter by the low to mid-single digits and lead to slightly lower revenue on a sequential basis.
HP Inc, which ranks second among global PC vendors according to IDC data, said the shortages would limit its ability to supply personal computing devices and printers at least until the end of the year. 
Still, the companies, which are leaders in the personal computing industry, said they were bullish on the overall market, expecting the surge in demand for laptops needed by people working and going to school remotely to continue.
Global shipments of PCs, the industry's collective term for laptops and desktops, grew 55.2% during the first quarter, according to preliminary data from research firm IDC.
Dell said revenue from its client solutions group, which includes desktops, notebooks and tablets, rose 20% to $13.31 billion in the reported quarter. 

HP's PC-related sales rose 27% in the quarter ended April 30, while notebook sales surged 47% from the same period a year earlier.
Dell's revenue rose 12% to $24.49 billion in the first quarter, beating estimates of $23.40 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data, while HP posted overall revenue of $15.9 billion above the $15 billion estimate.

HOUSTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - The full makeup of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s board of directors remained undecided following Wednesday's hotly contested election in which 16 candidates vied for 12 seats.
In a shareholder vote that rocked the oil industry, activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 won at least two seats with support from top Exxon investors BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), and Vanguard Group. The contest was marked by controversy with the hedge fund warning of last minute vote changes and accusing Exxon of delaying the count ""for its own purpose."" 
Inspectors are sifting through millions of electronic and mail-in ballots for the final two candidates with the greater number of votes.
WHO IS COUNTING VOTES?
An inspector of elections, which can be one or more people, is hired to prepare results. The process might run into June, according Exxon spokesman Casey Norton, because of the sheer number of votes and evaluating ballots can be complex. 
WHAT DO INSPECTORS CONSIDER?
With millions of shares changing hands daily, ineligible shareholders sometimes cast ballots. The inspector must check ballots so only eligible votes are counted, and that changed votes are not double counted, said Cal Smith, a partner at law firm King & Spalding. Only Exxon shareholders as of March 29 were eligible.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
If either side challenges the preliminary results, the next stop is called the ""snake pit,"" where the inspector, proxy solicitors for each side and their lawyers review the votes. 
HOW LONG DOES A SNAKE PIT LAST?
It can take weeks to decide whether a shareholder had the right to vote, whether there was proper chain of custody, and whether a last-minute vote change can supersede a previous ballot. Once this happens, the vote can be certified.
WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED SO FAR?
Eight of Exxon's nominees, including Chief Executive Darren Woods, and two of Engine No. 1's nominees, former refining executives Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, were elected by comfortable margins.
WHAT NOMINEES REMAIN IN CONTENTION? 
Exxon directors Steven Kandarian, Douglas Oberhelman, Samuel Palmisano and Wan Zulkiflee, and Engine No. 1 nominee Alexander Karsner are still in the running.

HOW MIGHT THE BOARD MAKEUP CHANGE? 
Exxon could seat six to seven new directors within little more than a year - half its membership. The tally includes new appointments earlier this year, election results and a pledge to add two new directors within 12 months.

Google executives' appraisals sought in U.S. antitrust case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for the Justice Department and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google tangled on Thursday over whether the company should hand over performance reviews of executives whom the government is considering calling as witnesses.
In a pre-trial hearing, Kenneth Dintzer, speaking for the Justice Department, gave the example of an executive who might say in a self-assessment that Google has hit 85% market share in a certain area and his or her goal is to increase it. Dintzer stressed that the government did not want sensitive health or other personal information.
John Schmidtlein, who argued for Google, said he found it hard to believe that a performance review would have information that would break open an antitrust case. He also said he had ""never heard"" of performance reviews being subpoenaed in an antitrust case.
Judge Amit Mehta said that he would like to see data from personnel files of six people, and that he would read them and decide. ""I take the government at its word that there may be some relevance to these files,"" he said.
The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google in October, alleging the company acted unlawfully to maintain its position in search and search advertising on the internet. 
A state antitrust case, filed in December, accused Google of seeking to extend its dominance to devices like speakers, televisions and even smart cars. 

The two cases have been combined for pre-trial matters.
The next pre-trial conference was set for the end of June. The federal case is expected to go to trial in September 2023.

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) soared on Thursday, notching a 35% one-day gain in a rally that burned bearish investors and sparked jubilation among the stock's online supporters.
The movie theater chain’s market value ended the session at $11.9 billion as its shares closed at $26.52, with the highest trading volume of any stock on U.S. exchanges on the day. The shares are now up 1,150% year-to-date after hitting their highest level in four years.
Market watchers have attributed the moves in AMC - as well as in shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) which also rallied this week - to a range of factors, including the enthusiasm of retail investors congregating on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets and the unwinding of bearish bets against the companies’ shares. 
“I’m continuously amazed by the things we are seeing,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird, who does not have a view on where AMC's stock will trade. “All of us are getting an education in what moves stocks and that education is ongoing.”
About 91 million shares, or roughly 20% of AMC's float are sold short, with bearish investors suffering just under $2 billion in mark-to-market losses year-to-date, according to data from S3 partners. 
“One hundred percent, there were some short sellers with less conviction that closed out their short positions today,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics. 
A short squeeze took shares of GameStop on a more than 1,600% surge in January, though the stock pared those gains the following month. The video game retailer's shares closed up 4.7% at $254.13 on Thursday.
Shares of Koss Corp, another Reddit favorite, also rose sharply on high volume, closing up 10.4% at $22.82. The stock was up a further 2.5% after the bell.
FROM CRYPTO TO MEME
Investors shifting into so-called meme stocks from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - whose prices have wobbled as they came under increased scrutiny from regulators - may also be driving the moves, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said. 
“Bitcoin’s decline has clearly flushed out some tourists, so some of that capital is probably being reallocated back into meme stocks,” Vanda’s Eric Liu said in an email.
Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, is down around 39% from its April 14 high of $64,895. 
Investors may have also been encouraged by AMC’s earnings report and conference call earlier this month, where it said the environment was looking increasingly favorable. [nL4N2MT4VQ]
“AMC’s earnings call probably also reawakened some animal spirits, and we saw a dramatic pick up in message board and social media activity in the name after the call,” Liu said. 
AMC's shares were up as much as 52% on Thursday and surpassed their Jan 27 high, posted during the rally in meme stocks earlier this year.
Some analysts covering the stock say they are optimistic business trends will improve for AMC as consumers become more confident about returning to movie theaters after their COVID-19 vaccinations and flock to summer releases. 
However, at least one pointed to enthusiasm among retail investors as the main reason for Thursday's gains. 
""This is not driven by institutional demand... it's not trading on fundamentals. It's a meme,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter who has a $6.50 price target on the stock. ""It's just silly."" 
On WallStreetBets, some users celebrated while others fretted over their recent purchases.
“Bought at 9.70. Let’s go to the moon,” wrote user markad007.

But another denizen of the forum, TalkingBackAgain, was less enthusiastic. 
“I bought them at $29.25 and they tanked immediately. I lost 10% before I could exhale,” the user wrote. “Now I don’t know whether I’ll ever see that money back or whether this is the precursor to a $GME-style squeeze. I feel stress.”

Costco, like several other retailers, has benefited from the easing of pandemic-related restrictions and stimulus checks, as more people visited its cavernous stores to buy everything from groceries to sporting goods.
The company said it was beginning a phased return of food sampling and plans to bring back seating at most of its food courts.
Costco added it continued to see strength in its non-foods businesses and its travel division, which offers hotel rooms and cruise tickets to its members, aided by pent-up demand and COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs.
However, the company said it was still pressured by supply delays, higher freight costs and chip shortages, which were impacting deliveries.
""There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said.
Costco added it was tackling supply chain delays by adjusting orders.
Comparable sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, jumped 15.1% in the third quarter, compared with estimates of a 11.46% rise, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.22 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the quarter ended May 9, from $838 million, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected a net income of $2.34 per share.
Total revenue rose 21.5% to $45.28 billion, compared with estimates of $43.64 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced slightly on Thursday, as data showing improvement in the labor market helped bolster expectations in the economic recovery and spurred a minor rotation towards stocks seen as more likely to benefit from the rebound.
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims dropped more than expected last week to a 14-month low of 406,000 as pandemic restrictions continue to be lifted, while a separate report showed business spending on equipment picked up speed. 
Graphic: U.S. jobless claims, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznpnrygmpl/joblessclaims.png 
The data helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year note reaching a high of 1.625% and denting the attractiveness of higher-growth names in areas such as technology while helping those seen as more likely to benefit from an improving economy such as financials and small caps.
Still, the 10-year yield remained within the range it has been in for several days, which served to keep inflation concerns in check and limited the rotation within sectors.
Investors have been closely watching economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials for signs of runaway inflation and the possibility the central bank may begin to pull back on its massive stimulus measures. 
""When you look at the jobless claims that actually shows we're continuing to make progress, if we get a strong jobs report in the next release that's going to provide some support, until then there's uncertainty so I don't think there's a lot of momentum either way,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, in Waltham, Mass.
""We've had the Fed come out and say we're going to continue to support things but now we're starting to be a little bit nervous, that's obviously a headwind."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 141.59 points, or 0.41%, to 34,464.64, the S&P 500 gained 4.89 points, or 0.12%, to 4,200.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.72 points, or 0.01%, to 13,736.28.
Weighed down by weakness in tech shares, the Nasdaq underperformed the Dow and S&P.
U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) climbed 3.87% to lead the Dow higher after its European rival Airbus outlined an almost two-fold increase in production, citing a strong recovery in aviation from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Boeing supplier  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) jumped 7.09% and the two were the biggest boost to the S&P industrials, the best performing sector on the day. 
Investors will now look to the personal consumption expenditure report due on Friday as it is the central bank's preferred inflation measure for its 2% long-term target.
Fed officials have repeatedly maintained in recent days that the central bank is not ready to adjust its monetary support, although some have suggested they are open to begin discussing the reduction of its bond-buying plan. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said the labor market is tighter than many realize.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp forecast second-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, but shares fell 1.35% as the chipmaker could not say for certain how much of its recent revenue rise was driven by the volatile cryptocurrency-mining market.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.48 billion shares, compared with the 10.52 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A Massachusetts judge on Thursday rejected Robinhood's bid to block state regulators from moving forward with their enforcement action alleging that the online brokerage encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades without limits.
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger said Robinhood could continue challenging in court the validity of the state's new fiduciary rule, which underlies Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin's case against it.
But Salinger said that did not mean he should in the interim block Galvin, who oversees the state's securities division, from proceeding with his case, noting that some claims were unrelated to the new regulation.
""If the court were to strike down the challenged regulation, the division would still be entitled to press its separate claims that Robinhood's alleged conduct was nonetheless unethical or dishonest,"" Salinger wrote.
He requested further briefing on whether Robinhood's challenge to the fiduciary rule should be put on hold pending the outcome of Galvin's administrative case, though he said it would be ""unusual"" to do so.
Debra O'Malley, Galvin's spokeswoman, said he was pleased by the ruling, while Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, a spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood, welcomed the judge's decision to address the rule's validity.
Galvin's office had argued the issue should be first heard by the administrative hearing officer presiding over his case against Robinhood, which is seeking to go public through an initial public offering.

Galvin announced his case in December, before the social media-driven rally in stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) prompted by retail investors buying the stocks on platforms like Robinhood.
Robinhood sued in April, arguing Galvin lacked authority to adopt the fiduciary rule and that it conflicted with federal law. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 adopted its own rule for brokerages that rejected the standard Galvin was enforcing.

By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Governors of U.S. states that represent both political parties have written letters to President Joe Biden supporting the purchase of F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co.
Biden's $753 billion national security budget request, expected by Congress on Friday, will boost research and development spending to prepare for future warfare.
The separate letters, seen by Reuters, were penned by four Democrats and one Republican and point out that the jet is made in 48 states and Puerto Rico, and is responsible for more than 254,000 direct and indirect jobs. 
The stealthy jet is the most expensive Pentagon weapons program that will cost over $1.7 trillion over its multi-decade expected service life.
Earlier this month, Senators from both parties wrote letters to the heads of the Appropriations and Armed Services committees supporting the purchase of the jets.
At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Frank Kendall, Biden's nominee for Secretary of the Air Force, said ""the key to keeping the cost down in an air fleet is getting the numbers up. There is a strong correlation between the size of the fleet and the cost of the fleet. In my view we should get the cost down and keep the procurement at a rate that makes sense.""
Biden's 2022 budget will request 85 of the jets for the U.S. armed services, with 48 going to the U.S. Air Force, people familiar with the requests say. The jets would be delivered in 2024.
Lockheed plans to deliver between 133 and 139 of the jets this year to both U.S. and international customers and partners.

IoT is also being used in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, and increased demand for cloud solutions and smart devices in the 5G era should also increase the demand for IoT powered products in the coming months. Consequently, we think ABB (ABB), Skyworks (SWKS), and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) should benefit significantly. Let’s take a closer look at these names.Many businesses are planning to continue, at least in-part, with remote working arrangements even after the pandemic is over given its benefits and the huge investments they made in remote connectivity during the pandemic. This is expected to buoy demand for gadgets that support Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Furthermore, the commercial deployment of 5G technology is expected to create a high demand for secure IoT devices and tech solutions in the coming months. Manufacturing and industrial sectors are also increasingly using IoT technology.
The global IoT market is expected to grow at a 10.5% CAGR over the next five years to reach $1.39 trillion by 2026. Investor optimism about this industry is evident in the Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF’s (SNSR) 51.2% returns over the past year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The heads of major U.S. retail banks faced renewed criticism Thursday from Democratic lawmakers who said financial institutions should not have charged Americans billions of dollars in overdraft and other fees during the pandemic. 
Testifying before Congress for the second time this week, the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) highlighted their banks' efforts to waive fees and offer more affordable accounts after Senator Elizabeth Warren attacked them over the costs.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who bore the brunt of Warren's ire during Wednesday's Senate hearing, said his bank waived $400 million in overdraft fees for customers who asked for help since the pandemic began. Warren had slammed JPMorgan for gathering $1.46 billion in such fees.
She responded on Thursday, tweeting, ""Only @jpmorgan would brag that they only charged about $1.5 billion in overdraft fees during a global pandemic and economic crisis, instead of the roughly $2 billion they usually take.""
In a statement, the Consumer Bankers Association said customers have to opt in for overdrafts and many do so because they ""view it as a valuable service.""
On Thursday, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), another Democratic critic of Wall Street, also raised concerns that banks had ""raked in"" fees ""at a time when individuals and families across the country are struggling.""
Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf was pressed by Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney for charging ""predatory"" overdraft fees on debit card transactions.

Scharf, who is trying to turn Wells Fargo around after its six-year sales practices scandal, said the bank was looking to be ""more consumer-friendly."" He said it had recently launched an overdraft-free account that is ""probably"" now its most popular. 
The chief executives of  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also testified on Wednesday and Thursday.

(Reuters) - Two tech trade groups filed a lawsuit against Florida on Thursday over a new law that would fine social media companies that ban political candidates, which they said violated free speech rights.
The lawsuit, which said the bill signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday was unconstitutional, was filed by internet lobbying groups NetChoice and Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA). The groups' members include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
""We cannot stand idly by as Florida's lawmakers push unconstitutional bills into law that bring us closer to state-run media and a state-run internet,"" said NetChoice's Vice President Carl Szabo. ""The First Amendment protects social media platforms' right to host and moderate content as they see fit for their business models and users.""
Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for Republican DeSantis, said the governor’s office had no comment on any specific lawsuit but that it had anticipated legal challenges and was confident the legislation had a ""strong legal basis.""
""Big Tech is in some ways more powerful than government, and certainly less accountable. Free speech is a sacred right for all Americans,"" she said.
Former President Donald Trump, also a Republican, remains blocked on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after the platforms banned or suspended him over risks of further violence following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters. The ban added to Republicans' long-standing accusations that online platforms censor content due to anti-conservative bias.
Florida is the first state to regulate how social media companies moderate online speech. The new law would also make it easier for Florida's attorney general and others in the state to sue the tech companies over claims that platforms have imposed content moderation on users unfairly or inconsistently. 

It has been criticized by internet law experts as unconstitutional and as pre-empted by Section 230, a federal law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users. 
The law exempts companies that own and operate a ""theme park or entertainment venue"" of more than 25 acres, such as Disney's theme park in the state.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday as better-than-expected jobless claims data and a positive report on first-quarter gross domestic product showed that economic recovery is gathering steam.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 406,000 for the week ended May 22, according to the U.S. Labor Department, as layoffs subsided, with companies desperate for workers to meet surging demand unleashed by a rapidly reopening economy.
That was the lowest since mid-March 2020 and kept claims below 500,000 for three straight weeks. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 425,000 applications for the latest week.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday confirmed economic growth accelerated at a 6.4% annualized rate last quarter, thanks to the massive fiscal stimulus. 
The data, which was unrevised from the estimate reported last month, was the second-fastest GDP growth since the third quarter of 2003.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.6028% from 1.574% late on Wednesday.
""This is the first time that continuing jobless claims beat expectations and it shows that more people are starting to go back to work and this is very positive for the economy,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.41% to 34,464.64, the S&P 500 gained 0.12% to 4,200.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.01% to 13,736.28.

Multiple Federal Reserve officials made comments this week to calm inflation worries and signal a possible start to talks to end the central bank's bond buying program.
Vice Chair Richard Clarida said this week recent inflation pressures would ""prove to be largely transitory,"" though he added that policymakers will be at a point to begin discussing tapering in upcoming meetings.
The Fed Vice Chair for supervision, Randal Quarles, suggested that at some stage it will become important for the U.S. central bank to discuss plans to tighten its asset purchase programme. 
The dollar index traded in a narrow range on Thursday as traders still looked toward an upcoming inflation report closely watched by Federal Reserve. The index was down 0.075%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Swiss bank Julius Baer will pay $79.7 million in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice after being implicated in a sprawling corruption probe surrounding FIFA, the world's soccer governing body.
Julius Baer's three-year deferred prosecution agreement on Thursday resolves a money laundering conspiracy charge, and calls for the Zurich-based bank to pay a $43.3 million criminal fine and forfeit $36.4 million.
The Justice Department said the forfeiture represents bribes that marketing executives paid soccer officials in exchange for broadcasting rights to soccer matches including the World Cup, and which a former Julius Baer banker helped launder.
Julius Baer ""turned a blind eye to glaring red flags of money laundering,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Mark Lesko in Brooklyn, New York, said in a statement. 
The agreement was accepted by U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn, after Julius Baer's general counsel pleaded not guilty on the bank's behalf.
No further punishment will be imposed if the bank complies with the agreement's terms. Julius Baer had previously set aside funds to cover the payout.
Switzerland's third-largest listed bank has said it has cooperated with the Justice Department since 2015, upgraded its compliance controls and dismissed some clients.
The Justice Department unveiled the FIFA probe in April 2015.
More than 40 defendants have been charged, and at least 30 have pleaded guilty.
The former Julius Baer banker, Jorge Arzuaga, was sentenced in November to three years probation after pleading guilty to a conspiracy charge.
Arzuaga was accused of helping an Argentine sports marketing executive pay bribes to Julio Grondona, who was then president of Argentina's soccer federation and also a FIFA vice president. Grondona died in 2014.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA has also imposed penalties for Julius Baer's anti-money laundering shortfalls, ordering the bank to improve its controls and appoint an auditor, and reprimanding two former chief executives.
FINMA lifted a ban on Julius Baer making large acquisitions in March.

1109,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2021 04:27PM ET</span>",Senate Nears Passage of Bill to Confront China’s Economic Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate moved toward passage Thursday of an expansive bill to bolster U.S. economic competitiveness and confront China’s rise, debating some last amendments before a final vote.
The legislation cleared an initial procedural vote after a deal was struck between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republicans on considering some additions to the bill. That cleared the way for the Senate to meet Schumer’s goal of passing the legislation before senators left Washington for a scheduled week-long break.
The bill, which has bipartisan support in the Senate, would plow more than $100 billion into U.S. research and development and provide $52 billion to foster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It also includes a wide array of measures directly targeting China -- on human rights and its influence in the U.S. -- underscoring the bipartisan angst over the rise of the strategic rival.
The procedural vote was delayed for several hours as Republicans demanded their amendments get put before the Senate. Schumer said the Senate already has voted on 18 amendments, 14 of them from GOP senators.
“It’s time to move forward together and pass this bill,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. “We can finish the bill today.”
Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell responded that while his party wanted their amendments considered, “Republicans don’t want a big fight over this.”
At the center of the delay was an amendment from Republican Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho that he sponsored with Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. It takes aim at trade imbalances between the U.S. and China, as well as other countries and was expecting it to be included in the final package. Schumer had excluded it because, he said, it wasn’t germane to the underlying bill.
“It expands and strengthens our trade posture, not just vis-a-vis China, but our trade posture globally,” Crapo said. “I think it’s one of the most critical things we could do here.”
He said he wasn’t sure whether it had enough votes to be added to the legislation.
Other senators were seeking consideration of their amendments as well. But only Crapo’s and one from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on security measures to help protect U.S. intellectual property from theft were considered. Rubio’s amendment was tabled.
While the legislation has broad bipartisan backing in the Senate, the House is still working on its own version and it could be tougher to muster enough support for a final bill. Both parties in the House are deeply divided over how to best to get tougher on competitiveness with China.

Officials at PSEG Long Island, a unit of New Jersey energy company Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) Inc were not immediately available for comment.
Isaias knocked out power to more than 4.3 million homes and businesses from North Carolina to Quebec - some for several days - including over 320,000 on Long Island.
This is not the first time a storm has gotten a company managing LIPA's power lines into trouble.
PSEG Long Island took over the operation of LIPA's system in 2014 from a unit of UK energy company  National Grid  (LON:NG) PLC, following National Grid's failure to restore power quickly after Hurricane Sandy.
PSEG Long Island provides service to 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
LIPA has said it is considering several different options for its power system, including selling assets to private investors, resetting the PSEG Long Island relationship, contracting with a new service provider or putting utility operations under LIPA management.
LIPA said it was still in talks with PSEG Long Island on a reformed contract.
LIPA asked companies interested in operating all or some of its system to respond by July 19.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 was eked out a gain Thursday, powered by a General-Electric-led rally in industrials, while signs of an improving labor market kept the reopening trade alive as the broader market is on track for a weekly gain.
The S&P 500 rose 0.12%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.41%, or 414 points, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.01%.
Industrials were up more than 1%, led by gains in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) as the recovery in the aviation sector continued to take shape. Aircraft maker Airbus unveiled a plan to ramp up production of its A320 models per month to 64 by the second quarter of 2023.
Sentiment on the broader cyclicals sector including materials continues to be supported by data signaling an ongoing improvement in the labor market as jobless claims fell to a new pandemic low.
Initial jobless claims fell 38,000 to 406,0000 in the week ending May 22, the lowest level since March 2020. That topped economists estimates for a decline to 425,000.  
""There was a big downward shift in claims in the beginning of April that came as a result of more progression in the reopening process. Since that big drop during the week of April 10, claims have been grinding lower, week by week,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Financial were also in the ascendency, with regional banks racking up gains following a renewed ride higher in rates as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 1.6%.
Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) were among the biggest sector gainers.
In tech, meanwhile, chip stocks gave up some gains following weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Nvidia's first-quarter results topped expectations, and the chipmaker raised guidance on revenue, but doubts about how much growth was led by hardware demand from cryptocurrency miners flagged concerns about sustainability.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) was up more than 4% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.
 Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY), meanwhile, rose 1% after lifting its outlook on full-year comparable sales and reporting quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Energy, struggled to advance weighed down by a slip in the oil majors including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) after losing at least two board seats to activist investor Engine No .1 over its climate strategy.
""While the majority of the board will still be XOM-chosen, this historic defeat is a clear signal that shareholders want to see XOM do more to address climate … which could spark change at the company,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said.

(Reuters) - Reuters News postponed the launch of its website paywall following a dispute with financial data provider Refinitiv over whether the move would breach a news supply agreement between the two companies. 
Reuters, a unit of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, had been planning to start charging for news on Reuters.com from June 1. It was not immediately clear how long the delay would last.
In a staff meeting on Thursday, Reuters Editor-in-Chief Alessandra Galloni confirmed that the news agency had paused the launch of the website paywall as well as the introduction of a new legal news section on the website, while discussions with Refinitiv to resolve the dispute were ongoing. 
In a statement, a Reuters spokesman said, ""We are still working through our plans for the relaunch of Reuters.com as a subscription service."" Discussions with Refinitiv were ""about our business approach and products, and how we can enhance our offer to all customers,"" the spokesman said. 
 London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) Plc, the parent of Refinitiv, said discussions were ongoing. ""The foundation of our partnership is strong and we will continue to work together to deliver for all of our customers,"" it said in a statement. 
The postponement is a setback for Reuters’ plans to build new sources of revenue via its website and raises questions about the news agency’s relationship with its biggest customer. Refinitiv accounts for about half of Reuters' revenue. Reuters derives most of its remaining revenue from its media agency operations, as well as its growing events business. 
Refinitiv was part of Thomson Reuters until private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc acquired a majority stake in it in 2018. Blackstone and Thomson Reuters subsequently sold Refinitiv to the LSE, closing the deal in January this year.
As part of its initial separation, Refinitiv struck a 30-year news agreement with Reuters. Refinitiv competes with Bloomberg and other news and data providers to banks and other financial institutions, and Reuters News has long been a key distinguishing factor for the business. 

Under the agreement, Reuters is guaranteed annual payments of at least $336 million to provide news and editorial content to Refinitiv until 2048.
In April, Reuters announced it would plan to charge $34.99 a month for access to its website, which has been available for free. Reuters chief marketing officer Josh London called the launch ""the largest digital transformation at Reuters in a decade.""

Industrials were higher thanks to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) (book that flight!), materials were supported by jobless claims at a new pandemic low (McD's is offering free iPhones to new hires!) and financials rode Treasury yield rates higher (cha-ching!).    
Energy and tech, on the other hand, were less inspired. 
Meme stocks were back in the news, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) soaring as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said retail investor trades are here to stay. 
We'll get another view into inflation tomorrow, and the lucky ducks at Citi will get a four-day weekend. Enjoy the unofficial start to summer.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Inflation
Following the jump in CPI earlier this month, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation is set to spike in April. The core PCE deflator is expected to jump to 2.9% from 1.8%. In other economic data, personal income is set to slide 14.3% as stimulus checks disappear, and personal spending is expected to gain 0.5%. Those are all due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Budgeting
Floated earlier today, Joe Biden's fiscal year 2022 budget is scheduled for official release. The $6 trillion behemoth would take federal spending to its highest levels since World War II. That is if it ever gets passed, which is unlikely given the Democrats' slim control of Congress.
3. A four-day weekend

Investing.com -- Matchmaking isn't for love alone. 
Nerdy, which runs the Varsity Tutors website, specializes in matching tutors and students using artificial intelligence to make the best connection. The company has seen sales boom over the past year and expects even more growth ahead. And it's about to go public via a special-purpose acquisition company owned and run by private equity giant TPG.
The company provides one-on-one tutoring, as well as free and paid group classes and self-guided study. It has 87,000 paid online active users and more than 500,000 free learners. The company is seeing an average compound growth rate of 45% in revenue, with sales expected to increase 30% from this year to next, and profit coming in 2023.
If the competition is any indication, Nerdy could be in for a good run. Rival  Chegg Inc  (NYSE:CHGG), which provides study help but not personalized live instruction, saw revenue rise through the pandemic as education technology firms gained relevance amid shutdowns and isolation. Shares of Chegg have about doubled since around the start of the pandemic, hitting a record early this year. 
Chief Executive Officer and Founder Chuck Cohn says Nerdy has a unique model that will help it stand out. ""Our superpower is high quality scaled live instruction, that's what nobody else has ever done before,"" he said in a video interview this month. 
Nerdy has a market capitalization of $1.7 billion, and reported 100% growth in online revenue for the first quarter versus a year earlier.  Active learner growth increased 67% and paid sessions increased 186% year-over-year. Paid sessions per active expert increased 60% year-over-year, and demand appears to be increasing with a return to in-person activities.
Its merger with TPG Pace Tech Opportunities Corp (NYSE:PACE) could be completed by July. SPACs had a strong run in the first three months of 2021, with the total number of mergers quickly surpassing all of 2020. Issuances slowed after the Securities and Exchange Commission published accounting guidance that, if made law, would force pending and existing SPACs to recalculate their financials for the value of warrants each quarter, CNBC reported. That could result in balance sheets with more liabilities than equity.
They're starting to make a comeback, though, according to SPAC Research, and particularly those with private investment commitments from name-brand investors. In the case of Nerdy, TPG has raised $150 million from Franklin Templeton, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Koch Industries and Learn Capital, among others. And unlike some SPACs, this one actually has sales that are growing at a fast clip.
""We have a great business,"" Cohn said. ""We're not a flying car company with zero dollars of revenue.""
Nerdy was born, as so many startups are, out of personal need. About 14 years ago, Cohn was studying calculus 2 at Washington University, and desperately needed help. He was convinced he was going to fail the course because he couldn't find a tutor. Eventually, two friends came to the rescue, but the idea that high-quality tutoring was badly needed and hard to find stuck with him.
""There was an inherent discovery problem in the market,"" Cohn said. He borrowed $1,000 from his parents and worked nights and weekends on his project, posting flyers in coffee shops, for three years while keeping his day job in private equity. The big differential at Nerdy is the level of expertise and the technology to match teaching and learning styles for the best outcome, Cohn said. 
The company's just getting started. With about $300 million on the balance sheet expected from the SPAC merger, Nerdy will continue to improve on its products, and will look at acquisitions. Cohn noted there are some 5,000 tutoring companies in the U.S., on top of the 1 million to 2 million independent tutors.
""We're gonna have enough cash"" that the company can go on the offensive, Cohn said.

AT&T announced last week that it would spin off its media assets and merge them with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, ending the wireless carrier's ambitious foray into media, and raising questions about Kilar's future at the company.
""My plan and my focus is to remain here in my CEO role at WarnerMedia,"" Kilar said during the meeting. ""I am not thinking right now about post-merger. There will be a time to consider that topic in 2022.""
""Because I believe we have unfinished business and the work of the next year can and should be extremely fulfilling as the world continues to see what we are capable of doing,” Kilar added.
The new company to be formed by WarnerMedia and Discovery will be led by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, which will comprise one of Hollywood's most powerful studios, including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, news network CNN, sports programming and Discovery's unscripted home, cooking, and nature and science shows.
On a call with reporters after the deal had been announced, executives said details about Kilar’s future had yet to be worked out. Executives also said they have yet to work out how the companies’ combined properties and services will be arranged.

The deal is expected to close in mid-2022, pending approval by Discovery shareholders and regulatory approvals.

Sberbank is diversifying in areas ranging from food delivery and taxi services to cloud computing and cyber security, and has made technological strides, last year unveiling a new virtual assistant, smart speaker and other gadgets.
FLIP is the size of a conventional passenger car but with space for six passengers, SberAutoTech said. 
It has met the maximum requirement of international automated driving standards, but so far has only been tested on closed tracks.
SberAutoTech did not disclose how much it had invested in the project or any details about prices, suppliers or its expected production timeline. 
Replaceable batteries power the vehicle's electric motor, but it can also harness the power of alternative fuels like natural gas and hydrogen, SberAutoTech said. 
""The company's know-how is the battery layout, which allows for all modules to be replaced in no more than five minutes, comparable to refilling a standard car with traditional fuel,"" the company said in a statement. 
""The flexible architecture of SberAutoTech's self-driving technology will enable us to roll out solutions across a variety of verticals, like freight transport, last mile, and taxis,"" said Sberbank Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovksy. 

The curved design, with no obvious front or rear, resembles the flying vehicles from the 1985 Soviet TV series 'Guest from the Future', which were also called 'Flip'. SberAutoTech did not say whether the film had inspired the design. 
Russian market leader  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) has already tested thousands of driverless hours in Russian cities and abroad, while its driverless robot buggies have started delivering restaurant meals in Moscow.

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Europe's Airbus urged suppliers to prepare industrially and financially for steep increases in jet output floated earlier on Thursday, and said the industry was returning towards pre-crisis trends for its most popular airplanes.
Airbus sees demand for single-aisle medium-haul jets like the A320neo as fundamentally strong, gradually resuming a trajectory seen before COVID-19 triggered production cuts.
""It is just there. The pent-up demand is very strong for those flights,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters in an interview
""That is why we are sharing (production scenarios) with them and we are asking them to be prepared, and they have the means to do that. There is a lot of liquidity in the market.""
Faury's comments came as Airbus firmed up plans for increased output in 2021 and issued a mix of firm targets and provisional scenarios that could almost double single-aisle output by 2025, sending its shares sharply higher.
Investors hailed a bounce-back for an industry battered by the pandemic, but several suppliers have talked of a standoff with Airbus about who should pay for investments needed to get single-aisle output back to pre-crisis levels and beyond.
Faury said the unusually detailed output plan would reassure suppliers that everyone was sharing the same burden.
""The aim is to give the supply chain a clear understanding...and make sure that they have no doubt that what we are asking them to prepare is consistent with what we are asking other suppliers to prepare,"" he said.
""I think we should not overestimate our level of confidence, but we should also not underestimate the fact that after the crisis it is no longer a crisis,"" he said.
Analysts say tough negotiations over the balance between upfront machinery investments and the promise of profits from future high volumes is common. But the discussion has intensified after the crisis hit finances of many suppliers.
'NORMAL BUSINESS'
""It's technically correct to say that there is a lot of liquidity in the capital markets,"" but that is not available to companies with high debt, responded a senior industry source.
""The banks look at the equity of the small suppliers and walk away,"" he added.
Faury noted that aircraft production had already achieved the rates being targeted in the short term.
""It is not the same kind of (industrial) challenge as the one we had in 2018 and 2019, entering 2020. We need to be back to where we were already before,"" he said, referring to past increases in production to reach record pre-crisis levels.
Many suppliers had also benefited from government support schemes during the crisis. 
""To some extent we are back to normal business, normal relationships and what needs to be done to secure the right level of production,"" he added.
Airbus has voiced concerns to suppliers about quality-control problems both before and during the crisis.
Faury urged suppliers to ""take the right measures"" to address this as it lays down increasing quality demands.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is flexing its supply chain too but not as quickly as Airbus as it deals with a stockpile of jets following the grounding of its 737 MAX, leaving Airbus in the lead. 
Some analysts say Boeing also appears to be taking a more cautious view on future demand, though Faury said the trends in demand identified by Airbus were visible across the industry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's $715 billion Department of Defense budget will shift funding from old systems to help modernize the nuclear arsenal to deter China, while also developing future warfare capabilities, people familiar with the budget said.
The defense spending request, which will be sent to Congress on Friday, is expected to contain investments in troop readyness, space, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative aimed at countering China's military build-up in the region and nuclear weapons technology, the people said.
The budget request would buy ships, jets and pay for maintenance and salaries, but an additional $38 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies bringing the national security budget to $753 billion, a 1.7% increase over the 2021 figure.
There will also be money to further develop and test of hypersonic weapons and other ""next generation"" weapons systems as the military aims to build capabilities to counter Russia and China.
President's budget requests, including those for the military, are commonly a starting point for negotiations with Congress which ultimately decides how funds are spent. 
The Pacific Deterrence Initiative, created to counter China, focuses on competition in the Indo-Pacific and aims to boost U.S. preparedness in the region through funding radars, satellites and missile systems.
To pay for this, people familiar with the shift said, the Pentagon is seeking to divest some of its older equipment with higher maintenance costs including four Littoral Combat Ships, several A-10 aircraft which provide close air support to ground troops, as well as the number of KC-10 and KC-135 planes in the mid-air refueling fleets. 
Tensions with an increasingly assertive China are on the minds of U.S. military planners. Bejing accused the United States last week of threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait after a U.S. warship again sailed through the sensitive waterway.
The U.S. Army's goal for troops in the budget was reduced very marginally, the people said.
""We must modernize if deterrence is to endure and, if confirmed, I would seek to increase the speed and scale of innovation in our force,"" Kathleen Hicks said in her testimony in February before she was confirmed as deputy secretary of defense.
Among the Pentagon's competing priorities, the Biden administration will request 85 stealthy F-35 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), the people said. The 2021 and 2020 presidential budgets requested 79 and 78 of the jets respectively, ultimately Congress authorized additional fighters. Senators and governors have come out to support the jet which has a huge industrial base.
The U.S. Navy's shipbuilding plan, published in the final months of the Trump administration, and had 12 new surface combatant ships for the 2022 budget. But the Biden request has only eight new warships, the people said. 

Despite shaving numbers from older systems the Biden administration will continue to invest in modernizing the U.S. nuclear triad, an expensive undertaking that will cost an average of more than $60 billion per year over this decade and more than a trillion dollars in total, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Funding will go to improve nuclear command and control as well as delivery platforms like the Columbia Class nuclear submarine made by Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) Industries and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and the certification to carry nuclear bombs aboard the stealthy F-35 jet fighters.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A private equity firm founder and onetime insurance executive who referred ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin and her husband to the mastermind behind the U.S. college admissions scandal was sentenced on Thursday to two months in prison and fined $250,000 for his role in the scheme.
Mark Hauser, 60, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock in Boston after pleading guilty in August to participating in the vast college admissions fraud scheme by paying $40,000 to rig his daughter’s ACT college entrance exam.
Hauser broke into tears as he apologized for his ""serious mistake"" and crimes that he said he engaged in to help a daughter who had faced ""never-ending medical challenges.""
""I was not trying to establish prestige for myself or my daughter,"" he said. ""My only concern was to help her catch her breath.""
Hauser's lawyers argued for probation. But Woodlock said Hauser deserved prison and the $250,000 fine so the public could be assured that ""nobody is free from the harshest aspects of the law.""
Hauser is one of 57 people charged in the scandal, in which prosecutors said parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to secure their children's college admissions through fraud and bribery.
The parents include Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who admitted to trying to secure spots for their daughters at the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits.
Prosecutors said Hauser referred Giannulli to Singer. Loughlin and Giannulli were sentenced last year to two months and five months in prison, respectively.

Hauser founded Cincinnati, Ohio-based Hauser Private Equity and owned the insurance firm Hauser Inc. In August, Brown & Brown (NYSE:BRO) pulled out of a $187 million deal to buy the insurer after Hauser's case became public.
Prosecutors said Hauser in 2016 agreed to pay Singer $40,000 to have an associate proctor his daughter's ACT exam at a test center in Texas that Singer controlled through bribery and secretly correct her answers.

This, along with the remote working culture, has amplified demand for digital real estate brokerage services. As a result, the shares of real-estate technology firm  Redfin  Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) have returned more than 90% over the past year. So, read ahead to learn whether RDFN is a good addition to one’s portfolio now or if it is susceptible to a retreat.Real estate has been one of the best performing industries amid the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to a surge in home buying. The Fed’s easy monetary policy and asset repurchases have pushed interest rates to historic lows, making real estate investments lucrative. Consequently, a shortage of inventory and endless bidding wars have driven property prices to unprecedented highs. The remote work culture has also motivated people to migrate to low-cost towns from expensive cities.
In addition, the pandemic pushed up demand for remote services and, hence, one factor that has worked in favor of real estate companies is the rapid adoption of digitalization. A case in point is tech-first real estate company Redfin Corporation (RDFN). RDFN operates a digital real estate marketplace that offers online residential broking services and allows homebuyers to schedule virtual home tours. The company also delivers ancillary services, such as loan origination and title services, to facilitate a speedy process.
On March 31, RDFN had a 1.14% U.S. market share by value. Driven by its unique business model and given the red-hot housing market, shares of RDFN have returned 92.2% over the past year. In fact, the stock registered a 5.2% intraday gain yesterday to close the session at $57.16.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – Shares of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shot up more than 6% Thursday as the company announced its third order win in two days, this one for supplying its Cypress onshore turbines for an 88 MW wind farm in Vietnam.
BIM Wind JSC, a joint venture company between Vietnam’s BIM Energy Holding and Philippines’ AC Energy, has placed the order with GE. It includes a 15-year full-service operations and maintenance contract.
The wind farm is expected to be commissioned by the end of third quarter of 2021. All turbines will be equipped with GE’s two-piece blade design.
Wednesday, GE said it will supply 16 of its 5.5 MW-158 Cypress turbines, its largest onshore wind turbine in the field, for the 88 MW Puskakorpi wind farm in Finland along with a 30-year full services agreement.
GE’s Cypress onshore wind platform enables higher energy savings. It includes power ratings between 4.8 and 6.1 MW, with 158 and 164-meter rotor diameters and various hub heights. It is equipped with both single piece and jointed blade variants.
In the other order win on Wednesday, GE said Austria’s largest electricity producer, VERBUND, has elected it to supply and commission one 45 MW generator for the extension of the Reisseck II pumped hydro storage power plant in Carinthia, located 2300 meters above sea level.
GE has been in the headlines lately for various reasons that include senior leadership changes, a reverse stock split and a $30 billion sale of its aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services, to Ireland’s AerCap.
In his May 15 upgrade, Citi (NYSE:C) analyst Andrew Kaplowitz put a buy on the stock, pegging his target at $17. The stock is still 21% away from Kaplowitz's target.
The analyst believes that while clean energy may not be a driver of the stock as yet, it could bring big upside if GE manages to grow its market share in wind turbines.

MOSCOW/PARIS (Reuters) -Belarusian national carrier Belavia cancelled flights to eight countries on Thursday, as more EU states applied airspace restrictions in response to the forced landing of a passenger jet in Minsk.
The tightening restrictions on Belarus came as its main ally Russia denied access to a second European carrier seeking to skirt Belarus en route to Moscow.
Belavia announced the cancellations ""due to flight bans from a number of countries"", after neighbouring Poland joined a growing list of territories that have barred it from flying over them, making more routes unviable.
""We regret that our passengers have to face this situation for reasons beyond the airline's control,"" Belavia said as it scrapped flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hanover, Kaliningrad, Milan, Munich, Rome, Vienna and Warsaw until Oct. 30.
The European Union urged its airlines to avoid Belarus and moved to close its own airspace to Belarusian carriers amid outrage over Sunday's interception of a Ryanair jet en route to Lithuania from Greece, and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board.
Belavia previously said it was banned from destinations in Britain, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Ukraine, most of which have also barred it from their airspace. Its neighbour Poland joined the list on Wednesday.
Belavia flights were still crossing Italy and Hungary on Thursday and serving EU destinations including Larnaca in Cyprus and Tallinn in Estonia, according to FlightRadar24 data. 
Cyprus officials said they were awaiting formal EU guidance on implementing the bans, and Estonia signalled imminent action.
""Belavia flights will not be accepted in Estonian airports, official decision later today,"" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted. ""Belarusian government has to take responsibility for its actions.""
RUSSIAN TENSIONS
Fallout from the Belarus standoff has sharpened tensions with Russia, whose vast airspace is hard to avoid for flights between Europe and much of Asia.
Moscow has so far refrained from heavy intervention as President Alexander Lukashenko's main ally.
But on Thursday Russia withheld clearance for an Austrian Airlines Vienna-Moscow flight plan avoiding Belarus - a day after failing to approve a revised Air France Paris-Moscow route. Both flights were cancelled.
""A change in flight routes must be approved by the authorities,"" said a spokesman for Lufthansa-owned Austrian Airlines. ""The Russian authorities did not give us this permit.""
Air France has cancelled a second Paris-Moscow flight scheduled for Friday after Russia failed to respond to another flight plan submission, the airline said.
Russia's civil aviation agency declined to comment. 
Other Air France-KLM and Lufthansa flights continue to cross Russian air space and serve destinations in the country unimpeded, both airline groups said. Lufthansa has successfully rerouted Frankfurt-Moscow flights around Belarus.

France, which was among the first countries to bar Belavia, turned away its Barcelona-bound flight 2869 on Wednesday, forcing a return to Minsk.
""This is a European diplomatic issue at ministerial level,"" a spokesman for the French DGAC civil aviation department said, declining further comment.

The recent volatility in the market provides a great opportunity to pick up shares on the dip. That's why Patrick Ryan is recommending Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC), Canfor (TSX:CFP) Corporation (CFPZF), and West Fraser Timber (WFG).Lumber prices tailed off last week after a considerable increase in the preceding months. However, the cost of lumber is jumping once again. As an example, 2x4s sold this past week for a record high of $1,640 per 1k-ft. board. This price level represents a climb of 340% in the past year. It is pretty clear that Americans and others cannot get enough lumber for housing, home improvement projects, and other needs.
If you are not invested in lumber stocks, you still have time to establish a position in one or more companies in the lumber space. The gigantic millennial age cohort is spearheading the housing push, ramping up demand for lumber all the more. Millennials are the largest age cohort in the United States, meaning the demand for housing-related lumber should hold strong for at least another half-decade, if not longer.
The question is not whether lumber will be in demand for the foreseeable future. Rather, the question is which specific stocks are the best to invest in to make money from the ever-spiking demand for wood. Three of the top lumber stocks are as follows: Boise Cascade (BCC), Canfor Corporation (CFPZF), and West Fraser Timber (WFG).

Because increasing IT spending is expected to drive demand for software, we think low-priced software stocks  Progress Software  (NASDAQ:PRGS) (PGRS), NetSol Technologies (NTWK), and Evolving Systems (EVOL) are well positioned to gain significantly in the near term. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.The software industry played a leading role in powering the stock market’s gains last year. But now, traders and investors are unnerved by indications of higher inflation and are moving away from expensive software stocks in fear of losses in the near term. The opportunity to capitalize on the economic recovery by betting on cheap cyclical stocks is another reason why software stocks have been retreating lately. This is evidenced by the Invesco Dynamic Software ETF’s (PSJ) 5.7%% loss over the past three months, compared to S&P 500’s (SPY) 10.2% gains.
Because most aspects of people’s lives and organizations' operations are now being digitized, the demand for software should continue to increase. With more organizations adopting cloud applications and products that could help their employees collaborate from afar and access data that are stored in remote data centers, there will likely be a substantial rise in IT spending going forward. Indeed, the global enterprise software market is expected to grow at an 8% CAGR to reach $634 billion by the end of 2023.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. opens criminal probe into alleged lapses at Eli Lilly plant - sources,"By Marisa Taylor, Mike Spector and Dan Levine
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co focused on alleged manufacturing irregularities and records tampering at a factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, that produces the pharmaceutical giant's COVID-19 therapy and other drugs, three people familiar with the matter said.
The probe represents a significant escalation of the government scrutiny on Lilly. The pharmaceutical company, one of the world's largest, has been under examination for more than a year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over alleged manufacturing and records violations at the Branchburg factory.
Reuters questioned Lilly about the criminal inquiry on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, the company disclosed in a securities filing that it had received a subpoena from the Justice Department in May seeking documents related to the Branchburg factory. 
The company did not disclose anything more about the nature or focus of the investigation and said it was cooperating fully in the matter.
Lilly said it had previously engaged external counsel to conduct an independent investigation of certain allegations relating to the Branchburg plant. The company submitted the same information Thursday to Reuters in response to the news agency’s questions.
""Lilly is deeply committed to manufacturing high-quality medicines for patients who need them, and the safety and quality of our products is our highest priority,"" the company said.
The Justice Department inquiry follows a Reuters report in March that a Lilly human resources officer alleged she had been forced out of her job https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elililly-special-report/special-report-insider-alleges-eli-lilly-blocked-her-efforts-to-sound-alarms-about-u-s-drug-factory-idUSKBN2B31K5 at the factory after undertaking internal investigations of employee complaints about manufacturing lapses, falsified or destroyed records and staff shortages. 
In April, employees accused a factory executive of altering FDA-required documents in order to downplay problems, according to an unsigned internal complaint reviewed by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-lilly-hit-by-staff-accusations-fda-scrutiny-covid-drug-factories-2021-05-05/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=twitter.
The company previously told Reuters that none of the issues flagged by FDA inspectors affected the quality of medicines released to doctors and patients. Lilly also has denied retaliating against any employees.
The Justice Department inquiry, which involves U.S. prosecutors and other officials in New Jersey and Washington, began in recent weeks, the three people said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is participating in the probe, they said.
A spokesman for the New Jersey U.S. attorney's office declined to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. Justice Department and FDA representatives in Washington had no immediate comment on the probe. The FBI declined to comment. 
The investigation is in its earliest stages, the three people told Reuters, and the Justice Department has not accused Lilly or any of its employees of wrongdoing. The department could ultimately pursue criminal charges, seek civil sanctions or close the probe without taking action.
Investigators have not zeroed in on specific legal violations that could form the backbone of a case, one of the sources said.
Steven Lynn, a former head of the FDA's Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality, said the federal government rarely seeks criminal charges stemming from manufacturing violations unless those lapses are extremely serious and the company does little to fix them.
“This is a big deal,” Lynn said of the Justice Department decision to launch a criminal probe of Lilly, echoing three industry and regulatory experts interviewed by Reuters.
‘OFFICIAL ACTION INDICATED’
In November 2019, FDA inspectors arrived at the Branchburg plant for an inspection and found that quality control data had been deleted and not appropriately audited, Reuters has reported. The plant produced blockbuster diabetes drug Trulicity as well as several cancer medications. 
Federal documents show the FDA cited the problems in March 2020 as “Official Action Indicated,” or OAI, which is its most serious category of violation. If not addressed, an OAI can lead to a prohibition on the sale of drugs from a facility, regulatory experts say. The FDA has not taken further public action.
Inspectors returned in July and found several more problems. Among them: Batches of drugs had been discarded because of manufacturing mistakes and quality control problems were not being properly investigated by the company to prevent recurrence. 
In response to a Reuters open records request, the FDA in May released two Lilly memos responding to the problems that the agency’s inspectors found in New Jersey. Lilly told the FDA it takes the agency’s findings “very seriously” and understands “the criticality of data integrity across the entirety of our operations,” a September 2020 Lilly memo said.
The FDA declined to release additional records about the New Jersey plant, saying it is “information compiled for law enforcement purposes” and disclosure could interfere with such proceedings.
In October, the Trump administration ordered $375 million worth of Lilly’s COVID-19 antibody therapy bamlanivimab, which is manufactured in Branchburg. Shortly afterward, the FDA authorized the drug’s use on an emergency basis to help curb the pandemic. Bamlanivimab is now combined with a second Lilly drug, called etesevimab, to treat COVID-19.
A condition of the emergency authorization was that an outside auditor inspect batches of bamlanivimab to ensure they met FDA standards. Lilly and the FDA have not responded to questions from Reuters about whether this requirement was met.
Reuters reported in March that a former Lilly human resources officer, Amrit Mula, had identified internally some of the same violations later documented by the FDA. Mula was forced out of the company in early 2019 after Lilly executives sought to downplay her findings, according to a letter demanding compensation for damages that her attorneys sent to the company in December 2019. The attorneys argued the company retaliated against Mula for raising legitimate concerns as part of her job.
In April, a group of Lilly employees in New Jersey asserted in an internal complaint that a top quality executive at the Branchburg factory, Lydia Wible, rewrote findings by Lilly technical experts to make the conclusions appear more favorable to the company. Wible did not respond to a request for comment sent Wednesday.
Lilly confirmed the existence of the internal complaint about Wible to Reuters, and said it had referred the matter for investigation to an outside party. It did not name that entity.

An internal Lilly response to the employee complaint, reviewed by Reuters, shows that the company hired the Washington-based law firm Covington & Burling LLP to investigate the matter.
Gerald Masoudi, a Covington partner who once served as FDA’s chief counsel, is collecting information from employees, the document shows. He did not respond to questions from Reuters.

(Reuters) -A majority of FirstGroup shareholders on Thursday backed the bus and train firm's 3.3 billion pound ($4.7 billion) sale of its U.S. assets to EQT (NYSE:EQT) Infrastructure, in a blow to activist investor Coast Capital which led opposition to the deal.
Some 61.3% of votes cast at the shareholder meeting supported the sale of FirstGroup's largest divisions, whose activities include operating thousands of yellow school buses. The British company needed the support of at least half of all votes cast.
Top investor Coast launched a campaign a couple of weeks ago to block the sale to the Swedish private equity fund, arguing it undervalued the assets, and demanded FirstGroup give more of the proceeds to shareholders.
U.S. hedge fund Coast was joined by number two shareholder  Schroders  (LON:SDR) in the minority opposing the deal on Thursday.
FirstGroup, which plans to use most of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and contribute to its UK pension schemes, has earmarked 365 million pounds to be distributed to shareholders.
Peel Hunt analyst Alexander Paterson said more could be handed out to investors as the group's new Transpennine Express contract in northern England was much less costly than under a worst case scenario.
FirstGroup plans to convene a general meeting, if necessary, after the deal closes to seek investors' approval over the proposed return of cash to shareholders.
""A share buyback may be more tax efficient or preferable for some shareholders and if that is the chosen route, it would probably require a shareholder vote,"" Paterson said.
The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.
While EQT welcomed the vote, Coast founding partner James Rasteh said he was concerned fellow shareholders made their decision without complete information and the fund was considering its options.
With the sale of First Student and First Transit, the Aberdeen-based company will focus on its UK networks.
It is also still looking for a buyer for its Greyhound U.S. bus operations.
Coast had been pressuring FirstGroup to sell its U.S. assets since 2019, with FirstGroup eventually starting a formal sale process in early 2020.
Thursday's result marks a second failure for Coast, which in 2019 tried and failed to oust former FirstGroup Chairman Wolfhart Hauser and overhaul the board.

Shares in the London-listed company, which have made little progress since the sale announcement last month, were up 0.4% at 1520 GMT.

RBC Capital Markets bumped shares to a buy-equivalent from a neutral-equivalent after the company announced a turnaround plan calling for investment of more than $30 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years. Ford is aiming to have electric vehicles represent 40% of sales by 2030.  
Analyst Joseph Spak said the plan addressed concerns about the company’s pivot to electric vehicles, CNBC reported. “Bottom-line, we feel much better about the more cohesive strategy as Ford is focusing on their strengths,"" Spak said. ""Ford still needs to execute, but the upside opportunity is clearer to us.""
Shares of the carmaker have rallied almost 200% since the pandemic hit last year. While the rally has been strong, it pales in comparison to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is up some 340% in that time.
Spak increased the price target to $17 from $4, alongside  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) bumped the price target to $16, according to StreetInsider.
A new suite of products called ""Ford Pro"" should help the company strengthen its already solid position in work trucks and increase profitability, Spak said.
Ford is setting up for significant upside in the long-term, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",Ford halts southern India plant production as pandemic surges,"By Sudarshan Varadhan
CHENNAI (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said it will halt production at its car plant in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu after workers staged a lunchtime sit-in protest on Thursday, demanding leave and health benefits, as the country battles the coronavirus.
The automaker will stop work at its Chennai plant on Friday and Saturday as it continues to engage with the union on other health and safety demands, Ford said in a statement.
""The safety of our workforce remains our topmost priority,"" a Ford India spokesman said, adding that the plant had been shut from May 14-May 22 at the behest of workers.
The sit-in protest is the latest expression of discontent and reluctance among factory employees in the southern state, home to India's flourishing automobile industry, to work amid a surge in virus infections.
On Wednesday, the Chennai Ford Employees Union expressed concern in a letter to management after 230 workers caught the virus.
""The company should pay all medical expenses of workers affected by the coronavirus,"" the union said in Wednesday's letter, reviewed by Reuters, and called for the plant to be shut until the state government removes lockdown restrictions.
It also sought compensation of 10 million rupees ($137,890) each for the families of two workers who died of the virus.
The union was still in discussion with the company about its demands, one of the sources said.
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), as well as its alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co, halted production earlier this week in Tamil Nadu. 
With more than 30,000 cases a day, Tamil Nadu is one of the states worst hit in India's second devastating wave of infections. Factories turning out automobiles are among those it has allowed to stay open during lockdown.
Ford has two car manufacturing plants in India to meet domestic and export needs.

The Tamil Nadu facility, with annual capacity of 200,000 units, makes the EcoSport and Endeavour sport-utility vehicles.
The other, in the western state of Gujarat, can produce 240,000 cars a year.

(Reuters) -Top U.S. dollar stores on Thursday gave tepid full-year profit forecasts, weighed down by higher transportation costs, even as a stimulus check-driven boost in spending helped them post better-than-expected quarterly sales.
 Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)'s shares dropped about 7%, as it forecast freight costs to be up as much as 80 cents per share for the rest of the year, compared with 2020.
Increasing freight costs caused by port congestions and global supply-chain disruptions have dented profit outlooks across industries, including that of apparel sellers Abercrombie & Fitch Co as well as many U.S. packaged goods makers.
""With regards to freight, the market conditions have continued to deteriorate since our update in March,"" Dollar Tree Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wampler told analysts on a post-earnings call.
The company is also facing wages-related pressure from labor shortages at its stores and distribution centers, Wampler added.
The operator of Family Dollar stores forecast its fiscal 2021 earnings to range between $5.80 per share and $6.05 per share, below Refinitiv IBES estimates of $6.24.
Meanwhile, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) raised its forecast for fiscal 2021 profit to be between $9.50 and $10.20 per share. But analysts' estimate of $9.58 were closer to the low end of the forecast.
Dollar General executives also warned of a hit to its profit margins from higher discounting as well as increased freight and labor costs.

Still both dollar stores' first-quarter results soared past market expectations on increased spending by consumers, armed with stimulus checks, on everything from apparel to home goods.
Dollar General also raised its forecast for full-year sales as the company's efforts in sharpening its focus on the higher-margin non-consumables category paid off. The retailer's shares rose about 2%.

Taylor Dart explains why its fundamentals continue to improve and point to a strong second half.It’s been a volatile month in the markets, and fortunately, for the silver bulls, this volatility has been to the upside. In an abrupt change of events, silver (SLV) has easily outperformed the S&P-500 (SPY) over the past month, up 7% for the month of May vs. the S&P-500’s 1% return. This outperformance bodes well for the precious metals complex, but the bears have managed to keep a lid on silver, for the time being, playing strong defense at the $28.90/oz to $29.30/oz resistance level. If this resistance level is broken on a monthly close, silver has lots of room towards the $35.00/oz level. However, until we have a clear breakout, the best course of action looks to be trading the range or holding best of breed miners like GoGold Resources (GLGDF).
(Source: TC2000.com)
As shown in the chart above, SLV continues to struggle with the $26.35 - $26.70 zone, and the price of silver has been unable to get through the corresponding $28.90/oz to $29.30/oz resistance zone. The good news is that the metal does not have caution bars (orange and red bars) as it approaches this strong resistance area for the fourth time in the past two years, suggesting that the next major test of this resistance level near $29.00/oz could lead to a successful breakout. This view is corroborated by sentiment, which is shown below.

As leading players in this space, we think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) should continue benefiting even in the post-pandemic environment because they are fine-tuning their operations to deliver goods even more quickly and efficiently. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Retail behemoths Amazon, Inc. (AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (WMT) have long been battling for the crown of the e-commerce king. While WMT remains the top dog in the global physical retailer space, its focus on expanding omni-channel retailing has allowed it to compete with AMZN’s strong grasp on the e-commerce market. Despite AMZN's mammoth presence and massive market share, WMT has been able to restructure its operations to better position its brand in the e-commerce marketplace.
AMZN and WMT achieved unprecedented business ascendance as consumers and businesses increasingly went digital amid the “new normal” ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. A big uptick in online shopping and massive omni-channel marketing strategies have contributed to these companies’ double-digit gains. Because the trend of spending more time on smartphones, browsing through retail platforms, and searching online for discount deals is expected to continue, both AMZN and WMT should generate increasing revenues.
AMZN has gained 34.8% over the past year, while WMT has returned 14.8%. But in terms of their past three month’s performance, WMT surpassed AMZN’s 5.6% with 9.4% gains. So, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Let’s find out.Roblox Corporation (RBLX) develops and operates an online entertainment platform that leverages its various offerings, such as Roblox Client and Roblox Studio, which have 3D features, and Roblox Cloud, among others.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing – AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) shares jumped 16% Thursday, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) discovered that the stock has replaced GameStop (NYSE:GME) as the top Reddit trend on WallStreet Bets.
Joining the meme-stock party, according to BofA, is Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), a provider of plant-based meat substitutes. That stock rose 11%.
AMC, GameStop, and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) have been part of the meme stocks gang which has a devoted following on Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
GameStop, so far a darling of the Reddit group, was down 2%, while Koss was up as much.
The story mostly began in January, when some Reddit followers decided to take on the big hedge funds who were short on GameStop. That unexpected coming together of widely distributed retail investors resulted in a short squeeze in the stock and created trouble for the institutional traders. One even went under.
Since then, the battle between the big institutional guys and the small retailer traders has waged on.
In the process, all doomsday projections of small investors playing with fire have come to naught, and meme stocks have continued to stay at elevated levels.
Few gave GameStop a chance as the video game retailer struggled against the online players in the last year. It has revamped its management, brought in new people to head key operations and pivoted to an online avatar and continues to stay in the hunt.
AMC survived a year of pandemic shutdowns and is today trading at 52-week high. The multiplex operator raised $428 million in equity at an average price of $9.94 per share in May. The shares have more than doubled since.

(Reuters) -Three of Canada's top lenders reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Thursday, as signs of an economic recovery helped them reverse bad debt provisions and their capital markets and wealth management units boomed.
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) have largely avoided major increases in loan impairments and expectations for strong economic growth look likely to keep a lid on them.
But their results masked some challenges, including flat net interest margins, little to no commercial loan growth and the impact of a strong Canadian dollar. 
Particularly at TD, earnings excluding the impact of provisions and taxes fell 16.8%, compared with increases of 14% and 11% at CIBC and RBC respectively.
The impact of the strong Canadian dollar and higher payments to retail partners in its U.S. credit card business weighed on earnings, TD Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in an interview. 
TD shares fell 0.7% from Wednesday's record close to C$88.19 in morning trading in Toronto. Royal Bank shares rose 1.05% to C$125.70, and CIBC gained 2.7% to C$140.83, both all-time highs. The Toronto stock benchmark added 0.3%.
""At first look we see TD’s Q2 EPS beat as lower quality relative to the bank’s peers,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Mike Rizvanovic wrote in a note. 
In contrast, RBC had a ""solid quarter overall"" and CIBC had ""strength across each operating segment"" although the latter's margin compression in domestic lending was a modest concern, he said. 
While RBC, Canada's biggest bank, also felt some currency hit in translating earnings from its U.S. City National business, it was offset to some degree by the impact on expenses, executives said on an analyst call. 
RBC released C$260 million ($216 million) from its loan-loss reserves in the second quarter, compared with provisions of C$2.1 billion a year earlier. CIBC reported an almost 98% fall in provisions, while TD recovered C$373 million of funds set aside to cover bad loans. 
Analysts had expected average core earnings per share for Canada's top six lenders to more than double in the three months through April from a year earlier when they set aside nearly C$11 billion to cover potential bad loans.
CIBC and RBC also benefited from a surge in deal-making and trading activity that boosted their capital markets businesses, with the latter reporting record revenue in investment banking.
TD's wholesale banking revenue fell 8% from a year earlier on lower trading revenues, although non-interest income was boosted 6% by wealth and banking fees. 

RBC posted adjusted earnings per share of C$2.79, compared with a Refinitiv IBES estimate of C$2.48 a share. CIBC's net income excluding one-off items was C$3.59, beating estimates of $3.01 a share. TD, Canada's second-largest lender, posted adjusted net earnings of C$2.04, exceeding estimates of C$1.76 per share.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",Biden trade czar 'optimistic' U.S.-EU aircraft subsidy spat to end soon,"By Andrea Shalal and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she is optimistic that the United States and Europe can settle a longstanding dispute over aircraft subsidies, leaving them free to focus on larger issues, including China's nascent aircraft industry.
Tai, who is working to reset trade ties with allies across the world after former President Donald Trump's tariff wars, declined to give any details about her talks with the European Union and Britain on the dispute, but struck an upbeat tone.
""It's impossible to predict the organic development of any negotiation. But I want to underscore how optimistic I am,"" Tai told Reuters in an interview late Wednesday. ""We are giving it everything we've got. I also feel confident that that is being reciprocated across the table.""
The European Union's trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis last week said Brussels and Washington were working to resolve the dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers by July 10.
Both sides agreed in March to suspend tariffs on billions of dollars of imports in a 16-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA). The suspension runs until July 10, with tariffs re-applying on July 11 if there is no solution
Asked how close the two sides were, Tai said simply, ""fingers crossed.""
She said she was encouraged by Dombrovskis' leadership and partnership, and would do everything in her power to create the ""maximum conditions for success.""
""It took 16 years, but we finally got here. I just want to preserve every opportunity for us to come to a good outcome,"" she said, noting that China had made no secret of its ambitions to become a global player in the commercial aircraft industry.
She added that in the face of this challenge, the U.S. and EU need to ""figure out the things that have kept us at each other’s throats for a very long time so that we can turn our attention to the bigger question.""
METALS TARIFFS
Tai and her European counterparts declared a partial truce in a three year dispute over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, agreeing not to escalate retaliatory duties.
Dombrovskis said U.S. metals tariffs and the EU's initial retaliatory duties from 2018 should be removed as soon as possible, adding that the two sides were working on doing this by the end of 2021.
Tai, who meets virtually with her counterparts from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies this week, said tariffs had gotten a lot of attention, but she was focused on formulating a new vision, more worker-centered vision for the global economy.

Asked if Washington would remove steel and aluminum tariffs as Europe expects, Tai said the bigger problem was global market distortion, a reference to overproduction by China. She has insisted that any solution to the metals tariff dispute be tied to a solution to global excess production capacity driven by China. 
""We are in the early days on this one, but let me reiterate my sense of optimism that I do see the kind of partnership that we feel like we’ll need from the European Union,"" she said.

Eli Lilly is also under pressure due to quality control, production and regulatory issues at its Indianapolis plant, which bottles bamlanivimab, among other drugs.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:47AM ET</span>","Late to the party, London rushes to win SPAC listings","By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is rushing out rules to make London's stock market attractive for 'blank cheque' listing vehicles as bankers ready a string of potential floats in Europe as interest in the U.S. fades. 
Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) have been the biggest trend in global capital markets in 2020 and 2021, with investors pouring more than $300 billion into listing these shell companies before they identify and acquire a business - effectively writing a blank cheque. They offer target companies an easier, quicker listing route at a guaranteed price at a time when many IPOs have failed.
So far, the frenzy has passed by Europe's biggest financial centre, partly because its rules don't allow investors more of a say on the acquisition or the option to take out their money if they don't like the target company. But now Britain, trying to keep the City of London competitive after Brexit, is on the cusp of changing that. 
Bankers say several SPAC candidates are waiting in the wings for a London float once new rules come in, by ""early summer"" according to the Financial Conduct Authority.
""I would probably say we will have 30-40 spacs across Europe in 2021 and London is a big part of that if the rules are adjusted in time,"" said Lyle Schwartz, co-head of alternative equity products at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Europe, their unit that looks after SPAC listings. 
The depth of international liquidity in London's markets and wide choice of acquisitions would be a draw. 
Schwartz said around 30 potential SPAC sponsors, who are generally well-known, deep pocketed institutions or individuals, are in discussions with regulators in Europe and about a dozen of them are now engaging with potential investors. 
Time is of the essence as the market for SPACs in the U.S. is already losing momentum with the prospect of rising interest rates, a saturated market and a general shift away from so-called ""growth"" sector investments. 
The fear is that Europe has ""come to the party while everyone is getting taxis to go home,"" said Tom Matthews, a partner at White & Case in London. 
""We have been a bit green with envy at all the activity across the pond, but that said I do believe the changes recommended in the Hill review will make a difference,"" he said. 
Former European Commissioner Jonathan Hill undertook a review for the British government on developing markets after Brexit and said there was a ""real danger"" fast growing British tech companies would list in Europe or the U.S. if the country's SPAC rules were not changed. 
Following his review, Britain's regulators have proposed SPACs which comply with a higher level of investor protection requirements won't have to suspend trading once they identify a takeover target.
This would avoid locking investors in for an uncertain period of time, which has deterred SPACs from listing in London. 
""We are still seeing a lot of interest for SPACs listings in London. We think it is a sensible and viable option for some companies and believe that with the proposed changes SPACs will form a subset of the market,"" said Charlie Walker, head of equity and fixed income primary markets at the London Stock Exchange. 
HOSTILE RECEPTION
Some major fund managers, however, have expressed disquiet.
""In a traditional IPO, bankers work for years with these companies to get them public market ready,"" said Adam Welham, head of equity capital markets in Europe for Fidelity Investments. 
""If you just have someone coming along and saying we've got the vehicle to make you public and you'll be done and you don't have to go through all the diligence and learning about what becoming a public company entails, there's potential for things to go wrong.""
Richard Buxton, head of strategy in the UK for British money manager Jupiter, said SPACs smack of a late cycle trend that London should not be bending over backwards to accommodate. ""I just think it's wrong to be joining in this regulatory rush to the bottom,"" he said.
Yet, a few high profile SPAC deals in Europe have had success. 
British technology investor Ian Osborne -- best known for his SPAC forays with Chamath Palihapatiya in the United States -- saw his Amsterdam blank cheque firm Hedosophia European Growth several times covered last week. 
Pegasus, a joint venture between banking veteran Jean-Pierre Mustier and France's richest man Bernard Arnault, also received a warm reception at the Dutch stock exchange. 
Osborne is said to be looking at teaming up with his U.S. SPAC partner Palihapatiya for another blank cheque foray in London, according to a source familiar with that situation.

Several other private equity firms and corporates are also considering SPAC listings in London and elsewhere in Europe, bankers said. 
""My feeling is that investors will be quite selective but sponsors with the type of quality and profile as Pegasus will get deals done,"" said Giacomo Ciampolini, who heads alternative equity unit at Citi for the EMEA region.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-New York could profit from Brexit tussle over euro derivatives,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A hasty shift in euro-denominated derivatives clearing from London to Frankfurt to meet European Union post-Brexit demands may drive business to New York and shackle the 27-member bloc's capital market, banks warn. 
The future of where euro derivatives are cleared for customers in the bloc became a focal point in the Brexit debate, with EU politicians keen to wrest control of the 100 trillion euro ($122 trillion) market away from the City of London after Britain quit the EU.
Whilst employing a relatively small number of people, euro clearing is a central cog in European financial markets so EU policymakers argue they should have full oversight of it.
The bloc's executive European Commission is studying ""technical issues"" raised by moving business worth trillions of euros from London Stock Exchange's LCH clearing platform to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex in Germany.
New York has already benefited from Brexit after most trading in euro derivatives in London left for the EU and SEF platforms in the United States following Britain's full departure on Dec. 31 2020.
Brussels is now targeting clearing, which ensures a transaction is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust, and the United States could end up grabbing business here too.
LCH accounts for over 90% of global clearing in euro interest rate swaps and says it is already supervised by the EU.
But the LSE unit only has permission to serve EU customers until June 2022 and industry officials say a shift in some euro clearing from London is now inevitable.
Although the European Commission said in January it would issue ""recommendations"" by mid-2021, it is now unlikely to be made public, a source familiar with the situation said.
The LSE has said that LCH members don't want to split the market by moving clearing from London.
""If you want to build up liquidity in the EU, we think it should be voluntary, market driven and happen over time,"" said Bruce Savage, head of the Futures Industry Association in Europe.
Albert Menkveld, professor of finance at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, has estimated that fragmenting euro rate swaps clearing would cost users of LCH at least 2 million euros a day in extra collateral from needing two clearers.
Banks have begun discussing how such an unprecedented shift could be done smoothly and for which products, industry sources say. Some banks insist it should be up to clients to decide where they clear.
""Banks want to move just the amount needed so that LCH gets some form of permanent access to the EU from June next year, and EU banks maintain access to a global pool of clearing business,"" one senior industry source said.
MULTI-CURRENCY
Only a quarter of euro swaps clearing at LCH have an EU counterparty over which EU regulators have direct influence, leaving most of the global market in London.
The global euro swaps market totals 100 trillion euros in notional outstanding, with LCH making up 80% and Eurex 20%. The German operator has been targeting a 25% stake.
""We are in favour of a market-driven alternative for clearing euro swaps within the EU,"" Eurex Clearing board member Matthias Graulich said.
Relocation involves closing a position in London and opening a new one in Frankfurt, a complex process that has never been undertaken on the scale envisaged.
""There is no first mover advantage as the first mover won't get better prices,"" industry sources said.
Eurex clears swaps and other products in euro, while LCH clears swaps in multiple currencies, making relocation harder.
EU pension funds with business predominantly in euros might be more willing to relocate clearing, but many of LCH's EU customers clear more in dollar swaps than in euro swaps, meaning they need multi-currency clearing, industry sources say.
""Our approach is to offer a full-service portfolio focused on the euro across fixed income futures, swaps and repos. This is different from LCH,"" Graulich said.
Relocation could be further complicated if the EU narrowed LCH access to the bloc after June 2022 to clearing only non-euro swaps, and the EU's securities watchdog ESMA is studying if there should be forced relocation of euro swaps clearing.
ESMA said it aimed to complete the assessment well in advance of the June 2022 deadline.
""Relocation of euro derivatives clearing by regulatory mandate would result in negative financial, commercial, operational and risk implications for market participants and place EU firms at a competitive disadvantage,"" FIA's Savage said.
Unable to reap savings from clearing in multiple currencies in London, EU customers could turn to the CME in the United States, which has long-term EU permission to serve customers from the bloc.
""For some EU buyside customers with multi-currency positions, they would be more likely to shift positions to New York than to the EU,"" a senior industry official said.
Should clearing business move to the United States, the EU would have even less oversight of the activity, said Scott O'Malia, CEO of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
CME declined to comment.
LCH must serve three months' notice to customers to shift euro positions from London if Brussels refuses to renew access from next June, meaning the clock is ticking.

""It's not terribly clear where this is going to go,"" said Katharine Braddick, head of financial services at Britain's finance ministry.

1154,By StockNews,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",3 Under the Radar Stocks That Could Soar if Gold Continues to Rally,"Increasing purchasing power, primarily due to falling unemployment and fiscal stimulus, is creating inflationary pressures in the United States. This makes the backdrop favorable for gold because this precious metal tends to perform well in an inflationary environment, providing a hedge against economic uncertainty. Hence, we think investors seeking to capitalize on the yellow metal’s turnaround should consider betting on mining stocks Centamin (CELTF), DRDGOLD (DRD), and Jaguar Mining (OTC:JAGGF).These companies are well-positioned to deliver significant returns. Read on.
Investors turned to safe haven gold last year to protect their wealth during the COVID-19-led economic slowdown. The precious metal came under relentless selling pressure after hitting all-time high in August 2020, however, due to investors’ optimism over a potentially robust global economic recovery spurred by the mass vaccination drive. Consequently, gold prices slid to $1,700 per ounce in March this year.
However, the yellow metal has rebounded sharply on worries surrounding rising inflation and is currently trading near $1,900. The government's rescue spending and an improving job market have been boosting purchasing power, which is driving inflation. In fact, consumer prices in the United States have recently increased the most since 2009. According to Statista, the annual rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.26%. Furthermore, because the Fed currently views any rise in inflation as temporary, the central bank may not change its easy monetary stance anytime soon.
So, while the recovery by the economy so far has boosted investors’ risk appetite, uncertainties continue to loom over the pace of recovery. As a result, gold’s demand as a safe-haven asset is increasing. Also, with the printing of money picking up pace globally and the Fed expanding its balance sheet, the dollar could weaken further, pushing gold prices higher.

So, the question is, will the stock recover or will it suffer further declines? Read more to find out.Vacation rental company Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) operates a platform that facilitates the arrangement of stays, vacations and experiences. It connects hosts and guests online or through mobile devices. ABNB made its market debut on December 9, 2020, at a time when the sector had been battered by reduced-travel trends due to the global public health crisis.
Closing yesterday’s trading session at $134.75, ABNB’s stock is trading 38.7% below its $219.94 all-time high, which it hit on February 11. Furthermore, the stock has lost 23.1% over the past month and 8.2% so far this year.

Shares of the company, which have gained over 20% this year, rose about 5% in morning trading as it also reported better-than-expected first quarter results. 
Best Buy was among the biggest retail winners during most of the health crisis last year as stuck-at-home Americans set up remote workspaces and invested in home appliances leading to a surge in sales of laptops, webcams, refrigerators and other electronics. 
""We're still going to see a population that likely is going to be living some hybrid life for the foreseeable future and I think the refresh cycles as a result are going to speed up as people look for that new and better way to work and school from home,"" Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said in an analyst call.
However, Barry added it was difficult to gauge the impact on sales from a switch in consumer spending to activities such as eating out, traveling and social events in the later part of the year, and after the stimulus boost peters out. 
The company forecast second-quarter comparable sales to rise 17% and expects full-year comparable sales to rise 3% to 6%, compared to a previous forecast range of a fall of 2% to a rise of 1%. 
It expects comparable sales to fall in the second half of its fiscal year.
Barry also said Best Buy's inventory of electronics was largely unaffected by the global semiconductor microchip shortage, but the company was keeping an eye on the changing situation. 

The company's comparable sales rose 37.2% in the first quarter ended May 1, beating analysts' estimates of a 22.7% increase. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.23 per share, topping estimates of $1.39 per share.

Although Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) has scheduled another meeting next week with Spain's second-largest bank, it does not expect any breakthrough, a spokesman for the union at BBVA said.
""Negotiations with the bank have not progressed over layoff plans and we are formally calling a strike on June 2,"" the spokesman said, adding the CCOO would also call for partial strikes and rallies next week.
A BBVA spokesman declined to comment.
BBVA said last month that it was planning to cut 3,800 jobs and close almost a quarter of its branches, to adapt to a customer shift towards online banking.
The bank recently offered to bring the number down to around 3,300 employees, but CCOO believes this is still too high and is demanding than any cuts should be through voluntary redundancy and early retirement. 
It is also calling for greater financial compensation for those who leave BBVA as a result of the cuts..

Formal talks with BBVA to reach any agreement are due to finish on June 4, CCOO has said.
There have been other protests in Spain against plans by five Spanish banks to cut a total of 18,000 jobs, which have coincided with government calls to rein in the pay of top bankers in the country.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",Airbus hikes jet output targets in bet on aviation recovery,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus ramped up its jet production targets on Thursday, backing signs of global recovery and strengthening its hand ahead of talks with suppliers about how to share investments needed to lift aviation out of its pandemic doldrums.
Shares in the world's largest planemaker rose more than 6% after it said was exploring an almost two-fold increase in output of key single-aisle jets by the middle of the decade from crisis-depressed levels, while firming up 2021 output plans.
""The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in a statement.
Airbus confirmed plans to increase single-aisle A320neo production by more than 10% from a current rate of 40 airplanes a month to 45 a month by the end of this year. 
It gave suppliers a firm new target of 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023 - topping its previous production record of 60 a month and improving on its pre-crisis ambitions of 63.
Shares in Airbus rose as much as 6.8%, soaring back above 100 euros to within a whisker of their 52-week high of 104.54 euros after its projections, which used carefully calibrated language ranging from firm plans to long-term scenarios.
Production of workhorse single-aisle airplanes sets the drumbeat for the global aerospace industry and is closely tied to medium-haul traffic that tends to track the wider economy.
Demand for the jets is recovering more quickly than expected, led by domestic travel in the United States and China.
But industry sources said Airbus could face a battle to persuade suppliers to step up investments for plans that may not come to fruition.
The planemaker said it was asking suppliers to ""enable a scenario"" where it can produce 70 single-aisle jets a month by the first quarter of 2024. 
""Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 (a month) by 2025,"" it added.
The bold roadmap comes after Reuters reported Airbus had ordered suppliers to demonstrate as soon as possible that they are factory fit for increased single-aisle jet output, while voicing concerns over industrial quality problems.
It also comes less than a week after industry sources disclosed Boeing (NYSE:BA) was discussing a fresh sprint in 737 MAX output to as many as 42 jets a month in autumn 2022 to help shake off overlapping safety and COVID-19 crises.
In the rest of its portfolio, Airbus announced a firm target of increasing production of the small A220 from five a month to six a month in early 2022. It added it was envisaging monthly output of 14 for the same model by the middle of the decade. 
WARY SUPPLIERS
The planemaker said production of the wide-bodied A350 was expected to rise from an average of five a month now to six by the autumn of 2022. Long-haul travel on jets like these is expected to be slowest to recover. 
Only the wide-bodied A330 family is excluded from the higher production ambitions and will stay at two a month.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) described the move as ""punchy production plans,"" while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital said it was ahead of expectations.
Shares in suppliers rose, with engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) among the biggest beneficiaries of an Airbus-led rally in Paris.
But some of the company's network of 8,000 suppliers were privately less optimistic. 
The production ramp-up has already led to a stand-off between some suppliers and Airbus over who should bear the risk of investments needed to lift the industry out of the crisis.
""The supply chain doesn't yet see the signs"" of the type of recovery laid out by Airbus in single-aisle jets, a senior industry source told Reuters.
Asked about the proposed increase in A350 output, the source added: ""It's a long way off"".
Airbus moved to reassure suppliers by arranging hurried talks on the plans.

Engine makers in particular are likely to seek guarantees before committing to significantly higher rates, a second senior source said. They effectively have final say, others said.
""Airbus has clearly decided it needs to stress-test its suppliers, and check that they actually can (and will) deliver to higher rates,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa wrote.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>","Exclusive: As China plans new rules, global automakers move to store car data locally","By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Ford have set up facilities in China to store data generated by their cars locally, they told Reuters, as automakers come under growing pressure in the world's biggest car market over how they handle information from vehicles.
Cars are being fitted with an ever-increasing array of sensors and cameras to assist drivers. 
But the data they generate can also be used by manufacturers to help develop new technologies, such as autonomous driving systems, raising privacy and security concerns, particularly when the information might be sent abroad. 
U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is under public scrutiny in China over its storage and handling of customer data in the country. 
Last week, Reuters reported that staff at some Chinese government offices were told not to park their Tesla cars inside government compounds due to security concerns over vehicle cameras, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Tesla said on Tuesday it had set up a site in China to store data generated by all vehicles it sells in the country.
Other automakers told Reuters they have done the same. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) said it established a data center in China in the first half of last year and was storing all vehicle data locally. 
BMW said it operates ""local data centers in China for the Chinese vehicle fleet,"" without saying when they opened. 
Daimler said it runs ""a dedicated vehicle backend in China, where vehicle data is stored."" 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp declined to discuss how they manage their data in China, while France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said it does not yet have a car data center in China. 
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor and Stellantis said they would comply with rules in China but gave no further details.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said compliance with data protection rules was crucial for a successful digital transformation, but ""as the regulatory environment is still in rapid development, it is too early for us to comment on the specifics.""
None of the carmakers said whether they would share data from China with their overseas offices. 
Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co did not respond to requests for comment.
China introduced a cybersecurity law in 2017 that required all companies to store key locally-generated data onshore in China, but that was before ""smart"" cars made the issue a major concern for carmakers. 
This month, China's cyberspace regulator posted a draft rule that said automakers must seek customer approval to collect driving data. The rule, in the public consultation phase, would also require automakers to store data locally and get regulatory permission when they want to send such data to foreign entities.
In the wake of the 2017 cybersecurity law, the new proposals shouldn't be a surprise to any automakers, said Tu Le, an analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights who was critical of manufacturers that have been slow to adapt. 
""The lack of a 'data' strategy tells me that decision-making is still centralized at their home offices and that they're still struggling to evolve into 'digital' first companies,"" Le said. 
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation also sets strict rules on how companies handle and store data.

It is unclear what impact China's requirements will have on the way global automakers research and develop new models or technologies. It is not unusual for companies currently to share data from China to their headquarters to develop models, executives at various manufacturers said.
""Data will ultimately be the difference-maker for companies because that's what they'll use to build products and services that help differentiate themselves from their competitors,"" Le said.

(Reuters) -General Motors Co said Thursday it will be soon be restarting production at five assembly plants around the world that have been idled due to a global semiconductor chips shortage.
GM said it is restarting operations at four plants in the United States, Mexico and Canada starting next week. Two plants in Mexico - San Luis Potosi Assembly and Ramos Assembly - that build the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Blazer will resume production on May 31.
GM said its ""supply chain organization continues to make strides working with our supply base to mitigate the near-term impacts of the semiconductor situation.""
GM shares were up 4% in early trading.
Next week GM will also resume full production on May 31 at its Bupyeong 1 Assembly in South Korea, which produces the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Buick Encore GX and has been operating at 50% capacity since April 26, and return the Changwon assembly plant to two shifts.
GM's CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, that builds the Equinox will resume production earlier than expected on June 14 and run through July 2. The plant has been idled since February 8.
Lansing Grand River will restart production of the Chevrolet Camaro earlier than expected on June 21. The plant has been down since May 10.

GM said it continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build its most in-demand products, including full-size trucks and SUVs, but said the situation continues to remain fluid globally.
Earlier this month, consulting firm AlixPartners said the global semiconductor chip shortage will cost automakers $110 billion in lost revenues this year, up from a prior estimate of $61 billion, as it forecast the crisis will hit the production of 3.9 million vehicles.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Bayer shares dropped as much as 5% on Thursday after a U.S. judge rejected its plan to try and limit the cost of future class action claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
The German group called into question the future sale of glyphosate-based products to gardeners in the U.S., and said it would review plans to settle around 30,000 legal claims, after the judge called Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s plan to end years of litigation ""unreasonable"" on Wednesday.
""We will continue to assess financial risks as we move forward,"" finance chief Wolfgang Nickl said in an analyst call, when asked if the estimate of the potential financial burden had been revised.
Bayer will be spared payouts related to future cases it had outlined in its plan this year and next but will continue to set aside $2 billion for the risk of further claims, reflecting its view that there were no fundamental changes in the outlook.
Investors were less optimistic, with shares falling as much as 5.3% and trading 4% lower at 1044 GMT.
""This ruling will keep a Damocles sword on Bayer,"" even as demand for seeds and farming pesticides recovers, analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said.
BACK TO COURT
Bayer's top litigation lawyer William Dodero said the group would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to quash defeats suffered in jury trials and appellate courts which came despite the product being deemed safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Specifically, Bayer will ask for a review of rulings that went in favour of Roundup user Edwin Hardeman, with the top court likely to decide whether to grant the request by early winter and a final verdict expected around the middle of next year, Dodero said. 
“It simply can’t be right that a manufacturer that’s followed the science and all applicable regulations is being held liable,” Dodero said on how he will argue his case.
Markus Manns, a fund manager at Union Investment, which holds Bayer shares, said the focus had turned to whether the Supreme Court will allow the review.
About 125,000 people have alleged Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cases involving 96,000 of those have been resolved with a $9.6 billion settlement which also included provisions for the remaining claims.
Three cases have gone to trial and in each one, juries awarded tens of millions of dollars in damages for plaintiffs. 
""We are determined to resolve the Roundup litigation and minimise the risk to our company from the existing and potential future lawsuits,"" said Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann.
""We remain open to settlement negotiations on the remaining lawsuits, as long as the terms are reasonable. However, we will review this approach in the future,"" he added.
REVIEW OF RESIDENTIAL USE 
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco rejected as ""unreasonable"" Bayer's class action proposal, which would have provided compensation in return for placing limits on lawsuits. 
Bayer acquired Roundup with its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Announcing a new plan after the ruling, Bayer said it ""will immediately engage with partners to discuss the future of glyphosate-based products in the U.S. residential market,"" which accounts for most cancer claims.

Bayer said that market segment was worth about 300 million euros in annual sales and one option included using a different active ingredient in Roundup, while no changes were foreseen for agricultural users.
Demand for the herbicide has remained robust throughout the litigation, Bayer added.

1165,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2021 09:23AM ET</span>","Yum's Pizza Hut Set for Big Growth in Latin America, Iberia","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Latin America will soon be home to a lot more Pizza Huts.
The pie purveyor, which has already conquered much of Asia, is projecting solid growth south of the border and in Iberia, where stores are set to more than double as the taste for America's favorite slice of Italy infiltrates local cuisines. 
That said, succeeding in the region is not without its problems -- economic downturns, currency fluctuations, inflation pressures and, of course, the occasional dictator can burn even the best-laid plans. So Pizza Hut is hedging risks as it always does, by never going it alone.
""We always partner with somebody from the country, we don't go it alone,"" said Enrique Ramirez, general manager for Latin America & Iberia, in a video interview earlier this month. ""We have to adapt and be flexible to be successful.""
Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) hit a record this month after announcing a dividend of 50 cents per share and a $2 billion share buyback plan, as well as strong first quarter results. After conquering much of Asia, Pizza Hut is now turning its attention to other regions with the most potential. Pizza Hut currently bring in the smallest share of revenue versus its sister brands KFC and Taco Bell, which together comprise Yum! Brands. But Pizza Hut saw the highest same-store sales growth for the first quarter of 2021, and while the U.S. was heavily responsible for that, Latin American & Iberia will lead the division's growth in units in the coming years. 
Of total Pizza Hut sales, the U.S. represents 45%, while Asia and China together lead with a total of 30%. That's followed by Latin America & Iberia, with 10% of total sales for the most recent quarter. Of more than 17,000 total global locations, the region has 2,500. That is set to more than double to 5,500 in the coming years, emphasizing the increasing importance of those markets.
Earlier this month, Pizza Hut opened its 1,000th Fast Casual DelCo (FCD) location in Guadalajara, the same city where its first-ever Mexico location opened 52 years ago. The new store model is a higher-margin concept that first rolled out in 2017 and a move away from the traditional in-store dining restaurant Pizza Hut was first known for. The stores are smaller with lower costs and faster profitability. 
""We see that the growth is mostly in delivery and carryout, that's why we're pushing that model,"" Ramirez said. The plan to open or renovate more such locations is in different stages of development in different parts of the world, and where the dine-in model works well and is profitable -- like in El Salvador and Peru -- it will remain.     
Currencies in Latin America are well-known for dramatic fluctuations, as well as potentially expansive inflation and a lack of trustworthy public institutions. To avoid some of those pitfalls, Pizza Hut seeks to develop local suppliers, as well as to add local flavors. 
Latin America & Iberia are expected to increase by about 6% a year in number of units, versus about 4% for overall unit growth. Latin America has 1,500 locations, with another 1,000 set to be added in Brazil and Mexico. Colombia also has room to run, and the company is eyeing markets it's not currently serving, including Argentina. The Iberian market, meanwhile, is also set to grow, adding another 500 stores from 1,000 today. In Spain, Pizza Hut also partners with Telepizza, a local brand, meaning they can build up both brands for market share.    
U.S. brands have had mixed success in Latin America, and in fact Pizza Hut was present in Argentina, for example, last century before closing shop. But it looks like now they've found a recipe that works.

Investing – Vertex Energy (NASDAQ:VTNR) shares soared 125% in Thursday’s premarket as the specialty refiner sealed a $75 million deal to a refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa).
Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) expects the acquisition to add $3 billion in annual revenue and more than $400 million in gross profit by end-2023.
The Mobile, Alabama, operation refines 90,000 barrels a day. Vertex plans to produce petroleum fuel and renewable diesel at the refinery following the close of the transaction, expected by December.
The Houston, Texas-based company will acquire approximately 3.2 million barrels of product storage, inventory, logistics and distribution assets, together with more than 860 acres of developed and undeveloped land.
The inventory is currently valued between $65 million and $85 million, according to Reuters.
Vertex expects to retain the approximately 200 employees currently engaged in the business being acquired.
Shell and Vertex will have crude supply and product offtake agreements, the companies said.
Vertex plans to produce approximately 10,000 bpd of renewable diesel and renewable byproducts at the plant by the end of 2022, increasing to 14,000 bpd by 2023, Reuters reported.
The company said it will spend $85 million to convert Mobile's hydrocracking unit.

The company revised its enterprise comparable sales growth to 3% to 6%, as against prior outlook of (-2%) to 1%.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Iceland intends to launch an initial public offering (IPO) of Islandsbanki by next month, in a first step to curbing the state's ownership of the banking sector well over a decade after it imploded during the 2008 financial crisis.
The North Atlantic nation, whose banking collapse was an extreme example of the greed and mismanagement of the global financial system, said on Thursday it would begin to normalise its financial sector by selling at least 25% of the bank's existing shares by next month.
Islandsbanki, formerly Glitnir, was one of the three lenders that failed within days of each other in 2008, prompting a state takeover that resulted in the restructuring of existing banks and creation of new ones.
Islandsbanki, which became the country's first listed company in 1904, saw its share price fall by 75% in just a month in September 2008 before it was nationalised. At the time, the Icelandic government paid 600 million euros ($732.24 million) for a 75% stake, which included the issuance of new capital.
Today, Islandsbanki could be valued upwards of $1.1 billion in the IPO, a source familiar with the transaction said, asking not to be named.
Citing successful capital raises by banks, including NatWest and Greece's Alpha Bank, he said there was renewed interest in financial institutions across Europe as the COVID-19 crisis is not primarily a financial crisis, banks are generally well capitalised and most are heavily provisioned.
OVERLY EXPOSED
Iceland began in the early 2000s to promote itself as a low-tax island economy that could serve as a base for offshore investment and finance. 
At one point, the country's banks held assets worth ten times the nation's gross domestic product, including large assets abroad, making them overly exposed when the financial crisis hit.
Capital controls and a subsequent fall in the Icelandic currency helped to restore Iceland's competitiveness. 
It began lifting capital controls in 2015, bringing it out of financial isolation, while a tourism boom fuelled economic growth. 
""The listing of Islandsbanki on Nasdaq Iceland is an important first step to reduce the Icelandic state's significant ownership in the banking sector,"" Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson said in a statement.
""Thereby we move one step closer to a healthier environment in our banking sector, such as those of our neighbouring countries in the Nordics,"" he said. 
Arion Bank, one of the other three large banks that collapsed in 2008, was the first to list in 2018. Arion was taken over by the state in 2008, but its creditors took control of the bank in 2010.
Islandsbanki has a domestic market share of around one-third, around 740 employees and last year posted pretax profit of 9.32 billion Icelandic crowns ($77 million).
The bank, which has a BBB/A-2 credit rating at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, aims to deliver a return on equity of between 8% and 10% by 2023 and above 10% in the long term. 
The state holding company has hired  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), J.P. Morgan,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and HSBC to help coordinate the IPO.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 08:21AM ET</span>","Boeing to pay $17 million in FAA settlement over 737 MAX, NG equipment","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing Co will pay $17 million in penalties under a Federal Aviation Administration settlement after it installed equipment on 759 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and NG aircraft that contained sensors that were not approved, the FAA said on Thursday.
The FAA said the settlement separately covers the planemaker's submission of 178 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for airworthiness certification when the aircraft potentially had non-conforming slat tracks installed, and improperly marked those slat tracks. 
Boeing has agreed to a number of corrective actions, including conducting safety risk-management analyses to determine ""whether its supply-chain oversight processes are appropriate and whether the company is ready to safely increase the Boeing 737 production rate,"" the agency said.
The company must strengthen procedures to ensure it does not install any aircraft parts that fail to conform to their approved design, the FAA said.
""Keeping the flying public safe is our primary responsibility. That is not negotiable, and the FAA will hold Boeing and the aviation industry accountable to keep our skies safe,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said.
Boeing said the ""penalties stem from issues that were raised in 2019 and which we fully resolved in our production system and supply chain. We continue to devote time and resources to improving safety and quality performance across our operations.""
If Boeing does not complete corrective actions in a timely fashion, the FAA can levy up to $10.1 million in additional penalties.
Boeing must also revise production procedures to enable the FAA ""to observe production rate readiness assessments, (and) the data on which the company bases the assessments, and the results of the assessments.""
In March 2020, the FAA proposed fining  Boeing Co  $19.7 million for allegedly installing equipment on hundreds of 737 aircraft containing sensors in heads-up displays that regulators had not approved for use.
The FAA alleged that between June 2015 and April 2019, Boeing installed Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) Head-up Guidance Systems on 791 jetliners, including 618 Boeing 737 NGs and 173 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.

There was no relationship between the two fatal 737 MAX crashes that grounded the plane for 20 months and the sensor issue, the FAA said in 2020.
In January 2020, the FAA proposed fining Boeing $5.4 million, alleging it failed to prevent the installation of nonconforming slat tracks on 737 MAX airplanes.

The move by CVS, which has over 9,600 pharmacies across the United States, adds to the range of incentives being offered by states and companies desperate to get vaccination rates up and American life back to some degree of normality.

At the same time, average credit scores for consumers who financed new and used vehicles are higher, and delinquency rates are lower, indicating a healthy auto credit market overall, the study found. Experian, an information services company, gathers data on consumer and business credit and generates credit scores, among other services.
""Consumers are increasingly purchasing SUVs, CUVs and pickups. It's driving loan amounts up and payments up,"" said Melinda Zabritski, Experian's senior director of automotive financial solutions. CUV is an acronym for car-like, crossover utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4, a best seller in the category.
Average credit scores for new and used vehicle buyers rose in the first quarter, and the average used car buyer now has a prime level credit rating of 663, Experian said. The share of consumers with sub-prime credit scores dropped to a new record low of just over 17%.
More than 56% of new vehicles financed in the first three months of 2021 were SUVs, and another 17% were pickup trucks. The average amount financed to buy a new vehicle rose to $35,392 in the first quarter from $33,833 a year earlier.
The share of new vehicle loans longer than 72 months rose to just over 35% of the total from just under 32% a year earlier.
Used-vehicle lending showed a similar pattern of more borrowed on average for longer periods. 

In the past, lengthening loan terms raised yellow flags among auto credit market-watchers. But Experian found the share of delinquent loans - where borrowers were 60 days behind on payments - fell in the latest quarter to 0.54% from 0.67% a year ago, and 0.68% in the first quarter of 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.
""I don’t see anything in the industry itself that would be a cause for alarm,"" Zabritski said.

Investing -- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares erased their early losses and traded 0.8% higher in Thursday’s premarket as concerns over supply chain issues that have plagued chipmakers last few quarters kept the market sentiment for the stock in check.
A revenue forecast of $6.30 billion for the second quarter with ‘plus or minus 2%’ possibility was also keeping the traders guessing.
Nvidia EVP and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company’s lead-times for data center products and other component suppliers had lengthened. This had led to outstanding inventory purchase obligations almost doubling at the end of the quarter to $3.46 billion from $1.76 billion a year earlier.
Many chipmakers including Nvidia, TSMC, NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and AMD have been facing supply chain issues as demand has boomed for mobiles, EVs and smart devices during the pandemic while chip production ground to a halt.
The company posted record net income for the first quarter and record revenues as well.
Net income for the quarter ended May 2 more than doubled, rising 109% to $1.91 billion on GAAP basis.
Revenues rose 84% from a year ago $5.66 billion as companies used its chips to power laptops and data centers.
All revenues streams, namely gaming, data centers and professional visualization platforms, posted record revenues. Demand from OEMs grew too with automotive being the only market platform in the company’s bouquet degrowing.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 07:37AM ET</span>","Total, Chevron suspend payments to Myanmar junta from gas project","(Reuters) -French oil and gas group Total and U.S. energy company  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have suspended some payments from a gas joint venture that would have reached Myanmar's junta, earning praise from pro-democracy activists for taking an important first step.
International companies doing business in the country have come under pressure from rights groups and Myanmar's parallel civilian government to review their operations to stop payments flowing to a military government that seized power on Feb. 1.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the army overthrew the elected government and detained its leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and the junta has responded with brutal force to daily protests, marches and strikes nationwide in support of the ousted civilian administration. 
In a statement, Total said ""in light of the unstable context in Myanmar"" after a joint proposal with Chevron shareholders at the meeting of the Moattama Gas Transportation Company voted to suspend all cash distributions.
Total is the biggest shareholder with 31.24%, while Chevron holds 28%. Thailand's PTTEP and Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise hold the remainder.
""Total condemns the violence and human rights abuses occurring in Myanmar and reaffirms that it will comply with any decision that may be taken by the relevant international and national authorities, including applicable sanctions issued by the EU or the U.S. authorities,"" the statement said. 
Chevron in a statement said: ""The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar requires a collective response to improve the welfare of the people of Myanmar.""
The U.S. company also said: ""Any actions should be carefully considered to ensure the people of Myanmar are not further disadvantaged by unintended and unpredictable consequences of well-intentioned decisions."" 
Rystad Energy analyst Readul Islam said the energy companies'move appeared to break new ground, given that there so far haven’t been any international sanctions targeting hydrocarbon operations in Myanmar.
""The mood music appears to have shifted, particularly given operator Total’s past history of staunchly defending its Myanmar operations,"" he said. 
Justice for Myanmar, an activists group, welcomed the decision to suspend payments of dividends, which it said would curb one source of revenue to the junta. 
""But we note that this is only a minor portion of the revenue that the junta is receiving from Total’s operations in Myanmar, which also includes the state’s share of gas revenues, royalties and corporate income taxes,"" Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung said in a statement.
Located off Myanmar's southwest coast in the Gulf of Martaban, the Yadana fields produce gas for delivery to power plants in Thailand. They also supply Myanmar's domestic market, via an offshore pipeline built and operated by state energy firm Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. Total said it was continuing to maintain the production of the Yadana gas field ""so as not to disrupt the electricity supply that is vital to the local populations of Myanmar and Thailand.""
PTTEP did not respond to requests for comment.

Myanmar's political crisis has also frozen Total's plans for further development options in another potential big field Block A-6, Rystad's Islam said.
""In the past, the majors could have waited out political disturbances...but today, there’s the additional parameter of energy transition which may mean (they) now have the option of foregoing developments and 'greening' their portfolios.""

1178,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Fare Bargains Vanish as Airlines Seize on Surging Summer Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- The days of bargain basement airfares are ending as the U.S. vaccine supply unleashes a wave of pent-up travel demand.
A rebound in trips to visit friends and family coupled with flight schedules that remain below 2019 levels means more flyers chasing fewer seats. That’s pushing up trip costs for the peak summer season as carriers reboot revenue management tools -- which raise fares in line with stronger seat demand -- after a year in which planes often flew with rows of empty seats.
“I haven’t been super-pleased with the prices,” said Jackson Ralston, 29, of Lake Dallas, Texas, who is monitoring daily Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Flight fare alerts to attend a friend’s bachelor party this summer. Current ticket prices from Dallas to Manchester, New Hampshire, for the planned weekend at a lake are close to $600.
“I’m debating whether or not I’ll need to fly into more of a major hub over there and just rent a car and drive up,” he said.
The hit to consumer wallets is buoying airlines that have had to rely on billions of dollars in federal aid to weather a collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Coupled with deep cost cuts last year, the fare recovery is making carriers including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. more confident that their run of red ink will end in the third quarter.
Airlines Rally as U.S. Travel Rebound Quickens Into Summer
Airfares jumped a record 10.2% in April from the prior month, the U.S. Labor Department reported May 12, reflecting a surge of demand as cooped-up consumers returned to the skies.
Compared with the level in the first quarter, the median round-trip fare has climbed 12% to $357.36, according to TripActions Inc., a corporate travel manager that collects fares from global ticket-distribution systems. Those three months are a rough proxy for the U.S. summer buying season as people plan vacations and weekend trips.
The price increases are likely to stick, making the ultra-low fares of a year ago a distant memory. In the U.S. domestic market, fares will average $283 for the period of June-August, a 35% increase from last year and only 4% below the level of summer 2019, according to a May 18 fare forecast from Hopper Inc., a travel search and analytics company.
“In the domestic market, I expect that fares will meet those of 2019 levels” sometime between August and October, said Adit Damodaran, an economist with Montreal-based Hopper.
Lost Time
Billions of dollars in federal aid kept airlines afloat last year while also requiring them to maintain certain service levels. As a result, the seat supply didn’t fall as quickly as demand.
In late March 2020, with would-be flyers staying home en masse, airlines offered some flights between New York and the West Coast for as little as $88, down 51% from earlier in the month, according to Hopper.
Now the airlines are making up for lost time by seizing on consumer appetites for leisure trips, primarily for domestic flights and popular Caribbean and Latin American beach destinations.
Canada and most of Europe remain largely off limits to leisure travelers, with lengthly mandatory quarantine protocols for inbound visitors. Industry executives see a recovery in Asian travel as even further behind. To adjust, airlines are shifting some of their largest twin-aisle aircraft to domestic routes that were served largely by smaller planes before the pandemic.
The three largest U.S. airlines have increased wide-body flights in the U.S. by 30% this year through August, with numbers peaking in June and July, from 2019 levels, according to data from Cirium. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc., for example, is using big Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 777 jets on flights connecting Miami with Los Angeles and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.
There’s still a ways to go before pricing fully catches up with the levels of 2019, a record year for air travel. Domestic leisure fares so far this quarter are roughly 18% below the same period two years ago, according to data compiled for Bloomberg News by Menlo Park, California-based TripActions.
Relative to 2019 levels, ticket prices can vary widely by route. The median price for a round-trip ticket from Minneapolis to Orlando, home of Disney and Universal theme parks, is $304.68 this quarter, down 28% from two years ago, according to TripActions. Los Angeles to Orlando is 12% lower. But New York to Miami fares are 39% higher, at $487.
Improved Outlook
The improving outlook for pricing power has helped spur a rally in a Standard & Poor’s index of major U.S. airlines, which has advanced 30% this year. The index rose to a six-week high Wednesday after recent signs that the recovery was strengthening.
Booked fares on June flights are nearing the same level as two years ago, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. said May 19, spurred partially by the carrier’s plan to fly only 84% of its 2019-level capacity in the second quarter.
Likewise, while United is touting July as its busiest flight schedule since March 2020, the month’s flying will still be about 20% below the level of two years ago. United is flying 126 new routes in July it didn’t have two years ago, a sign of what the airline and its competitors have done to revamp their networks and pursue leisure traffic destinations near and far.
Delta’s bookings have been better than expected recently as customers resume booking trips further in advance, said Glen Hauenstein, the company’s president. Forward bookings are above 2019 levels for leisure travel, he told a Wolfe Research conference May 25.
“July is better than June and August is better than July,” Hauenstein said. “September is better than August.”

""The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates that the cybersecurity of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. 
Owners and operators of critical pipelines will be required to report confirmed and potential cybersecurity incidents to the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and designate a cybersecurity coordinator, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, DHS said.
The directive will also require pipeline owners and operators to review current cybersecurity practices and identify any gaps and remediation measures for risks, it said. They must report those results to the Transportation Security Administration, a unit of DHS, and CISA within 30 days. 
A ransomware attack forced Colonial Pipeline, which runs from Texas to New Jersey, to shut much of its network for several days earlier this month, leaving thousands of gas stations across the U.S. Southeast without fuel. 
Motorists, fearing prolonged shortages, raced to fill their tanks as the outage laid bare the nation’s reliance on a few key pipelines for fuel needs.
The closure of the 5,500-mile (8,900-km) system was the most disruptive cyberattack on record, preventing millions of barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from flowing to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast.
The hackers held Colonial Pipeline's computer network hostage and successfully extorted millions of dollars in digital currency. The incident has bumped the cybersecurity of critical U.S. infrastructure to the top of the national agenda.
Investigators in the Colonial case say the attack software was distributed by a gang called DarkSide, which includes Russian speakers and avoids hacking targets in the former Soviet Union. U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russia should bear some responsibility since the hacking came from inside its borders.

In the past the Transportation Security Administration has provided voluntary guidelines on cybersecurity for pipelines.
TSA is considering additional mandatory measures to enhance cybersecurity in the pipeline industry, the DHS statement said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Thursday, with investors cautious ahead of key employment data and more retail earnings.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 10 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 55 points, or 0.4%.
This expected muted start followed a relatively quiet session on Wall Street Wednesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 ending 0.2% higher, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing little changed and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.6%.
Investors will keep a wary eye on the release of new labor-market data ahead of the open, especially after Randal Quarles, the Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision, stated Wednesday that the central bank will need to start discussing shortly plans to reduce its bond purchases if the economy continues to show massive improvement.
The weekly initial jobless claims data is scheduled for release at 8:30 AM ET, with economists expecting a total of 425,000 Americans to have filed unemployment benefits in the week ended May 22, another new pandemic-era low.
Also of importance will be the number of continuing claims, which are measured with a one-week time lag to initial ones, after they rose by over 100,000 to 3.751 million last week.
Pending home sales, durable goods and the second reading of the first-quarter GDP release make up the rest of the economic data slate.
In the corporate sector, the likes of  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are due to release quarterly earnings. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be in focus after the chip giant’s first quarter beat expectations, while Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) reported widening losses after the close Wednesday. 
The energy sector could also be in the spotlight after Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) was ordered by a Dutch court to drastically deepen its planned greenhouse gas emission cuts, and both  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) suffered shareholder rebellions.  
Crude oil prices slipped Thursday, after recent gains, as traders digested the possible return of Iranian exports along with a hefty draw in U.S. stocks.
By 6:05 AM ET, U.S. crude was down 0.7% at $65.72 a barrel, while Brent was down 0.8% at $68.21.
The market was supported late Wednesday by a bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. oil inventories, with the Energy Information Administration reporting a draw of 1.662 million barrels for the week to May 21, suggesting rising demand from U.S. consumers.
However, the focus remains on the Iranian nuclear talks and whether sanctions on its oil exports are lifted. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, are due to meet on June 1, and these producers will have to assess whether to change their plans for easing production curbs against the prospect of Iranian supply returning to the market.

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement on its website that the community group buying service provider had failed to correct wrongdoings in some areas since it was fined by the regulator in March, despite company claims of active rectification.
For example, Nice Tuan offered a type of pear at 0.99 yuan per 250 grams, despite its cost being 3.89 yuan, according to SAMR.
Such behaviour ""undermines the legitimate rights and interests of small and medium-sized enterprises"" and other grocers, it said.
Nice Tuan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In March, China fined five community group-buying platforms, including Nice Tuan, and others backed by the likes of Meituan,  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), citing ""improper pricing behaviour"".

China has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which rank among the world's largest and most valuable, citing concerns that they have built market power that stifles competition, misused consumer data and violated consumer rights.

(Reuters) - When U.S. President Joe Biden's administration approved the country’s first major offshore wind farm this month, it billed the move as the start of a new clean energy industry that by the end of the decade will create over 75,000 U.S. jobs.
Industry executives and analysts do not contest that claim, but they make a clarification: For the first several years at least, most of the manufacturing jobs stemming from the U.S. offshore wind industry will be in Europe.
Offshore wind project developers plan to ship massive blades, towers and other components for at least the initial wave of U.S. projects from factories in France, Spain and elsewhere before potentially opening up manufacturing plants on U.S. shores, according to Reuters interviews with executives from three of the world’s leading wind turbine makers.
That is because suppliers need to see a deep pipeline of approved U.S. projects, along with a clear set of regulatory incentives like federal and state tax breaks, before committing to siting and building new American factories, they say – a process that could take years.
""For the first projects, it's probably necessary"" to ship across the Atlantic, said Martin Gerhardt, head of offshore wind product management at Siemens Gamesa, the global offshore wind market leader in a comment typical of the group.
That underscores an uncomfortable truth for the Biden administration as it seeks to show political opponents that a transition away from fossil fuels to fight climate change can be good for the economy: many of the clean energy jobs he aims to create to offset losses in drilling and mining may not materialize until well after his time in the White House ends.
The administration has unveiled a goal to install 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power capacity in U.S. waters by 2030 – roughly the amount that already exists in Europe’s two-decade old industry – a plan that it estimates will create 77,000 U.S.-based jobs while combating global climate change.
More than 2,000 turbines will be needed to meet the 30-GW target, according to Shashi Barla, an analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But U.S.-based factories probably will not materialize until 2024 or 2025, he said.
After that, Barla said he expects the U.S. supply chain to develop rapidly and to make around 70% of major components for the industry by 2030.
A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A FACTORY IN EVERY STATE
This month, Washington took a big step toward its goal of launching the offshore wind industry by approving the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, jointly owned by Avangrid (NYSE:AGR) Inc and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.
That project, the first major offshore wind farm to get federal approval in the United States after more than a decade of stops and starts, is expected to produce enough electricity to power 400,000 homes in New England by 2023.
Vineyard Wind alone will create 3,600 U.S. jobs, according to company officials, though most of the project’s components will be manufactured in Europe due to the lack of an existing domestic supply chain. 
U.S. company  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s renewable division, GE Renewable Energy, will supply Vineyard Wind with 62 turbines. The major parts for those turbines, which are twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, including rotor blades and gear boxes, will be made in its factories in France.
Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), Avangrid’s Spanish parent company, says the contract to make the turbine foundations, meanwhile, will create around 400 jobs at the Windar Renovables factory in Spain.
Several other U.S. offshore wind project proposals have also been preparing orders from companies like GE and Siemens Gamesa, but they are awaiting federal regulatory approval before moving forward.
The manufacturers told Reuters they need those orders to become solid and reliable before contemplating investments in a U.S.-based supply chain for offshore wind. 
Opening a factory is costly and time-consuming: they require permits and large amounts of space near the coast, said Christy Guthman, GE Renewables commercial leader of U.S. offshore.
""We definitely want to maximize our local content wherever possible, but we need to have that sustained volume year over year to look at potential investments in the U.S,"" Guthman said.
Developers also need to navigate complex state-level demands on the industry, as governors compete to ensure that any future factories supplying the offshore wind industry are built within their borders. 
New Jersey, for example, has asked bidders on its offshore wind supply contracts to specify how they will help the state become an industry hub, while a recent New York solicitation said investments that create sustainable in-state jobs would be given preference. 
""We cannot have a factory in every state, that is not economic,"" Siemens Gamesa Chief Executive Andreas Nauen said in an interview.
Nauen’s company is still deliberating over whether to open a specialized facility on the East Coast to service a proposed project for Dominion Energy in Virginia, having been named preferred supplier back in January 2020.
Siemens Gamesa, GE and Vestas already produce parts for smaller, onshore turbines in the United States, but locations including landlocked Kansas, Iowa, North Dakota and Colorado put them too far from the windy coasts to be of much use for larger offshore pieces. 
Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Equinor, meanwhile, have said they plan to open manufacturing for some parts to service U.S. offshore projects they have proposed, though many major parts would likely still be derived from established plants in Europe.
POLITICAL TURBULENCE
Suppliers have reason to be cautious. Clean energy expansion in the United States relies heavily on political will – which can shift from administration to administration. 
Federal incentives for renewable energy projects have expired or experienced eleventh-hour extensions in Congress multiple times over the last decade. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, meanwhile, had cancelled Vineyard Wind's permit application during his term, throwing the entire industry into doubt until Biden revived the process. 
That turbulence resounded in the supply chain. Vineyard Wind initially chose Vestas as its turbine supplier in 2018, but that contract expired as federal permitting dragged on.
The Biden White House has said it is aware that suppliers need airtight commitments to make investments in local manufacturing, and points out the administration has pledged $3 billion in public financing for offshore wind and transmission developers and component suppliers. It will also fund $230 million of port infrastructure projects to help encourage the industry.
The U.S. International Trade Commission, meanwhile, has imposed tariffs on imported wind towers from certain countries including Spain. While the move came at the request of two domestic producers of towers for the U.S. onshore wind industry, the tariffs would apply to offshore towers as well, increasing the economic incentive to open U.S. factories.
""We know that we need to create greater certainty for offshore wind projects,"" U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Director Amanda Lefton said on a call with reporters on May 11. 

Lefton has also acknowledged that competing state demands could be an obstacle for the industry. 
""There's been this healthy competition among states for who is the most aggressive,"" Lefton said in an interview with Reuters. ""But we stand to gain a lot more now by... rowing in the same direction on establishing the supply chain here.""

The bank's annual shareholder meeting, held online due to the coronavirus pandemic, took place in a more relaxed atmosphere than in recent years, a reflection of the lender's return to profit and rising share price. 
Three years into its restructuring, Sewing said Germany's largest bank wasn't over the finish line.
""But we have come a long way. We still have work to do, but we have already achieved so much,"" he said. 
Asked about possible mergers and acquisitions, Sewing said: ""Our main focus is and remains the successful execution of our transformation by 2022"". 
Deutsche posted a net profit for the first quarter, its strongest result for seven years, driven by its investment bank which outperformed major U.S. rivals.
Its shares are up more than 130% from last year's record lows.
""There are no more question marks hanging over the stability of our bank, while many – but not all – of the problems of recent years have been remedied,"" said Chairman Paul Achleitner.
Alexandra Annecke, a fund manager with Union Investment, said Deutsche had become an exciting turnaround story and this year's meeting for once wasn't taking place in a crisis. 
""Shareholders have the worse behind us,"" she said. ""We finally see light at the end of the tunnel.""
Deutsche's restructuring includes exiting business lines such as equities trading and shedding 18,000 staff. 
Ratings agencies have become more optimistic about the bank. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) recently put Deutsche under review for a possible upgrade. 
Despite a spate of good news, however, the bank is still having problems with money laundering controls. 

Germany's financial regulator last month ordered Deutsche to enact further safeguards to prevent money laundering.
""We must improve our transaction monitoring,"" Achleitner said.

It said Foxconn, the main assembler of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones, was seeking a minority stake to help the group expand its chipmaker unit SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
Asked about the report, DNeX told Reuters it is always open to discussion with strategic partners and investors that can bring value to the group but cannot comment on any specific discussion at shareholder level, if any is taking place.
Foxconn said following company policy, it does not comment on market speculation or rumors.
In February, DNeX and Beijing Integrated Circuit Advanced Manufacturing and High-End Equipment Equity Investment Fund Center won a bid to acquire SilTerra for 273 million ringgit ($65.98 million) from sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional.
DNeX will own 60% in SilTerra while its Chinese partner takes the remainder. 
Foxconn lost the bid for the semiconductor maker earlier this year but its chairman told reporters the company was still looking for semiconductor fab purchase opportunities in Southeast Asia.
While Apple is Foxconn's largest customer, the electronics manufacturer has been looking at other areas for growth, including in electric vehicles (EVs).
Last week, it signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with carmaker Stellantis to form a joint venture to supply in-car and connected-car technologies across the auto industry.

Shares in DNeX, a trade facilitation and oil & gas service provider, rose as much as 13.6% on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union will apply lessons from the Wirecard scandal by proposing stricter rules next year for company financial reporting and auditors, its financial services chief said.
The payments company collapsed in 2020 in Germany's biggest post-war fraud scandal after auditor EY could not confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.32 billion) in cash balances.
""Wirecard is a wake-up call. Wirecard told and sold a great story that wasn't true,"" Mairead McGuinness said in a speech to the European Policy Centre on Thursday.
""More and more board members should think twice if they are going to sit on a board and look at their wider responsibilities rather than just looking internally at the bottom line,"" she said.
McGuinness will launch a public consultation after the summer looking at company audit committees, the outside auditors who sign off on financial figures companies publish and the regulators who supervise them.
It will examine whether responsibilities of company board members to provide accurate financial reports are defined clearly enough.
The consultation will reflect on how to improve the role of company audit committees and whether they should be mandatory.
McGuinness said supervisors for auditors across the EU had found problems with internal quality control systems.
""They also found a lack of or inappropriate monitoring of high-risk audited entities and insufficient audit evidence and documentation,"" she added.
""And it is for these reasons that I aim to have a proposal ready by the end of 2022 to tackle the problems and to strengthen the quality of public reporting and its enforcement.""
McGuinness said ""more and stronger action"" may also be needed to ensure competition in an audit market where EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC, dubbed the Big Four, have 92% of market share.
The EU is rolling out requirements for companies to report on the ""sustainability"" of their activities to help meet goals for reducing carbon emissions.
""I would not like to see that concentration of control over the sustainability reporting,"" McGuinness said of the Big Four.
Other reasons for the ""lack of quality"" in auditing might also be a focus on more attractive non-audit services, she said.
EU securities watchdog ESMA criticised German regulator BaFin last year for deficiencies in its handling of Wirecard, and suggested stronger cooperation between national and EU-level audit regulators.
This provided a ""very good starting point"", McGuinness said.

The EU brought in rules for the audit market in 2016 that require companies to change auditors every few years and imposed a cap on non-audit services, but there are national variations.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: KPMG managers back liquidation of Singapore firms in $1 billion nickel scandal,"By Chen Lin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore firms accused of being involved in a $1.1-billion bogus nickel trading scheme should be placed in liquidation as there was no business to be preserved, interim judicial managers at accounting firm KPMG have said in a document seen by Reuters.
Authorities in the city state have implicated Ng Yu Zhi, a former managing director of trading companies Envy Global Trading (EGT) and an inactive firm, Envy Asset Management, in the fraud, one of the biggest in Singapore.
Last month, Singapore's High Court appointed KPMG as the interim judicial manager for the firms, as well as a related company, Envy Management Holdings.
Ng faces more than a dozen charges of cheating and fraud brought by prosecutors over the scheme, which the authorities say raised money from investors to fund non-existent nickel deals.
Ng has not made any public comment on the charges, following which he was removed from his role as managing director of EGT. The companies have not been charged. 
""The companies' assets...are grossly insufficient to meet the potential claims of the companies' creditors,"" the interim judicial managers said in their report, dated Tuesday.
""We recommend the companies be placed into liquidation and that appropriate steps be taken as soon as practicable to recover the assets of the companies.""
The report said the scheme purportedly raised about S$1.5 billion ($1.13 billion) from nearly 1,000 investors, with about S$731 million of this later withdrawn by investors. 
Authorities have previously said at least S$1 billion was raised in the scheme. 
The managers, led by Bob Yap, a KPMG partner in Asia, declined to comment on the report on grounds of confidentiality.
Envy Group and Ng did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The judicial managers' report also concluded that none of the funds from investors were used for nickel trades, and that any investment returns were likely to have come from investor funds.
Documents were forged and a video of a nickel shipment inspection recorded to convince investors of the existence of the purported trading, the report added.
""We conclude that the objectives of judicial management cannot be achieved for any of the companies. There is, most significantly, no business for the judicial managers to preserve or continue,"" the managers said in the report.
The managers will continue investigations into the companies' affairs, they added.
During the period from July 2020 to February 2021, EGT made nearly 1,200 fund transfers, totalling S$238.6 million, to two bank accounts, at least one of them belonging to Ng, the report said.
Ng made, or caused to be made, an average of 150 transfers a month and up to 41 transfers a day during this period, and separately received S$29 million in director's fees, it said.
Ng has declined to meet the KPMG officials, it added.
Besides Ng, the report identified Lee Si Ye as an ultimate beneficial owner of the Envy Group. Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If convicted, Ng faces a jail term of up to seven years on the fraudulent trading charges, while cheating is punishable with up to 10 years.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's security chief sent letters to media tycoon Jimmy Lai and branches of HSBC and Citibank this month threatening up to seven years' jail for any dealings with the billionaire's accounts in the city, according to documents seen by Reuters.
The letters, signed by Secretary for Security John Lee, were sent to Lai after the Hong Kong authorities announced the freezing of his majority stake in publisher Next Digital and local accounts of three companies owned by him under a sweeping new national security law.
One of Lai's financial advisers said that while the amount of funds in the accounts was relatively small, they represented the Hong Kong management end of a global network of banking relationships covering his private wealth.
Three senior private bankers and three corporate lawyers - independent from Lai's accounts - said the action extended the tightening national security apparatus into elite tiers of the banking system for the first time, exposing risks for clients and top financial managers in Hong Kong.
The advisers are seeking guidance from bankers and lawyers on how to challenge the freeze, and its impact on offshore holdings and banking relationships managed through Hong Kong until now.
The action by the security secretary is also fuelling concern about the broader investment climate in the city given the potential reach of the security law, imposed on the former British colony last June by China's parliament, lawyers, bankers and diplomats say. 
The moves could imperil any attempt by the democracy activist to move offshore assets back home to prop up Next's troubled Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid, a staunch government critic, the financial adviser said.
Shares in Next Digital rose as much as 330% as they resumed trading on Thursday after authorities last week froze Lai's 71.26% stake, then worth $45 million.
Lai has emerged as one of the highest profile targets of the new law and is facing three national security charges including allegedly colluding with a foreign country.
The letter to Lai, sent to him at the city's high-security Stanley Prison, threatens up to seven years' jail and an unspecified fine for any dealing in the named assets, including disposal or conversion, using them as collateral or transferring them in or out of Hong Kong.
The letter to Lai lists seven Hong Kong accounts that are linked to three companies registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).
Lai could not be reached for comment. 
Described as ""Notice No. 1"", the letter states that the action is taken under the ""implementation rules"" of Article 43 of the law, which allows for the seizure or freezing of property ""used or intended to be used"" for the commission of an offence.
The letters also acknowledge the right of Lai and the banks to challenge the notice, which expires in May 2023, in court. 
The same language was used in letters to HSBC and Citibank, according to the documents seen by Reuters.
A Security Bureau spokesman said as judicial proceedings were going on ""it is not appropriate for us to disclose operational details"".
""Suffice to say, endangering national security is a very serious crime."" 
Banking regulator, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said banks had to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations, including freezing of assets under relevant laws, which includes the national security law.
""The HKMA has no role in criminal investigations and we are not in a position to comment,"" it said. 
'WAKE-UP CALL'
The letter to Lai specified that he would be held liable if he dealt with the assets ""except under the authority of a licence"" granted by Security Secretary Lee.
The letters to the two banks did not make clear which employees in the bank would be held liable. 
A Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Citibank said the bank did not comment on individual client accounts. ""Citi is required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in markets where we operate,"" the spokesperson said. A spokeswoman at HSBC in Hong Kong declined to comment.
An account in OCBC Wing Hang Bank is also listed in the letter sent to Lai but it is not known if that bank received a similar notice. OCBC Wing Hang declined to comment. 
Lai told Reuters last May that, given the pressure building on him, the bulk of his personal wealth was off-shore.
His advisers say this is spread across Asia and North America, including property in Taiwan, hotels in Canada and tens of millions in U.S. stocks.
""We are certain they are determined to choke Apple, and even without trying to seize assets offshore, they are making it difficult to move that money back into Hong Kong,"" one adviser told Reuters.
""We can now see that any banking relationship you have centred on Hong Kong makes you vulnerable under the national security law – that is going to be a big wake-up call for the wealth management industry here, and their rich clients,"" the adviser said.
""In trying to nail Jimmy Lai and Apple to the wall, they might well be nailing that industry too.""
Lai's advisers fear the uncertainty surrounding his offshore assets stems from the fact that they are held in offshore accounts set up and managed through Hong Kong.
Bankers and lawyers say regulators and banks in other jurisdictions are not obliged to respond to demands related to individual accounts from another country, especially if those requests are not linked to terrorism or money laundering charges.
One senior private banker in Hong Kong said it was a common practice for Hong Kong-based private bankers to set up overseas accounts for clients - operating under a key assumption that such offshoring of wealth would be legally firewalled.
""It doesn't matter if the accounts are set up in Hong Kong. The money is somewhere else, and falls under another jurisdiction,"" the banker told Reuters. ""It's secure.""
If, however, confidence in this arrangement were undermined by the national security law and discretionary curbs on monetary outflows, it could hurt the industry. 
""A lot of clients have already been spreading their eggs,"" said the banker who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the issue. ""The No. 1 one destination is Singapore.""
The 73-year-old Lai is serving a 14-month prison sentence for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019.
As those protests built, Lai's representatives moved assets offshore via Hong Kong bank branches to seek protection against a proposed extradition bill that fuelled the demonstrations. 
While the government later shelved the bill, its key features - including the ability to render Hong Kong suspects for trial in mainland Chinese courts and broader asset seizure regulations - were included in the security law imposed by China's highest legislative body.
Lee, the security secretary, said last week that the move against Lai was meant to prevent further crimes and wasn't aimed at media work.

Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the action would hopefully reinforce the city's status as a financial hub ""so that no-one can use our financial system to carry out acts endangering national security"".
Next Digital said in a statement on Wednesday it had enough working capital to operate for at least 18 months from April 1 without new loans or cash injections from Lai.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -HSBC announced it is withdrawing from U.S. mass market retail banking by selling some parts of the money-losing business and winding down others, a long-awaited move as the lender steps up a shift in focus to Asia, its biggest market. 
Europe's biggest bank has for years been trying to shrink its presence in some European and North American markets where it has struggled against competition from larger domestic players. 
The bank said in a statement late on Wednesday it would exit retail banking for most individual and small business customers but retain a small physical presence in the United States to serve its international affluent and very wealthy clients. 
""They are good businesses, but we lacked the scale to compete,"" Noel Quinn, HSBC group CEO, said in the statement.
HSBC unveiled in February a revised strategy focused mainly on wealth management in Asia, and at the same time said it was ""exploring organic and inorganic options"" for its U.S. retail banking franchise.
As part of Quinn's gameplan that also involved slashing costs across the banking group, the London-headquartered bank has been looking to step back from sub-scale markets and businesses.
HSBC is also seeking to sell its French retail banking operations as part of the same strategy, and has entered final negotiations to sell that business to private equity firm Cerberus, Reuters reported in March. 
Citizens Bank, part of Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group, has agreed to buy HSBC's east coast personal and small business banking business including 80 branches, and Cathay Bank, a unit of  Cathay General  Bancorp (NASDAQ:CATY), has agreed to buy its west coast business including 10 branches, according to HSBC and separate statements from the two U.S.-headquartered banks. 
""These transactions, whilst very small in the context of HSBC group, should contribute to streamlining the group,"" analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) wrote in a note on Thursday. They added, though, that the bank is expected to still face some investor pushback as it is not completely exiting U.S. retail.
HSBC said it expected to incur pre-tax costs of $100 million connected with the transactions, after which it does not expect to generate a significant gain or loss.
HSBC's U.S. wealth and personal banking business made a loss of $547 million in 2020, according to the bank's annual results, versus a $5 billion profit in Asia, primarily from Hong Kong, its most profitable market. 
Its global banking and markets division, which includes its investment banking and large corporate businesses, made a profit of $573 million in the United States in 2020. 
The bank's Hong Kong listed shares rose as much as 0.8% to a three-month high, before retreating. 
U.S. TROUBLES 
HSBC expanded into U.S. retail banking in the 1980s as part of a broader strategy to diversify its geographical focus.
However, it has been trying to walk back on this for more than a decade, and in 2011 announced the sale of nearly half of its then 470 U.S. branches, mostly in upstate New York, and also its profitable U.S. credit card arm.

HSBC had acquired that credit cards business as part of its disastrous $14 billion purchase of U.S. consumer lending firm Household International in 2003, which triggered billions of dollars of subprime mortgage losses, and an eventual $1.6 billion payment to settle a class-action lawsuit.
The bank currently has a U.S. network of 148 branches.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Bayer to rethink Roundup in U.S. residential market after judge nixes $2 billion settlement,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) -Bayer said on Wednesday it will review the future of its Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers in the U.S. residential market after a judge rejected a $2 billion plan to settle future claims alleging the herbicide causes cancer.
The company also said it will reassess its efforts to settle around 30,000 ongoing claims by Roundup users who are alleging they have become sick from the product.
The announcement came hours after a U.S. judge rejected Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s $2 billion class action proposal, which would have provided compensation in return for placing limits on lawsuits. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco called the plan ""clearly unreasonable."" 
Bayer said its new proposal was ""designed to help the company achieve a level of risk mitigation that is comparable to the previously proposed national class solution.""
The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use. 
But thousands of users have alleged it caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. Three cases have gone to trial and in each one, juries returned verdicts and tens of millions of dollars in damages for plaintiffs.
Bayer is dealing with two separate sets of legal risks from Roundup, which it acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
The company committed $9.6 billion in June to settle around 125,000 existing claims and lawsuits by Roundup users who were already alleging the product caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The company has resolved all but 30,000 of those claims.
However, because Roundup remains on the market and because there is a 10-year to 15-year lag between exposure and the onset of symptoms, Bayer also faces years of future litigation from people who use glyphosate on their lawns and farms.
NEW PROPOSAL
Bayer said Chhabria's order ""closes the door"" on using a class action to settle those future claims.
Instead, it outlined a new proposal. 
Bayer said it ""will immediately engage with partners to discuss the future of glyphosate-based products in the U.S. residential market,"" which has been the source of most claims that Roundup caused cancer.
The company said it will continue to supply glyphosate products for agricultural users.
The company also said it will seek approval from the Environmental Protection Agency to include a link on Roundup labels to inform consumers of studies about the product.
Chhabria had suggested at a hearing last week that Roundup include on its label a reference to a 2015 finding by the cancer research arm of the World Health Organization that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans.”
He said that would inoculate the company from future litigation, most of which has been brought on the theory that the company has failed to warn consumers of the cancer link to Roundup. 
The company also said it would continue to pursue appeals of the jury verdicts. 
Chhabria said last week the biggest threat to all of the Roundup litigation was a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that the cases were barred by the EPA's finding that Roundup is safe for humans. It is unclear if Bayer will ever get a case before the highest U.S. court.
The company also said it will explore alternatives to address future Roundup claims. 
Bayer will host a conference call on Thursday to discuss the new plan.

The agreement that Chhabria rejected would have paused litigation linking Roundup to non-Hodgkin lymphoma for four years and would have barred Roundup users from seeking punitive damages once the pause on litigation expired. 
In return, users could be eligible for free medical exams and up to $200,000 compensation if they were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Early or late cycle? Fast-running bull market unnerves investors,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) -Will history's longest-ever bull market be followed by one of the shortest?
It's been just over a year since a new business cycle kicked off, yet the speed at which it's progressing is unnerving some investors who fear the swift-running bull market is headed for an abrupt end over the coming year.
Some, pointing to higher-than-usual equity returns and valuations for this stage of the cycle, are even asking whether this could just be the same, decade-old bull market which survived last year's COVID-19 blow.
Either scenario isn't great for markets. The accepted wisdom is that bull markets don't die of old age. They meet their end at the hands of central banks, typically when valuations and leverage get too exuberant. 
So if COVID-19 didn't kill the bull, the Federal Reserve's upcoming stimulus unwind may do it. Such fears have already slowed equity gains in recent weeks, accelerated flows to safe-haven cash and defensive assets.
Grace Peters, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, noted that less than 18 months in, markets were displaying ""mid-cycle"" characteristics that had appeared only around the five-year mark last time.
The S&P 500 index is 24% above the prior bull market peak hit in Feb 2020. After 2008, stocks took roughly five years to achieve that milestone.
Peters noted, too, that equity returns are running already in the ""mid-teens"", faster than the mid-to-high single digits which is typical of the mid-cycle phase.
""I'm surprised by the speed of travel compared to the 2008 crisis... we've been growing cautious about a short-term pullback."" 
The 2009-2020 bull market was the longest ever, racking up global equity gains of 237%. The pandemic then brought on the fastest bear market ever -- classed as a 20% top-to-bottom drop.
That bear was quickly chased away by central banks which slashed interest rates and turned on the money-printing presses. Since then global stocks have risen 73% - $42 trillion in value.
Those moves indicate a new cycle, technically at least. But the shallow bear market and the much faster and stronger bounceback are causing some to have doubts.
""We never had an extended down cycle,"" said  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV)'s chief equity investment officer Edward Perkin said. ""This equity market is either mid- to late-cycle or it is in the second act of the previous cycle that never ended.""
The cycle would likely be ended by monetary policy moves, possibly if Fed tightening sends the economy back into recession, Perkin said, though he saw it as an issue for 2022.
EARLY ECONOMY, LATE MARKETS
Valuations are, arguably, another danger signal. The cycle restarted with higher valuations and the S&P 500 trades already at an exuberant 21 times forward earnings.
Research by Kleinwort Hambros on market cycles going back to 1870 shows that cyclically adjusted price/earnings -- the CAPE ratio -- are 11.5 times on average when a bull market starts and around 20 times when it ends. 
But the cycle that kicked off last March started with a 24.8 CAPE ratio which is now at 37, the study shows.
Valuations are of course inflated by stimulus -- $30 trillion since last March by some estimates, much higher than the preceding decade. Interest rates far lower than during past cycles make share prices look less outrageous.
Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros noted that as markets have galloped on, a disconnect has arisen with the economy which still displays early-cycle features such as high joblessness. 
That unusual situation makes his positioning more cautious than it would normally be this stage of the cycle, he said. 
The question is how quickly economies will catch up. 
""Fed tapering is a risk but if it's replaced by genuinely stronger macro activity then you don't need that much liquidity. In a perfect world, stronger fundamentals will offset the taper,"" Kamal said.

If not, markets will look to central banks again. Norman Villamin, chief investment officer of Swiss asset manager UBP said the post-2008 years show policymakers will act against any slowdowns, effectively creating mini-cycles.
""I think we're reasonably early in the cycle,"" he said, but ""it is important to distinguish between the bigger picture trends and these mini-cycles.""

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is closing its Indonesian onshore institutional equities trading business, the investment bank said on Thursday in response to queries from Reuters.
Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it ""intends to cease its onshore broker-dealer activities in Indonesia. The firm remains committed to Indonesia and will continue to provide our global clients access to the equity market working with qualified local brokerage partners.""
Sources familiar with the decision said the move will affect about 10 roles and the investment bank will carry out sales, trading and research functions from its Southeast Asian hub of Singapore.

The onshore Indonesian equities business was opened in 2012 following an announcement by Morgan Stanley's CEO James Gorman in November 2011 while he was visiting Jakarta. He had said in a statement that growing the firm's business in Indonesia was an ""important strategic priority and commitment"" for the bank.
Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that its research coverage will also be provided offshore from Singapore but added that PT Morgan Stanley Sekuritas Indonesia will continue to serve the investment banking clients onshore.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions targeting technology companies have hit a record high in Asia Pacific, Dealogic data shows, and dealmakers expect this M&A pace to continue as the pandemic spurs a shift toward virtual activities in the economy.
Tech M&A has totalled $136.2 billion in 2020, more than double the year-ago levels, according to data provider Dealogic. 
Tech deals accounted for 28% of the regions' overall M&A transactions, which totalled $482.4 billion as of Wednesday, the highest share in at least a decade, the data shows.
This boom ""is a result of technology changing the way our economy works"", said Jung Min, co-head of M&A and Technology, Media and Telecom at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Asia (ex-Japan). 
""For a consumer, it affects how you shop, pay, eat, move and entertain. For a business, it affects how you recruit top employees, source your supply chain, manufacture and, of course, sell to customers,"" he added.
For businesses to ensure they have the required scale to win in this environment, M&A is ""transformational"", he said.
Corporate executives are also bullish on the sector, a survey by law firm Baker McKenzie shows.
The survey of 800 senior executives in Asia Pacific shows over three quarters of the respondents predicting tech deals would increase markedly in the next 12 months.
In the survey, conducted in the first quarter and published on Thursday, 92% said technology, media and telecoms companies would drive their own deal activity, while 57% said they would acquire new technology and associated expertise.
""This signals major consolidation across the tech sector, as fast growth companies snap up rival firms and complementary platforms, and move into new markets,"" the report said.
In April, Grab Holdings, the largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm in Southeast Asia, went public in the world's biggest $40 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company.
Grab's rival Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia have also announced a merger to create a multi-billion dollar tech company in Indonesia's largest-ever deal.

Mega deals in the pipeline also include a possible take-private of Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp. 
Toshiba has hired UBS to advise on a strategic review, amid calls from shareholders to explicitly seek offers from potential suitors after it dismissed a $20 billion take-private bid from CVC Capital this year.

Investing.com – Hong Kong-based media publisher Next Digital Ltd. saw its shares soar on Thursday morning. It was the company’s first day of trading following the suspension of its shares more than a week ago after founder Jimmy Lai’s assets were frozen under Hong Kong’s national security law.
Next Digital (HK:0282) shares in Hong Kong were up 69.35% to HKD0.315 ($0.04058) by 13:44 AM ET (5:44 AM GMT). They opened the session 141.9% higher on the back of retail investors’ support for Lai and his publications.
“There are a lot of investors who are willing to speculate in this stock, it’s crazy,” Wealthy Securities managing director Louis Tse told Reuters.
“I don’t think the moves are based on any kind of financial fundaments for the stock.”
Next Digital’s shares were suspended on May 17, following Lai’s sentence to 14 months in prison the month before for participating in 2019’s social unrest.
Next Digital, the parent company of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily publication, said on Wednesday that the company has enough cash for at least 18 months starting from April 1 without additional funding from Lai, who owns a 71.26% stake in the firm. The company also said it has HKD521.4 million ($67.17 million) in its unaudited bank and cash balances as of March 31.
The publisher also said on Wednesday that Hong Kong’s National Security Department had notified the company’s chief executive Cheung Kim Hung that Lai would be barred from dealing in assets, including shares in the listed company and bank accounts of three firms directly or indirectly wholly owned by Lai.
However, Next Digital said the notice will not affect its stock trading. “The board does not expect the issue of the notice to have an immediate negative effect on the financial situation or operations of the group,” said Cheung."

TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp's bank borrowing climbed by 42% in the year to March-end with the increase shouldered by foreign lenders, company filings showed on Thursday. 
Borrowing from the conglomerate's principal lenders rose to 4.98 trillion yen ($46 billion) in the last business year, with main bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc the only Japanese lender remaining in the top three backers.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) are among SoftBank's biggest lenders, the filings showed, with the borrowing coming as the Japanese conglomerate builds its technology investing operations globally. 
SoftBank has experienced rapidly changing fortunes over the last year, with its stock price and portfolio valuations plummeting in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the group into asset sales.

Chief Executive Masayoshi Son pledged to use cash reserves as a defence but with earnings rebounding and a recently completed share buyback driving stock-price recovery, the firm has expanded backing for its second Vision Fund to $30 billion.

(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration defended on Wednesday a proposed ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) oil development in Alaska, backing the drilling project which was approved under the administration of former President Donald Trump.
""A Wednesday filing by the U.S. Department of Justice continues to defend a 2020 Record of Decision for the Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve – Alaska (NPR-A)"" a spokesman of the U.S. Interior Department said in an email.
In February, an appeals court blocked construction of ConocoPhillips' $2 billion-plus Willow crude oil project in Alaska. Wednesday's development comes even as Interior Secretary Deb Haaland had opposed the project last year when she was a member of Congress.
The Trump administration approved the Willow development plan in October. Permits to mine for gravel and build roads were issued on the morning of Jan. 20, just before Biden was sworn in as the nation's 46th president.
Environmental groups had sued, making the argument that the government failed to take into account the impact that drilling would have on fragile wildlife.
""The filing (on Wednesday) maintains that the decision complied with NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) standards in place at the time, and that the plaintiffs did not challenge the Record of Decision within the time limitations associated with environmental review for projects in the NPR-A"", according to the statement shared by a Department of Interior spokesman. 
The project has been pushed by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, who along with another Republican senator, Dan Sullivan, discussed the oil project during a meeting with Biden on Monday, according to Politico. 

Murkowski said the engagement with the Biden administration officials since that meeting was ""very productive"".
Willow holds 590 million barrels of recoverable oil and could produce up to 160,000 barrels per day as soon as 2024, according to ConocoPhillips' previous estimates.

The project represents an investment of 36.6 billion Mexican pesos ($1.84 billion) and includes the design, manufacture, delivery, testing and commissioning of 42 trains, the National Tourism Promotion Fund (Fonatur) said in a statement.
The consortium was led by Bombardier Transportation México SA de CV and also included France-based  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA , Mexican firm Gami Ingenieria e Instalaciones S.A. de C.V, the Mexican unit of Azvi S.A.U. known as Construcciones Urales S.A. de C.V., and Construcciones Urales Procesos Industriales SA de C.V.
The consortium's proposal came in 890 million pesos lower than the second offer received, Fonatur said. The first tests of the equipment for the project will be carried out by 2023.
The 1,470-km (913-mile) Mayan Train rail line is designed to connect tourist hot spots from southern Chiapas state to the Yucatan Peninsula along the Atlantic coast, including the popular Maya ruins of Palenque and Chichen Itza to the beach resort Cancun.
French trainmaker Alstom participated in the building of Mexico City's Line 12 metro railway, which recently collapsed in one section, as part of a consortium that also included Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's construction arm Grupo Carso and Mexico's ICA.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Air freight market becomes a bright spot for Boeing in China,"By Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed
BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, struggling in China with sales of passenger planes due to trade tensions and the grounding of its 737 MAX, is upbeat about the outlook for freighter plane sales there as e-commerce demand booms.
A three-year deadlock on Boeing plane orders was broken last May when China Cargo Airlines, owned by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp Ltd, placed an order for two 777 widebody freighters. Boeing's website shows 24 of the type have been delivered to China.
""We've seen this really explosive demand for dedicated freighter airplanes in the last year,"" said Richard Wynne, managing director of China marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
Though political friction between China and the United States has meant no Chinese orders for new Boeing passenger planes since 2017, Boeing's dominance of the freighter market makes it harder to bypass.
Around 90% of the world's freighters are Boeing planes. Sources have said, however, that rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) is canvassing interest in a freighter version of its A350 passenger jet.
Boeing's products include new-build freighters like the 747, 777 and 767 as well as conversions of older 737 and 767 passenger planes.
It forecasts China, including Hong Kong, will need 750 more freighters over the next 20 years, including 350 widebodies.
Much of the current demand is being driven by a pandemic-induced expansion of online shopping.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and major e-commerce rivals JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) have all reported forecast-beating revenue growth recently.
YTO Cargo Airlines, owned by Alibaba-backed YTO Express, is introducing converted 767 planes to its fleet.
Boeing has eight 737 passenger-to-freighter production lines in China that allow for one conversion at a time.
China's air freight market is less than half of the size of the United States by tonnage but growing at a faster rate, said Wynne. 
Chinese airlines also fly relatively less of the air freight that goes in and out of the country than carriers in other parts of Asia, leaving room for market share growth, he added.
Air freight rates have skyrocketed as demand has returned to pre-pandemic levels while overall capacity is much reduced due to the drop-off in passenger flights that carry cargo in the planes' bellies.

Wynne said rates were forecast to stay strong for the foreseeable future while international travel remained weak. 
""You would imagine a more gradual trend down (for freight rates) as more widebody planes come back online, but they should stay robust for quite some time,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's remuneration for the past business year fell by 52% to 100 million yen ($915,000) including basic pay, a filing from the Japanese conglomerate showed on Thursday.
The disclosure ahead of SoftBank's annual general meeting on June 23 follows a turbulent year which saw the group pounded by the COVID-19 pandemic before rebounding to record profit on market appetite for its technology investments. 
Son, who has spoken of the need to pay top dollar to attract talent, received the modest pay package just as his fortune was lifted by recovery in the group's share price after a $23 billion buyback programme which also boosted his ownership https://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-group-stocks-idCNL4N2ML1W7.
The entrepreneur's stake in the company he founded is worth around $38 billion at Wednesday's closing price of 8,274 yen. 
The filing also showed Simon Segars, CEO of Britain-based chip designer Arm, received the largest disclosed remuneration of 1.9 billion yen. SoftBank agreed to sell Arm https://www.reuters.com/article/arm-holdings-m-a-nvidia-idUSKBN26507O to U.S. chip firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in November in a $40 billion deal that is yet to receive regulatory approval.
The filing did not reveal full numeration for top SoftBank executives including Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra and Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure who left the group's board in November, as their pay after that point was not disclosed.
Misra's disclosed remuneration was 931 million yen ($8.5 million) - down 42% when compared with the year prior, when he sat on the board for the full 12 months. Claure's remuneration fell 15% to roughly 1.8 billion yen, with his package including the cost of his relocation to the United States.
In total eight executives received $64 million, including former strategy chief Katsunori Sago who has since left the firm https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN2AX111.
SoftBank announced further changes to its board last week including the nomination https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-corporate-governance-idCAKCN2D305H of a gaming industry executive Keiko Erikawa, chair of Koei Tecmo Holdings Co Ltd.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning as investors await clarity on inflation trends and tapering prospects.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.57% by 10:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT), as investors await data, including the Jobs/applications ratio for April and the Tokyo Core Consumer Price Index for May, to be released on Friday.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.84%. The Bank of Korea handed down its policy decision earlier in the day and kept the interest rate unchanged at 0.50%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.17%. Australia’s second-most populous state of Victoria announced a one-week COVID-19 lockdown from May 27 to June 3 to deal with a fresh COVID-19 outbreak.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.08%. China’s Shanghai Composite inched was up 0.91% while and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.24%.
Investors continue to monitor how the price pressure will impact Fed’s current dovish monetary policy even if policymakers have insisted that they expect that the inflation will be temporary and the central bank will not hike interest rate for a while.
“Investors appear to be giving the Fed the benefit of the doubt with their transitory inflation forecast, but we suspect the window of confidence could close without supporting evidence in coming months,” Craig W. Johnson, technical market strategist at Piper Sandler & Co., told Bloomberg.
Johnson also expects economic uncertainty and volatility will likely stay high as investors await Fed clarification on whether it will taper asset purchases.
Randy Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said on Wednesday that it will become important at some stage for the central bank to discuss tapering its asset purchase program should inflation rise.
Though ""we need to remain patient"" in any policy shift, ""if my expectations about economic growth, employment and inflation over the coming months are borne out ... and especially if they come in strong ... it will become important for the (Federal Open Market Committee) to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings,"" Quarles added, echoing comments made by Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida earlier in the week.
Some investors remained skeptical even amid Fed reassurances that it would not alter its current dovish policy in the short term.
""While the efforts by various Fed speakers appeared to have assuaged market concerns, doubt remains,"" GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller told Reuters.
""What that means is that after a period where monthly inflation reports have largely been sidelined as a market focus, that they once again assume primacy they once enjoyed as the statistical report that matters,"" Miller added.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 11:11PM ET</span>","U.S. Senate panel advances EV tax credit of up to $12,500","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Finance Committee advanced legislation on Wednesday that would boost electric vehicle tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs that are assembled by union workers in the United States.
The bill would limit tax credits to vehicles with a retail price below $80,000 to qualify for the tax credits. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500 with no maximum price and currently phases out for individual automakers once they hit 200,000 total EVs sold.
Both General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have hit the cap and currently do not qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.
The ""Clean Energy for America"" bill, which advanced on a 14-14 tie vote, would eliminate the existing EV cap, while the credit would phase-out over three years once 50% of U.S. passenger vehicle sales were EVs. It has numerous other green energy tax incentives and would rescind or cut many fossil fuel tax provisions.
The EV proposal led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, would boost the $7,500 tax credit by $2,500 for vehicles assembled in the United States and another $2,500 for cars at facilities whose production workers are members of, or represented by, a labor union.
That would mean smaller credits to automakers such as Tesla, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and others who do not have U.S. union workers, and companies building EVs outside the United States.
The EV incentives are estimated to cost $31.6 billion through 2031, according to a congressional estimate. The bill must still be approved by the full Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries and new incentives to purchase commercial electric vehicles.
President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion for electric-vehicles and charging stations, including $100 billion for consumer rebates. Last week at a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) factory in Michigan, Biden ruled out consumer incentives for high-priced electric luxury models and urged automakers not to build EVs abroad for U.S. consumers.
United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble praised the legislation for ensuring ""EV production will directly create the good paying union jobs of the future President Biden has championed.""
Stabenow said a century ago as automakers were debating between electric and gasoline-powered vehicles Congress provided tax incentives for the oil industry.
""We picked a winner and they won - 100 years ago,"" Stabenow said ""And now we're just trying to level the playing field.""

Republicans said Democrats were using the tax code to devastate the oil and gas industry. They also cited reports that children are involved in some countries in the mining of minerals for EV batteries.
""This is a frontal assault on my state,"" said Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas. ""This is an ideological jihad against the status quo... where many jobs in our country depend on the oil and gas sector.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares in jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai's Next Digital Ltd soared on Thursday, the first day of trading after a suspension of longer than a week following a freeze in the pro-democracy activist's assets under the national security law.
In a late Wednesday statement, the media publisher said it had enough working capital for at least 18 months from April 1 without additional funding from Lai, its controlling shareholder.
Shares opened 141.9% higher at HK$0.45, the highest since December 2020, when Lai was charged under the security law imposed by China earlier that year. They then extended gains to HK$0.80, the highest since August 2020, when Lai was first arrested and national security police raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper.
The stock can be highly volatile as trade is dominated by retail investors, and its spikes are often a result of buyers' showing support for Lai and his pro-democracy publications.
""There are a lot of investors who are willing to speculate in this stock, it’s crazy,"" said Wealthy Securities managing director Louis Tse. ""I don’t think the moves are based on any kind of financial fundaments for the stock.""
Hong Kong's National Security Department had notified Next Digital's chief executive, Cheung Kim Hung, that Lai was prohibited from dealing in assets, including shares in the listed company and bank accounts of three firms directly or indirectly wholly owned by Lai, the publisher said in a statement late on Wednesday.
""The board does not expect the issue of the notice to have an immediate negative effect on the financial situation or operations of the group,"" Cheung said in the statement. 
Next Digital's shares were suspended on May 17.
Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid published by Next Digital, said at the time the group had sufficient working capital for nine to 10 months. 
On Wednesday, Next Digital said its unaudited bank and cash balances amounted to HK$521.4 million ($67.17 million) as of March 31. It added that it expected cost savings in the longer run as a result of a recent decision to stop publishing Taiwan Apple Daily in print.
Next Digital, in which Lai owns a 71.26% stake, also said it did not expect the notice from national security authorities to affect the trading volume of the shares in the company. 
Lai, a staunch Beijing critic seen as a traitor in China, was sentenced to 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019, and is among the most high-profile arrests made under the security law. He faces three more charges, including collusion with a foreign country.

Lai is due in court on Friday, where he will hear a sentence for another unauthorised assembly, on Oct. 1, 2019 - China's national day. He had pleaded guilty.

(Reuters) - A tiny hedge fund dealt a major blow to  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Wednesday, unseating at least two board members in a bid to force the company's leadership to reckon with the risk of failing to adjust its business strategy to match global efforts to combat climate change.
The success by hedge fund Engine No. 1 in its showdown with Exxon shocked an energy industry struggling to address growing investor concerns about global warming. It happened on the same day activists scored a big win against another oil major, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) - a Dutch court ordered the company to drastically deepen pledged cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
Eight of Exxon's nominees including CEO Darren Woods were re-elected to its 12-member board of directors, along with two of Engine No. 1's nominees, the company said. The counting is not finished, so Engine No. 1 could potentially see three of its four nominees join the Exxon board.
The result will add to pressure on Woods, who campaigned to convince shareholders to shoot down the board challenge and argued the company was already advancing low carbon projects and improving profits.
""Today, we heard shareholders communicate a desire for ExxonMobil to further these efforts,"" Woods said in a statement. ""We're well positioned to do that.""
Under Woods, Exxon incurred a $22 billion loss last year as COVID-19 pandemic destroyed fuel demand worldwide. Exxon has lagged other oil majors in its response to climate change concerns, forecasting many more years of oil and gas demand growth and doubling down on spending to boost its output - in contrast to global rivals that have scaled back fossil fuel investments. 
""It's a huge deal. It shows not just that there is more seriousness apparent in the thinking among investors about climate change, it's a rebuff of the whole attitude of the Exxon board,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director of ESG Research at MSCI.
The dissident shareholder group led by Engine No. 1 put up a slate of four nominees in the first big boardroom contest at an oil major that makes climate change the central issue. The fund's stake in Exxon - an energy behemoth with a market value of close to $250 billion - is worth just $50 million. 
NEW DIRECTION
The two Engine No. 1 nominees elected were Gregory Goff, a 64-year-old former top executive at Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Andeavor, and former Neste Oyj executive Kaisa Hietala.
""We welcome the new directors, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, to the board and look forward to working with them constructively and collectively on behalf of all shareholders,"" CEO Woods said at the end of Exxon's shareholder meeting.
Vote counting to determine the final two seats was continuing. That left the re-election of directors Steven Kandarian, Douglas Oberhelman, Samuel Palmisano and Wan Zulkiflee up in the air. Alexander Karsner, one of Engine No. 1's nominees, was still in the running, Exxon said.
Governments and companies have moved to reduce emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the planet by investing in wind and solar energy. Investors led by Engine No. 1 have said Woods needed to make big changes to ensure Exxon's future value to investors.
The fund successfully rallied support from institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms upset with Irving, Texas-based Exxon for its weak financial performance in recent years. Among those were BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Exxon's second-largest shareholder, who agreed to vote for three members of Engine No. 1's slate.
BlackRock said the three bring ""fresh perspectives and relevant transformative energy experience"" that would help Exxon evaluate ""the risks and opportunities presented by the energy transition,"" according to a note posted on its website.
Exxon shares rose 1.2% to $58.94 on the day. The stock has lagged its peers over the last five years.
Woods had argued that Exxon's board understood the company's complexity and that Exxon supports a path toward carbon reductions in the Paris accord, the international agreement aimed at combating climate change.
However, in another signal of investor dissatisfaction with the company's approach to climate change, shareholders also approved measures calling on Exxon to provide more information on its climate and grassroots lobbying efforts. 
""Exxon Mobil shareholders chose real action to address the climate crisis over business as usual in the fossil fuel industry,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who in April said the state's pension fund backed Engine No. 1.
DiNapoli said that for years, investors have ""received platitudes and gaslighting in response"" from Exxon in response to concerns about the climate crisis.
Exxon had fought to keep climate activists at bay, spending tens of millions of dollars on a high-profile PR campaign, agreeing to publish more details of its emissions and coming out in support of carbon reduction. Activists said it was too little, too late, and that Exxon needs a less reactive strategy.

""We are sending new board members, seasoned in managing change in the fossil fuel industry, to help put the company back on track,"" DiNapoli said.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 09:25PM ET</span>",New hedge funds bask in Exxon's climate spotlight,"By Ross Kerber and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -The successful board challenge against  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) casts a spotlight on two recently launched sustainability-focused investment firms that took opposite sides in the high-stakes battle: Engine No. 1 and Inclusive Capital Partners. 
Engine No. 1 set the spark in January by formally nominating four directors to Exxon's board, accusing it of not moving fast enough to diversify away from fossil fuels. Inclusive Capital Partners sided with Exxon after its founder Jeffrey Ubben joined the energy giant's board in March, and argued it was already working with the company to improve its technology in areas such as carbon capture.
Both funds were launched less than a year ago. Their quick ascendance to Exxon's board underscores how Wall Street's new focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) is opening doors for activist hedge funds at some of the world's largest companies. 
Engine No. 1 was launched by hedge fund veteranChris James in December 2020. Charles Penner, Engine No. 1's head of active engagement, spent much of his career at activist hedge fund Jana Partners, where he quarterbacked a campaign to get iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to create tools for parents to track and limit the use of children's' smartphones.
From the start, the team had the backing of U.S. pension fund CalSTRS, which provides benefits for California teachers.
""We called for change at ExxonMobil, and a record number of shareholders, including many of the largest investors in the world, voted to hold the company accountable,"" the pension fund said in a statement after the vote on Wednesday.
Engine No. 1 reported as of the end of March owning 917,400 Exxon shares valued at $51 million - a sum that traditionally would barely get a phone call returned from a company like Exxon, whose current market capitalization stands around $250 billion. Yet thanks to the backing of some of the biggest Wall Street fund managers such as BlackRock, it has won at least two seats on Exxon's board.
Lawyers and industry analysts who worked with Penner said he had immersed himself for years in researching how to take on the oil giant and speaking to other Exxon shareholders.
Engine No. 1 ""did an effective job of making their case, and it appears that investors are saying that with their votes,"" said Tim Youmans, engagement leader for EOS at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), which advises clients how to vote.
Ubben founded Inclusive Capital in June of last year after leaving ValueAct Capital, the activist hedge fund he launched in 2000. He had a built a reputation for pushing for change outside the limelight and working more collaboratively with management than many other activists.
He has described Inclusive Capital as a return-driven environmental and social activist firm and raised concerns about the sustainable products being sold by big index funds. In a recent regulatory filing the firm said it owned 1.6 million share of Exxon, valued at $93.6 million.
Ubben defended Exxon against Engine No. 1's criticism, and as of Wednesday morning Ubben was still calling top Exxon investors to make the company's case, according to people familiar with the matter. While the result is a setback for Ubben, he gets to keep a board seat at Exxon he may not have gained if the oil major was not seeking to defend itself against Engine No. 1 in the first place.
Representatives for Ubben did not immediately comment for this article. 
A spokesman for Engine No. 1 referred to Penner's statement at Wednesday's annual meeting in which he said the firm has ""learned that change can happen anywhere. It will always be a long shot, but it will always be worth it.""

In a statement on its website on Wednesday a top Exxon investor BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said it backed three of the four dissident nominees. 
Those directors, ""together with Mr. Ubben, bring the fresh perspectives and relevant transformative energy experience to the Board that will help the company position itself competitively in addressing the risks and opportunities presented by the energy transition,"" BlackRock said.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 09:21PM ET</span>","Wall Street bank CEOs to tout COVID relief push, diversity efforts before Congress","By Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street bank chiefs will tout the role their institutions have played in getting the pandemic-hit U.S. economy back on track when they appear before Congress this week, but are likely to face tough questions on hot-button social and economic issues.
The Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees will hear from the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
In prepared testimony posted on Tuesday, the CEOs highlighted their banks' resilience during the pandemic and their efforts to support struggling clients. They also flagged their work on other priorities, including efforts to address climate change and structural racism.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said climate change is ""one of the defining issues of our time,"" while Citigroup chief Jane Fraser said the banking industry cannot ignore the role it played in the past in contributing to ""systemic inequities."" 
Wednesday's hearing is the first time the CEOs of the nation's largest banks will have testified before the Senate Banking Committee since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Democratic gains in the 2020 election handed control of that panel to Senator Sherrod Brown, a fierce Wall Street critic.
Brown said in an interview on Monday that banks' success steering through the pandemic was not enough.
""They did well, but they did well for themselves,"" he said. ""Every time there's a crisis, banks seem to do better than the rest of the country.""
While the hearings are unlikely to result in policy proposals, they are politically risky for the CEOs as scrutiny of their industry grows in Washington under Democratic leadership.
They are likely to be grilled on a raft of issues including economic inequality, fair lending, diversity, racial justice, climate change, cryptocurrencies and tax policies.
""We expect these hearings to be disjointed and nebulous, but they will be must-watch television, nonetheless,"" Isaac Boltansky, a director at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note. 
The banking industry's image has improved in Washington since the financial crisis more than a decade ago and big banks believe they have a good story to tell after getting $69 billion of COVID-19 aid into the hands of 850,000 struggling small businesses. 
INDUSTRY WATERSHED
Wednesday will mark a watershed for the industry with Citigroup's Fraser, the first female CEO of a Wall Street bank, making her Capitol Hill debut. 
She will appear alongside Dimon, Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, Well Fargo's Charles Scharf, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon.
""Diversity, equity, inclusion – these banks have a great story to tell on these issues,"" said Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association.
Still, the executives are likely to get heat from some lawmakers, particularly progressives who want them to do more to tackle wealth inequality, racial injustice and climate change. 
The legislators are also likely to seek answers from the CEOs on evidence flagged by congressional reports that lenders discriminated against some borrowers when distributing pandemic aid, and whether Wall Street's wealthy pay enough taxes. 

Republicans, on the other hand, are angry at what they see as Wall Street's liberal leanings and will likely criticize the CEOs for trying to drive social policies by curtailing credit for sectors such as gunmakers, private prisons and oil and gas. 
""Banks influencing elements of social policy...presents a perilous political dynamic as attempts to placate the left will undoubtedly frustrate their historic allies on the right,"" wrote Boltansky.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 09:10PM ET</span>",Asset managers should set out ESG principles for securities lending,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asset managers who lend their securities should create policies using environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles for how they recall their shares for voting, and what collateral they accept, industry groups said on Thursday.
Owners of shares or other securities can lend them, for a fee, to other investors to hold them temporarily to short the stock, or for other purposes, such as hedging.
Often highly profitable for the lenders, opponents of the practice say it can conflict with ESG investing, an increasingly important trend that accounts for investment worth tens of trillions of dollars. 
Major concerns are that asset owners who have lent their shares could be unable to vote for policies which fit with their ESG goals at company general meetings, and that they accept securities that do not meet their ESG standards as collateral for securities they have lent. 
Securities lenders should develop a recall policy based on ESG considerations in their proxy voting framework, identifying the types of resolutions on which they want to vote by company and issue, the Pan Asia Securities Lending Association (PASLA), and the Risk Management Association said in a series of guidelines published on Thursday. 
They should also establish what collateral they would accept, and consider applying the same standards around collateral that they use when making investments, the guidelines added. 
""All investment products need to start thinking about ESG,"" said Paul Solway a PASLA director. 
While imposing restrictions on how shares can be lent would affect how easy it would be to find borrowers, and the returns asset managers would generate from lending, ""it is about finding that balance, and identifying the commercial and viable options,"" he said.

Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, stopped lending its overseas shares for short-selling in late 2019, calling the practice inconsistent with its responsibilities as a long-term investor.
A PASLA survey last year found market participants thought securities lending could be compatible with ESG investing.

(Reuters) -The Centers for Disease Control said it had approved one cruise ship from  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) to resume sailing in June, more than a year after U.S. cruising was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Celebrity Cruises' Celebrity Edge will depart from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on June 26, the cruise company said. It will be the first U.S. departing cruise in a more than a year with paying passengers.
""Cruising from the U.S. is back!"" Richard D. Fain, Royal Caribbean Group chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement.
The CDC said it is committed to working with the cruise industry and ports to resume cruising in a phased approach.
""CDC and the cruise industry agree that the industry has what it needs to move forward and no additional roadblocks exist for resuming sailing by mid-summer,"" the agency said on Wednesday.
The ship will skip a simulated voyage because it requiring crew and passengers to be vaccinated, the CDC said.
Royal Caribbean said all sailings will depart with vaccinated crew and everyone over 16 must present proof of vaccination against COVID-19. From August 1, all guests ages 12 and older must present proof of vaccination.

The inaugural sailing sets the stage for Royal Caribbean Group to announce additional itineraries, the company added.
The state of Florida, which was later joined by Alaska, sued President Joe Biden’s administration in federal court in April, seeking to overturn the CDC's decision to prevent the U.S. cruise industry from immediately resuming operations. A federal judge sent that lawsuit to mediation last week.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - World stocks will continue to rise this year on robust economic and earnings recoveries but any quickening of inflation would temper that enthusiasm, according to Reuters polls of analysts, a majority of whom said a near-term correction was unlikely.
Around this time last year, global equity markets were haemorrhaging from the pandemic-driven economic damage but that was followed by a huge upswing, boosted by unprecedented stimulus and the recovery at hand.
While stocks have continued to rise significantly this year, the news flow on inflation has whipsawed financial markets - with equities falling on data pointing to increased price pressures and rising on reaffirmed dovish monetary policy stances.
Reuters polls of nearly 300 equity strategists taken May 10-26 showed all 17 stock indexes surveyed on were forecast to rise, with annual gains in nearly all of them predicted to be in double digits this year.
""When it comes to assessing the market environment we prefer to choose 'half full'. We will remain vigilant for rebalancing opportunities ... as we expect rates and equities to drift higher,"" noted Ehiwario Efeyini, senior market strategy analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""In terms of the broader economic environment, we are closer to mid-cycle than late cycle and that growth is currently flashing bright green and surprising more than expected.""
But forecast gains for 15 of those 17 bourses to end-2021 were lower than year-to-date returns, suggesting more modest rises and concentrated within specific sectors, rather than a broad and significant leg higher.
""The rotation in stock markets has further to go over the next few years, as many of the factors which have worked in its favour since late last year resume,"" noted Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics.
""However, we expect bond yields, especially in the U.S., to resume their rise. Meanwhile, we are forecasting a strong recovery in the global economy and that will boost the relative appeal of value stocks.""
Nine indexes were forecast to surpass their current peaks, including the benchmark S&P 500 index - which is already up nearly 12% this year and forecast to rise 2.5% further to a life high by end-2021. 
""There's still some fuel left in the tank"" for the U.S. stock market, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""A lot of folks are still coming to grips with the fact that the earnings outlook will be a lot better than was expected even as recently as a few months ago.""
When asked what was more likely for corporate earnings for the rest of this year, over 80% of strategists, or 92 of 114, said they would rise, including 49 respondents who expected a significant rise.
The remaining 22 said decline or about the same.
""HUNT FOR YIELD""
In response to another question, over half the strategists, or 55 of 97, said ""hunt for yield"" would sway global stock markets in the next three months, while 42 expected ""safe-haven bets"" to drive markets.
When asked on valuations at current levels, over three-quarters of analysts, or 86 of 110, said equity markets they covered needed to gain at least another 5% to be called expensive, including 47 who expected a run up of 15% or more was required.
The remaining 24 analysts said they were already over-valued.
That lines up with responses to another question, where about 60% of strategists, or 67 of 115, said a significant correction over the coming three months was unlikely in the markets they cover.
The remaining 48 respondents said likely.

""Investors have voiced concern that peaking fundamentals are a harbinger for stock prices,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""We agree Q221 will experience the fastest economic and earnings growth in the reopening period, the result of the vaccine rollout and government stimulus. We disagree, however, that peaking growth represents a headwind for market success.""
Canada's main stock index was forecast to climb above the 20,000 threshold for the first time by end-2021, while Japanese shares were expected to recover and reach a 30-year peak. 
Brazil's equity market was forecast to surpass its current peak, but was predicted to be on course for its second slowest year since 2015, with investors worried about the mounting human and financial toll of COVID-19 in the country. 

Indian shares were predicted to continue their recent rise and by year-end nudge past a life high hit before the latest coronavirus wave took hold. [EPOLL/IN]
But European stocks were set to hold around or inch just above current record levels as the initial boost from the region's V-shaped recovery after the COVID-19 downturn was expected to lose momentum.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon's move to buy the MGM movie and TV studio will provide fuel for the Seattle company's critics in the nation's capitol who complain it is already too big and powerful, but experts said the deal poses few classic antitrust concerns. 
    A little more than an hour after the deal was announced, Republican Senator Josh Hawley blasted Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a ""monopoly platform"" on Twitter, adding, ""This sale should not go through,"" and that the company shouldn't be allowed to buy anything.
And Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate's antitrust panel, called for ""a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won't risk harming competition."" 
The announcement also comes just one day after Washington, DC's attorney general filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com, alleging the online retailer broke antitrust law with unfair pricing strategies.
The $8.45 billion merger would combine the world's biggest online retailer with a film and TV studio that has a storied past but has struggled to keep up with rivals including  Disney .
    MGM, which owns the James Bond franchise and made ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" also made classic films like the ""Rocky"" series and ""Princess Bride."" But look at the top ten grossing films of 2018 and 2019 and MGM is absent, according to boxofficemojo. As is Amazon.
Amazon's Prime Video, which is bundled with subscriptions to Amazon's service that promises quick deliveries of purchases, also faces well-financed rivals including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, HBO Max and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Apple TV+. The companies are increasing investments in international markets, aiming to capture the pandemic-led expansion of binge-watching shows online. 
    Given the state of competition in the two markets, antitrust agencies which police mergers for anticompetitive behavior would likely struggle to convince a court that the deal will mean higher prices or less innovation.
""It seems like the market shares aren't big enough to attract the attention of today's antitrust enforcers,"" said Chris Sagers, a professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law with a focus on antitrust, who noted that because of its size, ""people will be concerned because it's Amazon.""
Amazon declined to comment on this story but in an October 2020 blog post noted that ""large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong."" 
Amazon has come under criticism for buying competitors, like online shoe seller Zappos in 2009 and Diapers.com in 2010, and that criticism is likely to continue.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, when she was running for president, explicitly called for federal regulators to undo ""anti-competitive mergers,"" including Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos.
""Amazon is prioritizing monopolizing content for the streaming service while completely failing to address the real concerns of workers, small businesses, and regulators,"" said Alex Harman, a competition policy advocate for Public Citizen.

Antitrust experts have been studying Amazon's purchase of the Whole Foods supermarket chain in 2017 for clues about how the MGM deal might be handled. That merger was quickly approved by U.S. competition regulators even though Amazon was at that time much criticized for allegedly using its market power to dominate different retail sectors. 
""For political reasons, they might spend more time with this acquisition than they did with Whole Foods but for practical reasons it might end up the same,"" said Andre Barlow, antitrust expert with Doyle, Barlow and Mazard.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",Nvidia forecast beats expectations but crypto mining's role remains unclear,"By Tiyashi Datta and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp forecast second-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates on Wednesday, but shares fell 1% after-hours as the company could not say for certain how much of its recent revenue rise was driven by the volatile cryptocurrency-mining market.
Demand for Nvidia graphics chips for video gaming boomed through the pandemic. This added several years of rapid sales growth for data center chips used in artificial intelligence applications such as image recognition. 
But on Wednesday investors again seemed put off by a surge in purchases of Nvidia chips for cryptocurrency mining, which tends to occur when the value of the currencies rises. To distinguish volatile demand for crypto-mining chips from its other more stable business lines that investors are tracking closely, Nvidia has tried to use technical changes to steer miners away from its gaming chips and toward purpose-built chips for mining.
Nvidia said those crypto-specific chips brought in $155 million in its first quarter. The company said crypto miners also gave its much larger gaming chip segment a boost but it was not sure by how much. Crypto-specific chip sales are expected to rise to $400 million in the second quarter, the company said.
In an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said making gaming chips less suitable for miners helps keep them available for gamers.
""It effectively increases our production and supply"" of gaming chips, Huang said.
Nvidia also said it still expects to close its $40 billion deal to purchase British chip technology firm Arm Ltd by March 2022. The deal has drawn scrutiny from regulators in the United States and Britain and also needs approval from European and Chinese authorities.
The company expects revenue this quarter of $6.30 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with analysts' estimates of $5.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's total revenue was $5.66 billion during the first quarter, beating estimates of $5.41 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted profit was $3.66 per share, above analyst estimates of $3.28, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's closely watched data center business, which has been eating away at rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s dominance in the segment, had revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79% year over year and above analyst estimates of $1.88 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Sales for gaming chips were $2.76 billion, more than double the previous year and above estimates of $2.47 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Nvidia's shares were down 1% at $621.95 in extended trading on Wednesday.

Stocks such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), Arcelor Mittal (MT), and Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) have high upside potential based on their average price targets.A strategy many investors practice is to follow the recommendations of Wall Street analysts. The easiest way to do this is by looking at analyst price targets. Wall Street analysts are typically responsible for coverage on a select group of stocks based on industry and market size.
Analysts meet with management and other stakeholders to help determine a company’s current and future value based on its financials and growth potential. They use this information to generate earnings estimates and target prices that help them form their overall ratings. While we don’t need to pay too much attention to analyst ratings, we should keep an eye on price targets. A price target is what analysts think the stock is worth per share.
When you take an average of analyst price targets, you can get a good idea of what price a stock could reach. If a stock is trading below its average target price, there is a solid chance it will increase its price. If a stock is trading more than 20% below its average price target, there is a strong chance it will rally, which is why investors should consider stocks such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out Wednesday's session with modest gains as recent comments from Federal Reserve officials helped tamp down concerns about runaway inflation and kept bond yields in check.
Stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have struggled in recent weeks as bond yields advanced due to rising inflation worries, were among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P 500 index with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note holding below the 1.6% level.
On Wednesday, Fed vice chair for supervision Randal Quarles said he was prepared to open talks on reducing the central bank's emergency support measures, only to also stress the need to remain patient.
Multiple Fed officials have commented in recent days on inflation, maintaining the central bank views it as transitory and has the tools to clamp down if it begins to run too hot. However, they have also edged closer to starting the debate about tapering, or reducing, its massive fiscal stimulus plan. 
""It feels like everybody is giving a very slow but choreographed message that things are improving, we can at least start talking about talking about tightening,"" said Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridian in Wichita, Kansas.
""It could be that the wrong Fed governor says the wrong thing in the next couple of weeks and that kicks it off.""

1223,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 06:37PM ET</span>","GameStop, AMC extend rallies, gouging short sellers","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) -Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rallied to their highest levels in months on Wednesday, with some market-watchers saying the recent surge was forcing bearish investors to unwind their bets against the video game retailer.
GameStop shares surged 15.8% to $242.56, around its highest level since mid-March, while AMC shares shot up 19.2% to $19.56, the highest since Jan. 27. CFRA on Wednesday raised its price target for AMC shares to $18 from $2.50. 
Shares of GameStop and other companies popular on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets have been climbing in recent weeks and the rally accelerated on Tuesday. GameStop is now 70% above its closing low for May, while AMC has risen 95% in the month-to-date.
GameStop's big gains have caused some bearish investors to retreat, forced to buy shares to cover their short-sale loans, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.
""We have started to see some short covering in GME as mark-to-market losses mount on the short side,"" Dusaniwsky said in an email on Wednesday.
Around 958,000 shares of GameStop, worth $201 million, were bought to cover short sales over the last week, S3 data showed. Roughly 11.55 million shares of GameStop, or 20.3% of its float, are currently sold short, Dusaniwsky said.
Short-sellers in GameStop are down $6.7 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, including $339 million from Tuesday's more than 16% gain and about $383 million due to Wednesday's move, S3 data showed.
A short squeeze helped send GameStop shares increase by more than 1,600% in January to a record high of $483. The stock pared most of those gains in the following month, only to bounce again in March. 
Some analysts also pointed to speculation that GameStop may be building a nonfungible token (NFT) platform. Website nft.gamestop.com advertised positions for engineers, designers and other jobs. GameStop did not provide further details. 
""If you own a stock and you want it to keep going up you need reasons,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman, who has a $30 price target on GameStop and an ""underperform"" rating. ""This is retail investors trying to convince themselves to buy more of the stock."" 
About 20.6% of AMC shares are sold short, according to Dusaniwsky who notes that even as the shares have been rallying, short-sellers have been adding to their exposure, selling 1.18 million shares short over the last week.
With the rally in AMC shares, now up 822% for the year-to-date, shorts are down $1.37 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, including $290 million losses from Wednesday's rally, S3 data showed.
Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold downgraded his AMC rating to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" on Wednesday after the stock surpassed the brokerage's recently increased price target of $16.

However, retail investor enthusiasm for AMC shares ""likely helped to take AMC to a place of surviving the pandemic vs. facing liquidation scenario,"" he said, referring to capital the company has been able to raise in recent months.
""I still look at the fundamentals, but there's going to be other drivers now that may move stocks beyond fundamentals,"" Wold said.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 06:37PM ET</span>",Senator Warren attacks JPMorgan's Dimon over 'baloney' overdraft fees,"By Pete Schroeder, Matt Scuffham and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Progressive firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday attacked JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) chief executive Jamie Dimon after the country's largest lender reaped $1.46 billion in overdraft fees during 2020 while borrowers were struggling to make ends meet amid pandemic lockdowns.
Warren told Dimon during a banking industry U.S. Senate hearing that the fees were especially egregious after federal agencies and Congress gave lenders a raft of regulatory breaks to allow them to preserve capital and better help customers. JPMorgan collected more overdraft fees than its immediate competitors, Warren said.
""You and your colleagues came in today to talk about how you stepped up to help your customers during the pandemic. It's a bunch of baloney,"" Warren told Dimon in a fiery exchange https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Ua3tLeKM during which the pair, at times, spoke over each other. 
Dimon responded that JPMorgan waived overdraft fees for customers who asked. When Warren asked Dimon if the bank would refund the fees, he flatly said, ""No."" 
After the hearing, a spokesperson for the bank said in an email response to Reuters that in 2020 the bank waived fees on over 1 million deposit accounts, including overdraft fees, ""no questions asked.”
The JPMorgan CEO testified alongside Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) CEO Jane Fraser, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co CEO Charles Scharf, who also got heat from Warren for overdraft fees. Collectively, the four banks gathered $4 billion in such fees last year, Warren said. 
With their smaller retail businesses,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) CEO David Solomon and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gorman largely dodged Warren's wrath during their testimony.
Speaking to CNBC after the hearing, Warren, a former 2020 presidential candidate who rose to prominence during the 2008 financial crisis, said the banks had used the pandemic to ""pump up their profits"" and required aggressive regulation.
The cost of overdrawing a checking account hit a new high in 2020, increasing to an average of $33.47, according to Bankrate, a consumer finance service. Banks say overdrafts are an important source of credit for customers, but consumer groups say the fees are usurious.
""We believe this exchange only improves the prospects that the (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) will look at further limits on overdraft fees,"" wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group.
HEAT FROM BOTH SIDES
The same six CEOs are due to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday as scrutiny of the industry grows under Washington's Democratic Party leadership. 
Warren's attack on Dimon and overdraft fees will come as a blow to the industry which thought it had a good story to tell lawmakers after dishing out $69 billion of COVID-19 aid to struggling businesses and launching programs to tackle racial injustice and wealth inequality. 
But the Wall Street bosses frequently found themselves under fire from both sides of the aisle, with Democrats criticizing the banks for not doing enough to help everyday Americans, and Republicans wary of their growing support for liberal causes. 
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Wall Street critic who became chair of the Senate Banking Committee following Democratic gains in the 2020 election, also took a tough line, saying the banks' success navigating the pandemic was not enough.
""Under the current system, Wall Street profits no matter what happens to workers, because those profits now come at the expense of workers,"" he told the CEOs in his opening remarks and implored them to justify their multi-million dollar paychecks and stock buy backs. 

Republicans, on the other hand, criticized the banks for trying to drive social policies by limiting financing for fossil-fuel companies and gun manufacturers and by speaking out against a new Georgia voting rights law.
""Big banks face fire from progressives and conservatives,"" Seiberg wrote after the hearing. ""What satisfies one side outrages the other side.""

Stimulus-led spending confidence among customers allowed the apparel retailer to cut promotions and sell at full prices, pushing the company's gross margin to 42.2% from 36.7% in 2019. 
""High demand is driving greater pricing power,"" Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Foyle told analysts on a post-earnings call.
The company also said it was optimistic about the back-to-school season denim trends as it revamps fashion styles to cater to the looser fits that millennials and teens are sporting these days. 
Pent-up demand for loose-fit jeans, tops and leggings coupled with the $1,400 stimulus checks that Americans received in March lifted the company's sales for the first time since the onset of the pandemic.
The company also reported a 57% surge in digital revenue in the first quarter compared to 2019 levels, fueled by a redesigned app and enhanced curbside and in-store pickup features.
Brand Aerie recorded an 89% rise in revenue compared to 2019 levels, while revenue at the American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) label rose marginally.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned a profit of 48 cents per share, above analysts' average estimate of a profit of 46 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 05:51PM ET</span>",Biden's EV metals import plan unlikely to match climate goals -executives,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) -The Biden administration's plan to rely on ally nations for most of the metals needed to build electric vehicles ignores the complexity of modern mining and could keep the United States from meeting aggressive climate goals, according to industry executives. 
Reuters reported on Tuesday that President Joe Biden plans to look abroad for most supplies of EV metals and focus on domestic processing into battery parts, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists and counter to a private commitment to miners last autumn to allow more domestic mining.
U.S. Senator John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said on Wednesday in response to the Reuters story that Biden is bowing to pressure from environmentalists.
""We have these minerals here. We should produce them and use them for American workers and consumers,"" said Barrasso, who represents Wyoming.
Industry representatives have taken similar positions. 
""The approach is deeply naive and very dangerous to the United States supply chain for electric vehicles,"" said James Calaway, chairman of ioneer Ltd, which is developing the Rhyolite Ridge lithium project in Nevada.
Aggressive U.S. climate goals under Biden call for roughly half of all new U.S. automobile sales to be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be electric by 2040. 
""Given the administration's timeline, they have no choice but to allow more domestic mines,"" said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, which is developing the Thacker Pass lithium deposit in Nevada.
Underscoring the supply challenge, the International Energy Agency this month forecast global demand for lithium will jump 40 times by 2040, while cobalt and nickel demand would rise at least 20 times. 
Chile and Australia - the world's two largest producers of lithium - ship most of their product to Asia for processing into battery cathodes and other parts. Expecting those countries to divert existing supply chains to the United States is not realistic, executives said.
""American manufacturing must include sourcing the raw materials needed for manufacturing here in the United States, rather than continuing to rely on other countries for these resources,"" said Kathy Graul of  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's proposed Twin Metals copper mine project in Minnesota.
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack - who oversees the U.S. Forest Service - said earlier this month he was undecided on whether to temporarily block that project.
The Biden administration in February temporarily blocked Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc's Resolution copper project in Arizona, a project that would, if built, supply a quarter of U.S. demand for the red metal.
While the Biden administration may want to rely on mineral deposits in ally nations, it will have competition from China, which is willing to pay top dollar, industry leaders said.
""The U.S. government cannot make assumptions that non-U.S. rare earth producers will sell their materials into the U.S. supply chain and not to China,"" said Pini Althaus, chief executive of privately-held USA Rare Earth, which is developing a rare earths mine in Texas and building a battery facility in North Carolina. Rare earths are used to make magnets found in EVs and most electronics.
The United States is not planning to abandon domestic mining altogether, according to Ali Zaidi, the deputy White House national climate adviser. 
Zaidi said that ""building American-made EVs and shipping them around the world will include leveraging American-made parts and resources,"" including responsibly pursuing and mining EV battery metals.

To be sure, the U.S. mining industry knows ally supply will be needed. Given expansion plans from automakers, the United States is unlikely to be able to supply more than 30% of the lithium it needs to build EVs domestically by 2030, said Joe Lowry, an independent lithium industry consultant. 
""Allies were always going to need to be part of the lithium supply equation,"" he said.

By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. bank profits rose 29.1% during the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter as banks adjusted expectations for future credit losses downward, a bank regulator said on Wednesday. 
The industry posted $76.8 billion in first-quarter profits, up $58.3 billion from a year prior and $17.3 billion in the final quarter of 2020, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said in its quarterly banking profile report.
The report data also showed that three-quarters of all banks, or 74.8%, reported higher quarterly net income compared with the year-ago quarter and that the share of unprofitable institutions dropped from 7.4% a year ago to 3.9%.
Loan balances declined from the previous quarter and year, driven by a reduction in credit card balances, the agency added.
FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said the new data shows, despite continued challenges, ""the banking industry remains resilient. Strong capital and liquidity levels support lending needs and help protect against potential losses.""
The new data also showed deposits grew by $635.2 billion, or 3.6%, from a quarter prior to $18.5 trillion. 
This lift in U.S. consumers' savings repeats a trend of previous quarters of unprecedented deposit growth, the regulator said.
""We've had record savings rates since the beginning of the pandemic, but this influx of deposits is not permanent,"" an agency official told reporters.
""As the economy continues to expand due to consumers and businesses starting to spend again, we will see a significant moderation in growth,"" another official added, saying that the agency will continue to monitor deposit trends.
Total assets increased by $680.9 billion, or 3.1%, from the previous quarter to $22.6 trillion.
Cash and balances due from depository institutions expanded by $440.1 billion, or 13.8%, while securities rose a record $366.9 billion, or 7.2%.

Three new banks opened and 25 institutions merged in first quarter 2021. No banks failed during the quarter, the FDIC data showed.
The number of institutions on the FDIC’s so-called problem bank list declined by one to 55 from the previous quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets gained and the U.S. dollar rallied against major currencies on Wednesday for the first time this week as Federal Reserve officials continued to downplay prospects of rising inflation.
Fed vice chair for supervision Randal Quarles signaled the U.S. central bank's plans to open talks on easing its bond buying program as the economy roars ahead and prices rise. On Tuesday, vice chair Richard Clarida said the Fed could curb inflation and engineer a ""soft landing"" without throwing the economic recovery off track.
On Monday, Fed Board Governor Lael Brainard and James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, reiterated the dovish monetary policy stance.
The dollar index was up 0.392%, while the benchmark yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped to 1.557%, from 1.564% late on Tuesday.
""The Fed has really been pushing its view on inflation, but with regards to bond tapering investors are concerned they will allow the economy run hot,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management.
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks rose 0.18% to 708.52. European stocks were flat below a record peak set on Tuesday. 
The comments from multiple Fed officials reflect a shifting tone at the central bank. A month ago, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was ""not yet"" time to contemplate discussion of policy tapering or slowing the pace of asset purchases. More recently policymakers have acknowledged they are closer to debating when to scale back crisis support for the U.S. economy.
On Wall Street, all three main indexes closed higher driven by consumer discretionary, communication services and financial sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, to 34,323.05, the S&P 500 gained 0.19%, to 4,195.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.59%, to 13,738.00.
""The Fed is still putting a lot of liquidity into the system and when the economy is running hot that's got a lot of people thinking that they might make a policy mistake,"" Ripley said.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.45% to over two-week highs, while Tokyo's Nikkei advanced 0.3%.
Emerging markets stocks strengthened as stronger economic growth numbers in Mexico lifted the peso, boosting hopes the country is on track to recover from its sharpest economic contraction since the 1930s.
MSCI's index of emerging market stocks rose 0.48%. 
Gold prices fell below $1,900 per ounce, its appeal dimmed by a rebounding dollar and U.S. Treasury yields.
Spot gold shed 0.17% to $1,896.06 per ounce after hitting its highest since Jan. 8 at $1,912.50. 

Oil prices settled higher as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles reinforced expectations of improving demand ahead of the peak summer driving season, offsetting worries that a possible return of Iranian supply would cause a glut.
Brent settled up 16 cents, or 0.3%, to $68.87 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 14 cents, or 0.2%, at $66.21 a barrel.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 04:45PM ET</span>",Explainer: What the Dutch court carbon emissions ruling means for Shell,"(Reuters) - A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to significantly deepen planned greenhouse gas emission cuts, in a landmark ruling that could pave the way for legal action against energy companies around the world.
Shell said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling which it plans to appeal.
Here are some key points about the ruling: 
- WHAT WAS THE RULING?
The district court ordered Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. Shell currently aims to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 20% over the same period from a 2016 baseline. 
- DOES THE RULING AFFECT SHELL'S GLOBAL OPERATIONS?
Yes. The reduction relates to Shell's global operations and is not limited to the Netherlands, the court ruling said. 
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SHELL?
The ruling said that ""it is up to RDS (Royal Dutch Shell) to design the reduction obligation, taking account of its current obligations and other relevant circumstances.""
Shell earlier this year announced a strategy to become a net zero emissions company by 2050, meaning its absolute emissions will also be net zero at that point. It has stated that it believes its emissions peaked in 2018. 
- ABSOLUTE TARGETS VS INTENSITY TARGETS?
The court ordered Shell to reduce absolute emissions by 45%. Shell's short and medium-term targets are intensity based. 
Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.
At its annual general meeting this month, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden rejected setting absolute reduction targets, saying: ""Reducing absolute emissions at this point in time is predominantly possible by shrinking the business."" 
- HOW BIG ARE SHELL'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS?

Shell, the world's largest oil and gas trader, produced 1.38 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020, roughly 4.5% of global energy-related emissions that year, based on International Energy Agency figures https://www.iea.org/articles/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2020.
Shell's 2020 emissions were down from 1.65 billion tonnes the previous year, largely as a result of a fall in oil and gas demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The growing need for cybersecurity, cloud-computing, automation and analytic solutions, as many businesses continue to adopt hybrid-working models, should be to the benefit of networking service providers. In fact, the global Network-as-a-Service market is expected to grow at a 33.1% CAGR over the next five years to reach $45.03 billion by 2026.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on top networking stocks Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI), and Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA).

Because the stigma of association with the plant is being shed at breathtaking speed, it appears that the industry is en route to the mainstream. This backdrop makes Wall Street analysts extremely bullish on Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) and Green Thumb (GTBIF). So come on, let’s evaluate these names.The cannabis industry’s changing legal landscape in the United States, which is highlighting the medicinal benefits of cannabidiol products, has been creating a favorable backdrop for cannabis companies. The legalization of recreational marijuana is slowly eking out victories on a state-by-state basis.
As of April 2021, 35 states and the District of Columbia had legalized marijuana for medical use. Sixteen of these states also allow adults to legally use marijuana for recreational purposes. In fact, there is now a growing acceptance of the plant as a legitimate option for patients suffering from chronic pain or seizures. The cannabis market is estimated to grow at a 28% CAGR over the next five years to hit $90.4 billion.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last month that he hopes to see an end to the drug’s prohibition by next year’s 4/20. This has given Wall Street analysts more confidence about the performance of financially sound American cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. (CURLF) and  Green Thumb Industries Inc . (OTC:GTBIF).

1237,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 04:27PM ET</span>","Ford boosts EV spending, outlines 2030 sales targets, shares near 5-year high","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday outlined plans to boost spending on its electrification efforts by more than a third and said it aims to have 40% of its global volume be all electric by 2030, sending shares near a five-year high.
Under a plan dubbed ""Ford+"" meant to have investors value it more like a technology company, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said it now expects to spend more than $30 billion on EVs, including battery development, by 2030, up from its prior target of $22 billion. Ford's shares were up 7.4% in afternoon trading after earlier rising almost 9%.
""This is our biggest opportunity for growth and value creation since Henry Ford started to scale the Model T,"" Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said at the company's Capital Markets Day meeting online. ""Our ambition is to lead the electric revolution.""
Ford and other global automakers are racing to shift their gasoline-powered lineups to all electric power under pressure from regions like Europe and China to cut vehicle emissions. U.S. President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion to boost U.S. EV production, sales and infrastructure. 
Ford's 2030 sales target would translate to more than 1.5 million EVs, based on last year's sales. By comparison, rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has targeted annual sales of more than 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. Ford previously said its European lineup will be all-electric by 2030.
GM aspires to halt U.S. sales of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, and has said it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years. 
Some analysts see Ford as trailing rivals in the electrification race, but Ford officials disagree, pointing to the rollout of the Mustang Mach-E electric crossover, and the electric versions of the Transit van and F-150 pickup. 
Ford said it expects to deliver an 8% operating margin in 2023.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company also said it is forming a new stand-alone unit, called Ford Pro, to focus exclusively on commercial and government customers.
The company is targeting increasing revenue for the commercial market for hardware and related services addressable by Ford Pro to $45 billion by 2025, up from $27 billion in 2019. 
Ford said it will also aim to develop EV batteries under the ""IonBoost"" brand, from lithium-ion versions to lithium-ion phosphate for commercial vehicles and eventually low-cost solid-state batteries in partnership with startup Solid Power, in which the automaker has invested. Farley expects Ford to cut battery costs 40% by mid-decade.
Last week, the automaker announced a memorandum of understanding to form a battery joint venture with South Korea's SK Innovation, to make battery cells at two U.S. plants.
Farley also said Ford expects to have 1 million vehicles capable of receiving over-the-air software updates on the road by the end of the year, top the number of vehicles Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc serves that way next year and scale that to 33 million by 2028. 
Ford also announced ""Blue Oval Intelligence,"" an in-vehicle technology stack that allows fully connected and updated software, enabling the automaker to interact with customers after the vehicle sale. The stack also will enable streaming services from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).

Ford sees the overall market for connected functions like driver-assist technologies, new features and upgraded software content, and EV charging hitting a projected $20 billion by 2030.
Ford confirmed it will develop two dedicated EV platforms, one for full-size trucks and SUVs, including the Ford Explorer; the other for cars and smaller SUVs. Reuters reported that on Tuesday.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 04:14PM ET</span>","S&P 500 has room to run, but inflation fears to dampen sentiment","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 will end the year only about 2.5% above its current level, with concerns over increasing inflationary risks likely to temper some of the enthusiasm for U.S. stocks this year, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The benchmark S&P 500 is already up nearly 12% since the end of 2020, boosted by upbeat prospects for the economy and earnings following economic stimulus and strong distribution of coronavirus vaccines.
By the end of 2021, the index will be at 4,300, a 2.5% gain from its close Monday of 4,197, according to the median forecast of 46 strategists polled by Reuters over the last two weeks.
That forecast is higher than 4,100 in the February Reuters poll, and strategists cited stronger-than-expected earnings so far this year as among reasons for bumping up 2021 forecasts.
Based on the poll, the Dow Jones industrial average will finish this year at 35,500, up about 3.2% from Monday's close.
""There's still some fuel left in the tank"" for the stock market, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""A lot of folks are still coming to grips with the fact that the earnings outlook will be a lot better than was expected even as recently as a few months ago.""
Wall Street analysts now expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 35.6% in 2021, compared with a forecast of 23.3% growth at the start of the year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Also, even with concerns surrounding inflation, the Fed is likely to remain accommodative ""for some time,"" Samana said. Wells Fargo last week raised its year-end 2021 forecast on the S&P 500 to 4,500 from 4,300.
Rising U.S. inflationary risks have spooked investors recently. High inflation raises the potential for an earlier-than-anticipated scaling back of monetary support by central banks and also for reduced corporate profit margins.
Minutes last week from the last Federal Reserve meeting suggested some policymakers were ready to talk about reducing stimulus by tapering bond purchases.
Many strategists in the poll viewed a correction in stocks over the next three months as likely, and several said they saw the U.S. stock market as overvalued at current levels.
Recent inflation concerns have prompted some investors to take profits in technology and other growth stocks that outperformed at the start of the pandemic.
Shares of banks, energy companies and other economically-sensitive names have surged since breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccines late last year but remain favorites for 2021 among strategists.
""The question becomes how long are the legs for cyclicals. I do think they're long enough to last for the rest of 2021,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.

""In my base-case scenario, this is going to be a risk-on environment,"" said Hooper. Her year-end target on the S&P 500 is 4,450.

HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The first  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) directors not appointed by the company include an executive versed in renewable fuels and a ""prudent"" risk taker and disrupter poised to challenge the oil company's ways, said people familiar with his career.
Activists pressing Exxon to cut spending, boost returns and prepare for a lower-carbon future got a victory on Wednesday when shareholders elected Gregory Goff, a 64-year-old former top executive at Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Andeavor, and former Neste Oyj executive Kaisa Hietala. The vote followed a bruising battle led by a hedge fund. [L2N2ND16X]
The two face an insular corporate culture renowned for slow-to-change ways. Goff and Hietala will be two voices among a 12-person board that has had six directors handpicked by Exxon's current chief executive Darren Woods. 
Goff was unavailable to comment according to spokeswoman for hedge fund Engine No. 1. Hietala could not be immediately reached. 
Both have extensive backgrounds in oil refining, a business where Exxon posted a $1.1 billion loss last year. Hietala got Finish refiner Neste into renewables and has been on the boards of investment giant  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and paper and packaging firm Smurfit Kappa Group. 
Goff in 2010 took over the predecessor to U.S. oil refiner Andeavor, built it through deals and expanded the business internationally. He later sold it to Marathon, giving investors a 1,200% return during his 8-year tenure. 
Goff ""understands the business very well, both the operational side and the commercial side, said John Auers of refining consultants Turner, Mason & Co. ""He's a very sharp, astute guy who takes prudent risks,"" he said.
In 2013, Goff bought a BP (NYSE:BP) refinery in Carson, California, integrating it with a nearby refinery his company previously purchased from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). Both happened as competitors were exiting the West Coast.
Four years later, he jumped into Mexico's fuel market through terminals, storage, and a retail network fed by its U.S. production. It was a bet that was rivaled that year by BP,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon. 
""His reputation is exceptionally high among investors,"" said analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Goff will be ""far more concerned with Exxon Mobil’s management structure and lack of entrepreneurship than some misguided attempt to target net-zero,"" he wrote. 

Goff also can succeed as an outsider at Exxon, said a person who has known him for many years but declined to be named for business reasons. 
""He is disruptive in a pragmatic and constructive way,"" this person said. ""He's not stuck in the status quo.""

1244,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 03:53PM ET</span>","Amazon brings James Bond, Rocky to fight Netflix with $8.5 billion MGM buy","By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc will buy MGM, the fabled U.S. movie studio home to the James Bond franchise, for $8.45 billion, giving it a huge library of films and TV shows and ramping up competition with streaming rivals led by Netflix and Disney+.
The deal aims to bolster Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s television-focused studio with new and historic filmmaking from MGM, which has snapped up lucrative series including ""Rocky"" and ""Tomb Raider"" since its founding in 1924.
Streaming video helps the world's largest online retailer draw people to subscribe to Prime, a club with fast shipping, and to shop more once they're members. Privately-held MGM, or Metro Goldwyn Mayer, also owns the Epix cable channel and makes popular TV shows including ""Fargo,"" ""Vikings"" and ""Shark Tank.""
Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, laid out the rationale for the deal at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.
""MGM has a vast, deep catalog of much beloved intellectual property,"" he said. ""With the talented people at MGM and the talented people at Amazon Studios, we can reimagine and develop that IP for the 21st century.""
Bezos said it was ""premature"" to name Amazon Studios as the fourth pillar of the company after its seller marketplace, cloud division and Prime, but it was working toward that milestone. More than 175 million Prime members watched content on Amazon in the past year, and streaming hours were up 70%, he said.
July 5 - the day Amazon was incorporated in 1994 - will be the date long-time cloud chief Andy Jassy takes over as CEO, Bezos said.
Amazon's Prime Video faces a long list of rivals including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, HBO Max and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Apple TV+. The companies have increased spending and expanded in international markets, capturing the pandemic-led shift to binge-watching shows online.
To stay competitive, Amazon has also courted fans of live sports and picked up licenses to stream games, boasting a long-term deal with the National Football League that was estimated to cost about $1 billion per year. 
The proliferating streaming services are scrambling for content libraries and brands they can expand. Analysts have said this is a big motivation for another round of consolidation of media properties after a brief hiatus during the pandemic.
""With new entrants to streaming from all the major studios and TV networks, Amazon has to increase its commitment to video or risk losing engagement,"" said Jim Nail of research firm Forrester. 
Underscoring the trend toward consolidation, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) announced a $43-billion deal last week to spin out its WarnerMedia business and combine it with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, one of the most ambitious yet in the streaming era.
Amazon's Hollywood studio purchase is a first for a big U.S. tech company and could spark further interest in Silicon Valley, a source familiar with the matter said.
The acquisition is Amazon’s second-biggest after Whole Foods Market, which it bought for $13.7 billion in 2017.
At almost $9 billion, the lofty price is about 37 times MGM’s 2021 estimated EBITDA - or almost triple the enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple that Discovery’s deal implied for AT&T’s content assets - according to Reuters Breakingviews.
At the same time, Amazon posted its fourth consecutive record quarterly profit in April.
MGM started a formal sale process in December, when it was estimated to be worth about $5.5 billion.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and LionTree advised MGM on the deal.
The deal will provide fuel for the Seattle company's critics in Washington who complain it is already too big and powerful, but experts said the deal poses few classic antitrust concerns.
Amazon shares rose 0.3%.
LUCRATIVE FRANCHISE RIGHTS
Amazon has picked up Academy Awards over the years and slowly moved from art-house fare toward content with wider appeal. The MGM acquisition accelerates that move, giving it rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history that’s earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally, according to MGM.
Other classic films in MGM's library include ""RoboCop,"" ""Moonstruck"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs.""
The potential to mine this intellectual property, by making new content based on popular characters, will help Amazon draw viewers to Prime, two former Amazon executives told Reuters.
MGM also licenses content for video games, which could benefit Amazon's development efforts in that area.
Still, Amazon efforts to profit off the library won’t be easy, or cheap.
In many cases, MGM’s content is tied up in multi-year deals with television networks, the former Amazon executives said. Amazon cannot simply air MGM’s reality show “The Voice,” for instance, which contractually is in the hands of NBC.
Bringing a new installment of the James Bond saga online instead of in theaters would be a particularly difficult task, the sources said. The terms under which MGM acquired the franchise leave control in the hands of the Broccoli family, the Bond films’ producers.
Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions said in a statement, ""We are committed to continuing to make James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.""

News of the acquisition followed quickly on the upcoming return of Jeff Blackburn, Amazon’s former senior vice president overseeing content and M&A, who had left early this year.
Incoming Amazon CEO Jassy had particular trust in Blackburn after decades at Amazon together, hoping he might shepherd a complicated merger, the sources said.

The company's stock opened at $20, up from the reference price of $18 per share set on Tuesday.
Founded in 2010, Santa Monica, California-based ZipRecruiter operates an online marketplace connecting employers and job seekers. 
The company, which competes with Indeed and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) owned LinkedIn, charges a fee for job listings while it is free for job seekers posting resumes.
ZipRecruiter was valued at $1.5 billion in a fundraising round in 2018, with investment from Wellington Management Company and venture capital firm IVP.
The company's stock market debut comes as U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, with some initial data for May also showing signs of weakness.
Still, economists generally are expecting strong job growth in the months to come, as vaccinations gather pace and the economy reopens.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped further below 500,000 for the week ended May 15, with employers, ranging from manufacturing to restaurants and bars, scrambling to find workers.
ZipRecruiter has forecast a 79% to 86% jump in second-quarter revenue, after reporting an 11% rise in the first quarter of 2021.
The company's job posting business has rebounded after taking a hit from the fallout of the pandemic last year. 

ZipRecruiter's stock market listing, done through a direct listing where no shares are sold ahead of the opening, follows a record 15-month run in the U.S. IPO market, as investors rushed to buy stocks of high-growth tech companies. 
Reuters first reported the company's plans to go public.

I thought this is an apt time to highlight some GARP stocks given that we’ve experienced a significant correction in growth stocks over the past couple of months. Although the correction may not be over, it has created some interesting opportunities in high-quality GARP stocks. Here are 3 that investors should consider: Synchrony Financial (SYF), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM), and Cigna Corp. (CI).

Investing.com –Bitcoin slipped below $40,000 Wednesday, but signs that point to renewed long-term demand supported sentiment on the popular crypto following its recent rout.
BTC/USD to rose 2.02% to $38,682, but had traded as high as $40,750 on the day.
Traders are starting to move their coins off exchanges to private wallets to hold bitcoin for the long haul once again, according to data earlier this week from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.
The net transfer volume from and to exchanges - a measure that measures the ratio of BTC moved on versus off exchanges - turned negative earlier this week, indicating that more traders were moving bitcoin from exchanges to store, or 'hodl' BTC in private wallets, a sign of renewed appetite for long-term demand.
This measure had been positive – indicating more coins moving to rather from exchanges – since the rout began.
The buying has mostly been led by long-term investors who had been scooping up BTC in the recent rout at the expense of newer traders that were over-leveraged and forced to panic sell.
Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) endorsed bitcoin as new asset class, driven by interest from its institutional investors who have moved from rudimentary questions about crypto including BTC to positioning questions.
""[A]sset managers and macro funds are interested in whether or not crypto fits into their portfolios, and if it does, how to get access to either the physical—by trading the spot instrument on a blockchain— or exposure through other types of products, typically futures,"" Goldman Sachs said in a report.
Still, the report wasn't all positive for bitcoin as Goldman questioned whether BTC was a true store value.
""A major argument in favor of bitcoin as a store of value is its limited supply. But demand, not scarcity, drives the success of stores of value. No other store of value has a fixed supply,"" Goldman said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese shares are expected to recover and reach a 30-year peak by the end of year as an acceleration of vaccinations after initial delays helps the economy to reopen, according to respondents in a Reuters poll.
The median estimate in the May. 10-25 poll of 21 analysts and fund managers forecast the benchmark Nikkei index would gain just over 9% from Monday's close of 28,364.61 to reach 31,000 by the end of December.
That is about 1% above its 30-year peak of 30,714 hit in February, and would represent a 13% gain for the year. It is higher than a forecast of 30,750 in the previous poll in February.
Japanese shares have stagnated over the past three months, hurt by a slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, cautious earnings guidances and the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) effective tapering in its stock buying.
Still, most market players expected those negative factors to fade. 
A mass vaccination programme has just started in Tokyo and Osaka, and is likely to make companies more optimistic about earnings.
As for the BOJ, it has mostly stayed away from markets since April but has indicated it is prepared to buy aggressively if necessary.
Japan's manufacturers have already been reaping the benefit of a global economic recovery, with a shortage of semiconductors helping various electronic parts makers.
""While I expect a foreign demand-driven recovery in the Japanese economy, domestic demand-oriented firms should see improvement too as vaccinations will make headway,"" said Hiroshi Namioka, fund manager at T&D Asset Management.
After recent falls in the market, valuations of Japanese shares have become cheaper, with the broader Topix trading at 15.8 times expected earnings, far below a peak of around 18 times hit earlier this year.
Yet the current multiple is still higher than in most periods during the decade before the pandemic, leading some analysts to think further gains may be limited.

""Some people used to say because monetary and fiscal stimulus is boosting multiples, stock prices will gain further. But the truth is, multiples are now declining globally,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
Matsumoto expects the Nikkei to end the year at 26,500.

LONDON (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) said on Wednesday David Craig, chief executive officer of its Refinitiv data and analytics business, would be stepping down from his current role in July and handing over his responsibilities to ex-Bloomberg executive Andrea Remyn Stone.
Craig would serve in an advisory capacity from July and leave the company at the end of the year, the LSEG said in a statement.
The London bourse operator completed its $27 billion purchase of Refinitiv in January from a consortium led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and including  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), owner of Reuters News.
The takeover came into sharp focus on March 5 when LSEG shares tumbled more than 12% on higher-than-expected costs for improving the resilience of Refinitiv's legacy platform. LSEG said it would spend a billion pounds this year on the integration.
Stone, who was hired by Craig in January 2020 and will become group head of data and analytics from July 1, previously worked at financial data provider Bloomberg LP and at Dealogic.
""The team is laser focused on delivering the integration,"" Stone said in the LSEG statement announcing her appointment.
Craig became CEO of Refinitiv in 2018, having led the team that founded the company out of the financial and risk division of Thomson Reuters. He had joined Reuters as chief strategy officer in 2007.
""With credit to David, he took a long-term view when he first recruited Andrea,"" LSEG CEO David Schwimmer said in the statement.
A person familiar with the situation said that Craig had been assured three years at Refinitiv, which end this year, and that Schwimmer likely wanted someone new in charge ""to exert his authority over a division that's worth 70% of his revenues.""
The LSEG press office declined to comment.
A fund manager who is among the top 20 shareholders in LSEG said that while Craig was generally well regarded by investors, a fresh pair of eyes at the helm of Refinitiv was ""probably no bad thing."" 
LSEG shares remain some 20% below March 5 levels. They did not react to the announcement of Craig's exit. 
In early April, Refinitiv's terminals, used by financial firms across the world, suffered a blackout lasting several hours.
Later in April, Schwimmer said that integration and savings from the Refinitiv takeover were on track, noting Refinitiv had not delivered any surprises as ""we had done a lot of due diligence"".
Last week, LSEG said it was in talks with Thomson Reuters over their agreement to distribute news content, following a dispute over whether Reuters News could put up a paywall on its website.

Thomson Reuters holds a significant minority stake in LSEG following the Refinitiv deal. Refinitiv is also the largest customer for Reuters News, which earns half its annual revenues through an annual payment worth $325 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering new rules to protect investors amid a surge in the use of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACS) as capital-raising vehicles, its new chair will tell lawmakers.
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise cash to acquire and take public a private company, allowing targets to sidestep the stricter regulatory checks of an initial public offering.
Gary Gensler, in prepared testimony to the financial services and general government subcommittee of the U.S. House Appropriations panel on Wednesday, said that overseeing SPACS has also placed demands on the resources at the watchdog, which has seen a 4% decline in its staff overall since 2016. 
He added that the Division of Enforcement's staff had six fewer staff than in fiscal year 2016, while its Division of Corporation Finance was currently 20% smaller than five years ago.
""Are SPAC investors being appropriately protected? Are retail investors getting the appropriate and accurate information they need at each stage"", said Gensler in his second appearance before Congress since he was sworn-in as SEC chair last month.
""How do SPACs fit in to our mission to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets? It could be the case that SPACs are less efficient than traditional IPOs,"" said Gensler, adding he had tasked staff to recommend possible rules or guidance in this area.
A record $100 billion has already been raised by U.S. SPACs so far this year, while the value of SPAC mergers and acquisitions hit a record $263 billion, according to data from Dealogic.
Some 30 companies have agreed to merge with SPACs since the beginning of April, compared with 69 during February-March, when the SPAC boom hit a peak, according to data vendor Refinitiv.
Analysts say the euphoria among retail investors that helped fuel the SPAC boom has subsided as investors worry https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-companies-snub-spacs-amid-concerns-they-cannot-deliver-2021-05-25 that SPACs have taken many companies, often loss-making or even without revenue, public at too-high valuations.

Bankers and lawyers warn companies that SPACs may not be able to deliver on the frothy valuations they promise.
Gensler will also tell lawmakers crypto tokens are a highly volatile and speculative asset class, which have opened a path to investor fraud and marketplace manipulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - A London lawsuit brought against the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) by ENRC, a mining company at the centre of an eight-year corruption investigation, lacks evidence and should never have been brought, a lawyer for the agency told a court on Wednesday. 
Simon Colton told London's High Court that ENRC may now regret sharing information with prosecutors as it sought to avoid a criminal investigation by committing to being open and transparent about an internal inquiry around seven years ago.
""But a change of policy and regret do not justify the present claim,"" he said, as the SFO began its defence in the high-profile trial, which is scheduled to run for 11 weeks.
The SFO opened an investigation into ENRC in 2013 over allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the acquisition of mineral assets in Africa. The investigation is still open, but no charges have been filed against the company or current or former employees.
ENRC is seeking public vindication and multi-million pound damages. 
It alleges that former Dechert lawyer Neil Gerrard, hired in 2010 to carry out an internal investigation following a whistleblowing report, conspired with SFO contacts to damage his client, expand or prolong his own brief to increase his fees and leaked privileged and sensitive material.
A lawyer for Dechert and Gerrard has dismissed the allegations, saying ENRC misrepresented documents and events, took little account of probability and leapt from suspicion to accusation.
ENRC, which was co-founded by three billionaire Kazakh businessmen and the Kazakh government, also accuses the SFO of misfeasance in public office. 
It alleges that the agency knew Gerrard was passing on sensitive information without authority, but incited and encouraged him in an effort to clinch a high-profile corporate settlement or prosecution. 

Colton said ENRC had levelled ""the most serious allegations"" against seven senior SFO officers and was seeking to cast its net wider because its case only made sense if there had been a ""conspiracy of silence"".
Nicholas Purnell, a lawyer for Dechert, said earlier that senior ENRC management had both authorised and understood the need for Gerrard to make disclosures to the SFO to ward off the possibility of a raid, although some within ENRC had disagreed.

And because job growth fell short of consensus expectations in April, placing a small question mark next to the robustness of the economic recovery, we think investors that are seeking a steady income stream should invest now in dividend paying stocks  Northrop Grumman  (NOC), Sysco (SYY), and The Mosaic (MOS). All three names have recently hiked their dividends. Read on.The Federal Reserve’s dovish monetary policy stance has played a huge role in the U.S.’ fast-paced economic recovery. Despite rising inflation rates the Fed plans to stick with its “cheap money” policy even as markets exhibit signs of a “taper tantrum”. San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly recently said in a CNBC interview that she is bullish regarding the future, but that substantial progress has to be made before the central bank can tighten its monetary policy. Indeed, April's job growth data was disappointing.
As a result, Treasury yields dipped slightly on May 26. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield stood at 1.56%. The Fed’s plan to hold interest rates at near zero levels in the short term, coupled with increasing market volatility and declining Treasury yields, has been motivating investors to focus on high-yield dividend paying stocks.
Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) and The  Mosaic Company  (NYSE:MOS) hiked their quarterly dividend payouts recently based on strong performance and stable cash flows. We think their strong fundamentals and growth potential should allow them to sustain their payouts over the long term, making them attractive investment bets now.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian airline  Azul SA  (NYSE:AZUL) has approached Chile's bankrupt LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group with the aim of buying its Brazilian operation, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. 
Azul's shares rose more than 9% in Sao Paulo on the news, while LATAM's shares in Santiago, where the airline is listed, were down 20%. 
LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago and, while it has secured new liquidity in that process, it has yet to present a formal restructuring plan.
Azul, controlled by JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp founder David Neeleman, said in a securities filing on Monday that it was ready to lead a wave of consolidation in the Brazilian airline industry, which has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On Wednesday, the newspaper Valor Economico also said Azul was trying to lure LATAM and talking to its aircraft lessors. 
A LATAM spokeswoman said the airline had not received any offer from Azul, that talks were not in progress and that LATAM had no intention of selling any of its parts.
In addition to extensive international routes, LATAM has domestic operations, not just in Brazil but also in Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. 
During the pandemic, Azul and LATAM developed a codeshare program to avoid competing in Brazil as the market shrank, which was blessed by regulators. That program suddenly ended this week, which Azul said was a reaction to its consolidation plans. 

Industry analysts had said throughout 2020 that Azul might try to buy LATAM in Brazil. The two airlines divide Brazil's market with a third carrier, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes. 
Gol's shares were up 7% on Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Italy's plan to set up a successor to its loss-making flag carrier Alitalia cleared a key hurdle on Wednesday after the European Commission said it had reached an understanding with Rome on parameters to ensure the new airline is independent from the old one.
Long-running discussions between the two sides have foundered amid disagreement over its successor ceding half of Alitalia's slots at Milan Linate airport, the old brand and the loyalty programme.
EU competition enforcers want Rome to make sure that there is no economic continuity between Alitalia and its successor Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA), otherwise the latter would be liable for the former's billions of euros in state aid received in recent years. 
The possible deal between the Commission and Rome on Wednesday came after a meeting between European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Italian Economic Development Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti and Economy Minister Daniele Franco.
""The Commission and the Italian authorities have reached a common understanding on the key parameters to ensure economic discontinuity between ITA and Alitalia,"" a Commission spokeswoman said.
She said talks with Rome would now continue at technical level while an ongoing investigation into the 1.3 billion euros ($1.59 billion) of state aid granted to Alitalia was in the final stage.
Giorgetti said Rome now needed to work to ensure that new Alitalia was ready to operate ""as soon as possible"", adding it was reasonable to expect a start in August.
As part of the understanding, less than half of Alitalia's fleet will be transferred to ITA, as well as less then half of its aviation personnel, with new contracts, a person familiar with the matter said. The source added that ITA would retain a number of slots at Milan Linate airport depending on how many planes it gets.
The rest of Alitalia's assets, including its brand, will be tendered off, where ITA will be allowed to take part together with other interested parties, the person said.

ITA will not be allowed to take over Alitalia's loyalty programme nor its client base, it said.

Investing – Ford Motor (NYSE:F) shares rose 7.5% Wednesday after the carmaker said 40% of its global output would be all-electric by 2030.
At its Delivering Ford+’ Capital Markets Day to showcase its plans for EVs, the company had something for everybody.
It said its vehicles will incorporate digital lifestyles by fully integrating best-in-class technology from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).
Ford aims to have about 1 million vehicles that are capable of receiving over-the-air system updates on the road by the end of this year and to exceed Tesla’s volume by July 2022.It has also raised planned electrification spending to $30+ billion by 2025, including development of IonBoost batteries.
The Ford management also talked about its plans to cater to both individual and corporate buyers by aiming to lead the electrification revolution including making investments in battery technologies.
The company has been making all efforts to get deeper into the EV market. Last week, it aggressively priced its latest electric truck, F-150 Lightning. The base model will cost $40,000, making it 20% more affordable than the next cheapest truck, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck. Rivals like the Rivian R1T and the Hummer EV cost a lot more.
The F-150 Lightning will be one of the mainstays of Ford’s EV play. In just a week of bookings starting, the electric pickup truck has garnered 70,000 reservations.
Again last week, Ford and South Korea’s SK Innovation signed an initial pact to create a joint venture, BlueOvalSK, to produce approximately 60 GWh annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade, with potential to expand.
Ford is also putting in more equity in Solid Power, a producer of all-solid-state batteries for EVs. Solid-state batteries are showing great promise. They don’t use the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion batteries, can be lighter, with greater energy density and provide more range and lower cost."

1265,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>","U.S. a top target for foreign and domestic influence operations, says new Facebook report","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - The United States topped a list of the countries most frequently targeted by deceptive foreign influence operations using Facebook between 2017 and 2020, the social media company said in a new report released on Wednesday. 
It also came second on a list of countries targeted by domestic influence operations in that same time period.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said one of the top sources of coordinated inauthentic behavior networks targeting the United States in the year leading up to the 2020 presidential election was domestic campaigns originating in the United States itself, as well as foreign operations from Russia and Iran.
The tallies were based on the number of ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" networks removed by Facebook, a term it uses for a type of influence operations that relies on fake accounts to mislead users and manipulate the public debate for strategic ends. 
Facebook began cracking down on these influence operations after 2016, when U.S. intelligence concluded that Russia used the platform as part of a cyber-influence campaign that aimed to help former President Donald Trump win the White House, a claim Moscow has denied.
The company said Russia, followed by Iran, topped the list for sources of coordinated inauthentic behavior and that this was mostly rooted in foreign interference. Top targets of foreign operations included Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Libya and Sudan. 
But the company also said that about half of the influence operations it has removed since 2017 around the world were conducted by domestic, not foreign, networks. 
""IO [influence operations] really started out as an elite sport. We had a small group of nation states in particular that were using these techniques. But more and more we're seeing more people getting into the game,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, told reporters on a conference call.
Facebook said the domestic influence operations that targeted the United States were operated by conspiratorial or fringe political actors, PR or consulting firms and media websites.
Myanmar was the country targeted by the most domestic inauthentic networks, according to Facebook's count, though these networks were relatively small in size.
Gleicher said threat actors had pivoted from large, high-volume campaigns to smaller and more targeted ones, and that the platform was also seeing a rise in commercial influence operations. 
""I actually think the majority of what we're seeing here, these aren't actors that are motivated by politics. In terms of volume, a lot of this is actors that are motivated by money,"" he said. ""They're scammers, they're fraudsters, they're PR or marketing firms that are looking to make a business around deception.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium said on Wednesday it was suspending vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for people under the age of 41 following the first death in Europe from severe side-effects associated with the shot.
""The Inter-ministerial conference has decided to temporarily administer Janssen's vaccine to the general population from the age of 41 years, pending a more detailed benefit-risk analysis by the EMA (European Medicines Agency),"" Belgium's health minister and seven regional counterparts said in a statement.
The EMA, the European Union's medicines regulator, said it was reviewing the ""first fatal report"" of a 37 year old woman in Belgium who had suffered from a blood clot with low platelets, a condition previously associated with the shot. 
It added it had asked the U.S. drugmaker to carry out a series of additional studies to assess a possible link between the shot and the rare clotting condition. 
J&J said product safety was its paramount concern and that the EMA had left it to EU member states to decide on vaccine use, taking into account how fast the virus was spreading and whether alternative vaccines were available.
""As the global pandemic continues to devastate communities around the world, we believe a single-shot, easily transportable COVID-19 vaccine with demonstrated protection against multiple variants can help protect the health and safety of people everywhere,"" the company said in a statement. 
The woman died on May 21 after being admitted to hospital with severe thrombosis and platelet deficiency, the ministry's statement said.
She was vaccinated through her employer, outside of the official Belgian vaccination campaign.
Belgium has so far administered about 40,000 J&J shots, with 80% of those to people over 45 years old, the statement said.
The EMA said more than 1.34 million J&J doses had been administered within the EU.
J&J said on April 20 it would resume rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe with a warning on its label, after requesting countries, including Belgium, to pause its use amid concerns about possible links to rare blood clots.
J&J has said that no clear causal relationship has been established between the vaccine and the clots. 
Last month, the EMA found a possible link between the vaccine and rare blood clotting issues in adults who received doses in the United States, but backed its overall benefits against any risks. 
It looked into eight known cases of clotting in combination with low platelet counts in people who got the J&J shot in the United States. All people affected were below 60 years of age, and most were women.
The Janssen one-dose vaccine is primarily used in Belgium for home vaccination of the elderly and a number of vulnerable groups including the homeless and undocumented migrants.
Most EU countries are using the J&J shot, although Denmark has excluded it from its vaccination programme and Italy has restricted its use to older people.

The United States resumed using the shot in April after a 10-day pause to investigate its link to the extremely rare, but potentially lethal, blood clots.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it found a ""plausible causal association"" after identifying 28 cases among the more than 8.7 million people who had received the J&J vaccine.

Last week Italy's No. 2 bank decided to skip the payment of coupons on legacy instruments, known as CASHES or convertible and subordinated hybrid equity-linked securities, in a U-turn that unnerved the market and sent the bond in question into a tailspin.
The decision, taken by new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel barely a month after his arrival, took bond investors by surprise after the lender's chief financial officer said in February the bank expected to pay a coupon.
In a statement, Euroclear, which settles and clears securities trades executed on European exchanges, said it had told clients on May 19 the payments would not take place.
""Due to an internal processing error, nevertheless provisional credits were made and became visible to clients. No payment has been made,"" it said, adding it was reversing the provisional credits.
On Wednesday Bloomberg cited sources saying some bondholders had received notice of a coupon payment. Holders of the 2.98 billion euro ($3.6 billion) bonds received the notification on Tuesday, it said. (https://bloom.bg/2SrB5dN)
Since the pandemic broke out bond investors have been concerned banks could decide not to pay coupons on some debt which provides the option to defer payments.
The interest payments withheld by UniCredit so far amount to 30 million euros. They would total 120 million euros for the whole of 2021 if the decision were upheld in coming quarters, as has happened in the past when payments were skipped in the first quarter.
On Tuesday a spokesman for the Italian bank said ""UniCredit confirms its decision not to pay the CASHES' coupon and has not given anyone mandate to do so.""

On Wednesday it declined to further comment beyond its earlier statement.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 12:58PM ET</span>","Buy now, pay later players tackle credit conundrum in Mideast's Gulf","By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Financial technology start-ups in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates offering online short-term credit say they are enjoying exponential growth as the coronavirus pandemic drives a shift in consumer spending online. 
Digital buy now, pay later (BNPL) purchasing is relatively new to the region where consumers have traditionally been sceptical of paying for goods before getting them.
But Saudi Arabian-based Tamara and UAE's Spotii, Tabby and Postpay all say the take-up has far exceeded initial expectations. And investors are paying attention. Tamara last month raised $110 million in debt and equity, a large amount for an early stage Middle East start-up.
This week, Australia's second biggest BNPL player Zip said it was buying the rest of the shares in Spotii it did not already own for $16 million. Tabby has raised over $30 million including funding from Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala.
""We're constantly having to re-forecast our numbers just because we constantly get surprised by the consumer adoption,"" Tabby Co-Founder and Chief Executive Hosam Arab told Reuters.
There is no independent data available on the Middle East BNPL market which also includes Shahry in Egypt; all of the companies in the sector are early stage start-ups and many only began operating last year.
In the United States, Australia and Europe, BNPL is marketed as an alternative to credit cards. During the pandemic, with consumers conserving cash and seeking alternative methods of borrowing money, the service exploded in popularity.
In the Gulf, BNPL companies present themselves as an alternative to cash on delivery, the most common payment method for online purchases in many Middle East countries, according to a 2018 report by British security firm  G4S  (CSE:G4S). 
But Anil Malhotra, chief marketing officer of digital payments business Bango, said a cultural challenge for BNPL in the Gulf was to make sure it ""doesn't look or smell like credit.""
Islamic customs prohibit charging interests on loans, which has deterred some Middle East consumers from using credit cards.
Saudi Arabian independent retailer Crate, which introduced Tamara on its website last August, has found that while those checking out with BNPL had become repeat users, most customers preferred to pay by card or cash on delivery.
Half of all purchases are paid with card, while cash on delivery accounts for 40% of all online transactions with BNPL making up 10%, Chief Executive Rayan Fadul told Reuters.
BNPL is still new to the region's consumers who are wary of using a product they don't yet fully understand, he believes.
""They would like to see other people talk about it first and maybe explain to them how easy it is.""
PHYSICAL OPPORTUNITY 
The model varies but BNPL companies typically allow shoppers to pay for purchases in instalments over several weeks or months. Gulf providers do not charge interest and instead earn most revenue by charging merchants fees.
While shoppers can be charged hefty fees if they miss a payment, providers say they cause less financial burden than credit cards. Users can be suspended if they miss a payment.
They also say they help merchants increase sales as shoppers are able to spread out payments over an extended period and allow shoppers to buy products they need.
As BNPL firms generally make money off merchant commissions and late fees, not interest payments, they sidestep the legal definition of credit - and credit laws.
But the sector has come under scrutiny with authorities in Britain and elsewhere reviewing or tightening rules around the industry, with some regulators saying that technology companies offering BNPL should be regulated like ordinary lenders. 
It's not clear how Middle East regulators plan to react. The financial authorities in Saudi Arabia and the UAE did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
""This is credit and if credit is mismanaged, either by the lender or borrower, bad things happen,"" Citi Global Head of Banking Research Ronit Ghose told Reuters.
Tamara, which is in Saudi and the UAE, says it has signed up over 1,000 merchants and that transaction volume has been increasing 170% month-on-month. Spotii, available in Saudi, UAE, Bahrain and Oman, has 650 merchants on its platform and has seen transaction volume rise at an average of 90% month-on-month since it launched last year, according to Zip.
Postpay, Spotii, Tabby and Tamara all say they plan to expand to other markets soon.
As the impact of the pandemic diminishes, investors also see an opportunity for BNPL firms to take more business at the shop till in the Middle East. 
""We think physical point of sale will play a very big role in the future of BNPL in this part of the world,"" said Eslam Darwish, partner at Dubai-based venture capital firm Global Ventures which has invested in Tabby.

Alshaya Group, a Kuwaiti retailer with Middle East franchising rights for companies including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Hennes & Mauritz, is planning to roll out Postpay in different online stores after trailing it this year in the UAE at Footlocker.
""We are certainly looking at in-store availability of BNPL to benefit customers who, sometimes or always, prefer physical to digital shopping,"" Chief Digital Officer Paul Morris said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - ByteDance, the Chinese owner of short video platform giant TikTok, launched a share buyback this week for current and former employees, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
The buyback comes after ByteDance announced in April that it did not have imminent plans for a public listing. The company had planned to list some of its Chinese businesses including TikTok's Chinese version Douyin in Hong Kong, sources previously told Reuters.
Last week, company founder Zhang Yiming unexpectedly announced that he will step down as CEO, a move that comes as Chinese regulators are increasing scrutiny of the country's biggest technology firms.
In an email sent to current and former employees this week, ByteDance said eligible shareholders can apply to sell their holdings by June 20 at $126 per share for current employees and $100.80 per share for former employees, the people said.
The price for current employees during an earlier buyback last November was $60 a share, the sources said. 
Beijing-based ByteDance declined to comment. 

The nine-year-old company typically launches share buybacks twice a year, the sources said, declining to be named as the information is not public. 
Some ByteDance employees recently expressed frustration on social media for not being able to sell their shares in an IPO.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The white woman who falsely told police that a Black bird-watcher threatened her in New York City's Central Park sued her former employer Franklin Templeton, saying it fired her without doing a fair investigation and falsely portrayed her as racist.
Amy Cooper said in a Tuesday night complaint that Franklin Templeton's actions following the May 25, 2020, encounter substantially harmed her career, and caused such severe emotional distress that she became suicidal.
""Plaintiff's personal and professional life has been destroyed by the knowingly false statements defendants made,"" said the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.
Cooper, 41, who had been an insurance portfolio manager, is seeking unspecified damages for race and gender discrimination, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence.
Franklin Templeton, part of Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN), said it would defend against Cooper's ""baseless"" claims, including against Chief Executive Jenny Johnson.
""We believe the circumstances of the situation speak for themselves and that the company responded appropriately,"" it said in a statement.
Lawyers for Cooper declined to comment.
Cooper's confrontation with the bird-watcher Christian Cooper went viral after a video emerged of her appearing agitated, calling the police and saying ""there's an African-American man threatening my life.""
She made the call after Christian Cooper, who is not related to her, asked her to leash her dog to comply with park rules. 
Franklin Templeton fired Cooper the next day, saying it did not condone racism.
Cooper had worked for the company in New York since 2015, and said she received ""countless"" phone and text threats after its phone system gave callers her cellphone number.
The video has been seen on Twitter more than 45 million times.
It was taken the same day a Minneapolis policeman killed George Floyd, sparking nationwide protests about racial injustice.

Manhattan prosecutors charged Amy Cooper last July with filing a false police report.
They dropped the misdemeanor charge in February after Cooper completed therapy that included instruction on not using racial bias.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A lawyer for the European Union accused AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on Wednesday of failing to respect its contract with the 27-nation bloc for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and asked a Belgian court to impose a large fine on the company.
The EU took the Anglo-Swedish firm to court in April after the drugmaker said it would aim to deliver only 100 million doses of its vaccine by the end of June, instead of the 300 million foreseen in the supply contract. Brussels wants the company to deliver at least 120 millionvaccines by the end of June. AstraZeneca had delivered 50 million doses by the beginning of May, just a quarter of the 200 million vaccines foreseen in the contract by then. ""AstraZeneca did not even try to respect the contract,"" the EU's lawyer, Rafael Jafferali, told a Brussels court in the first hearing on the substance of the legal case.
He said the EU was seeking 10 euros ($12.2) for each day of delay for each dose as compensation for AstraZeneca's non-compliance with the contract. 
This could be as high as 200 million euros ($244 million) per day from July 1, AstraZeneca's lawyer Hakim Boularbah told the court, asking the judge to revise it down in case of a negative verdict.
Jafferali said the EU was seeking an additional penalty of at least 10 million euros for each breach of the contract that the judge may decide.
The next hearing is on June 4 followed by a verdict which is expected sometime later that month.
NOT A CONTRACT FOR SHOES
""This is not a contract for the delivery of shoes or T-shirts,"" Boularbah said, stressing the complexity of manufacturing a new vaccine.
The EU accusations were ""shocking"", Boularbah said, noting the company had formulated its delivery targets based on early estimates of production capacity. He added that the vaccine was sold at cost. 
AstraZeneca has repeatedly said the contract was notbinding as it only committed to make ""best reasonable efforts"" in delivering doses. Jafferali said that principle had not been respected because the drugmaker had not delivered to the bloc 50 million doses produced in factories that are listed in the contract as suppliers to the EU, including 39 million doses manufactured in Britain, 10 million produced in the United States and 1 million in the Netherlands.
The lawyer said these doses were ""diverted"" to other clients. The company has said that doses produced in Britain were reserved under a contract the British government signed with the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine. 
AstraZeneca's lawyer said the British factories were mentioned in the EU contract for information, but there was no commitment to use them. They were expected to produce vaccines solely for Britain until February 2021, when the company expected to deliver 100 million doses to London. It has not yet completed its deliveries to Britain. Jafferali said AstraZeneca had pledged in the EU contract not to have other engagements that would prevent it from abiding by the terms of the deal. The lawyer also said AstraZeneca had failed to communicate to the EU in a timely manner the magnitude of its supply problems because it repeatedly sent messages, including publicly, that it was able to meet its targets, before finally admitting there were large shortfalls in March. The company had warned the EU in December of productionproblems, but communicated only at the end of January, just before the start of deliveries, a much larger cut than initially expected for the first-quarter.
Boularbah said AstraZeneca had continuously kept the EU informed about its production plans and problems.

He said the company had informed the EU last summer that the UK-based factories making the vaccine were to be used exclusively to supply Britain as part of its contract with the government there.

MADRID (Reuters) -Luis Gallego, chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), said on Wednesday he expects COVID-19 to spur further airline consolidation, eventually leaving just two or three carriers per continent.
The pandemic has ravaged the industry, grounding thousands of planes worldwide and sending airlines scrambling for cash as countries shut borders and restricted travel.
""We will all have a huge amount of debt after this crisis so all of us will be smaller for some time,"" Gallego told a virtual event on the prospects for the tourism sector.
""Some won't survive: there will be opportunities for consolidation we'll participate in.""
Asked whether the trend would lead to two or three dominant airlines in each continent, Gallego agreed and stressed the importance of better combining different flight networks.
He also said he hoped the North Atlantic corridor would open by late June, early July and said the United States should be included on Britain's green list of safe destinations due to its high vaccination rate.
Gallego described IAG's joint businesses in the North Atlantic and Middle East as a key driver in its recovery and expansion, particularly the partnership with Qatar Airways.
While the industry expects to recover pre-pandemic passenger volumes by 2023 or 2024, Gallego forecast business travel - a crucial earner - would remain around 15% below 2019 levels, forcing IAG to seek greater efficiency elsewhere.
Increased domestic travel is also set to play a pivotal role in the recovery, Gallego added, pointing to China, where internal flights already exceed 2019.
""Higher taxes and more costs in airports is not the solution,"" Gallego said as some EU countries plan to hike taxes on short-haul flights and introduce a frequent traveller tax to cut carbon emissions.

He called instead for more plants to produce less-polluting sustainable aviation fuel to help meet emission-reduction targets. 
Sustainable fuel generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels, offering airlines a way to become greener while continuing to fly.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Delta Air makes $350 million gamble as it lobbies Biden on fuel credits,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) has stopped buying the credits its oil refining arm needs to comply with U.S. biofuel laws, leaving it with a $346 million liability at the end of the first quarter, as it tries to persuade the White House to ease its obligations, according to previously unreported financial filings and sources familiar with the matter.
The decision to suspend buying is a risky gamble by the airline as these credits hit record highs and Delta works to convince the White House to ease its obligations to comply with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the sources said.
Merchant refiners like Delta-owned Monroe Energy have long opposed the RFS, which requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase credits from those who do, often at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Delta's refinery, along with a handful of others, is seeking a temporary waiver of biofuel laws from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, arguing the costs are overly burdensome and threaten their plants.
The issue looms large for Delta because it owns the 185,000 barrel-per-day Monroe Energy refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, a facility it has tried but failed to sell in recent years. 
Delta did not respond directly to questions about the decision to stop buying the fuel credits, known as RINS. 
A spokesman pointed to comments on an April 15 investor call by the airline's co-chief financial officer, Gary Chase, who said a ""huge escalation in the cost of RINS"" from 60 cents to 70 cents at the end of the fourth quarter to above $1 now has impacted ""near-term performance."" Chase suggested the price movements were among ""short-term dislocations"" affecting the refinery. 
A refiner might stop buying credits for reasons including that they were short on cash, or that they thought RIN prices were likely to fall in the future, or expected some regulatory relief that would reduce their compliance requirements.
For example, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, a nearby shuttered refinery, stopped buying credits and built up a massive liability ahead of filing for bankruptcy in 2018.
The Trump administration eventually waived roughly $200 million of Philadelphia Energy's credit liability, angering the nation's Farm Belt, but rescuing the refinery for a brief time.
Delta's $346 million outstanding liability on biofuel credits is roughly double its full-year 2020 RFS compliance costs of $172 million and significantly higher than the $58 million it paid in 2019, according to company filings.
The $346 million figure represents the current value of credits the company would need to buy to comply with the RFS. Those credits are meant to be handed in annually to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Delta reported an overall adjusted net loss of $2.26 billion for the quarter ended March 31, its fifth quarterly loss in a row, as air travel continued to be stifled by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHITE HOUSE PUSH
The refinery, which employs 450 people and hundreds of contract workers, mostly from trade unions, is also looking to join with union labor in the upcoming weeks to ratchet up pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden, according to two sources familiar with the planning. 
Refinery and labor leaders plan to argue that without any relief from the White House, hundreds of union jobs are at risk.
Biden helped rescue the U.S. East Coast refining industry as vice president years ago. But the current environment will be a major test of whether Biden can juggle his ambitious climate goals with supporting high-paying union jobs. 
""Delta, quite honestly, might not have the cash to devote to this right now,"" said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston who has been critical of Delta’s decision to buy the refinery. ""If they get relief from the government, then great, but it could be a risky bet.""
Most merchant refiners buy credits daily to avoid amassing a large liability and exposure to fluctuating prices, but Monroe Energy has slowed or halted purchases, according to two market sources with knowledge of the company’s trading activity. 
""We haven't seen them in the market for months. It’s unusual,"" said one of the sources who trades the credits.

Monroe Energy did not respond to requests for comment on their activities.
Delta RIN credit liability was detailed in a footnote in its most recent securities filing for the quarter ending March 31. Last year, at the same time, the company had an outstanding obligation of $33 million, records show.

Similar comments from European Central Bank policymakers, including that it may be too early to discuss tapering of emergency bond purchases, helped equity markets in the region stabilize.
But banking stocks came under pressure as a result.
""Investors appear to be fairly content with the outlook for policy, and inflation concerns have certainly receded for the time being,"" said Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG.
""This will mean that further gains in bank stocks based off hopes of rising yields will be cancelled out for the time being, resulting in banks joining in the list of stocks that have struggled to find a catalyst to keep rising,"" he added.
The STOXX 600 hit a record high on Tuesday, after rising almost 12% this year, helped by strong earnings and optimism over re-opening of economies as COVID-19 vaccinations pick up.
""We've been very risk on for the start of 2021, and we've taken quite a bit of cyclicality off our asset allocation simply because we're missing the next big catalyst on the macro side,"" said Max Kettner, multi-asset strategist at HSBC Global Research. 
European stocks are set to hold around or inch just above current record levels, with a Reuters poll of strategists predicting the STOXX 600 would reach 451 points by year end, just 1.3% above Monday's close.
British retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) jumped 8.5% to a one-year high after it said it had traded well in the early weeks of the 2021-22 and that earnings would recover after an 88% slump in full-year profit.

French food firm Danone slipped 1.8% after Berenberg downgraded the stock to ""sell"", citing the hard-to-fix low-growth nature of most of its businesses.

GM and Lockheed said they would collaborate to make a battery-powered, autonomous Lunar Terrain Vehicle for NASA's Artemis lunar landing program, which aims to return U.S. astronauts to the moon as early as 2024. 
NASA is expected to launch a competition to develop lunar vehicles in its Artemis moon landing program. The agency has outlined plans for a variety of lunar vehicles that can carry human explorers, haul commercial payloads or traverse remote regions of the moon on missions lasting as long as 100 days.
Elon Musk's rocket launch company, SpaceX, won a $2.9 billion contract last month to build the spacecraft to carry NASA astronauts to the moon. That award is being challenged by Jeff Bezos' BlueOrigin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc.
Lockheed and GM have a history in space. Lockheed has worked on NASA space projects for 50 years and GM helped develop the original NASA lunar rover, which ferried NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon in the early 1970s.
For GM, getting back into the space business offers a fresh way to compete with Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and SpaceX for the attention of investors, customers and future employees. 
Musk has used SpaceX to promote Tesla's electric vehicles, including launching a Tesla Roadster into deep space.
Lockheed and GM said their proposed lunar vehicle would use GM battery technology to travel ""significantly farther distances"" than the Apollo mission vehicles, which ventured just 4.7 miles from the landers. 

One goal for the new vehicle is to allow for exploration of the Moon's dark, rugged south pole, and other areas humans have not gone before, GM and Lockheed said.
GM and Lockheed said their vehicle would be designed to provide ""commercial payload services"" and prepare for human landings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday it is finalizing rules establishing a long-delayed electronic pilot records database demanded by Congress in 2010 in the wake of a fatal crash.
In March, the FAA published proposed rules to establish a new database to provide potential employers with rapid access to information about pilot performance and employment records after the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in February 2009 near Buffalo killed 50 people. The FAA said operators will have until late 2024 to fully comply with the rule. 
In July, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) cited the FAA's failure to finalize the database as a contributing factor in a February 2019 fatal crash of an Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW) cargo plane.
The new final rule, which has been submitted for formal publication by the FAA, requires air carriers to report pilots’ employment history, training, and qualifications to the database and to review electronic records when considering pilots for employment.
""It has been a long journey for the families of Colgan Flight 3407, but their tireless advocacy and continued engagement with the FAA has made this database a reality. With it, employers will be able to quickly and thoroughly make informed hiring decisions to keep our skies safe,” said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson in a statement.
The FAA said the database is ""intended to help ensure that no records about a pilot’s performance with previous employers that could influence a future employer’s decision go unidentified.""
The captain of Flight 3407 failed three tests known as “check rides” but only disclosed one to the airline. ""Access to these records is critical to ensuring that airlines have as much information as possible about a pilot’s qualifications and safety records prior to making a hiring decision,"" New York lawmakers wrote in February.
In the Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) crash, the NTSB cited the first officer’s inappropriate response to an inadvertent activation of the airplane’s go-around mode that resulted in his spatial disorientation and led him to place the airplane in a steep dive from which it did not recover.
The NTSB said the first officer had a long history of training difficulties at several employers and cited ""deliberate attempts” to hide employment history deficiencies.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 11:31AM ET</span>",Michael Kors parent expects upbeat full year as luxury demand rebounds,"(Reuters) -Capri Holdings Ltd on Wednesday forecast annual revenue and profit above analysts' expectations, as shoppers return to stores in the United States following speedy vaccinations.
The company said it would raise prices this fall and spring next year for Michael Kors, its biggest brand by sales that it planned to transform into a ""smaller, more profitable business.""
The emphasis comes as the brand's about 4% sales decline in the fourth quarter was in contrast to that at its Versace and Jimmy Choo businesses which grew 10% and 16%, respectively.
Chief Executive Officer John Idol said the company plans to further Michael Kors's appeal as a more luxurious brand in North America with fewer promotional merchandise on shelves by curtailing the amount of supply. 
Idol said the company expanded its database for the brand by 18% in the fourth quarter, adding ""it also means that the price increases are not stopping that customer from crossing the line and purchasing products."" 
Capri expects total revenue of about $5.1 billion for its fiscal 2022, higher than Wall Street projections of $4.99 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Gross margin is expected to increase about 50 basis points, even as transportation costs increase. 
The company has kept a tight control over inventory during the pandemic that has bolstered its gross margin.
Capri said e-commerce sales rose 80% in the fourth quarter, with retail sales rising 13%.

Bigger rivals LVMH, Hermes and Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have also benefited as traditionally reluctant luxury products sellers invest heavily to take advantage of the shift to selling online.
Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.20 billion beat estimates of $1.02 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 38 cents per share, handily topping the estimate of 2 cents.

Revenue rose to 76.88 billion yuan ($12 billion) in the quarter ended March 31, from 49.70 billion yuan a year earlier. Analysts expected revenue of 74.5 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data.
Adjusted net profit rose to 6.1 billion yuan, versus market estimates of 3.97 billion yuan.
Xiaomi's share of the smartphone market in China increased 75% year-on-year in the quarter ended late March, according to research firm Canalys, as Huawei retreated from the market following U.S. trade restrictions that crimped its ability to source key components for its handsets.
Revenue from smartphone sales jumped 69.8% year-over-year to 51.5 billion yuan, while revenue from internet services increased 11.4% to 6.6 billion yuan.
Despite the revenue growth, Xiaomi and other electronics brands remain hampered by the global chip shortage. 
A number of causes such as stockpiling, surging demand for personal computers during COVID-19, and mishaps at factories caused a range of hardware makers to scramble for semiconductors late last year.
Still, on a call with investors, Xiaomi CFO Alain Lam said the company's chip inventories remained at ""healthy"" levels and he did not expect a major impact on business this year, though the broader shortage may not end until mid-way through 2022.
Executives also added the company intends to double the number of offline retail stores it has in China, from roughly 5,000 at present to over 10,000. 
In India, meanwhile, one of its key overseas markets, the company will invest more in online sales as the government imposes strict lockdowns due to a surge in COVID-19 cases.
This quarter, Xiaomi also announced it would formally begin producing electric cars, with a new division to be led by Xiaomi founder Lei Jun. 

The U.S. government also removed the company from a blacklist that would have barred U.S.-based investors from owning shares in the company, reversing one of former U.S. President Donald Trump's last maneuvers against China's tech sector before he left office.

Investing – Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) shares touched their year’s high and were up 14% Wednesday as the company roared back to quarterly profit with operating income of $57 million, the best for a first quarter since 2008.
Net income was $41.76 million against a loss of $244.03 million in the quarter ended May 2 last year.
Net sales rose 6% from first quarter 2019 pre-pandemic levels, riding on products that found resonance with new and existing customers. Tight control over inventories improved price realizations and margins.
Sales growth was achieved despite the reduction of 1.3 million gross square feet of store space, or 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2019.

Hence, investors seeking to capitalize on the rising metal prices should consider betting on mining stocks Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL), Centerra Gold (CGAU), Sierra Metals (NYSE:SMTS), and Jaguar Mining (OTC:JAGGF). They are each still trading at a reasonable price.The metals and mining industry took a hit in the first half of last year as the COVID-19 pandemic halted production and manufacturing around the globe. An improving global economy is now lending support to metal prices because they are an essential part of the industrial sector. Hence, the mining space has already started to recover and now seems poised to grow significantly in the coming months. Notably, the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) has returned 32.4% so far this year, compared to the broader market S&P 500’s 11.7% gains.
It is true that China is at the forefront of economic growth and commodity consumption. However, the U.S. economy registered 6.4% annual GDP growth in the first-quarter of 2021, and economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect the U.S. economy to grow 8% in 2021. A resurgence in domestic industrial activities should drive inflation this year, and investors usually scoop up metals and other commodities during inflationary times. Furthermore, President Biden’s ambitious ‘Build Back Better’ infrastructure plan should drive domestic demand for metals and other commodities. This, coupled with global supply chain constraints, should further drive commodity prices north.
With money printing picking up pace globally and the Fed expanding its balance sheet, metals and commodity prices are expected to continue moving higher. So, we think it wise to bet now on affordable metal mining stocks—Vedanta Limited (VEDL), Centerra Gold Inc. (CGAU),  Sierra Metals Inc . (SMTS) and Jaguar Mining Inc. (JAGGF)—that are currently trading at reasonable prices. As direct beneficiaries of rising metal prices, these stocks could witness solid upside in the near term.

The company reported impressive financials for the quarter ended March 31. And because the demand for iron ore is expected to continue increasing worldwide, we think there could be plenty of upside left in VALE stock. Read on to learn more.Headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the world’s largest producer of iron ore, pellets and nickel, Vale S.A. (VALE) is no stranger to controversy. In March, it concluded the sale of its New Caledonia nickel mining assets to a consortium that included commodity trader Trafigura, opening the way for a production restart at the site, which had been hit by political unrest.
The stock has gained 15.8% over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $20.14.
VALE’s long-term performance is also impressive. It has returned 43.6% over the past three years. Furthermore, its revenue has grown at a 31% CAGR over the past three years, while its EPS grew at a 48.4% CAGR. On April 19, the company signed an investment agreement with Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

The fire at Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg early on Wednesday morning damaged several power cables leading to the Tesla site and an area of around 3 square metres, said a spokesman for the LKA state criminal investigation office.
The spokesman said arson was not being ruled out and investigators were examining a letter that circulated on social media during Wednesday which claimed responsibility. 
The letter, which was published on a radical left platform, said it had cut the power supply to the Tesla site by setting fire to six high-voltage cables above ground.
""Tesla is neither green, ecological nor social,"" said the letter, according to the LKA spokeman. 

Tesla, which has said it could produce up to 500,000 Model Y cars at the site annually, delayed the opening of its gigafactory to late 2021 from an initial July 1 date after adding plans to set up a battery cell plant there. 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has complained about German red tape needed for lengthy approval processes after construction of the factory was held up by environmentalists concerned about local wildlife and water resources.

(Reuters) -Bank of Montreal (BMO) kicked off Canadian lenders' second-quarter results reporting by strongly beating analysts' estimates on Wednesday as it set aside fewer provisions than expected and its capital markets unit swung to a profit. 
Canada's fourth-largest lender is also manually adjudicating more mortgages in areas with rapidly growing house prices and is stress testing its broader loan portfolios against higher interest rates, in addition to individual borrowers, Chief Risk Officer Pat Cronin said on an analyst call.
The measures at BMO, whose loan growth in recent quarters has been driven almost entirely by mortgages, similar to other Canadian banks, come as Canada's central bank sounds alarm bells about risks due to rapid house price appreciation and regulators tighten lending requirements. 
BMO is taking extra precautions while issuing mortgages in red-hot housing markets.
""But ultimately, our mortgages and loans are (based on) the borrower's ability to pay, not the house price,"" Cronin added.
As signs of an economic recovery emerge with COVID-19 vaccinations picking up, Canadian banks are continuing their better-than-expected run with loan losses remaining low. Strong trading activity and deal-making have also been a boon in recent quarters. 
Bank of Montreal shares rose 0.25% to C$123.93 in morning trading in Toronto, versus a 0.4% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark, after touching an all-time intraday high on Tuesday. The Canadian bank benchmark was on track for a record close on Wednesday.
Investors had been expecting lenders to beat estimates.
BMO released C$95 million ($78.5 million) of reserves on performing loans, compared with provisions of C$705 million a year ago. The total provisions of C$60 million were nearly a quarter of what analysts had expected. 
BMO's capital markets unit posted adjusted profit of C$547 million, from a C$68 million loss a year earlier, while wealth management earnings more than doubled to C$346 million.
But commercial loans fell nearly 15% year-on-year, while consumer lending grew 3.3%, driven almost entirely by mortgages.
The higher qualifying rate for mortgages, set to take effect on June 1, is expected to affect about 5% to 10% of borrowers, executives said on the call. 

BMO reported net income excluding one-off items of C$3.13 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of C$2.77.

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager running roughly $9 trillion, is a long-term investor, Fink said. And crypto currencies could potentially play a role in long-term investing as an asset class similar to gold.
For now, it is too early to determine whether cryptocurrencies are ""just a speculative trading tool"" he said. He also noted that broker dealers are the ones making the most money from the volatility of many cryptocurrencies and their wide bid-ask spreads.

Earlier in the meeting, BlackRock said all of its 16 director nominees were elected with a majority of shareholder votes cast. It also said that executive pay had been backed by 93% of shareholder votes. 
A shareholder resolution to convert the company into a public benefit corporation - with the aim of putting all stakeholders on equal footing with shareholders - was rejected, receiving only 2.3% of the vote.

The fact that total net sales decreased 13% from the same period in fiscal 2019, a pre-pandemic time, pulled sentiment lower. They came at $2.92 billion, 44% higher from the same period in fiscal 2020.
This is in contrast to many other retailers reporting numbers that beat the 2019 period before coronavirus. Many chains have left 2019 behind, helped by stimulus-driven consumer spending and the desire of people to return to normal times after a year of struggling with the pandemic.
Price markdowns, necessary to reduce excess holiday season inventory, hurt the bottom line even though it narrowed from same period last year.
Net loss was $166 million, down by more than a third from $521 million in the quarter ended May 2 last year.

Nasdaq's move follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval last week of a Nasdaq proposal to allow companies to raise capital in a direct listing as long the shares start trading within the indicated price range set. The listing would be pulled if shares were set to trade outside that range.
Nasdaq on Wednesday asked the SEC to remove any ceiling on how the shares trade. A company's stock would not be allowed to open more than 20% below the lowest price in the price range, but there would be no restriction on how high it can trade.
""Based on conversations with companies and their advisors, Nasdaq believes that there may be a reluctance to use the existing direct listing with a capital raise rules because of concerns about the pricing range limitation,"" Nasdaq said in the filing.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In making the request to the SEC, Nasdaq is reverting to the plan it submitted to the securities watchdog last August. It amended the plan in February to bring it in line with a similar proposal from rival the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The SEC approved the NYSE plan in December. 
Companies have been monitoring the regulatory developments but have yet to embark on a direct listing that would raise capital for them, because of the restrictions on how their shares would be allowed trade. 

Advocates of the plan say it will allow companies to raise money without paying hefty underwriting fees to Wall Street banks. Some investors in private companies, such as venture capital firms, also fret that banks underprice traditional initial public offerings to create a first-day trading pop.
A growing number of companies have recently gone public through a direct listing, including big names such as analytics company Palantir Technologies, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global and gaming company Roblox Corp. None of these companies raised capital in their direct listings.

Investing – Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) rose more than 8% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company raised its guidance and posted record quarterly earnings.
A $200-million repurchase plan for 2021 was just an added lubricant in today’s trade.
The sporting goods retailer has now guided for net sales of $10.51 billion to $10.80 billion this year, up from the $9.54 billion to $9.93 billion range it gave in March.
Earnings per diluted share are seen at $7.05 to $7.68, more than the $3.81 to $4.55 range it forecast earlier.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2021 were $2.92 billion, an increase of 119% compared to the first quarter of 2020. They were 52% higher than the levels of the 2019 quarter, a pre-pandemic period.
Same-store sales, a crucial benchmark given that this compares sales of stores that existed last year as well and ignores new store additions, more than doubled. They rose 115%, including the 14% increase in ecommerce sales.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) forecast a rebound in profit this year after an 88% slump in 2020-21 that reflected a collapse in clothing sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic but warned investors not to expect a dividend this year.
Chief Executive Steve Rowe said the results masked progress made in the 137-year-old group's latest turnaround plan, while trading in the early weeks of its new financial year had been encouraging.
Shares in M&S were up 7.3% at 167.4 pence at 0934 GMT. They were changing hands for 236 pence in May 2019.
Rowe, along with chairman Archie Norman, has focused on transforming the company's culture, improving clothing and food products and value to broaden its appeal, while closing stores and investing heavily in technology and e-commerce, including a joint venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO).
""By going further and faster in our transformation during this period of disruption...we have now moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S that is ready for the next phase,"" he told reporters.
""We now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again,"" he said.
With online penetration of its clothing and home business expected to grow to up to 50%, Rowe said M&S would accelerate the re-shaping of its store estate.
M&S currently has 254 full line stores, selling clothing and homeware and food. It is now targeting a fully modernised core of about 180 stores.
The group made a pretax profit before one-off items of 50.3 million pounds ($71.2 million) in the year to April 3, down from 403.1 million pounds in 2019-20.
Like-for-like clothing and homeware sales plunged 31.5%, damaged by multiple coronavirus lockdowns which shuttered stores. Clothing and homeware sales in stores crashed 56.2%, partly offset by online growth of 53.9%.
In food, where space remained open during the crisis, like-for-like sales rose 1.3%.
On a statutory basis M&S sank to a pretax loss of 209.4 million pounds, versus a profit of 67.2 million pounds in 2019-20.
All UK clothing retailers have been hit hard by the pandemic. Last month Primark which does not trade online, reported a drop in annual profit of 90%. Next, which has a huge online business, has shown greater resilience but its full-year profit still fell 53%.
M&S said trading for the first six weeks of the 2021-22 financial year had been ahead of the comparable period two years ago and its central expectations.

It forecast underlying pretax profit to recover to 300-350 million pounds in 2021-22 and a further reduction in net debt.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 08:52AM ET</span>","In U.S. creator economy boom, big tech battles for online talent","By Elizabeth Culliford and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Katie Feeney, an 18-year-old from Olney, Maryland, was in her calculus class on Zoom in November when she learned that a week of posting skits and unboxing videos on Snapchat earned her $229,000. Her $1.4 million in total earnings over the past seven months will be enough to pay for her college tuition at Penn State to study business.
Portland-based personal trainer Julian Shaw dug himself out of $18,000 in credit card debt during the pandemic by selling fitness education videos ""with a bit of sex appeal,"" on OnlyFans, a content subscription site favored by sex workers paid directly by followers for posts.
In the last year, major social media companies have raced to announce dozens of features aimed at attracting creators, an estimated 50 million people like Feeney and Shaw who range from internet personalities posting beauty tutorials on YouTube and TikTok to independent journalists selling newsletter subscriptions on Substack to video gamers live-streaming on Twitch.
The popularity of upstarts like TikTok, whose tools have helped unknowns generate massive audiences and whose $2 billion creator fund helped drive attention to the rapidly expanding field, has set off an arms race among big incumbents like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Alphabet-owned YouTube to lure the most popular creators, sometimes called influencers. They have introduced new features, funds and subscription or tipping tools to earn money from fans. 
The trend means changes for ordinary social media users too. They will face more requests or requirements to pay for content that is now available for free. And the new tools give them opportunities to engage more directly with influencers. 
The companies' race to attract and keep creators represents an evolution of the social media creator economy, which for years was based around earning money through ad revenue sharing and brand sponsorships. The sponsorship market reached $8 billion in 2019 and is projected to hit $15 billion by next year, according to influencer marketing firm Mediakix. 
""The power has shifted away from the platforms to the creators,"" said Josh Constine from venture capital firm SignalFire, which invests in one-year-old popular audio chat app Clubhouse. ""The platforms all stepped up and realized that they were in grave danger of losing their labor force, if they didn't add these features.""
Vine's experience is a cautionary tale, Constine said. The briefly hot short-form video app purchased by Twitter was considered a predecessor to TikTok but died after creators left the service because it did not provide ways for them to earn money.
Facebook, which long lacked monetization features, has announced a slew of creator-focused features and is paying video gamers as it builds out Facebook Gaming. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said this week the app was ""exploring"" content subscriptions, which would be a first for the Facebook-owned app.
Even Twitter is racing to catch up by teasing ""Super Follow,"" a feature for users to pay popular Twitter figures for exclusive content, and announcing paid ticketing for its new live audio chatrooms. This month it also launched a way for audiences to make online payments to a user's ""Tip Jar.""
When Los Angeles-based photographer Nesrin Danan learned in May that she could earn tips on the site, she tweeted to her 27,000 followers: ""I have tweeted 40,000 times since 2009 for FREE so if you have ever let out even the slightest chuckle at my unhinged nonsense I'm expecting at least $1."" She said she made a few hundred dollars this month.
THE CREATOR CHASE 
Social media personalities are parlaying success on one platform into earnings on another. This reduces their dependence on one app, where they could be vulnerable to algorithm changes or moderation decisions.
To keep creators engaged, tech platforms have dedicated funds to pay users who produce the most engaging content. Snapchat says it has spent $130 million since November financing contributors on its short-form feature ""Spotlight.""
Dominic Andre, a mental health therapist turned TikTok science video creator, said he long had his eye on getting involved with Snapchat's programs. A screenshot of the earnings he and his girlfriend made in the past year from Spotlight - $966,546 - is framed in the Los Angeles house that the money helped them buy. 
Feeney, who initially grew a following of over 5 million on TikTok before expanding to Snapchat, says she was recruited by YouTube to join a beta test for its new TikTok clone Shorts.
Tech journalist Casey Newton, who left Vox Media to write his newsletter ""Platformer"" on Substack in September, said companies are also offering more favorable terms for creators than they had previously. One example is Facebook's plans to let writers on its upcoming newsletter product export the email addresses of their readers if they decide to use a different publishing service, he said.
""I think that speaks to how much power creators have in this moment,"" Newton said.
YouTube, which has long provided ways for video posters to make money and says it has paid over $30 billion to creators and media organizations in the last three years, recently launched a $100 million fund for Shorts creators.

Jamie Byrne, YouTube's senior director of creator partnerships, said creators asked for such a fund if they were to make their YouTube channel the main home for their followings.
""Creators are taking their rightful place in the center of the creator economy universe,"" he said. ""We need to be their home base.""

Investing.com -- Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) shares jumped in Wednesday’s premarket following an optimistic outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 after positively surprising with its first three-month numbers.
The retailer benefited from consumers returning in larger numbers to its stores and digital channels as lockdown restrictions were lifted and people were happy to spend their stimulus checks.
Alongside first quarter numbers of last year, the retailers also gave comparisons with fiscal 2020 quarter numbers when most of the world hadn’t heard about coronavirus.
“. . .we believe the second quarter could continue to show steady sales improvement vs. FY’20,” Urban’s Co-President and COO Frank Conforti said at its conference call for analysts Tuesday.
The company expects the rise in its selling, general and administrative expenses to stay contained below its sales growth in the quarters ahead.
It will also open more stores this year, Conforti said, pegging the number at 54 excluding franchise partners’. It will close 18 of the existing ones.
Urban Outfitters surprised on the gross margin front too. At a call with analysts in March, it had warned its gross profit margins for the first quarter could be down several hundred basis points to fiscal 2020’s.
Gross profit margins, as a percentage of net sales, came at 32.4% for the quarter ended April 30. It was 31.1% in the same quarter two years ago.
Urban sales for the first quarter increased by 7% to a record $927 million. Net income for the quarter was $54 million or $0.54 per diluted share. It was $0.31 in the April quarter of fiscal 2020.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air emerged from six months of bankruptcy protection on Wednesday with a smaller fleet and its debt almost wiped out but also facing stronger competition and lingering uncertainty wrought by the pandemic.
The airline said on Friday it had raised 6 billion Norwegian crowns ($721 million) in fresh capital, as planned, more than enough to meet the minimum requirement set by bankruptcy courts in Dublin and Oslo.
""We have saved an airline that is of huge value to Norway and which binds our long country together,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram told a news conference.
""We're back!"" read a large banner outside the company's headquarters to mark the occasion, while Schram hoisted a flag with Norwegian Air's red, white and blue logo.
The COVID-19 pandemic threw already heavily indebted Norwegian into a crisis in early 2020, eventually forcing it to terminate large parts of its operations, including its transatlantic network.
The company now has 51 aircraft, down from a pre-pandemic 156, while its debt amounts to between 16 billion and 18 billion Norwegian crowns, down from more than 80 billion, it said.
But adding to competition from old rivals SAS and Wideroe, Hungary's Wizz Air has established several services to Norwegian cities in the last year. 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, has also opened more routes out of the Nordics and a new Norwegian start-up, Flyr, is expected to launch its first domestic flight by mid-year.
""We said that we wanted to get in enough (cash) so that we would be sure that, in a year from now, almost regardless of what happens with COVID-19, we'd still be in a good position,"" Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen said. 
Under the terms of the restructuring, a flexible leasing agreement will limit cash burn.
Norwegian will in the next 10 months only pay leasing costs for the aircraft it actually uses at any given time, so-called 'Power by the Hour' agreements, which provide financial flexibility amid uncertain demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) plans to have about 30% fewer combined clothing and food stores in 10 years time as more sales shift online, but will still open new shops when prime sites - like six former Debenhams outlets - become free, it said on Wednesday.
The British retailer, in the midst of its latest turnaround attempt after decades of failed reinventions, has closed or relocated 59 such ""full line"" stores over the last three years, leaving it with 254.
Its new target is to have a fully modernised core of about 180, in addition to its chain of food-only stores.
CEO Steve Rowe said that would be achieved by ""rotating the estate"" at 110 locations. About 35 full line stores will be relocated, about 45 will become food stores and about 30 sites will be exited over a ten year period, he told reporters after M&S published 2020-21 results.
""The market dynamics have changed and the effect of the pandemic means that we need to move faster,"" Rowe said.
""The good news is that there has rarely been a better time to acquire new space.""
Rowe said M&S has 17 new or extended full line stores in planning, including six former Debenhams sites, in the next two years.
Debenhams collapsed in December, with its last stores closing earlier this month.
To help fund the store estate plans, M&S plans to raise at least 200 million pounds ($283 million) by redeveloping freehold and long leasehold stores, including its flagship Marble Arch store in central London. 
""We're committed to stores and believe they could be a true source of competitive advantage, but they do need to be the right stores in the right location with the right services and they have to work with online,"" added Rowe.

German towns and cities had parked around 500 million euros ($611.40 million) of their savings with Greensill Bank, which collapsed earlier this year as part of financier Lex Greensill's insolvent Greensill Capital.
Greensill Bank, based in Bremen, became an attractive draw for municipalities such as Nordenham because it did not charge fees on deposits, which became increasingly uncommon as a result of European Central Bank (ECB) policies to spur the economy.
In the wake of the bank's collapse, a number of the affected towns have banded together as they seek to recoup some of their funds, which were not protected by a German deposit guarantee programme.
The Nordenham mayor, Carsten Seyfarth, said in a statement his decision not to run in September was due to the Greensill fiasco and the shadow it would cast over the election.
""Even if I am not aware of any personal or legal misconduct, it is ultimately a matter of assuming political responsibility, which now lies with the mayor as head of the city administration,"" he said.
Nordenham, just north of Bremen, had placed 13.5 million euros with the bank, nearly all of its short-term time deposits.

Read More: London Bankers Face Location Limbo as ECB Targets Brexit Moves
Almost five years after the U.K. voted to leave the EU, banks and regulators are still grappling with the practical implications amid uncertainty over what the long-term arrangements regarding financial services will look like. The ECB is seeking to rein in the practice of “back-to-back booking” where banks serve clients in Europe while holding capital and management in the U.K, on the grounds that it makes risks harder to police.
The review is a part of efforts to achieve comparability of current practices at the banks it supervises and ensure banks meet common benchmarks, one of the people said. The review has yet to conclude, making it difficult to determine which banks are furthest from meeting the ECB’s expectations.
An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment on the review.
Since the 2016 referendum, hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and thousands of jobs have shifted to cities such as Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. While that hasn’t yet threatened London’s status as a global financial center, the EU has made clear it expects further changes in the coming years.

Banks throughout the Brexit process have often been conservative in taking action, hoping to keep their options open in case a deal is struck offering more access between London and the EU.
The restrictions in movement brought about by the pandemic have thrown up additional obstacles to implementation, initially leading to a degree of leniency at the supervisor. The ECB has since said that lenders rolling out their Brexit plans won’t be allowed to use the ongoing pandemic as an excuse to delay relocating staff.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 08:02AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China bars banks from selling commodities-linked products to retail buyers - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking regulator has asked lenders to stop selling investment products linked to commodities futures to mom-and-pop buyers, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, to curb investment losses amid volatile commodity prices.
It has also asked lenders to completely unwind their existing books for these products, which they manufacture and sell to individual investors, said the sources, who are involved in and have been briefed on the decision.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission's (CBIRC's) order to exit these products has not been reported before. It issued the order this year, two of the sources said.
""The risk contained in banks' commodity-linked investments cannot be easily spotted by ordinary investors, neither can they bear it,"" one of the sources said. ""Banks also don't have enough expertise to run such products properly."" 
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the directive is not yet public. The CBIRC, China's top banking watchdog, did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking comments.
The move comes as runaway commodity prices in both onshore and offshore markets have raised regulatory concerns about the risks of speculative bets, prompting China's state planner and exchanges in recent weeks to take price-control measures https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-commodities-idUSKCN2D60A2. 
The CBIRC wants to prevent losses like that incurred a year ago by Bank of China (BoC) on crude-oil linked investment products, the people added.
It has asked lenders, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), to report ""clean-up progress"" on commodities-linked investment products on a monthly basis to regulators, two of the sources said.
The CBIRC has, however, not given a specific deadline to the banks for completely exiting their positions, they added.
The ICBC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
While the total size of such products in the Chinese banking system is unknown, BoC's $1.8 billion losses tied to just U.S. crude futures highlights the attractiveness of similar products for retail investors looking for higher returns. 
FULL SECTOR CLEAN UP
Regulators are worried mom-and-pop investors may get burnt again by the recent big swings in commodity prices, driven by post-pandemic demand recovery, liquidity easing and speculative trading. Government watchdogs have urged Chinese industrial metal firms to maintain market order.
BoC's losses last year had wiped out several thousands of such small accounts held by retail investors, ranging from college students to retired workers, prompting the CBIRC at the time to ask commercial banks to halt new sales of a wide range of investment products linked to commodity futures.
Given the recent price volatility, the ban on new sales has been widened to a full sector clean-up, covering products linked to commodities not specifically targeted before, such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, natural gas and soy beans, the three sources said.
Prices of most of these commodities have spiked in recent months, while futures prices for iron ore and corn on the Dalian Commodity Exchange as well as steel and copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have all hit record highs this year.
Some banks are considering ways to shift part of their existing commodity-linked investments and clients to affiliated brokerages, but that will need a nod from the securities regulator, one of the sources said.
While banks' derivative-like products have flaws in design and risk control, analysts say a harsh sector-wide clean-up means a major setback in China's plans to open up the market.

Despite repeated vows to ramp up financial derivatives, Shanghai Futures Exchange has already halted collaboration with banks on the launch of new derivative products in the wake of BoC's losses, two separate sources told Reuters.

Investing -- Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) shares were up over 10% in Wednesday’s premarket as two brokerages reiterated their ‘buy’ on the stock, spurred by the company raising its outlook while announcing third quarter earnings a day earlier.
It’s been a good period for cybersecurity solutions providers like Zscaler and Palo Alto as more people work from home, throwing up higher demand from both companies and individuals for their products as they seek more safety and security for their IT systems.
Wedbush has a target of $240 for the stock while Canaccord Genuity sees it at $250. The targets are almost 39% and 43% higher from the stock’s closing level on Tuesday.
Zscaler’s announcement it will acquire Smokescreen Technologies, an attempt to go for higher-margin business from clients by offering cybersecurity solutions against sophisticated, highly targeted attacks and ransomware was also adding to the positive sentiment for the stock.
The company expects total revenue of $660 million-$664 million in fiscal 2021. It sees non-GAAP income from operations between $71 million and $72 million.
While disclosing its second quarter numbers in February, the company had forecast its annual revenues to come between $634 million and $638 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was then seen in the range of $59 million- $61 million.
Zscaler grew its third quarter revenues 60% year-on-year to $176.4 million. It more than doubled its non-GAAP net income to $21.4 million from $10.3 million a year ago. Both were higher than the company’s own estimates given in February for the third quarter.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, continuing the recent rally, after it stalled during the previous session, ahead of more retail earnings.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 80 points, or 0.2%, lower on Wall Street Tuesday, the S&P 500 dropped 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was largely unchanged.
This setback followed strong recent gains amid optimism over the economic rebound as the country reopens and with the U.S. set to reach a 50% vaccination rate for adults.
This improving sentiment is pushing investors into corners of the market like airlines, cruise operators and other leisure-related stocks.
Elsewhere, the retail sector is likely to be in focus Wednesday, with the likes of Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) set to report quarterly earnings. 
Additionally, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock fell over 5% premarket after the company missed first-quarter earnings expectations after the close Tuesday, while Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock jumped over 9% following better-than-expected quarterly results. 
There are also a number of tech companies reporting results, including Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The data slate is largely empty Wednesday, but investors will keep close attention on a speech from Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles on Wednesday as concerns surrounding inflation and potential tapering continue.
Crude oil prices edged lower Wednesday, despite strong U.S. crude supply data, as traders digest the possible return of Iranian exports.
By 6:30 AM ET, crude was down 0.2% at $65.93 a barrel, while Brent was down 0.1% at $68.44,
Tuesday’s U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 439,000 barrels for the week ending May 21, suggesting an improvement in demand after the 620,000-barrel build recorded during the week before.
This puts the focus on the official crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, where a draw of over 1 million barrels is expected. 
However, all eyes are on the talks between Iran and world powers over the potential resumption of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Should the deal be revived, and the U.S. lift sanctions that are currently in place, Iran could add around one to two million barrels per day to the global crude supply.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,907.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2237.

Sony said in a statement it would accelerate investments in mobile and online services with the aim of expanding the number of consumers directly connected to its services to 1 billion people from 160 million.
As it streamlines its consumer electronic business, Sony is focusing more on movies, games and other content it sells through platforms such as its PlayStation games console. 

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its PlayStation 5 launched in core markets in November. A global shortage of chips, however, means Sony is unable to keep up with demand for the games console, which it wants to use to encourage online game downloads and sign-ups for subscription services.
In the business year that started April 1, Sony aims to ship 14.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The United States on Tuesday downgraded Mexico's aviation safety rating, an action that bars Mexican carriers from adding new U.S. flights and limits the ability of airlines to carry out marketing agreements with one another.
Over the objections of the Mexican government, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration announced the downgrade and said it would increase scrutiny of Mexican airline flights to the United States. 
The U.S. air regulator added it is ""fully committed to helping the Mexican aviation authority improve its safety oversight system to a level that meets"" international standards. The agency also said it is ""ready to provide expertise and resources"" to resolve issues raised in the safety assessment process. 
The FAA downgraded Mexico - the most common international destination for U.S. air travelers last month - from a level called Category 1, which signifies compliance with international standards, to Category 2, the lowest level.
Mexico's government said on Tuesday it is determined to recover a Category 1 air safety rating quickly.
""I think it will be a relatively quick and easy process,"" deputy transport minister Carlos Moran told Reuters. ""I hope it is less than three months.""
The Category 2 rating, according to the FAA, means Mexico lacks ""necessary requirements to oversee the country's air carriers in accordance with minimum international safety standards, or the civil aviation authority is lacking in one or more areas such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record keeping, inspection procedures or resolution of safety concerns.""
Shares in Mexican airline Aeromexico fell nearly 10% on Tuesday afternoon after the downgrade. Shares of Mexican airport operators ASUR (MX:ASURB), GAP and OMA also declined.
Mexico's air transportation industry group Canaero said the downgrade will ""severely affect"" the sector's recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade with the United States but it does not expect the action to impact existing operations of Mexican airlines.
Moran, in the interview with Reuters, ruled out government support for struggling airlines.
A similar FAA downgrade of Mexico in 2010 over suspected shortcomings within its civil aviation authority lasted about four months. Only a few countries are currently rated Category 2 by the FAA, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand and Malaysia.
Reuters first reported plans for the FAA downgrade on Friday and that the downgrade had been finalized Tuesday.
MEXICO FOUGHT DOWNGRADE
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday had urged U.S. authorities not to downgrade Mexico, arguing his country was complying with all relevant norms. Mexican officials held a previously unreported call Saturday with FAA officials to unsuccessfully argue against the downgrade, sources told Reuters.
The FAA review that began in October and went through February found about two dozen noncompliance issues and Mexico had only resolved four, officials said.
Mexico has been a top vacation spot for U.S. travelers during the pandemic, spurring U.S. airlines to redirect capacity they had previously flown to Europe before transatlantic travel restrictions were imposed last year. Nearly 2.3 million passengers traveled on U.S.-Mexico flights in April - more than three times the next most-popular country destination.
The downgrade means U.S. airlines will no longer be able to market and sell tickets with their names and designator codes on Mexican-operated flights.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said on Tuesday an FAA downgrade was not about its partner Aeromexico and that the action will have little impact on customers.
Delta said it will need to reissue reservations for some Aeromexico operated flights that were booked through Delta.
Unlike Aeromexico, Delta will be able to continue increasing routes and frequencies as demand recovers, said Rene Armas Maes, commercial VP and associate at Midas Aviation.

""U.S. carriers win big time,"" said Armas Maes.
It is yet to be seen if Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and the holders of Aeromexico's $400 million 7% bond due 2025 will seek any changes to the terms of the $1 billion debtor in possession loan they granted to the airline, said Armas Maes.

Britain has so far stuck with strict travel restrictions for most destinations abroad damaging the airline and travel industries, which face a new threat from worries about the spread in the United Kingdom of the novel coronavirus variant first found in India. 
Germany has banned most travellers from the country because of the variant and France has hinted it could follow suit. 
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said the industry's survival could be at risk if it had to endure a second summer of restricted travel. 
""I don't think that UK aviation as an industry can go through another lost summer without grave consequences,"" he told an online industry event on Wednesday. 
But for him, the Indian variant is not the concern. He said that evidence so far showed that vaccines are effective against it. 
""I don't think that the outlook...is that because of the Indian variant the summer is ruined,"" he said.
Lundgren's bigger worry is that Britain sticks to its strict travel rules which mean Portugal is the only major holiday destination open to Britons. 
British tourists had hoped to return to southern European beaches this summer, but rules for all other destinations mean they must take multiple COVID-19 tests and quarantine on their return, despite countries like Spain opening to them.

""The government needs to be ready and prepared to step up to protect this industry and it has to do so because it is its restrictions that have made it impossible to operate for the players in this industry,"" Lundgren said.
It was unlikely that the coming summer would be another lost season, said Lungren, but he urged Britain to put more countries on its green travel list at the next review on June 7.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s efforts to improve the diversity of its workforce and senior management have not proceeded as quickly as Chief Executive James Gorman would have liked, he said in prepared testimony posted on Tuesday.
Wall Street bank chiefs are expected to face tough questions in U.S. Congress on hot-button social and economic issues when they appear before House and Senate committees on Wednesday.
Ahead of the hearing, Morgan Stanley was asked to assess its successes and failures recruiting a diverse workforce generally and at the senior executive level specifically.
""I acknowledge that progress in this area has been slow for us and we can and should do better,"" Gorman said. ""The events of 2020 focused all of us in a way we had not been before and this was the ultimate call to action to make meaningful change."" 
Morgan Stanley faced criticism from some advocacy groups last week following a reshuffle of senior management which positioned four white men as potential successors to Gorman, who has run the bank since 2010.
Achieving greater diversity remains a key priority for Morgan Stanley, Gorman said.
""Every senior manager is required to have a succession plan for his or her senior team members, and part of that plan must include developing a diverse candidate pipeline,"" he said. 
Other Wall Street banks also used their prepared testimony to detail efforts to increase the diversity of their workforce and provide more services to minority communities.

The banking industry cannot ignore the role it played in the past in contributing to ""systemic inequities,"" said  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) chief Jane Fraser. 
The Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees will hear from the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley on Wednesday and Thursday.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>",WhatsApp sues Indian government over new privacy rules - sources,"By Joseph Menn
(Reuters) - WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit in Delhi against the Indian government seeking to block regulations coming into force on Wednesday that experts say would compel Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s messaging app to break privacy protections, sources said.
The case asks the Delhi High Court to declare that one of the new IT rules is a violation of privacy rights in India's constitution since it requires social media companies to identify the ""first originator of information"" when authorities demand it, people familiar with the lawsuit told Reuters.
The WhatsApp lawsuit escalates a growing struggle between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and tech giants including Facebook, Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter in one of their key global growth markets. 
Tensions rose after police visited Twitter's offices this week. The micro-blogging service had labelled posts by a spokesman for India's dominant party and others as containing ""manipulated media"", saying forged content was included. (https://reut.rs/3ccSQ7J)
New Delhi has also pressed tech companies to remove what it has described as misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging India, and some criticism of the government's response to the crisis, which is claiming thousands of lives daily.
While the new law only requires WhatsApp, which has half a billion users in India, to unmask people credibly accused of wrongdoing, it says it cannot in practice do that alone. 
WhatsApp says that because messages are encrypted end-to-end it would have to break encryption for receivers of messages as well as the originators to comply with the new law.
""Requiring messaging apps to 'trace' chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people's right to privacy,"" WhatsApp said in a statement when asked to comment on the lawsuit.
The sources familiar with the lawsuit declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
FIND A WAY
A government official said WhatsApp could find a way to track originators of disinformation, a long-standing stance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, and that the U.S. company was not being asked to break encryption.
WhatsApp said it would continue to engage with the government. Its Indian operations were continuing to operate as normal on Wednesday. 
India's technology ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit also comes at time many Indians have begun using rival messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram after WhatsApp introduced a new privacy policy earlier this year which allows it to share some data with Facebook and other group firms.
While Signal and Telegram downloads have surged in India, neither app commands as massive a user base as WhatsApp. They have yet to comment on India's demand for traceability.
The response of the companies to the new rules has been a subject of intense speculation since they were unveiled in February, 90 days before they were due to come into force. (https://reut.rs/34m9Bc9)
India's new Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code designates ""significant social media intermediaries"" as standing to lose protection from lawsuits and criminal prosecution if they fail to adhere to the code.
WhatsApp, its parent Facebook and tech rivals have all invested heavily in India. But company officials worry privately that increasingly heavy-handed regulation by the Modi government could jeopardise their prospects. 
Among the new rules are requirements that big social media firms appoint Indian citizens to key compliance roles, remove content within 36 hours of a legal order, and set up a mechanism to respond to complaints. They must also use automated processes to take down pornography.
COURT CHALLENGES
Facebook has said it agrees with most of the provisions but is still looking to negotiate some aspects. Twitter, which has come under the most fire for failing to take down posts by government critics, declined to comment. 
Some in the industry are hoping for a delay in the introduction of the new rules while such objections are heard.
The WhatsApp complaint cites a 2017 Indian Supreme Court ruling supporting privacy in a case known as the Puttaswamy judgment, the people familiar with it said.
The court found that privacy must be preserved except in cases where legality, necessity and proportionality all weighed against it. WhatsApp argues that the new law fails all those tests, starting with the lack of explicit parliamentary backing.
Experts have backed WhatsApp's arguments.
""The new traceability and filtering requirements may put an end to end-to-end encryption in India,"" Stanford Internet Observatory scholar Riana Pfefferkorn wrote in March. (https://brook.gs/3um1PJY)

Other court challenges to the new rules are already pending in Delhi and elsewhere.
In one, reporters argue that the extension of technology regulations to digital publishers, including the imposition of decency and taste standards, is not supported by the underlying law. (https://

CHENNAI (Reuters) -Eicher Motors Ltd-owned Royal Enfield will shut its three south Indian manufacturing plants for three days to ensure safety amid rising COVID-19 cases, according to an internal note seen by Reuters and two sources.
Royal Enfield - an famous brand in India, the world's biggest motorbike market, will shut its three manufacturing plants from May 27 to May 29, the internal note to workers said.
""We will resume operation from Monday, 31st May,"" the internal note to workers signed by Royal Enfield Chief Operating Officer B Govindarajan said.
""The above days shall be compensated later as per market needs,"" Govindarajan said in the note.
Royal Enfield did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

Tamil Nadu is one of the worst hit states with more than 30,000 cases a day last week. The state, an auto hub known as India's Detroit, has imposed a lockdown but has allowed some factories, including auto plants, to continue operating.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Automaker VinFast has added JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to a team advising it on a planned U.S. listing, a group executive said, but sources said Vietnam's likely first U.S. listing faces a delay due to uncertainty over regulations.
""VinFast is working with advisers including JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank in the syndicate for the U.S. listing,"" Le Thi Thu Thuy, vice chairwoman of VinFast's parent Vingroup JSC, told Reuters.
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
VinFast had flagged in April it would consider a U.S IPO or merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). 
Reuters reported earlier in the month that VinFast was eyeing a valuation of about $60 billion and had appointed  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to lead the potential transaction. Sources have said VinFast's IPO could raise at least $2 billion, and one source had said a deal was slated for the second quarter.
VinFast's preferred scenario is to merge with a SPAC for a U.S. listing, said two sources who had direct knowledge of the matter.
However, they said the talks with the SPACs haven't made much headway in terms of coming up with deal proposals or a specific timeline for a listing.
This was due to uncertainty surrounding SPAC regulations in the United States, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the information has not yet been made public.
A time table on a transaction has not been set and the company's plans could change, they added.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up scrutiny of SPACs, which have been hugely popular over the past year. An official said in April the agency is reviewing filings and seeking clearer SPAC disclosures, and detailed concerns around fees, conflicts and sponsor compensation. 
When asked about any delay in the listing plan, Thuy, who was formerly chairwoman of VinFast, said the company was still carrying out procedures needed for the U.S. listing and would make an announcement later.

JPMorgan was appointed because of its work on U.S. SPAC deals over the past year, one of the sources said.
Deutsche Bank has worked closely with Vingroup, Vietnam's largest conglomerate, in the past and was a lead arranger and book runner on a $525 million syndicated loan for VinFast in January last year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning as U.S. economic data disappointed amid concerns over inflation and jobs. U.S. Federal Reserve officials also insisted any inflation would be temporary but indicated that asset tapering could begin soon.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.31% by 11:32 PM ET (3:32 AM GMT). Bank of Japan board member Hitoshi Suzuki said earlier in the day that the central bank should restrain its purchase of exchange-traded funds (ETF) during calm periods in the market to prevent its holdings from increasing as much as possible.

Treasury yields fell below the peaks they reached in 2021 as more U.S. Federal Reserve officials insisted that price pressures would be transitory.

""It may well be... there will come a time in upcoming meetings we will be at the point where we can begin to discuss scaling back the pace of asset purchases… that was not the focus of the April meeting. It is going to depend on the flow of data,"" said Clarida.
He added that economic growth will continue as the Fed will be able to curb runaway inflation with tough talk and modest rate hikes.
“What we keep hearing from the Fed is that they’re going to take a very different approach to inflation this time around,” Kristina Hooper, Invesco chief global market strategist, told Bloomberg.
“The Fed is likely to let the punchbowl stay out a lot longer. The big fear about inflation is that the Fed would act.”

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks look set to hold around or inch just above current record levels as the initial boost stemming from the region's V-shaped recovery after the COVID-19 downturn loses momentum, a Reuters poll found.
The Reuters poll of 16 fund managers, strategists and brokers surveyed over the past two weeks predicted the STOXX 600 would reach 451 points by year end, just 1.3% above Monday's close. 
Supported by massive stimulus and vaccination campaigns, the pan-European index has already risen 11.5% this year, as investors rushed to price in the region's catch-up potential. 
European corporates are still set for more quarters of double-digit profit growth, as economies reopen and Brussels pumps more support through its huge post-pandemic recovery fund.
That should shield European equities from possible pull-backs even as investors start to ponder risks that inflation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy conditions, especially in the United States.
""The positive tailwinds should continue with activities normalizing and economies growing again,"" said Tomas Hildebrandt, portfolio manager at Evli Bank in Helsinki, stressing the importance of the EU recovery fund.
""Its success is definitely crucial, as well as keeping new Covid variants and infections at bay. Nevertheless, the current positive drivers will fade with time,"" he added.
With most of the results accounted for, European profits are expected to have surged a whopping 93% in the first quarter, according to the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data which point to a similar performance in the second quarter.

Euro zone business growth accelerated in May at its fastest pace in over three years with the IHS Markit flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a gauge of economic health, climbing to 56.9, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. 
A deal to open up tourism across the European Union this summer should also provide a boost to tourism-dependent economies that were hammered by restrictions last year.
""The key is seeing reopening progress across Europe combined with global COVID-19 improvement,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. 
But for analysts such as Marco Vailati, head of research and investments at Cassa Lombarda in Milan, the momentum is fading and the economic environment is probably as good as it gets.
""As the year progresses, it will be increasingly difficult for the macro trend to surprise positively with the same intensity,"" said Vailati, who sees the STOXX retreating slightly to 430 points by year end. 
European stocks have so far this year outperformed the MSCI's global stock index, which is up approaching 10% year to date. 
Among the factors backing European indexes is the fact they are cheaper than their global peers and are heavy in banks and other cyclical stocks which benefit when the economy looks up.
They are also light on tech and growth stocks for which investors are reluctant to pay hefty premiums amid buoyant economic activity and rising interest rates.
According to the poll, the UK's top FTSE 100 share index is expected to reach 7,250 points at the end of the year against Monday's close of 7,051.59.
France's CAC 40 is expected to rise to 6,500 points from its current 6,410 points level, while Italy's FTSE MIB and Spain's IBEX are seen making slightly higher gains of over 3% before the end of the year. 

Germany's industrials-heavy DAX index should gain about 1.7% to 15,700 points.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Westpac Banking Group on Tuesday reopened Australia's big banks bond-market taps for the first time in more than a year, with a $2.75 billion deal that also marked their first use of a non-USD Libor benchmark rate to price the debt.
Investors gobbled up Westpac's first issue of senior bonds since January last year, allowing the country's second-largest lender to pay only 60 basis points over Treasuries for $1 billion in 10-year debt, a 25% discount to the 80 points it paid last year.
A $300 million floating-rate bond tranche maturing in five years was priced at a 52 basis point spread over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) - the first time any of the ""Big Four"" Australian lenders had used the Libor replacement for their deals.
Australia's big banks are bursting with cash and had abandoned onshore and offshore senior markets since the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) introduced the Term Funding Facility (TFF) in March 2020, costing only 0.10%, to ensure access to liquidity at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""There's been a long hiatus since we've seen the major banks access term funding markets given their access to the central banks' TFF and the substantial uplift in deposits,"" said Allan O'Sullivan, Westpac's head of debt capital markets syndication.
""It's positive that investors are seeing a transaction from them on their screens again.""
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), RBC Capital Markets and Westpac managed the issue, which was priced in New York hours on Tuesday afternoon and also included $1.45 billion 5-year bonds paying 40 basis points over Treasuries, according to the managers. 
""A super-strong outcome by Westpac,"" said Ian Campbell, Citigroup head of debt capital markets in Australia and New Zealand. ""The trades shine even brighter given the all-time tight spreads."" 
The bond had ""really encouraging support from global USD investors, many of whom had not had a chance to buy senior unsecured AA rated opco paper for over 14 months from the major Australian bank sector,"" he added.
Australia's major banks have not yet deployed the massive A$200 billion ($155.2 billion) funding facility in full but it expires in June and repayments start in 2023.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, the nation's third-largest lender, is also expected to issue senior unsecured bonds in coming weeks. 
Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) is being replaced with rates compiled by central banks after lenders were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig the reference rate for their own gain in 2012. 
SOFR is published by the New York Federal Reserve to use as a reference point for U.S. dollar derivative and debt transactions.
Britain's financial regulators in March called a formal halt to nearly all Libor rates from the end of this year, piling pressure on markets to quicken a switch in interest rates used in $260 trillion of contracts globally.

In late 2019, Westpac's largest peer Commonwealth Bank issued the country's first public deal that did not use the local LIBOR-equivalent benchmark, the bank bill swap (BBSW) rate. [https://reut.rs/2Tbo2gF]

1331,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 09:46PM ET</span>","Canada's TSX seen topping 20,000 on higher commodity prices: Reuters poll","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index is forecast to climb above the 20,000 threshold for the first time by the end of this year as a recovery in the global economy from the coronavirus crisis boosts the outlook for resource stocks, a Reuters poll found. 
The median prediction of 26 portfolio managers and strategists was for the S&P/TSX Composite index to rise to 20,050 by the end of 2021, up 2.7% from May 21's close and above February's forecast of 19,650. It was then expected to advance to 21,750 by the end of 2022. 
""The cyclical upturn in the global economy will support commodity prices and translate into a strong earnings outlook for the TSX,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategy analyst at Edward Jones.
In April, the IMF projected the global economy would expand 6% this year, helped by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
""The reopening is still ahead, further employment gains are expected as the labor market slack is gradually eliminated, and the outlook for personal consumption is strong,"" Kourkafas said.
The TSX has climbed 12% since the start of 2021, outpacing Wall Street. On Friday, it touched an intraday record high of 19,614.78.
Materials and energy shares account for 25% of the Toronto market's capitalization, compared with 5% for the S&P 500.
The heavier weighting in resource shares could help the TSX outperform U.S. markets over the next year, said Steve Palmer, chief investment officer at AlphaNorth Asset Management.
""Many resource commodities are in strong uptrends,"" Palmer said.
Copper prices climbed this month to record high levels, while the price of oil has nearly doubled since November to $64 a barrel. 
Most investors that responded to some additional questions expected corporate earnings to rise over the rest of the year. Still, a slight majority said a market correction of more than 10% over the coming three months was likely or very likely.
""The pricing of the global economic recovery has been front-loaded,"" said Dominique Lapointe, a senior economist at Laurentian Bank Securities.
The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus by China and tapering of global quantitative easing has the potential to temporarily derail the rally this year in equities, Lapointe said.
Last month, the Bank of Canada became the first major central bank to cut back on pandemic-era money-printing stimulus programs. Some investors expect the Federal Reserve to signal a taper in the coming months if inflation heats up. 
But the makeup of the Toronto market could offer some protection to investors.

""The inflationary fears that are adding to volatility in global markets would not hurt the TSX as much as it would other less cyclical global stock markets,"" said Matt Skipp, president of SW8 Asset Management.

BERKELEY, Calif. (Reuters) -Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it will drop a radar sensor in favour of a camera-focused Autopilot system for its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in North America starting this month.
The move came amid growing scrutiny by regulators and media about the safety of what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dubs ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving (FSD)"" features, following a series of crashes.
""Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America,"" CEO Elon Musk said in a Tweet. 
He said it plans to release an improved ""FSD beta V9.0"" based on the pure vision system about three weeks later.
""FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time,"" he said.
In October, Tesla rolled out the test version of its new FSD system to a limited number of people, enabling cars to navigate on city streets in semi-autonomous mode as well as highways. A wider launch has been delayed. 
While most companies like Waymo equip autonomous cars with cameras paired with sensors like lidars and radars, Tesla relied on cameras and one radar to detect and analyze objects. 
Tesla's approach helped reduce costs and commercialize its driver assistant features, but experts and other companies have raised safety concerns. 
Tesla said the transition to a camera-focused system may result in limitations of some features such as lane-centering and parking assistance, saying those functions will be restored via software updates ""in the weeks ahead.""
All new Model S and Model X cars, as well as all vehicles built for markets outside North America, will still be equipped with a radar, Tesla said. 

A radar sensor uses radio waves and sensors to detect objects.
In March, Tesla told California regulators it might not achieve full self-driving technology by the end of 2021.

Vivendi, controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, is planning to cash in on its crown jewel - the world's biggest music label, which it has valued at 33 billion euros ($40.43 billion) - as streaming revenues fuel growth.
In a transaction involving an Amsterdam listing, Vivendi aims to distribute 60% of Universal's capital in kind to existing shareholders, which will allow Bollore retain a strong grip on the group.
In a letter to Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine, Bluebell Capital Partners, which did not disclose the size of its Vivendi stake, called on Vivendi to add a cash dividend of 3 billion euros to the deal. 
Bluebell, which rose to prominence with a campaign earlier this year to oust the boss of French yoghurt maker Danone, said the distribution-in-kind structure penalised investors, according to the letter seen by Reuters. 
""We view the particular structure proposed to (the annual shareholder meeting) as highly tax inefficient and respectfully question the steps already undertaken which in practice prevent more tax effective solutions,"" partners Marco Taricco and Giuseppe Bivona wrote in the letter, dated May 21. 
They also called for Universal's listing to be shifted to the New York Stock Exchange. 
Vivendi confirmed it received the letter, and a spokesman said the group would have dialogue with shareholders on June 22, at its annual meeting. 

Vivendi said earlier in May it could sell an additional 10% of Universal to an American investor as part of the deal.
Universal, behind singers such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, is currently 20% owned by a consortium led by Chinese giant Tencent. The remaining 80% is owned by Vivendi.

The UAW said it looks forward to starting discussions with GM on the ""joint venture to produce batteries in Ohio and Tennessee so workers will have a voice at the table in order to create good paying union jobs and benefits.”
The UAW wants U.S. automakers to recognize the union at joint-venture battery facilities. The union has said it represents about 48,500 U.S. workers at GM, though the automaker says about 49% of its U.S. workforce, or 46,000 workers, were represented by the UAW, as of the end of 2020.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co last week announced a similar planned battery venture with SK Innovation.
President Joe Biden went to a Ford plant in Michigan last Tuesday and told automakers ""we need you to deepen your partnership with the UAW.""
GM said both the company and the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC. ""respect workers' right to unionize and the efforts of the UAW to organize battery cell manufacturing workers in Ohio and Tennessee at our joint venture sites.""
GM added that it believes the UAW, ""given their historic and constructive relationship in the automotive industry, would be well positioned to represent the workforce.""
In April, GM and LG Chem unit LG Energy Solution said they would build a second U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant, revealing plans for a $2.3 billion factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee. 
LG Chem and the White House did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
The UAW has criticized GM for announcing a $1 billion investment in Mexico to build EVs, and Ford for opting to build some EVs in Mexico rather than in Ohio.
Biden also urged automakers not to build zero-emission vehicles abroad for U.S. consumers.

""We need automakers and other companies to keep investing here in America and not take the benefits of our public investments and expand electric vehicles and battery manufacturing abroad,” Biden said.
The UAW said last week Ford has a ""moral obligation"" to make sure battery plant jobs are good-paying union jobs. The company said that will be determined by the joint venture.

Attorney General Karl Racine said Amazon requires third party sellers to give its customers the same or better prices than they offer elsewhere.
But since Amazon's prices include fees, which can run as high as 40 percent of the total price, Racine said the policy could make prices for the same product more expensive on platforms that compete with Amazon.
The legal action is the latest of multiple state and federal suits filed against the largest tech companies in an effort to limit alleged abuses of their outsized market power. 
Amazon disagreed with the lawsuit, saying its policies were aimed at keeping prices low.
""The DC attorney general has it exactly backwards – sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store. Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
The company's share price dipped on news of the lawsuit but quickly recovered.
The lawsuit, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court, put Amazon's share of the U.S. online retail sales market at between 50% and 70%. 
""Amazon has used its dominant position in the online retail market to win at all costs. It maximizes its profits at the expense of third-party sellers and consumers, while harming competition,"" Racine said in a statement.

The four big tech companies - Amazon.com, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - have spent more than a year under antitrust scrutiny. 
The U.S. Justice Department sued Google late last year alleging violations of antitrust law, as did two groups of states. Facebook was sued by the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states.

Peter Weinzierl and co-defendant Alexander Waldstein, both of Austria, were accused of conspiring from 2006 to 2016 with Odebrecht and others to launder money in a scheme involving the use of slush funds to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to public officials.
Weinzierl is a former chief executive of Meinl Bank, later renamed Anglo Austrian AAB Bank, and a deputy chairman at the House of Julius Meinl, according to Meinl's website.
The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, New York said Weinzierl was arrested in the United Kingdom pursuant to a U.S. request while Waldstein, an officer at Weinzierl's bank, remained at large. Both were also directors at an affiliated bank in Antigua, the office said. 
Lawyers for both defendants could not immediately be located. Meinl did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside U.S. business hours.
Prosecutors said the defendants and their co-conspirators used fraudulent transactions and sham agreements to move more than $170 million from New York bank accounts through their bank, and to offshore accounts secretly controlled by Odebrecht.
According to prosecutors, some suspect payments went to government officials in Brazil, Mexico and Panama, and Odebrecht evaded more than $100 million of Brazilian taxes by improperly deducting fraudulent payments from reported profits.
Both defendants were charged in an indictment unsealed on Tuesday with two money laundering counts and one conspiracy count, while Weinzierl was also charged with a money laundering spending offense.
In December 2016, Odebrecht and its parent  Braskem  SA (NYSE:BAK), Brazil's largest petrochemicals company, pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $3.5 billion to settle bribery-related charges by U.S., Brazilian and Swiss regulators.

Odebrecht changed its name in December to Novonor SA.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be effective in adolescents aged 12-17 and showed no new or major safety problems in a clinical trial, the developer said on Tuesday, potentially setting the stage for a second vaccine for school-aged children to be authorized in July.
Moderna Inc, whose vaccine is authorized for adults 18 and older, said it will submit the findings of its adolescent study to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators for emergency use authorization in early June.
U.S. regulators took about a month to review a similar study from Pfizer/BioNtech, which was authorized for ages 12-15 on May 10. If Moderna gets the same treatment, its authorization would come in early July.
Most children with COVID-19 develop only mild symptoms or no symptoms. Yet children remain at risk of becoming seriously ill, and they can spread the virus. Widely vaccinating 12- to 18-year olds could allow U.S. schools and summer camps to relax masking and social distancing measures suggested by the CDC.
“We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents,"" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said in a statement. 
Moderna's trial evaluated the vaccine in 3,732 adolescents aged 12 to 17, two thirds of whom got the vaccine and one third of whom got a placebo. The main goal was to produce an immune response on par with that seen in the company's large, Phase 3 trial in adults, which was 94.1% effective at preventing COVID-19.
Two weeks after the second dose, researchers found no cases of COVID-19 in the vaccine group compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100%, based on case definitions from the company's adult trial. 
Using a case definition from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which requires only 1 COVID-19 symptom, the vaccine was found to be 93% effective, suggesting the vaccine may be protective against cases with milder symptoms, the company said.
The researchers found no new safety issues. The most common side effects after the second dose were headache, fatigue, body aches and chills.
The company said it is still accumulating safety data. All study participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second dose to determine long-term protection and safety.

Moderna said it plans to submit the data to a peer-reviewed publication. The company is currently testing its vaccine in children as young as 6 months of age.
In addition to the United States,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine is also authorized for use in younger teens aged 12 to 15 in Canada and Algeria.

(Reuters) - Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) soared 16.3% on Tuesday after hitting their highest level since late March, and other so-called ""meme"" stocks also rallied as investors shifted back into the retail favorites that had notched big gains earlier in the year.
The video game retailer’s shares finished at $209.43, marking their first close above $200 since March 19. Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings ended up about 20% while Koss Corp gained 22.9%.
""Once it goes over $200 the buzz starts,"" said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure and proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. You can “100% peg it to social media."" 
GameStop’s shares and those of other stocks popular on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets have climbed in recent weeks, a move that has come amid a broad sell-off in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, another investment popular among individual investors. 
GameStop closed 46.5% above its lowest close so far for May, while Bitcoin is down about 35% so far this month and rival cryptocurrency ether is about 42% below its record, reached on May 12 in a sell-off that has come amid increasing scrutiny from regulators in the United States and China.
Denizens of WallStreetBets and some Twitter users also speculated that the recent moves in GameStop and AMC may be forcing bearish investors to unwind their bets, an event known as a short squeeze. 
Roughly 26% of GameStop's float or 14.76 million shares were on loan as of May 24, according to Astec Analytics. More than 14 million shares in the company changed hands on Tuesday, marking its busiest trading day since mid-April.
Some 129 million shares of AMC Entertainment, or 28.8% of its float, were on loan on May 24, Astec data showed. 

A short squeeze helped send shares of GameStop on a 1600% run in January, though the stock pared much of those gains the following month.
Users on Twitter, meanwhile, exhorted one another to hold or buy more shares of AMC, many under the hashtag #notapenny, which notched more than 17,000 posts by 4pm ET.

Shares in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were sharply higher on Tuesday after top executives said that the pace of a leisure travel recovery was increasing.
""We've been very, very pleased with the pace of demand recovery,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein told an industry conference. ""Bookings have been better than expected.""
As more Americans pass through airports, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plans to hire another 1,000 officers by July 4, a peak U.S. travel period, after hiring 3,000 officers since Jan 1.
""We have already seen a sharp rise at the nation's airports and will continue to experience steady increases throughout the summer,"" Acting TSA Administrator Darby LaJoye told a news conference at Reagan National Airport outside Washington. 
The TSA screened 1.86 million passengers on Sunday, the highest daily total since March 2020.
United said it now expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be positive in the third quarter and trimmed its forecast for a decline in unit revenue in the current quarter.
And American is seeing ""encouraging signs"" in business and international travel, which have been hit hard during the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said. 
The improvements come as more American become vaccinated, companies prepare for workers to return to offices and travel, and as more countries open their borders. 
However, the United States continues to bar the entry of nearly all non-U.S. citizens from most of Europe, South Africa, India, China, Iran and Brazil, despite pressure from travel groups to lift restrictions.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at the press conference the government is ""following the facts, the data, the science in making the decision as to when business, international travel actually can resume... This is something we are evaluating each and every day.""
The administration has held extensive meetings on the topic, officials have told Reuters, but made no decisions.

Industry officials think Biden could lift restriction on the United Kingdom and Ireland as soon as early June. COVID-19 cases in both countries have declined.
Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, told Reuters ""the UK is the furthest along. Our belief is, if we can open UK, the rest follows.""

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed slightly lower on Tuesday, and each of Wall Street's main indexes failed to stray far from the unchanged mark following a rally in the prior session as investors continue to try and assess the route of inflation.
Yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell for a fourth straight day, with the benchmark 10-year yield hitting a fresh two-week low of 1.557% and helping to dampen inflation worries. The yield had climbed to as much as 1.776% at the end of March.
Federal Reserve officials continue to downplay rising price pressures, and Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said the central bank can take steps to cool a jump in inflation, if it occurs, without derailing the economic rebound coming out of the coronavirus pandemic.
While most market participants expect prices to increase as the economy recovers, concerns about the speed and trajectory of the rise persist. 
""Maybe the bond market is not all that far out of balance,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who says the bond market doesn't seem that concerned about inflation at the moment.
""It's a combination that maybe the Fed is correct but also that the Fed for the first time showed they are beginning to talk about tapering (of bond purchases), which is also a comforting sign that there is still a heartbeat of inflation fighting in the Federal Reserve."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 81.52 points, or 0.24%, to 34,312.46, the S&P 500 lost 8.92 points, or 0.21%, to 4,188.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.00 points, or 0.03%, to 13,657.17.
Energy, down 2.04%, was the weakest sector on the day with  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) off 2.26% as the biggest weight on the S&P 500, after sources said BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has backed several candidates of hedge fund Engine No. 1 to join the energy giant's board.
Real estate, up 0.31% was a bright spot, benefiting from the pause in yields. Data on Tuesday showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped in April as prices surged amid a tight supply of houses, while a separate report showed U.S. consumer confidence was little changed and near last month's number that was the highest reading since February 2020.
The S&P 500 sits about 1% from its May 7 all-time high as the focus turns to the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, to be released on Thursday. A much stronger than expected reading on consumer prices two weeks ago re-ignited inflation fears and stoked market volatility.
Airline stocks, part of the ""reopening"" trade, rose after United Airlines and  Hawaiian Holdings  (NASDAQ:HA) issued upbeat air traffic and ticket sale estimates that sent their shares up 1.50% and 3.59%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) gained 1.39% after aircraft leasing business SMBC Aviation Capital agreed to buy 14 more 737 MAX jets.
Lordstown Motors Corp slumped 7.45% after the electric vehicle startup said that 2021 production of its Endurance truck would be half of prior expectations and it needs additional capital to execute its plans.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 07:11PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Biden looks abroad for electric vehicle metals, in blow to U.S. miners","By Ernest Scheyder and Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will rely on ally countries to supply the bulk of the metals needed to build electric vehicles and focus on processing them domestically into battery parts, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists, two administration officials with direct knowledge told Reuters.
The plans will be a blow to U.S. miners who had hoped Biden would rely primarily on domestically sourced metals, as his campaign had signalled last autumn, to help fulfill his ambitions for a less carbon-intensive economy.
Rather than focus on permitting more U.S. mines, Biden's team is more focused on creating jobs that process minerals domestically into electric vehicle (EV) battery parts, according to the people.
Such a plan would help cut U.S. reliance on industry leader China for EV materials while also enticing unions with manufacturing work and, in theory, reduce pandemic-fueled unemployment.
The U.S. Commerce Department is organizing a June conference to attract more EV manufacturing to the country. Biden's proposed $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan earmarks $174 billion to boost the domestic EV market with tax credits and grants for battery manufacturers, among other incentives. The department declined to comment. 
""It's not that hard to dig a hole,"" said one of the sources. ""What's hard is getting that stuff out and getting it to processing facilities. That's what the U.S. government is focused on."" 
Under the approach, the United States would rely on Canada, Australia and Brazil - among others - to produce most of the critical raw materials needed, while it competes for higher-value jobs turning those minerals into computer chips and batteries, according to the two sources.
Securing the full supply chain from metals to batteries does not require the United States to be the primary producer of the raw materials, said one of the sources.
A full strategy will be finalized after a year-long supply chain review involving national security and economic development officials.
Biden officials want to ensure the administration's EV aspirations are not imperilled as domestic mines face road blocks, the sources said, both from environmentalists and even some Democrats.
""It rings hollow when I hear everyone use this as a national defense argument, that we have to build new mines to have a greener economy,"" said U.S. Representative Betty McCollum, a Democrat who has introduced legislation that would permanently block  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's proposed Twin Metals copper mine in Minnesota.
""President Biden is focused on seizing the electric vehicle (EV) market, sourcing and manufacturing the supply chain here in America, and creating good-paying, union jobs,"" said Ali Zaidi, the deputy White House national climate adviser.
""Building American-made EVs and shipping them around the world will include leveraging American-made parts and resources. This includes responsibly pursuing, developing, and mining critical minerals and materials used for EV batteries.""
Zaidi also said that the administration is invested in a strategy that includes recycling in the supply chain.
While U.S. projects from small and large miners alike will feel the impact, the pain from any blocked projects will fall disproportionately on smaller, U.S.-focused companies. Many large miners also have global projects that could benefit from the administration's plan.
""We can no longer push the production of the products we want to places we cannot see and to people we will never meet,"" said Mckinsey Lyon of Perpetua Resources Corp, which is trying to develop Idaho's Stibnite mine to produce gold and antimony used to make EV battery alloys.
INVESTMENTS The U.S. government in April became the largest shareholder in mining investment firm TechMet, which controls a Brazilian nickel project, a Rwandan tungsten mine and is a major investor in a Canadian battery recycler. Washington also funds research into Canadian cobalt projects and rare earths projects in Malawi, among other international investments. The State Department's Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) is one of the main programs Washington plans to use to help allies discover and develop lithium, cobalt and other EV metals. To be sure, Washington is not ignoring domestic mining.
The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded grants to help old coal mines find ways to produce rare earths. U.S. officials have also funded MP Materials Corp, which owns the country's only rare earths mine, though it relies on Chinese processors. But the bulk of Biden's approach is designed to sidestep battles with environmentalists and save capital for other fights, according to one administration source. During a visit to a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plant in Michigan on May 18, Biden called for government grants for new EV battery facilities. He mentioned Australia's lithium reserves during the tour, but not large U.S. supplies of the key battery mineral.

Republicans say Biden's EV plans will be impossible to achieve without more U.S. mines. 
""These 'not-in-my-backyard' extremists have made clear they want to lock up our land and prevent the mining of minerals,"" U.S. Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, told a House Natural Resources Committee forum held the same day as Biden's Michigan visit. PLACATING LABOR Biden's approach comes with risks, including angering political supporters within the labor movement who want the administration to have an openness to resource extraction and the attendant jobs. ""Let's let Americans extract these minerals from the earth,"" said Aaron Butler of United Association Local 469 union, which does work for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd's proposed Resolution copper mine project in Arizona and endorsed Biden in the elections. ""These are good-paying jobs."" Many of the skills that labor unions would use to build mines, including concrete and electrical work, can also be used to build EV metal processing plants. The National Mining Association, an industry trade group, has been lobbying the White House and Congress to support domestic projects, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic showed the importance of localizing supply chains. Biden's White House is now quietly working to enlist labor support as it tries to build a case that its green policies are creating jobs, ahead of the 2022 midterm elections that could determine whether the strategy wins congressional backing, according to two organized labor sources familiar with the campaign Biden officials have reached out to unions across the country asking for specific job-boosting projects the administration can take credit for, the labor sources said.

Although a weaker-than-expected April jobs report, which eased concerns about the potential for a central bank policy change, helped tech stocks rally briefly, the sector remains extremely volatile. 
But while certain higher-priced technology stocks have experienced the most losses, some are still advancing on investors’ optimism over the industry’s bright long-term prospects.
Continued digitization and rising demand for advanced technologies from almost all industries should keep driving growth in the tech space.

The retailer's shares, which have gained 17% this year, fell 7% in extended trading, as first-quarter sales declined 13% from 2019. In contrast, rival apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a 7.3% rise in net sales for the same period.
The drop in sales showed Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was not recovering as quickly as rivals even as the roll out of vaccines and the arrival of stimulus checks in March boosted consumer spending confidence, analysts said. 
""This underlines the fact that Nordstrom has nowhere near dug itself out of the hole it fell into at the start of last year – despite the fact this was a boom quarter for the retail sector overall,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said. 
Late arrival of products during last year's holiday season led to a glut of out-of-fashion products, forcing Nordstrom to take steps including making returns to vendors and marking down prices in the first quarter to clear excess inventory. 
Higher labor and shipping costs, as well as supply constraints in the apparel industry, are also pressuring Nordstrom's margins, Nordstrom Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman said. 

The company reiterated its full-year revenue forecast of an over 25% increase, while rivals Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) beat first-quarter sales estimates and raised full-year forecasts last week. 
The company reported a net loss of $166 million, or $1.05 per share in the quarter ended May 1, compared with estimates of a loss of 57 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -World equity markets made gains while the U.S. dollar hit new lows against major currencies on Tuesday after Federal Reserve officials reaffirmed a dovish monetary policy stance that eased inflation concerns.
Investors weighed the Fed's soothing words that put to rest tapering worries for the time being and helped to drive the dollar to four-and-a-half-month lows. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note also hit two-week lows and was at 1.56% in afternoon trading, down from 1.608% late on Monday.
The yield curve flattened for a fourth straight session, as participants bought the long end of the curve on the view that price pressures would be stable for the rest of the year.
""People are starting to come around to the notion that the Fed is right to be careful about inflation because of the difficulties of COVID around the world,"" said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group in New York.
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks was up 0.15% at 707.26. The STOXX index of leading European shares gained 0.03% to 445.20 after hitting a record high of 447.15.
On Monday, Fed Board Governor Lael Brainard assuaged inflation concerns, saying she expects that price spikes associated with supply bottlenecks and the reopening of the economy to ""subside over time."" 
James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, also said on Monday that while still in the pandemic, it was not the time to talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy.
Those messages were consistent with what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said repeatedly over recent weeks. 
On Wall Street, all three benchmark indexes closed lower on Tuesday as concerns over the speed and trajectory of the rise in prices persisted among traders.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.24%, to 34,312.46, the S&P 500 lost 0.21%, to 4,188.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03%, to 13,657.17.
Some of the most active sectors on Wall Street include technology, industrials, customer discretionary, communication services and real estate.
""The reason why we are having some inflationary pressures is because Asia is having difficulties and that will work itself out and I think price increases like that are not long lasting,"" Cox said.
Overnight in Asia, the region's main regional equity gauges climbed, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 1.5% at a two-week high.
Oil prices edged a shade higher on Tuesday as rising demand from the approach of the Northern Hemisphere's summer driving season and lifting of coronavirus restrictions offset worries that Iran's possible return to the market will cause a supply glut.
Brent futures rose 19 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $68.65 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 2 cents to settle at $66.07.
Gold prices scaled a more than four-month peak, as the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields slumped after data showed consumer confidence dropped slightly in the United States. 
The dollar index, which measures the currency against major rivals, was down 0.2% in the afternoon session, after having fallen as much as 0.3% to 89.533, its lowest since Jan. 7.

Spot gold rose 0.97% to $1,899.2640 per ounce, having earlier hit its highest since Jan. 8 at $1,895.56.

(Reuters) -BlackRock,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s second largest shareholder, is backing several of upstart hedge fund Engine No. 1's candidates to join the company's board, in a blow to the energy giant, according to people familiar with the matter.
With the annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, Exxon has been scrambling to win the backing of major institutional investors for its directors in its toughest boardroom battle in recent history. Exxon has faced mounting criticism for its reluctance to invest more in renewable energy and for years of weak financial performance.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest fund manager, has a 6.7% stake in Exxon, and its vote illustrates how frustrated shareholders have become after years of having the company dismiss concerns about its strategy. Investors have grown much more serious about fighting climate change.
BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.
Exxon declined comment until after voting results are disclosed on Wednesday. Other sources have told Reuters the top U.S. oil producer has been calling shareholders, including Vanguard and  State Street  (NYSE:STT), to garner support for its slate of 12 directors. Preliminary results will likely be announced Wednesday morning after the meeting begins at 10:30 a.m. EDT.
Engine No. 1 has a stake worth only about $50 million in Exxon, a company with a market capitalization of about $250 billion, but the hedge fund has pushed publicly for Exxon to move faster to reduce its carbon footprint. The traction it has gained with shareholder advisory firms and BlackRock underscores the importance investors are giving to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. 
The sources requested anonymity because BlackRock does not publicly disclose how it casts its vote ahead of time. 
The final vote could turn on Exxon's three largest investors - Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock. Vanguard owns about 8.2% of the Exxon's stock while State Street owns 5.7%. Vanguard will not disclose its decision before the meeting, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
BlackRock has been more willing than Vanguard and State Street to back dissident investors, analysts have said. Its decision could prove critical to securing one or more seats for Engine No. 1's nominees.
Engine No. 1 proposed four directors - Gregory Goff, Kaisa Hietala, Alexander Karsner and Anders Runevad - with expertise in energy, technology and regulatory policy. BlackRock supported all but Runevad, the people said. Exxon has said the four do not have the expertise needed for its board. 
BlackRock also extended an olive branch to management and voted for CEO Darren Woods and for lead independent director Kenneth Frazier. Last year BlackRock voted to split the chairman and CEO roles that Woods holds and voted against Frazier. 
California-based Engine No. 1 won the backing of three large pension funds and other investors dissatisfied with Exxon's efforts to chart a clean energy strategy. Exxon's past dismissal of governance and climate concerns also cost its support, investors have said.
Three proxy advisory firms that guide how investors vote backed the hedge fund's slate. Institutional Shareholder Services recommended three of Engine No. 1's candidates while Glass Lewis backed two of the hedge fund's candidates.
Exxon pledged on Monday to add two new board members with energy and climate expertise within 12 months. Exxon's share price has climbed 45% since the start of the year. Its stock was off 2% at $58.30 at midday on Tuesday. 

Exxon's returns have lagged its global rivals, losing about 15% over the past five years. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said investors should stop funding new fossil fuel projects if they want to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

But the stock has declined more than 30% from its issue price. Read ahead to learn if OSCR could advance in the near term.Investing in insurance stocks is a good strategy for long-term gains because the industry has proven itself to be strong and resilient even amid uncertainty surrounding the global public health crisis.
According to a report by CMS, healthcare spending in the United States was projected at $4 trillion in 2020 and might touch $6 trillion by 2028. In fact, approximately $3 trillion of healthcare spending last year was passed through insurers, and this figure might hit $5 trillion by 2028. Hence, insurance underwriting margins have been on a rise and the insurance space is shaping up as a big investment opportunity over the coming decade.
A case in point is New York City-based, recently listed health insurance start-up Oscar Health, Inc. (OSCR).

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a three-day winning streak Tuesday as a slump in energy offset gains in leisure and travel stocks amid ongoing optimism on the progress of the economic reopening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.24%, or 82 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.21%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03%.
Energy fell more than 1%, weighing on the broader market, paced by declines in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),   Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM).
Still some on Wall Street remain bullish on economically-sensitive cyclicals including energy stocks.
""Strong growth in 2022 with a moderate rise in interest rates … bodes well for our favorable sectors: Industrials, Materials and Energy,""  Wells Fargo  said.
Travel and leisure stocks continued to trend higher, with airlines and cruise companies in the ascendency on optimism the lifting of restrictions will continue to accelerate travel demand.
Airlines were boosted by several optimistic updates from carriers including American and United Airlines that point to a faster return of demand than expected.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) raised its guidance on second-quarter revenue amid signs of a recovery in business bookings. Its shares rose more than 1%.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also touted expectations for a stronger return to business travel, sending its shares nearly nearly 1% higher.
Consumer confidence in the economy, however, fell short of expectations but economists said this was largely expected following a surge to record highs in April, and the impact of inflation pressures.
""Consumer inflation expectations have been elevated in recent months, which may also be damping their attitudes about their future purchasing power,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Big tech, meanwhile, traded mostly higher, though moves were largely muted as investors appeared reluctant to make big bets ahead of a four-day weekend.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended lower, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the green.
Amazon came under the spotlight after the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the e-commerce giant, alleging the company prevents sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices on other websites. Amazon in a reply to an AFP inquiry said: ""The DC Attorney General has it exactly backwards - sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store."" 
Sentiment on tech stocks has been helped by a pause in rising U.S. bond yields as fears over runaway inflation ease, but this will likely prove temporary as incoming inflation data will likely renew inflation jitters.
""We expect yields to resume their rise as a continued surge in the monthly price data challenges the market’s nervously-held view that any inflation increase will be transitory,"" Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.

Ross Bierkan, Stephen Joyce and Michael Leven, who have lodging industry experience, were speaking out for the first time and joining a chorus of investors opposed to this sale, citing the price.
They said they were acting independently of Tarsadia, the family office that owns 3.9% of Extended Stay and nominated them to the board, and of each other, in a letter seen by Reuters.
""We believe a standalone Extended Stay has a significant opportunity to create value for shareholders, if the Company pursues the right strategy and executes it well,"" they wrote.
Extended Stay Chief Executive Bruce Haase disagreed, saying shareholders recognize the ""dangerous potential outcomes and immediate value destruction"" from opposing the sale, which was at the ""right price"" at the ""right time.""

Prominent retailers CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and  Target  (TGT) have been strengthening their online presence to stay ahead of their peers and grab more market share. As such, shares of the two companies have recently soared to new 52-week highs and we think are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds and gain more traction in the coming months. So, read on to learn more.Amid a rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollout, declining average daily coronavirus cases and more cities and states eliminating pandemic restrictions, the retail industry has received a major boost this year. With consumers eager to spend money they have saved during the pandemic, there is little doubt that retail sales could soon eclipse pre-pandemic levels. Investors’ confidence in the retail industry is evident from the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 11.3% returns over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 7% gains over this period.
Since the pandemic-driven boost to online shopping is not expected to taper off anytime soon, retailers that have or will enhance their omnichannel capabilities are well positioned to witness sustained growth in their digital sales. With the economy experiencing a faster-than-expected recovery and consumer spending buoyed by an infusion of stimulus payments, the retail industry appears to be on the cusp of a comeback year.
Therefore, we think it is wise to invest in shares of leading retailers CVS Health Corporation (CVS) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Their stocks have recently hit their 52-week highs, and both the stocks are well positioned to keep soaring.

Companies in the movie theater segment were decimated amid the COVID-19 pandemic as economic lockdowns were imposed and entertainment avenues shut down.
However, in April 2021, ticket sales for stateside exhibitors were close to $190 million, which was the best month since March 2020. Alternatively, the bears might argue that ticket sales in April 2018 and 2019 topped $1 billion, which means the recovery in entertainment stocks might be subdued and painful.
Keeping this in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks in the movie industry- AMC Entertainment (AMC) and IMAX (IMAX) to analyze which is a better buy right now.

So, with this, we think it could be wise to bet on agriculture companies CF Industries (CF) and Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI). They are well positioned to benefit in the near-term. Let’s discuss.As COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions are eliminated, the agriculture industry’s prospects are getting better. The cost of food in the United States increased 2.4% in April 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Consequently, agriculture stocks are also gaining favor with investors. This is evidenced by the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund’s (DBA) 17.4% gains over the past six months.
One of the key reasons for rising food prices is heavy demand for food commodities from China. Other factors driving food prices include supply disruptions and a slowdown in shipping. Because these factors are expected to continue driving food prices up in the near term, the agriculture industry is expected to continue benefiting. According to a Meticulous Research report, the agricultural micronutrients market is expected to grow at a 8.7% CAGR between 2020 - 2027.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) and Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI). They are well positioned to capitalize on the agriculture industry’s growth.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 lacked direction Tuesday as investors weighed weakness in energy against strength in leisure and travel stocks amid ongoing optimism on the progress of the economic reopening.
The S&P 500 fell 0.28%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.23%, or 80 points, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.17%.
Travel and leisure stocks continued to trend higher, with airlines and cruise companies in the ascendency on optimism the lifting of restrictions will spark demand.
Airlines were boosted by several optimistic updates from carriers including Alaska and United Airlines that point to faster return of demand than expected.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) raised its guidance on second-quarter revenue amid signs of a recovery in business bookings. Its shares rose more than 1%.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also touted expectations for a stronger return to business travel, sending its shares nearly nearly 1% higher.
Consumer confidence in the economy, however, fell short of expectations but economists said this was largely expected following a surge to record highs in April, and the impact of inflation pressures.
""Consumer inflation expectations have been elevated in recent months, which may also be damping their attitudes about their future purchasing power,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Big tech, meanwhile, traded mixed as investors appeared reluctant to make big bets ahead of a four-day weekend.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), traded lower, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the green.
Amazon came under the spotlight after the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the e-commerce giant, alleging the company prevents sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices on other websites. Amazon in a reply to an AFP inquiry said: ""The DC Attorney General has it exactly backwards - sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store."" 
Sentiment on tech stocks has been helped by a pause in rising U.S. bond yields as fears over runaway inflation ease, but this will likely prove temporary as incoming inflation data will likely renew inflation jitters.
""We expect yields to resume their rise as a continued surge in the monthly price data challenges the market’s nervously-held view that any inflation increase will be transitory,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Energy, meanwhile, fell more than 1% to weigh on the broader market, paced by declines in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),   Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM).
Still the economic backdrop continues to favor economically-sensitive corners of the market such as cyclicals.
""Strong growth in 2022 with a moderate rise in interest rates … bodes well for our favorable sectors: Industrials, Materials and Energy,"" Wells Fargo said.

(Reuters) - New York-based indoor vertical farming startup Bowery Farming said on Tuesday it raised $300 million in its latest funding round, valuing the company at $2.3 billion as the pandemic shed light on the importance of securing local food supply.
Vertical farming grows its produce in stacked arrangements in technologically controlled environments, reducing the need for vast expanses of land and bringing mass production right in to urban areas.
While the new industry has struggled to break even in the past, the drop in technology costs, such as LED lights, is changing the economics and fueling investor interest.
According to PitchBook data, nearly $1.9 billion of global venture capital was invested in indoor farming in 2020, nearly tripling investment in 2019. 
Graphic: Global VC Funding in Indoor Farming, https://graphics.reuters.com/AGRICULTURE-INDOORFARMING/FUNDING/xegpbdgzjpq/chart.png 
Bowery’s latest funding round, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, would be the largest vertical farming deal on record, based on previous such deals listed by PitchBook.
The company’s leafy greens are sold in 850 grocery stores and it has two commercial farms in New Jersey and Maryland, and a third coming on line this year in Pennsylvania, said Irving Fain, Bowery’s CEO and Founder. Fain said the products are the same or lower in price than their organic rivals, but declined to say whether Bowery was selling them at a profit.
""The real benefit of what we're growing at Bowery is first of all, it's completely pesticide free,"" said Fain, adding that a large part of the power used for the farms is renewable with an aim to eventually make it fully renewable.
He said the new funds will be used to expand farms across the United States, looking for global expansion opportunities, and developing new crops and technology to grow things like strawberries, tomatoes and carrots indoors and near consumers as well.

Bowery's investors include GV, formerly known as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures, General Catalyst, GGV Capital and Temasek.

ZURICH/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are still deciding if and when to inoculate children against COVID-19 amid questions around safety, supply and the desperate call for more vaccines from hard-hit regions around the world.
After a sluggish rollout, inoculation programmes for the continent's adults 16 years and up are now underway. 
Adding children, who are less prone to severe COVID-19 but can be disease carriers, could help Europe to finally tame the pandemic.
Still, many health officials across Europe said they are continuing to weigh the low risk of serious COVID-19 disease among kids against the benefits for broader society that would accompany inoculating them.
""Individually, children and youth have less benefit from the vaccination than adults,"" Norwegian Institute of Public Health infection control chief Geir Bukholm told Reuters. 
""Vaccination to achieve herd immunity is also an aspect,"" he added. ""Should we recommend vaccination of children to gain control?"" 
In the United States, where more than 60% of adults have gotten at least one shot, 12- to 15-year olds started getting Pfizer/BioNTech shots this month. 
Kids in Canada are getting shots, too.
The European Medicines Agency is still reviewing the Pfizer/ BioNTech for 12-to-15 year-olds, with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) planning to seek approval as early as next month.
In France, the reopening strategy likely must include vaccinating children, given its models require 90% of the population to get shots to avoid epidemic resurgence, its Institut Pasteur has said. 
By May 20, however, only 18% of France's adult population had received both shots of a coronavirus vaccine.
A source close to the French scientific committee that advises the government told Reuters its members are assessing several scenarios, including shots for 16-to-18 year-olds from June and younger children from September as the new school year starts.
""A clear answer from me is: 'Maybe, and in any case, not now,"" French Health Minister Olivier Veran said last week, when asked about vaccinating younger children. 
""We need to get a shot to adults first.""
Italy could start by July, but the government is under pressure from a group of doctors and lawyers demanding a moratorium for children, due to what it calls a lack of long-term safety data.
""For children it is scientifically clear that there is no emergency,"" Eugenio Serravalle, a pediatrician and president of the group, the Association of Health Studies and Information, told Reuters.
MORAL IMPERATIVES
Initial clinical trials of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna vaccines in children showed them to be very effective at preventing COVID-19, and found no new safety concerns, beyond side effects documented in adults, most commonly headache, fatigue, body aches and chills.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into reports that some young people have developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, after getting vaccinated.
In Switzerland, outside the European Union, federal officials hope to vaccinate 12- to 15-year olds starting this summer, pending regulatory approval.
While Britain's speedy vaccination programme includes some 400,000 vaccinations daily and more than half of the population has been vaccinated, it has yet to decide on the under-16s, with the government saying it will be guided by the experts.
The prospect of children eventually rolling up their sleeves is already occupying thoughts of parents like Marie-Louise Pradin, a doctor in the northern French city of Lille with two boys, aged 11 and 14. 
""The doctor in me tells me to go ahead, although I will admit the mother can't help think: 'What if...'"" she said.
Meanwhile the World Health Organization has called for Western nations to delay vaccinating children and instead to donate doses to developing countries. 
The low risk in children of suffering severe COVID-19 complications, combined with the desperate plight of nations like India struggling with fast-spreading variants and too little vaccine, mean there is a moral imperative for donations, said Georg Marckmann, a professor of medical ethics at Munich's Ludwig Maxmilian University.
""There are good ethical reasons for Western countries to provide...vaccinations for low-income countries which have not been able to purchase sufficient dosages,"" Marckmann said. 
Still other experts counter that Western nations may be justified in inoculating their children before donating shots, as they aim for herd immunity and to eliminate excess deaths on the home front.
The virus has infected more than 32 million people and killed more than 712,000 in the 30-member European Economic Area (EEA).
Germany, where 13 percent of the adult population have received both doses of a vaccine, is debating now whether to give children from the age of 12 onwards shots from mid-June.
Its vaccine commission plans to make a decision in coming weeks.

""It must first be clarified exactly how urgently the children need the vaccination for their own health protection,"" Chairman Thomas Mertens told German state radio on Tuesday. 
""Our primary goal must be the protection and well-being of children.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is monitoring rising U.S. home prices, which it is concerned are increasingly making housing unaffordable, a White House spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
""The increase in housing prices we've seen does raise concerns for us about housing affordability and access to the housing market,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
""We recognize there is a need for new housing supply, particularly on the affordable end of the market.""
Home prices are sharply rising across the country, as people increasingly working from home during the pandemic struggle to find more spacious accommodation.
The rising prices also come amid shortages for goods like lumber and laborers in the aftermath of a coronavirus pandemic that disrupted normal supplies. Those signs of inflation threaten the United States' staggering economic recovery.
Psaki described these as ""supply-and-demand issues"" that are pushing prices higher.
Economic data from several sources on Tuesday pointed to sharply rising housing prices. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index, for instance, rose 13.2% in March from a year ago, the largest increase since December 2005, after rising 12.0% in February.
Psaki acknowledged that homes are a significant source of wealth for many families, who benefit from rising prices.

""The financial effects that some are feeling are positive,"" she said.
She did not suggest any new policy steps that might be taken to contain a gain in prices, but she did reiterate Biden's proposal for new credits to renovate single-family homes.

With an increasing number of states legalizing the use of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes, cannabis sales are expected to increase this year and beyond.
The burgeoning cannabis market in Canada has been gaining momentum on the back of increasing cannabis legalization in the United States. This could open up major markets for Canadian pot companies and allow them significantly increase their market shares.

Consequently, we think well-known oil and gas companies EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) are well-positioned to deliver solid returns in the near term.

After hitting historic lows in April 2020, the oil and gas industry has recovered significantly, primarily on the back of voluntary production cuts by OPEC+ countries. While the alliance has decided to gradually curb production cuts beginning this month, rising demand for crude oil on the reopening of the economies worldwide should keep oil prices at around their current levels in the coming months.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are set to face reduced EU antitrust fines over clean air technology after regulators narrowed the scope of an investigation, a person familiar with the matter said.
The case is different from Volkswagen's diesel emissions cheating scandal, which has cost it more than 31 billion euros ($38 billion in fines and settlements.
The European Commission, which charged the German carmakers in 2019 with colluding to block the rollout of clean emissions technology, is likely to issue fines before the summer break, the person told Reuters on Tuesday.
The EU competition watchdog had said previously that the case involved the ""circle of five"", namely BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volkswagen Group's VW, Audi and Porsche. 
The EU case will only focus on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, which reduce nitrogen oxides from diesel car emissions through the injection of urea (also called AdBlue) in the exhaust gas stream, the person said.
The Commission said in its 2019 charge sheet that the German carmakers colluded to restrict the size of AdBlue tanks between 2006 and 2014.
EU regulators scrapped earlier allegations that the group delayed new cleaner particulate filters for petrol cars from 2009 to 2014.
The Commission said the investigation was ongoing and declined further comment.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 12:28PM ET</span>",Explainer-What is 'black fungus' that is hitting India's COVID-19 patients?,"(Reuters) - A rapid rise in cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, has added to the challenges faced by India's healthcare system as it deals with a massive second wave of COVID-19 infections. 
The following lays out information about mucormycosis, opinions from health experts and the scientific evidence behind what could be driving the recent rise in cases. 
WHAT IS MUCORMYCOSIS? 
Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that causes blackening or discoloration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood. 
The disease has a close link to diabetes, and conditions which compromise the immune system. Experts have said that an overuse during the COVID-19 pandemic of certain drugs which suppress the immune system could be causing the surge. 
Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that mucormycosis has a mortality rate of 54%, which can vary depending on the condition of the patients and the body part affected. 
States across India have reported more than 5,000 cases of the otherwise rare disease in recent weeks, mostly in people infected with COVID-19 or recovering from the disease. 
IS IT CONTAGIOUS? 
The disease is not contagious, which means that it cannot spread from contact between humans or animals. But it does spread from fungal spores that are present in the air or in the environment, which are almost impossible to avoid. 
""Bacteria and fungi are present in our bodies already, but they are kept in check by the body’s immune system,"" said K Bhujang Shetty, head of Narayana Nethralaya a specialty eye hospital. ""When the immune system goes down because of cancer treatment, diabetes or use of steroids, then these organisms get an upper hand and they multiply,"" said Shetty.
IS THE USE OF UNSANITIZED OXYGEN CYLINDERS OR VENTILATORS CAUSING THE OUTBREAK? 
It's hard to say.
Experts say that unsanitary conditions could increase the risk of developing the infections. 
""There is a lot of contamination in the pipes used for oxygen, the cylinders that are being used, the humidifiers used,"" said Nishant Kumar, an ophthalmologist at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai. 
""If you are immuno-suppressed, and you have been on these pipes and oxygens for a long period of time, then these infections get much more of an opportunity to get in."" 
But opinion is divided on this point.
""Hospitals were dirty even before April. We need epidemiological studies to assess why these cases are rising now,"" said S.P. Kalantri, senior doctor and researcher at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Maharashtra. 
WHY MUCORMYCOSIS AND NOT OTHER FUNGAL INFECTIONS?

COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of secondary bacterial and fungal infections, but experts say India's second wave of COVID-19 has created a perfect environment for mucormycosis.
Low oxygen, diabetes, high iron levels, immuno-suppression, coupled with several other factors including prolonged hospitalization with mechanical ventilators, creates an ideal milieu for contracting mucormycosis, researchers wrote in the journal Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Tuesday that he hopes to make an announcement on the target for his $4 billion blank-check investment vehicle within weeks.
Ackman told investors on a quarterly call that his team is ""working to complete the transaction"" and that he likes the business and loves the management team.
If however the deal should collapse, Ackman said he would then move on to his next target. Either way, he said he would offer an update.

Ackman made headlines last year when he raised Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, making it the biggest blank check company ever.
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) like Pershing Square Tontine raise money in an initial public offering with the aim of merging with a private company. For the private company, the process is an alternative to it doing an IPO itself.

(Reuters) - European stocks closed flat on Tuesday, as a billion-dollar German property deal and a rally in technology shares were offset by losses in major mining stocks due to concerns over Chinese markets. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended largely unchanged at 445.20 points, after hitting a record high of 447.15 earlier in the day. 
Germany's DAX rose 0.2%, having hit a record high earlier in the day on news that Europe's largest residential property group Vonovia SE agreed to take over its rival Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) for about 18 billion euros ($22 billion).
Deutsche Wohnen surged 15.7%, the most on the STOXX 600, while Vonovia fell 6.1%. Europe's wider real estate index added 0.4%, briefly touching a one-year high. 
Technology stocks rallied 1.3% after their Wall Street peers climbed overnight on fresh insistence from U.S. Federal Reserve officials that loose policy would stay.
A lessening of inflation fears saw euro zone government bond yields edge down for the third day in a row. [US/]
""In the last couple of days, bond yields have come down a little bit and that has allowed equity markets to breathe again,"" said Roland Kayolan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
""We're still in a phase where economies are reopening gradually in Europe and we should see better leading indicators in the coming months.""
Miners lagged their European peers with a 1.7% loss, as China said it would strengthen price controls of key commodities after warning against hoarding and speculation to cool a blistering rally in prices of industrial commodities.
Investors weighed data that showed the German economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter against improving business morale in May, with companies turning more upbeat in the light of falling coronavirus infections and steps towards re-opening.
Europe's STOXX 600 is up about 12% so far this year, largely in line with Wall Street's S&P 500 as re-opening optimism lifted shares of economically sensitive sectors such as financials and energy. 

HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) AG gained 0.2% after U.S. construction materials supplier Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) said it would buy the German company's assets in California and Arizona for $2.3 billion.
British rail operator Trainline fell 8.3%, the most on the STOXX 600, after Stifel downgraded the stock, citing uncertainty to the firm's activities after the British government formed a new railway operator last week.

The AI Powered Equity exchange-traded fund (ticker AIEQ) has lagged its benchmark, the S&P 500 Total Return Index, by 9 percentage points since the end of March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech and health care stocks account for the bulk of the artificial intelligence-driven ETF’s underperformance, calculations show.
AIEQ has pared a rise of as much as 19% this year to trade just 5% higher, compared with a 12% gain for the S&P 500 total return gauge. The ETF beat its U.S. benchmark by about 7 percentage points last year.
As human investors look to ride the economic recovery from the pandemic, cheaper, more cyclical stocks are in demand while expensive growth stocks are out of favor. But the AI fund’s “manager” -- a quantitative model which runs 24/7 on  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp.’s Watson platform -- is not buying into the reflation trade narrative, according to an analysis of its latest holdings.
AIEQ has outsized positions in consumer discretionary stocks and is underweight cyclical sectors such as financials, industrials and energy.
Quant Model
The quantitative model behind the $150 million fund, developed by EquBot, assesses more than 6,000 U.S. publicly-traded companies each day. It scrapes millions of regulatory filings, news stories, management profiles, sentiment gauges, financial models, valuations and bits of market data, and then chooses about 30 to 70 stocks for the fund, which is run by ETF Managers Group LLC.
Launched in October 2017, AIEQ has delivered a total return of about 64% since inception, compared with 75% for the S&P 500 Total Return Index.
An international version of the fund which invests in non-U.S. securities using the same approach is more sympathetic to bets on a cyclical recovery, according to its holdings.
The AI Powered International Equity ETF (AIIQ) is most overweight industrials and materials relative to the MSCI World Index. It is underweight growth names such as consumer discretionary, tech and communication services.
AIIQ has risen 6% so far this year, compared with a 10% gain in the MSCI World Index.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Ryanair pilot who landed his plane in Belarus on Sunday repeatedly questioned information about an alleged bomb threat, before ultimately agreeing to land in Minsk, according to a transcript released on Tuesday by authorities in Belarus.
Belarus scrambled a warplane to escort the flight, which was en route from Greece to Lithuania. When the plane landed in Minsk, Belarusian authorities arrested a dissident journalist. Western countries have described the incident as a hijacking or piracy.
The transcript released on Tuesday differs from excerpts previously released by Belarus state TV, which had attributed some of the pilot's remarks to the controller. State TV had pointed to its version to argue that the pilot had asked to land in Minsk, rather than that the controller had advised him to do so.
Following are excerpts from the transcript, which Reuters was unable to verify. For clarity, the call sign, RYR 1TZ, which both the pilot and controller repeated when they spoke, has been edited out.

Should you place your bets on an established player like ChargePoint or buy shares of Beam Global that’s trading at a massive discount right now. . Investing in emerging technologies is always an exciting option. It provides investors with the chance to derive outsized gains and increase their capital at an exponential rate. Alternatively, it is not an option for conservative or risk-averse investors due to the disruptive nature of this space.
That being said, one such emerging industry is the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure industry. The shift to clean energy solutions should drive the demand for EVs higher in the upcoming decade which makes infrastructure stocks such as ChargePoint (CHPT) and Beam Global (BEEM) solid long-term bets today.
According to an IEA (International Energy Agency) report, the number of EVs might rise from just 10 million in 2019 to 140 million by 2030. It could rise to 245 million in case governments all around the world support and subsidize clean energy solutions.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ford follows GM, VW with two new dedicated EV platforms by 2025 - sources","By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co will announce on Wednesday that it is developing two dedicated all-electric vehicle platforms, one for full-size trucks and SUVs, the other for cars and smaller SUVs, as part of a strategy to catch General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in the global electrification race, sources familiar with Ford's plans said.
The all-EV platforms are part of an ambitious multi-year, multi-billion-dollar plan the No. 2 U.S. automaker will outline to investors at its Capital Markets Day in an online event. 
The dedicated platforms will give Ford common architectures — including shared chassis components, electric motors and battery packs — on which to base many of its future electric vehicles. That will enable it to simplify and reduce the expense of everything from logistics to manufacturing as it transitions from a global lineup of mostly fossil-fueled products.
Ford said it does not comment on future product speculation.
At Wednesday's investor event, the company also will provide more details on its long-range battery strategy, including a recently announced battery joint venture with Korea's SK Innovation, as well as broader goals for electric, commercial and self-driving vehicles, said the sources, who asked not to be named.
Ford previously said it will spend $22 billion through 2025 on electrifying many of its vehicles in the Americas, Europe and China. The sources said Ford is planning to launch at least nine all-electric cars and car-based SUVs and at least three electric trucks, vans and larger SUVs, including second-generation editions of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E at mid-decade.
What Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley cannot predict, however, is whether — and how many — customers will embrace the newer battery-powered vehicles, even if they are able to match or beat current combustion-engine counterparts in price, performance and operating costs. That concern is shared by nearly all automakers except Tesla, whose lineup is 100% electric.
Ford's traditional rivals have sprinted ahead, with both VW and GM committing tens of billions of dollars to electrify their fleets in the same markets as Ford, but on more aggressive timetables. VW and GM each will have at least two dedicated EV platforms, on which many of their future vehicles will be based.
VW launched the first of its all-new electric vehicles, the ID.3, last year in Europe, while GM will begin building its new Hummer EV pickup later this year in the United States. Both companies also are rolling out additional EV models that will share key components with those vehicles.
Ford earlier this year introduced the Mustang Mach-E, an electric crossover built on a new dedicated platform with the internal designation GE, the sources said.
A newer version of that platform, designated GE2, will debut in mid-2023, underpinning new Ford and Lincoln SUVs, according to Sam Fiorani, head of global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
The same GE2 platform eventually will be used as the base for replacements for the Mustang coupe and Mach-E, the sources said.
Ford will use a second passenger car platform — a version of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s MEB architecture — in Europe for at least two new models beginning in 2023, the sources said.
In February, Ford said its European lineup will be all-electric by 2030.
The redesigned F-150 Lightning, due in late 2025, is expected to be the first to employ the new TE1 truck architecture, Fiorani said. The first-generation Lightning, which debuts next spring, uses a platform that is heavily derived from the standard F-150.

Ford could also use the new TE1 platform for electric versions of the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs, the sources said.
In addition, Ford is expected to get a new electric vehicle, possibly a midsize pickup, that would be based on a platform from EV startup Rivian, in which Ford is an investor.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain is open to providing support for steel as a strategic sector, but nationalising Liberty Steel after the collapse of its main lender was unlikely, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Tuesday. 
Liberty and the rest of Sanjeev Gupta's family conglomerate have been seeking to refinance its cash-starved web of businesses in steel, aluminium and energy after supply chain finance firm Greensill filed for insolvency in March.
Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in Britain, said on Monday it planned to sell three non-core UK plants as part of a major restructuring and was still working at refinancing.
""I don't rule anything in or out, but I think nationalisation of all the options is the least likely,"" Kwarteng told a parliamentary hearing.
The Gupta Family Group Alliance (GFG) that owns Liberty has been under a cloud after Britain's Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into suspected fraud and money laundering in mid-May.
When asked about state aid for steel, Kwarteng said Britain had more freedom to support the industry after leaving the European Union and a task force would set up new rules on public procurement.
""We have a strategic interest in maintaining steel as every other G7 country does,"" he said, adding this was because of the needs of the defence sector as well as promoting jobs and economic growth.
The government was concerned about the potential for cheap imports squeezing out domestic producers and Kwarteng said a bill would be introduced over the coming months.

""This glut and the potential for dumping steel in the UK comes from lots of different sources,"" he said.
""We will have a subsidy control bill, which will set up a framework, which will give us the levers to act against this sort of steel dumping.""

Tesla said in a Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) post that data generated by all cars it sells in China, where it is making Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles, would be stored in the country.
Tesla added it would expand its data center network in China. The company's shares were last down 0.7%.
China, the world's biggest car market and the second largest for Tesla, is drafting rules to ensure the security of data generated by connected vehicles as their growing popularity fuels concerns about privacy and national security.
Staff at some Chinese government offices have been told not to park their Tesla cars inside government compounds due to security concerns over vehicle cameras, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.

Last week, Tesla vice president Grace Tao, along with executives at Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), attended a policy discussion held by a Chinese think-tank on data security.
Tesla is developing a platform for car owners in China that will allow them to access data generated by their vehicles. It is also boosting its engagement with mainland regulators and beefing up its government relations team, sources told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Investment bankers' business of putting together mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has never been stronger. Neither has their fear of missing out on meeting clients.
Bankers are rushing to see company CEOs and other top executives in person as restrictions put in place to contain COVID-19 have eased. This is despite dealmaking through Zoom meetings having flourished, with M&A volumes in the first quarter of 2021 hitting a year-to-date record.
The total value of pending and completed deals rose 93% to $1.3 trillion during the quarter, the second-biggest quarter on record, according to Refinitiv data.
More than a dozen investment bankers interviewed by Reuters said they were worried they would lose clients if competitors cultivated them in person. Some fretted they could not expand their clientele without schmoozing in the flesh. Some also said they or their staff were fatigued from working long hours remotely.
""People became Zoomed out. I was out visiting clients and they were very appreciative to have us back in front of them,"" said Drew Goldman, global head of investment banking coverage at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""The meetings, frankly, were more productive than they would have been on a phone call or on video conference call,"" he said, adding that most clients are also tired of Zoom and happy to meet in person.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places. This has made corporate executives more willing to engage in social activities, such as a round of golf and fine dining, that bankers organize to build rapport.
Rendezvous points have ranged from offices and restaurants to country clubs and backyards. 
During negotiations of the megamerger between AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), bankers gathered in Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav's New York City brownstone to hash out details of a deal that would create a company with an enterprise value of over $120 billion.
The pandemic's toll was the heaviest on young bankers who learn their trade and develop contacts by working alongside and traveling with senior colleagues, dealmakers said.
The social distancing restrictions made it challenging for them to evolve from footsoldiers to rainmakers, said one junior banker, using a term for those who bring in new clients and revenue. 
""For younger bankers who are trying to make their way in the world, they're gonna have to be out there, pressing the flesh and meeting people,"" said Marc Cooper, chief executive of investment bank PJ Solomon.

There is no certainty that travel by bankers will reach pre-pandemic levels. While bankers are eager to travel for business development, many are less keen to spend time with clients on more procedural talks that can be carried out remotely and expect a hybrid model will persist. 
""Citi bankers are visiting clients when and where appropriate and safe,"" said Tyler Dickson, global co-head of banking, capital markets and advisory at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). ""We do so on an as needed basis with the our firm's approval and clients' permission, while practicing safety measures such as social distancing and other relevant practices.""

Kellner's death, aged 56, in a helicopter crash on an Alaskan skiing trip in March has set off one of the biggest private wealth transfers in central Europe's former communist countries since the shift to democracy three decades ago.
Kellner's investment group PPF said in a statement his widow, Renata Kellnerova, had been appointed administrator of the estate during the proceedings.
""As such, she is listed as the holder of relevant public companies subject to regulation by the Czech National Bank. Ms. Kellner's appointment as the administrator of the estate doesn’t mean the inheritance process is complete yet,"" it said. 
The March accident came as PPF, of which Kellner owned 98.9%, was pressing ahead with one the Czech Republic's biggest banking mergers since the early 2000s to gain a controlling stake in MONETA. 
Kellner had a net worth of $17.5 billion, according to Forbes.
To meet regulatory conditions, Renata Kellnerova was listed as the beneficiary owner of PPF's stakes in both MONETA and O2 Czech Republic, controlling 29.94% and 83.57%, respectively, according to the filings.
PPF said Kellnerova would be a family representative on a newly formed executive committee to advise Ladislav Bartonicek, a PPF minority shareholder who is leading the company after Kellner's death.
Kellner founded PPF in the early 1990s and it has grown into a global player with assets worth 39.7 billion euros ($48.6 billion) at the end of 2020, spanning telecommunications, real estate, finance and engineering across Europe and Asia.
The group posted a loss of 291 million euros last year amid the coronavirus pandemic which hit its consumer lending business, the first loss in its history. 

PPF agreed with MONETA this month to combine their Czech lending assets to create a banking group to compete with the country's top banks.

(Reuters) -The expected U.S. downgrade of Mexico's aviation safety rating is not about the safety of Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL)'s partner Aeromexico and will have little impact on customers, Delta's president said on Tuesday.
The planned downgrade by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) could come as early as Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said, and follows a lengthy review of Mexico's aviation oversight by the agency. 
""This is not about Aeromexico. This is about the Mexican version of the FAA not having some of the right protocols in place,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said at a Wolfe Research conference.
Delta has a codeshare arrangement with Aeromexico enabling them to sell seats on each other's flights. Delta would be forced to remove its codes on Aeromexico flights following the downgrade, though Aeromexico could continue to code on Delta flights and members of Delta's loyalty program could still receive SkyMiles on Aeromexico flights that would normally carry the code, Hauenstein added.
""So very little impact for our customers booking through Delta,"" Hauenstein said.
""What is does do is restrict Aeromexico's ability to grow into the United States,"" Hauenstein added.
Delta and Aeromexico have been joint venture partners since 2017. Delta also owns 49% of Aeromexico but took a $770 million charge on its investment last year after the carrier's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

Reuters reported the expected downgrade on Friday.
This would not be the first time the FAA downgraded Mexico's air safety rating. In 2010, the agency downgraded Mexico due to suspected shortcomings within its civil aviation authority, then restored its top rating about four months later.

The scrambling of a warplane by Belarus to arrest a journalist, Roman Protasevich, has provoked outrage among Western leaders and prompted several airlines to divert flights away from Belarusian airspace.
""If the interceptor directed the Ryanair flight to Minsk, then they had to land there,"" said John Cox, a former US Airways pilot who is now an aviation-safety consultant.
""Pilots are trained for this, and there are internationally-agreed signals between the interceptor and the airliner,"" he said, adding that pilots carry drawings or descriptions of the intercept signals with them on every flight.
In the event of a bomb threat aboard, pilots would adhere to instructions on where to land and assume that the intercepting aircraft was there to help. 
""You don't question the intention (of an interception) because the assumption is that they're there on your behalf,"" said one pilot at a European airline.
""It's their airspace and you don't start a discussion with a MiG-29,"" said another pilot, referring to the military fighter jet which Belarus scrambled to intercept Ryanair's plane.
While airlines are required to provide passenger manifests for international travel, pilots are not usually informed of who is on board, aviation experts said.
The incident has strained a decades-old system of cooperation amid a flare-up of East-West tensions, with the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) saying Belarus' action may have contravened the Chicago Convention, a core aviation treaty.
""We strongly condemn any interference or requirement for landing of civil aviation operations that is inconsistent with the rules of international law,"" the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Monday and called for an investigation.

But the practicalities of organising such a probe are unclear as aviation, though highly regulated nationally and supported by globally harmonised rules to keep skies safe, lacks a global policeman to avoid constant disputes over sovereignty.
Meanwhile, lawyers said any probe or legal claim would also have to plough through a tangle of jurisdictions typical of liberalised air travel: a Polish-registered jet flown by an Irish group between EU nations Greece and Lithuania, over non-EU Belarus.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. companies snub SPACs amid concerns they cannot deliver,"By Echo Wang and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Advertising technology firm Simplifi Holdings was ready to go public last month at a valuation of close to $2 billion when some investors balked.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company was seeking to raise around $300 million in financing for its merger with D and Z Media Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by media entrepreneur Betty Liu.
Despite assurances from bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) that they could raise the private investment in public equity (PIPE) required, many big mutual funds and hedge funds passed on the deal because of concerns it was overvalued, according to people familiar with the situation. 
Simplifi and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. D and Z Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Simplifi is among dozens of companies that dealmakers say have canceled or reconsidered their plans to go public through mergers with SPACs in the last few weeks. They are concerned that PIPE investors are no longer flocking to what was until recently one of Wall Street's hottest trends. 
The main SPAC exchange traded fund, the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, has shed 28.1% of its value over the past three months, after hitting a peak of $35.08 in February.
Investors worry that SPACs have taken many companies, often loss-making or even without revenue, public at too-high valuations. The euphoria among retail investors that helped fuel the SPAC boom has subsided, as many of them nurse losses after share rallies reversed.
""PIPE investors have really put on the brakes in recent weeks and are focusing on more quality opportunities,"" said Amir Emami, global co-head of SPAC Coverage at RBC Capital Markets. 
The apprehension of PIPE investors is notable given that the terms of their investment allow them to redeem the SPAC shares they receive at their original value, minimizing risk. 
PIPE investors are also allowed to sell their shares in as little as 30 days after a merger with a SPAC closes, so their stance reflects doubt over whether there is still money to be made in these deals with a quick flip. 
Some 30 companies have agreed to merge with SPACs since the beginning of April, compared with 69 during the February-March period, when the SPAC boom hit a peak, according to data vendor Refinitiv. 
Many investment bankers and lawyers are now warning companies that SPACs may not be able to deliver on the frothy valuations they promise. If a SPAC's shares nosedive following a deal announcement, investors have the right to redeem the shares for their original value, upending the merger and leaving the private company without a deal to go public.
""Most of the SPAC mergers that are getting announced are trading below $10 a share soon after, so there is a very real possibility that folks will redeem their shares and shoot them down,"" said Latham & Watkins LLP partner Tad Freese.
About 60% of the 146 SPAC mergers that have been announced since the start of the year are currently trading below the initial public offering price of their SPAC, indicating high redemptions, according to data compiled by IPO expert Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida. 
LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES
SPACs are more expensive than IPOs for private companies as a route to going public. This is mainly because of the lucrative compensation of the SPAC managers, who are paid in SPAC shares, leaving less of the private company for its original shareholders. 
Nevertheless, companies have pursued deals with SPACs because they can use them as a platform to make wild projections to stock market investors about financial growth, a practice restricted by regulations in the traditional IPO process. SPACs also allow companies to go public in as little as three months, compared with a traditional IPO process that can take more than six months because of scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now the downturn in SPACs is pushing some companies to consider alternatives. 
BlueSnap, a Massachusetts-based digital payments startup, is considering a private funding round after some PIPE investors lost faith in being able to complete a SPAC deal quickly, people familiar with the matter said.
BlueSnap declined to comment.

California-based jewelry designer Brilliant Earth, which trades in conflict-free jewelry, is considering an IPO following unsuccessful talks to go public via a SPAC deal earlier this year, according to sources.
Brilliant Earth did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Crude Crude Oil WTI Futures fell after showing signs of recovery as the U.S. and Iran entered the final phase of their nuclear talks, rekindling hopes that the Iran’s oil would enter international markets soon.
Markets were also taking an extended breather after last week’s jolt that saw cryptos losing as much as half their value in a single session. The cryptos have since been trying to adjust to new levels but are still struggling.
 Moderna  's (NASDAQ:MRNA) announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine had been found to be effective in teens was also keeping the overall sentiment positive and driving trades in growth stocks.
In company-specific news, the buzz at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was also helped by reports the retail giant is nearing a deal to acquire MGM Studios for up to $9 billion. If this happens, it will mark its biggest purchase since acquiring Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

As Virgin Galactic’s dramatic rebound gathered pace in the last three days -- culminating in a 28% surge on Monday -- her firm Ark Investment Management slashed its remaining stake to just 45 shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The money manager has been gradually selling from May, after Richard Branson’s space-travel company plunged on technical issues and rising competition from rivals funded by Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.
It held more than 1.7 million shares worth over $100 million when the company notched its all-time high in February. By the start of May, with Virgin Galactic down more than 60%, it had boosted holdings to more than 2 million shares valued at $45 million.
Virgin Galactic remains more than 50% down from records, but in less than two weeks has rallied 73% thanks to a successful test flight that’s reviving confidence in its ambition to commercialize space tourism.
The Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics exchange-traded fund (NYSE:ARKQ) held the bulk of the New York-based asset manager’s Virgin Galactic shares, but has now sold them all. The Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKX), which was started in late March, held more than 220,000 shares worth almost $7 million shortly after its launch. It now holds the remaining few shares, worth about $1,200.
An Ark representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wood’s funds weren’t alone in missing the bounce. The VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (NYSE:BUZZ) also sold its holdings in Virgin Galactic just before the rebound.
The Dave Portnoy-backed fund, which picks stocks based on favorable sentiment detected in social media and blogs, sold its remaining shares in Branson’s company last week, the data show.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of African-American directors on corporate boards has risen significantly since the killing of George Floyd last year at the hands of Minneapolis police, according to a report by consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions. 
The social justice protests after Floyd's murder one year ago sparked a racial reckoning in Corporate America, with leaders of major companies, led mostly by white men, promising to do better to recruit, retain and promote people of color. 
S&P 500 companies appointed 165 directors who are Black, out of a total of 513 new corporate board members, from July 1, 2020 to May 19, 2021, according to ISS Corporate Solutions, or about 32%. 
In the same period a year earlier, S&P 500 companies appointed just 55 Black board members out of 485 total new directors, according to the analysis, or about 11%. 
""The needle has clearly moved,"" said Marija Kramer, head of ISS Corporate Solutions, in a statement.
Investors have called for more transparency on race, with proposals on corporate ballots requiring boards commission racial equity audits garnering support from shareholders. The audits analyze a company's impact on civil rights, equity and diversity.
ISS Corporate Solutions found that roughly half of the new directors who are Black were joining public company boards for the first time. Previously, about a third of Black directors were new to public board service. 

Companies also face new rules on board diversity in California and Illinois. Stock exchange operator Nasdaq Inc is waiting for regulatory approval to require companies it lists to report the number of directors by gender and in categories including Black or Hispanic and LGBTQ+.
The exchange wants boards to have at least one woman and one minority or LGBTQ+ member, or explain why they do not.

(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) on Tuesday launched a cloud computing service powered by data center chips from Ampere Computing based on technology from Arm Ltd, the second major cloud company to offer an Arm-based service after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services. 
Cloud providers are some of the biggest buyers of chips because they rent out the computing power they generate to thousands of other companies. Until recently, however, almost all the chips cloud services bought came from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) because most business software is written to run on those processors.
That began to change in 2018 when Amazon, the largest cloud provider, announced a service using its own custom chip made with intellectual property from Arm, the British firm whose technology already underlies most smartphone chips and is steadily making its way into laptops and data centers to challenge Intel and AMD.
Oracle on Tuesday joined the fray with chips from Ampere Computing, the company founded by former Intel President Renee James, who also sits on the board of Oracle. Oracle said it would rent out the chips at 1 cent per computing core per hour, less than half of what it said were its rivals' comparable rates.
""We’re at an inflection point in the industry,” Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, told Reuters in an interview. ""Now that there’s a very competitive Arm product, I view my job as to offer my customers value and choice.”

Oracle also announced a range of initiatives to help expand the amount of business software that runs on Arm chips, a move that could help its rivals.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google do not yet offer Arm-based cloud services to the public, but Magouyrk said he expects they will -- and that all cloud customers will eventually benefit from the competition.
""We’ll be ahead of them in that regard, but I also think they’ll have Arm offerings and they’ll be highly competitive. I view this is a multi-year process where Arm becomes ubiquitous on the server,"" Magouyrk said.

Investing –  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares rose nearly 3% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as the company said its Covid-19 vaccine has been found to be 100% effective in teenagers and that it would seek regulatory approval next month for its emergency use in that age group.
Moderna conducted trials among adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years. The findings make its vaccine second behind Pfizer’s to demonstrate high efficacy in younger people. Children make up close to 20% of the U.S. population, per government data.
The company, which uses mRNA technology to make its Covid-19 shots, said no cases of the viral infection were observed after two doses of vaccine using the primary case definition, consistent with a vaccine efficacy of 100%.
The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, the company said in a release.
All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second injection to assess long-term protection and safety, it said.
If approved, the vaccine will be a great morale booster for parents and help to bring their children back to schools this fall.
The two-dose vaccine is already authorized for adults and has helped to tame the virus in the U.S, along with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX) shot.
Moderna has forecast supplying 800 million to 1 billion doses of its vaccine in 2021 with another 2 billion doses to be supplied in 2021, the production coming from its own and partners’ facilities.

Airlines are seeing a pick up in summer bookings as easing COVID-19 restrictions and widespread vaccination efforts encourage travel in the United States, nearly a year after the pandemic hit demand.
United said ticketed yields accelerated in the second quarter, but warned that capacity for the same period would fall at least 46% compared to 2019, hurt by fewer flights to India and Israel during the health crisis.
The U.S. airline had previously expected second-quarter capacity to be down about 45%.
""Business demand continues to be significantly depressed, though bookings for business travel are starting to recover,"" United said.
The carrier expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), or unit revenue, to be down about 12% in the second quarter from 2019, compared to its prior outlook of down about 20%.

United expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin in the quarter to be down 11%, compared to its prior forecast of down 20%.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) last week trimmed its second-quarter average core cash burn forecast, as improving demand for leisure travel is expected to more than offset higher fuel prices.

The company Monday said it expects to produce half the number of vehicles it had forecast for this year even as it now sees its 2021 operating expenditure rising to $335 million-$350 million from $220 million-$235 million forecast in March.
According to NYT, Lordstown would be able to make as many as 2,200 trucks by the end of the year if it gets funding. Without additional capital, it would probably make fewer than 1,000.
The electric vehicle start-up sounded a note of caution, saying it has “encountered some challenges, including COVID-related and industry-wide related issues, as we progress towards our start of production deadline”.

(Reuters) -Britain's competition regulator is reviewing AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s planned $39 billion takeover of U.S.-based Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) on whether it could reduce competition in Britain or other markets.
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it was inviting comments from any interested party on the deal to help its assessment, a routine carried out for major deals, and set a deadline of June 3 for any submissions. 
Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca agreed to buy Alexion in December in its largest ever deal in a bet on rare-disease immunology and to boost its business, which includes a fast-growing cancer medicines unit and a major COVID-19 vaccine. 
AstraZeneca's European peers Roche and Novartis also have a portfolio of drugs for rare diseases and immunology products.
The CMA review is part of an initial analysis the regulator refers to as ""phase 1"", and is likely to be wrapped up by July 21, it said, adding the CMA expects to post its decision afterwards if the deal has been cleared or referred to a deeper, ""phase 2"" probe.
""The commencement of the UK CMA's formal review is another important step towards closing of the proposed acquisition, which we continue to expect will be in the third quarter of 2021,"" a representative for AstraZeneca said.
Shareholders of the Cambridge, UK-based company cleared the proposed deal at a general meeting earlier this month where 99.89% of votes cast were in favour of approving it. 
The United States in April approved the deal, as have other countries including Canada, Brazil and Russia. Regulatory clearances from regions such as Japan and the European Union are pending.

AstraZeneca, whose stock was 0.3% lower at 8,127 pence by 1112 GMT, is hoping an improved version of Alexion's best-selling drug and other rare-disease medicines will help build a deeper hold in China and other emerging markets.
Boston, Massachusetts-based Alexion was not available for comment outside of business hours.

(Reuters) - After a failed union-organizing effort at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) last month, labor advocates are looking to the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, hoping for a chance to get a worker on the board of directors of the world's largest online retailer.
A resolution from shareholders including nonprofit Oxfam America calls for Amazon to consider nominating an hourly employee to its board. The proposal picked up valuable, and rare, backing from top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.
Amazon's board has recommended that shareholders reject the proposal, and very few U.S. companies give workers a board seat. Still the concept is gaining attention as investors focus on income inequality and social justice issues.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a letter to shareholders last month that the company needed ""a better vision for our employees' success."" Bezos controls about 14% of Amazon's shares, making investor-led reforms an uphill battle.
During the labor organizing campaign, some staff had aired grievances including fatigue from warehouse work and mandatory anti-union meetings. Still, employees at the Bessemer, Alabama warehouse ultimately rejected forming the company's first U.S. union by a more than 2-to-1 margin. 
Jennifer Bates, a Bessemer employee who supported the union effort, will present the resolution at Amazon's annual meeting, according to Oxfam.
The proposal calls for directors to consider hourly associates in their initial list of new board candidates. Bates is expected to say Amazon has not listened to workers' health and scheduling concerns and that having a board seat would be ""transformative,"" according to prepared remarks shared with Reuters.
""It would send a signal that our voices matter,"" Bates says in the remarks.
Amazon referred Reuters to the board's statement against the proposal, which said directors already were focused on employees' pay and benefits and workplace safety and culture. The company raised starting pay to $15 per hour in the United States more than two years ago.
""We have also long recognized the importance of employees' participation in our decision-making processes,"" the board's statement said.
ISS SUPPORT MAY MOVE THE NEEDLE
For the meeting, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has backed eight other shareholder proposals contrary to the board's wishes and recommended against approving executives' pay, although it did recommend electing all 10 Amazon director candidates.
Various countries including Germany have requirements for worker representation in boardrooms, but only a few U.S. companies have such representation including top airlines Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc.
While a number of Democrats in Washington have called for such representation, similar shareholder proposals have drawn little support at other U.S. companies.
Proposals at  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) in March and at industrial systems maker  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) Inc in January each won only 7% support of votes cast, and others last year did not even fare that well. [nL1N2K93EL]
A difference is that neither proposal this year had the support of ISS, whose backing can shift 15% or more of shareholder votes, according to corporate election specialists. 
In its May 13 report ISS noted the controversies Amazon faces over working conditions in its warehouses and stated that ""having employee representation on the board could potentially provide the company with meaningful insights into its workforce's needs.""
Shareholder resolutions need not win majorities to lead to changes, since they show boards the mood of investors. Resolutions winning between 30% and 50% support still led to at least some changes two-thirds of the time, a recent study by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) found. 

The second-largest proxy adviser, Glass Lewis, has recommended investors oppose the director-candidate resolution, worried it could threaten the board's independence and shareholder value.
Courteney Keatinge, Glass Lewis senior director for ESG research who helped develop the recommendation, said the firm would expect Amazon to respond if the proposal wins more than 51%. She said via e-mail that “if it was not evident that the company responded or engaged extensively with shareholders on how to respond, we would probably have some concerns.”

Investing – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares were up just short of 1% in Tuesday’s premarket on double boost from Morgan Stanley reiterating its ‘overweight’ on the stock and a new order win to supply SMBC Aviation 14 jets from its 737 MAX catalog.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag pointed out to Boeing 737 tracker showing substantial increase in domestic flights in April while reiterating her target of $274 for the stock, StreetInsider said.
The data thrown up by the tracker is a positive development not just for Boeing but also airlines given the aviation sector has had a subdued comeback compared to other consumer sectors like retail and restaurants.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up 0.5%-1%. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) gained 1.4% premarket.
Prospects of more crude supplies as nuclear talks with Iran enter a crucial phase were keeping oil prices weaker, further lending help to airline stocks.  
In another positive development for Boeing, SMBC Aviation has placed an order for 14 additional jets of the single-aisle 737 MAX. The order marks another confidence booster for Boeing seeking to put more 737 MAX in the sky as it puts behind safety issues that plagued the plane for long.
A May 21 Reuters report said Boeing has drawn up preliminary plans to raise output of the narrow-body planes to as many as 42 units a month by fall 2022.
Two accidents in 2018 and 2019 forced authorities to ground 737 MAX, which was at the time Boeing's biggest money maker in a booming market for narrow body planes. The 20-month safety ban was lifted in November after the company made the fixes.
But the flights were halted in April after a separate electrical issue led the manufacturer to stop deliveries of the planes with an advisory to its clients not to fly those in their fleet.
Boeing secured on May 13 a much-awaited regulatory nod for the electrical fix that had kept some 100 of its 737 MAX series grounded.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday as optimism grows over progress on the reopening, with another wave of corporate earnings due.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 45 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices posted strong gains Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising almost 200 points, or 0.5%, the S&P 500 climbed 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite was the relative outperformer, jumping 1.4%.
Helping the tone was more progress on the reopening and signs the vaccine rollout is slowing the spread of new cases in the U.S. New York City and Los Angeles announced all children will return to public school classrooms in-person in September, while the United States last week reported the lowest number of new Covid-19 cases in nearly a year.
There are a number of companies set to report later Tuesday, including the likes of AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN),  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL), Agilent (NYSE:A),  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) and Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN).
Elsewhere, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also likely to be in the spotlight following reports that the retail giant is close to a deal to buy MGM Studios for between $8.5 billion and $9 billion. It would mark Amazon’s biggest acquisition since it bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion.
The recovery in the price of Bitcoin, now up 2%, means the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a big holder of the digital currency, and crypto-exchange  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) could be in focus.
Economic data due Tuesday includes new home sales for April at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Although the housing market has been very strong, there are signs that it’s cooling and analysts expect a figure of 970,000, falling by 50,000 or nearly 5%, from the 1,021,000 new home sales the prior month.
Additionally, consumer confidence in the U.S. may erode a little in May, with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index likely to fall to 119.4 from 121.7 in April. 
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, consolidating after recent strong gains as traders track progress over the potential return of Iranian supply to the international crude markets.
Talks between Iran and world powers will continue in Vienna this week to resolve outstanding issues on the 2015 nuclear accord, which may pave the way for the removal of U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude flows.

The company, a major Boeing customer, on Tuesday said the order is for jets that have already been built and will increase its MAX fleet to 121. 
Last year during the grounding of the MAX and at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic SMBC deferred delivery of 68 jets by four years until 2025-2027 and indicated that it had not ruled out cancellations.
But Chief Executive Peter Barrett on Tuesday said he was confident in demand for the MAX, which he said was finding increasing acceptance after regulators cleared it to fly late last year after its two-year grounding.
""We thought this was a good opportunity to increase our portfolio of young, fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly narrowbody aircraft - the kind of planes we think are going to be in demand as this recovery takes a firmer footing,"" Barrett told Reuters. 
""There seems to be good acceptance for the aircraft with airlines and customers."" 
Aircraft leasing companies, which control more than 40% of the global fleet, are among the largest MAX customers.
Industry sources last week told Reuters that Boeing had drawn up preliminary plans to boost 737 MAX output to as many as 42 jets a month in fall 2022 from single digits now, preparing for a recovery from overlapping safety and COVID-19 crises.

Production was halted in 2019 when Boeing's fastest-selling model was grounded after fatal crashes. Production resumed last May at a fraction of its original pace while Boeing navigated regulatory approvals and a fragile supply chain.
SMBC Aviation Capital is owned by a consortium including Japan's Sumitomo Corp and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Consolidation of the aircraft leasing industry, which controls over 40% of the global passenger fleet, is likely to be accelerated by COVID-19, the head of major lessor SMBC Aviation Capital, said in an interview on Tuesday. 
The prediction comes in the wake of last year's $30 billion mega-deal to combine the world's two largest aircraft leasing companies when AerCap agreed to buy the leasing business of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
""You were always going to see increasing levels of consolidation and... I believe it is likely that the events of the last 18 months are likely to probably accelerate that a bit,"" said SMBC Chief Executive Peter Barrett, one of the world's five largest lessors.
Barrett said SMBC was likely to receive offers to take part in any consolidation as one of the best capitalised firms in the industry and that if any opportunities ""present value and fit into our strategy, we'll certainly have a look at them.""
Barrett was speaking after SMBC reported a profit of $15 million for 2020 in what the firm described as the worst year the industry has ever experienced due to impact of COVID-19 restrictions on global travel. 
The company received a further $1.2bn of funding from its shareholders during the year taking its total shareholder support to $11.8 billion. That included $3.1 billion in equity and $8.7 billion in debt. 
It had $4.9 billion in available liquidity at the end of the year. 
It announced the purchase of an additional 14 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets, which it said had already been configured for use in the low-cost sector, with the first to deliver later this year.
Barrett said he expected the recovery in global aviation would ""take a firmer footing"" over the next 6-12 months with low-cost short-haul travel set to dominate. 
""The nature of the recovery is regional, its local... and it's going to be dominated by low-cost carriers, who are the people with the capacity and the ability to stimulate traffic,"" he said. 
Long-distance travel, on the other hand, remains a while away from a meaningful recovery, with operators likely to have to price tickets pretty aggressively to fill their planes, he said. 
Demand for narrowbody planes, which dominate short-haul markets, have seen demand improving in the past six months with leasing rates beginning to stabilise. 

Business travel will recover, but it is not clear how much smaller it might be after COVID-19, Barrett said. ""Whether it is going to be 5%, whether it is going to be 15% (smaller) .. It's hard to judge.""
Asked whether there was a risk of oversupply of narrow-body planes from Boeing and Airbus, Barrett said that was always a risk. ""It's a finely balanced thing."" (This story corrects in paragraph 6 to say SMBC received $1.2bn of funding from shareholders in 2020 to cumulative total of $11.8bn; It did not receive $11.8bn in 2020)

1407,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 06:23AM ET</span>",Portugal says TAP can still use rescue loan despite court ruling,"By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's Economy Minister said on Tuesday last week's ruling by Europe's second-highest court against a 1.2-billion-euro rescue loan to TAP airline did not hinder negotiations on its restructuring plan and TAP could continue using that money.
The Luxembourg-based General Court on Wednesday upheld Ryanair's fight against the rescue loan TAP received in 2020 from the state, with the European Commission's blessing, on the grounds that European regulators failed to justify the huge cash injections.
""This decision that the court took for formal reasons, over a lack of adequate reasoning, does not have an immediate impact, nor does it suspend the possibility of TAP continuing to benefit from the loan,"" Pedro Siza Vieira told Reuters.
Rather, the minister said, the court gave the Commission a period of time to continue analysing TAP's situation ""and then take a properly reasoned decision"".
Asked whether the ruling could hinder the negotiations with the European Commission over TAP restructuring plan, he said: ""I think not.""
The Commission has said it will study the ruling before deciding on its next steps.
If Brussels rejects Lisbon's restructuring plan for TAP, which involves a proposed 2,000 job cuts by 2022 and pay cuts of up to 25%, TAP would have to immediately repay the rescue loan, which could lead to its insolvency. 
TAP reported a record 1.2 billion euro loss last year amid the pandemic. 

""Portugal has a strategic interest in maintaining TAP as a company with its own brand and with its operations centre in Lisbon,"" he said.
""The state aid is truly an investment because TAP is viable in the medium and long term,"" he added.

The unit of U.S. banking giant  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will offer a 51% funding contribution ratio, while the wealth management unit of ICBC will offer 49%, the Chinese bank said in a exchange filing.
The joint venture is ""to create a world-class asset management business,"" said Goldman Sachs in an emailed statement to Reuters, as it ""will combine Goldman Sachs Asset Management's expertise in investment and risk management with ICBC's strong brand recognition and unparalleled access to retail and institutional clients across China.""
ICBC said it ""will be beneficial to the bank's provision of more diversified and professional wealth management services.""
The venture will develop a broad range of investment products for the Chinese market over time, including quantitative investment strategies, cross-border products and innovative solutions in alternatives.
China opened its giant financial sector to foreign companies last year as part of an interim trade deal with the United States signed in January.
U.S. fund giant BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) received a business licence earlier this month for a majority-owned wealth management venture with a unit of country's second largest bank China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB) and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd.

Amundi has also set up a wealth management joint venture with Bank of China, and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) has applied to partner with Bank of Communications (BOCOM) in wealth management.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), country's top banking watchdog, said in March that Chinese regulators would welcome more foreign firms' entry into China's financial sector, including the wealth management space.

""Together with the initial cash distribution and current cash and cash equivalents in the funds, the total cash position amounts to $5.9 billion as of May 14, 2021, which is more than half of the total (assets under management) of the four funds at the time of their suspension,"" the bank's asset management arm said in a statement to investors.
Having paid out some $4.8 billion in liquidation proceeds, the funds now hold some $1.06 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
It expected to provide an update on the next payments in late May or early June, it said.
Greensill Capital lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, but it collapsed in March after one of its main insurers declined to renew its cover. 
Among the investors burnt in the widespread fallout from Greensill's collapse were clients of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Its asset management unit was forced in March to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill.
Credit Suisse previously disclosed some $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties within the funds, with some $1.2 billion of its assets related to Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, which is being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office.

In March the bank hired financial adviser Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) to assist in evaluating the funds' portfolio and credit risks, it disclosed on Tuesday.
Internally, it has established an investment committee to help manage the liquidation process and set up a special project to handle the recovery as well as any necessary legal enforcement and litigation strategies, it said.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China launches antitrust probe into Tencent-backed property broker KE -sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's market regulator has begun an investigation into suspected anti-competitive practices by KE Holdings, the country's biggest housing broker whose top backer is Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), two people who know of the matter said.
The investigation is the latest into China's big so-called ""platform"" companies that match sellers and buyers, several of which have been accused by regulators of exploiting consumers. 
KE Holdings, which operates housing platforms Lianjia and Beike in China, was warned last month by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), along with dozens of internet companies, against any abuse of market dominance and told to conduct self-inspections. 
SAMR has been formally investigating in recent weeks whether KE Holdings forces real estate developers to list housing information only on its platforms, including Lianjia and Beike, a tactic known as ""choose one from two"", the people said, declining to be named because the information is not public.
The investigation has not been publicly announced. It is not known when it will be wrapped up or what it could entail for KE Holdings.
KE Holdings declined to comment to Reuters but in a later statement on its Chinese social media accounts Beike denied that ""SAMR had opened a case against Beike"".
SAMR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
KE's New York-listed shares fell as much as nearly 10% in pre-market trading on Tuesday, after the Reuters report.
Graphic: KE Holdings shares - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqbbjevx/image-1621913862223.png
Last month, SAMR hit  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group with a record $2.8 billion fine after finding that the e-commerce giant had been preventing its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms since 2015.
Tencent itself is in the firing line, with SAMR preparing to levy a fine of at least $1.5 billion on the gaming and social media behemoth, Reuters reported in April. SAMR also announced an investigation last month into Tencent-backed food delivery giant Meituan.
SAMR has stationed inspectors since late April in 17 companies that operate platforms, including KE Holdings, to enhance the efficiency of antitrust inspections, one of the sources said. 
KE Holdings, which also counts SoftBank Group Corp among its major backers, launched Lianjia, formerly known as Beijing Homelink Real Estate Brokerage, 20 years ago. 
It grew into one of China's largest bricks-and-mortar property agents and later set up Beike as a separate online housing platform matching buyers and sellers, renters and landlords, as well as providing home finance.
It listed in New York in August, and after sharp gains last year the shares are down 15% so far in 2021. Still, it has a market value of about $62 billion.

On top of the antitrust probe, KE Holdings faces uncertainty following the death last week of its 50-year-old founder and chairman, Zuo Hui, due to an illness. Co-founder Peng Yongdong was appointed chairman this week.
Its biggest revenue sources are from existing home and new home transactions, with market shares of 26% and 35%, respectively, of gross transaction volume in 2020, according to TF Securities, a relatively high proportion in China's fragmented housing market. KE Holdings posted stellar first quarter financial results last week, with net revenue up 191% on the year, bolstered byChina's robust property market that quickly rebounded last yearfrom the coronavirus crisis.

On Monday, Reuters reported the meeting was scheduled with some 20 executives. One source called it an opportunity to test the waters with companies ahead of Erdogan's planned meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden next month.
The ""CEO-level virtual roundtable"" would include a wide range of U.S. industries, Yaprak Ece, an official at the Turkish Embassy, said in an email. 
""President Erdogan regularly meets with the international investors (and) this event would highlight the two countries' growing economic and trade cooperation, in addition to current economic affairs,"" she said.
Another source who spoke to Reuters said executives from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are among those to join the call. The two companies did not respond to requests for comment. 

The planned June 14 meeting between Biden and Erdogan, on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels, would be their first in-person encounter since the U.S. election last year. 
Bilateral ties have been strained on several fronts including U.S. tariffs on Turkish steel and Ankara's purchase of Russian missile defences in 2019, which prompted Washington to oust Turkey from a consortium producing F-35 jets.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",Huawei plans to launch new operating system for phones in June,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies said it will launch its new Harmony operating system for smartphones on June 2, its biggest move yet aimed at recovering from the damage done by U.S. sanctions to its mobile phone business.
The use of its own operating system will mean it will no longer be reliant on Android. U.S. sanctions banned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from providing technical support to new Huawei phone models and access to Google Mobile Services, the bundle of developer services upon which most Android apps are based.
It was not immediately clear if it will be launching new smartphones at the same time or if there will be updates for existing phones or how fast the rollout might occur.
The new HarmonyOS will only go some way to mitigating the impact of the 2019 sanctions that also barred Huawei from accessing critical U.S.-origin technology, impeding its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors.
Once the world's biggest smartphone maker, Huawei now is ranked 6th globally with a 4% market share in the first quarter.
The previous Trump administration argued that the Chinese telecommunications giant posed a threat to U.S. national security - a charge that Huawei has denied.

Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei this week called on staff to ""dare to lead the world"" in software in a bid to move into business areas that can't be affected by U.S. sanctions, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
The company will need to take a more ""open source"" approach to development and should try to attract more software experts from overseas as part of the pivot, it said.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",COVID may be shifting ratings goalposts,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Colombia's loss of its S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) investment grade status last week has not only raised the usual question of who is next but also whether the number of countries seemingly being spared points to a moving of the ratings goalposts. 
Being stripped of one's investment grade credit rating - which can push up borrowing costs - is chastening for any government, but Colombia is by no means alone.
Over the past decade Brazil, South Africa, Turkey along with more than half a dozen others have become ""fallen angels"", as a demotion to junk is known in rating agency parlance, and COVID-19 pressures mean plenty more are in danger.
Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) both have India and Romania on warnings. Fitch also has Colombia, Panama and Uruguay on its watchlist and although tiny Curacao is the only one left on S&P's, 10 more countries are on the precarious BBB-minus last investment step albeit with 'stable' outlooks. 
On the face of it, it doesn't look good for many of them. India stands out with an eye-watering 90% debt-to-GDP burden, but all except for Romania now have debt ratios well above the 55% average for a BBB minus-rated country. 
Median interest payments are also expected to be considerably higher in emerging markets this year. Fitch reckons this to be equivalent to 2.5% of GDP compared to 1.2% in major economies and if COVID-19 continues, recoveries will be delayed.
However, despite all the gloomy numbers, financial market investors who use credit default swaps (CDS) to insure against debt problems, don't seem to think that any of these countries are about to suffer the chop. 
A year ago, CDS were pointing to India, Colombia as well as Indonesia and Mexico with its giant $130 billion bond market, all being demoted to ""junk"". All are now trading at levels suggesting they will retain their investment grades.
""There is no magic debt-to-GDP number that automatically triggers a downgrade. It just doesn't work like that,"" explained Moody's Chief Credit Officer for EMEA Colin Ellis.
Being cut to junk can automatically exclude government or corporate bonds from certain high-profile investment indexes and set off a wave of problems by driving up borrowing costs. 
In contrast to last year's blizzard of cuts when the main firms cut between 25%-30% of the countries they rate, Moody's has upgraded roughly three times as many as it has downgraded this year. S&P has made 50% more upgrades when corporates are included too. 
""When it is a something like a short sharp shock, sometimes it is appropriate to look through the noise,"" Ellis added, highlighting how COVID has caused most countries up to six months of acute economic pain compared to the nearly 18 months the 2007-2008 financial crisis lasted. 
ALL RISE
The task of deciphering impact from noise can run the risk of inconsistencies.
Colombia, which said last week it would work to maintain market confidence in its finances, should have been feeling hard done by, analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) say. 
S&P had only reaffirmed its investment grade a month ago and even with its tax plan problems, the government's 65% debt-to-GDP ratio will be well below India's 90% or the 85% of Croatia which had its BBB- rating reaffirmed on Friday. 
The 15-percentage point jump in its debt ratio since COVID has also been smaller than the near 20-percentage point rise Romania has seen, yet S&P has just taken Romania off its downgrade warning.
Italy, whose debt level is on course to top 150% of GDP this year, has had its rating lifted by S&P.
""There is a broad issue that rating agencies seem to be giving a lot of countries the benefit of the doubt,"" said one of fund manager M&G's ""bond vigilantes"", Eldar Vakhitov, who sees Romania as a prime example. 
S&P had put Bucharest on its downgrade warning back in 2019 citing concerns its budget deficit was increasing from 3% to 4.5% of GDP. Yet it didn't follow through even when it jumped to 9% of GDP in 2020 and was projected to be 7% this year.
One of S&P's top sovereign analysts, Frank Gill, noted that Romania's new government has backed off from major pension increases. More generally, with so much uncertainty over how COVID will leave economies, it makes sense to give some benefit of the doubt where possible.
Fitch's managing director for global sovereigns and supranationals, Tony Stringer, also pointed out recently https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fitch-wait-until-next-year-make-final-covid-19-judgments-2021-04-14 that the fact that almost all countries' debts have risen means that individual countries haven't stood out in how bad they look. 
Fitch forecasts that global government debt will reach $95 trillion by 2022, a record 40% increase in nominal terms compared with the pre-COVID level of 2019. 
""When you have a crisis that impacts all countries, some of those indicators on the relative scale are all going to move together - so it creates a bit of a cushioning effect for ratings,"" Stringer said last month.

For other observers though, that acceptance of high debt sits awkwardly. Ratings are specifically designed to judge countries' ability to repay their debt and history shows the higher the debt, the greater the risk of running into difficulties. 
""It's like saying, sorry, officer, you cannot give me a ticket, everyone else was speeding too,"" said S&P's former head of sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 12:30AM ET</span>",Emirates warns Boeing it will refuse 777x jets if they don't meet commitments,"DUBAI (Reuters) -The head of Emirates airline, one of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s biggest customers, has warned the U.S. planemaker that it would refuse delivery of 777x jets if they fall short of contractual performance commitments.
In an interview broadcast on Monday, President Tim Clark said he had not received any performance details of the jet's engines so far even though test flights began in 2020.
The influential industry veteran has raised concerns that Boeing had a recent history of over-promising on performance of new jets, including the in service 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.
""We will not accept an aeroplane unless it is performing 100% to contract,"" Clark told aviation consultant John Strickland in a pre-recorded online interview for Dubai's Arabian Travel Market trade show.
""Unless it is doing what they said it would do and contracted, we will not take that aeroplane.""
Boeing declined comment.
A GE spokesman declined to comment when asked if the engine maker had shared performance data with Emirates on the GE9X engine that powers the 777x.
However, the spokesman added, GE was pleased with its performance, validated through an extensive ground and flight test program.
State-owned Emirates is one of the world's biggest long-haul airlines, with a fleet of around 140 Boeing 777-300s and 115 Airbus A380s.
It has ordered 126 777x and 30 787s worth over $50 billion at list prices with the U.S. planemaker.
Boeing has been developing the widebody jet, a new version of its popular 777 series, with the goal of releasing it in late 2023, three years later than planned.
Emirates, who was supposed to receive its first last July, doubts it will start receiving the jets until 2024 though Boeing had told them it would come in the back end of 2023, Clark said.
""There are issues on that airplane. I'm not altogether clear as to when we're going to get them.""
He said the delays meant Emirates, a launch customer of the new jet, over the next three years had no visibility on how it would replace its current 777-300s with the new 777x jets.

Clark repeated recent criticisms that Boeing needed to undertake a cultural and governance change following the production of the flawed 737 MAX, which was suspended worldwide for nearly two years following two fatal crashes. 
He said he recently told Boeing to only start commercially producing a new aircraft once it had been fully tested and certified.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Tuesday morning as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials eased investor concerns about runaway inflation.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.70% by 11:23 PM ET (3:23 AM GMT) after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the world's recovery from COVID-19 was uneven and pledged to keep monetary policy ultra-loose.
Meanwhile, Japan is planning to extend the state of emergency against COVID-19 in nine prefectures, including Tokyo, as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase. The U.S. State Department also upped its travel advisory for Japan to level four in response.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.85%, with the Bank of Korea due to hand down its May policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.53%. The country’s second-largest city Melbourne has restricted gatherings as it deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.66% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.67%.
U.S. Federal Reserve officials, including Governor Lael Brainard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, reiterated that any inflation was temporary.
Bullard said on Monday that the central bank is not ready to pare back its stimulus measures, and expected inflation is to rise above 2% in 2021 and into 2022.
“We’re not quite there yet, I think we will get there in the months ahead... I think there will come a time when we can talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy, I don’t think we should do it when we’re still in the pandemic,” Bullard told Yahoo Finance.
While the comments eased concerns about the runaway inflation, some investors remain worried that the Fed could be forced to change its current dovish policy earlier than expected should inflationary pressure build-up.
“Inflation is a key focus for investors, meaning uncertainty over what happens to interest rates,” Chris Ingo, chief investment officer of core investments at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note.
“Yield curves have stabilized, but it is not clear that renewed inflation concerns automatically mean steeper curves,” the note added.
Investors now await the release of the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Prices index, the Fed’s preferred method of measuring inflation, on Friday.
On the central bank front, the Bank of Indonesia will hand down its policy decision later in the day, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand following a day later."
1417,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",Boom in China Firms Listing in the U.S. Comes to Sudden Halt,"(Bloomberg) -- At least three Chinese companies have put their plans to list in the U.S. on hold, heralding a slowdown in what’s been a record start to a year for initial public offerings by mainland and Hong Kong firms.
A bike-sharing platform, a podcaster and a cloud computing firm are among popular Chinese corporates holding off plans for a U.S. float, put off by recent market declines, souring investor sentiment toward fast-growth companies and lackluster debuts by peers like Waterdrop Inc.
Hello Inc., Ximalaya Inc. and Qiniu Ltd. are postponing plans to take orders from investors, even though the three had filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission well over two weeks ago. In the U.S., companies can kick off their roadshows two weeks after filing publicly and most typically stick to that timetable.
“The recent broad market selloff, combined with the correction of the IPO market since the beginning of last month when some new issuers tanked during their debuts, may make the market conditions less predictable for newcomers who are ‘physically’ ready -- meaning they have cleared all regulatory hurdles for IPO -- to get out of the door,” said Stephanie Tang, head of private equity for Greater China at law firm Hogan Lovells. “Some participants may choose to monitor the market for more stable conditions.”
The delays throw a wrench in a listings flood by Chinese and Hong Kong companies in the U.S. that already reached $7.1 billion year-to-date -- the fastest pace on record -- after booming in 2020. Demand for IPOs surged as a wave of global stimulus money, ultra-low interest rates and rallying stock markets lured investors despite Sino-American tensions and the continued risk of mainland stocks being kicked off U.S. exchanges.
READ: Stock Market’s Million Little Dramas Come Down to a Supply Glut
The S&P 500 Index capped its biggest two-week slide since February on Friday amid mounting investor concern over inflation and its impact on tech and other growth stocks. China’s CSI 300 Index remains in a technical correction, having fallen 10% from a February peak, while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed in the U.S., has slumped more than 30% from its high that month.
Waiting On
Hello, which offers a bike-sharing platform plus electric scooters for sale, has delayed its planned launch and is still undecided on its prospective valuation given rising investor caution about new shares, Bloomberg News has reported. It had been planning to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in the offering, although the final number will depend on valuations, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.
Online podcast and radio services startup Ximalaya and enterprise cloud services provider Qiniu have put their listings on hold after beginning to gauge investor interest at the end of April, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.
The sounding out of investors, or pre-marketing process, generally comes after filing for an IPO and before formal order-taking in a roadshow. Hello declined to comment while Qiniu didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Ximalaya’s IPO process is ongoing and the company will seek public listing at an appropriate time depending on market conditions, it said in response to questions.
Weak Debuts
The poor performance of recent Chinese debutants has also sapped investor confidence. Insurance tech firm Waterdrop has plunged 38% from its offer price since going public earlier this month. Onion Global Ltd., a lifestyle brand platform, has fallen more than 8% below its IPO price.
In fact, almost 59% or specifically 20 of the 34 Chinese firms that have listed in the U.S. this year are under water, data compiled by Bloomberg show, among them the two largest IPOs -- e-cigarette maker RLX Technology Inc. and online Q&A site Zhihu Inc. Of the ones that listed in 2020, just 40% are trading below their IPO prices.
The recent volatility in global markets has spooked U.S. companies as well. They have also been delaying floats or facing weak debuts.
For some, the current challenges faced by Chinese listing hopefuls are likely to be transitory, with the hotly-anticipated IPO of ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Inc., which has filed confidentially for a multibillion-dollar offering, set to prove the real test of investor appetite for the China story.
Apart from Hello and the two other firms that are said to delay IPO plans after kicking off their pre-marketing process, Chinese road freight transport platform ForU Worldwide Inc., which filed for a U.S. offering on May 13, and online education company Zhangmen Education Inc., which filed on May 19, are waiting in the wings though they have yet to pass the two-week hallmark.
“There is a natural strong growth in China which international investors will still want to invest in over the longer term,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer at the Global CIO Office in Singapore.

Stoddard, who advised on such situations as American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)'s $182 billion bailout and restructuring during the financial crisis of 2008, will be based in New York and focus on financial institutions globally.
A Bank of America spokesman confirmed the appointment.
Stoddard was group CFO at Aviva between 2014 and 2019, where he helped the UK insurer improve ratings and restructure businesses. After leaving Aviva, Stoddard worked as interim group CFO at Athora and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co.

Before moving to the insurance industry, Stoddard worked on deals and financing transactions at firms including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. 
At Blackstone, he worked on several deals around AIG's massive restructuring. In one of his assignments, he advised AIG to reject a $35 billion deal to sell its Asian life insurance business AIA to Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Plc after the buyer tried to cut the price. Instead, he advised AIG to pursue an IPO of the unit, raising some $20 billion.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 08:06PM ET</span>","At Epic v Apple's closing, judge probes implications of upending Apple's App Store","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) held unconventional closing arguments Monday in the antitrust trial between Epic Games and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), peppering both sides' attorneys for three hours about how far she could - and should - go to change Apple's App Store business.
App makers and regulators around the world are watching the trial and Gonzalez Rogers has hinted in sharp questions to Apple that she may be receptive to some of the ""Fortnite"" game creators' allegations that Apple misuses its control over the App Store and hurts developers.
Last week the federal judge said that Apple's App Store profits from game makers looked ""disproportionate"", but on Monday she questioned Epic on whether there was a way to address its concerns without forcing Apple to open the iPhone to rival app stores, as Epic has proposed.
That would be a sweeping change and ""courts don't run businesses,"" she said. She also noted the windfall that a change would mean for Epic, whose own efforts to start a competing paid app store were discussed during the trial.
""Let's be clear. Epic is here because if relief is granted, it goes from being a multi-billion-dollar company to a multi-trillion-dollar company. But it's not doing it out of the goodness of its heart,"" she said.
Epic's lawyer Gary Bornstein stuck to the request Epic has made since filing the case last year: Force Apple to open up the iPhone to competing app stores and bar it from requiring developers to use its in-app payment system. 
Gonzalez Rogers said that under Epic's proposed changes, it is likely the company would pay Apple nothing, a fact that ""concerned"" her throughout the trial.
Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney, who has driven the company's legal strategy and attended the entire trial, is ""attacking the fundamental way that Apple is generating revenue,"" Gonzalez Rogers said. ""There's a reasonable argument that (Apple is) using these profits to benefit the whole ecosystem.""
At times, Gonzalez Rogers questioned other issues, such as an Apple rule barring developers from using email addresses gathered from iPhone users to market ways to avoid Apple's in-app purchase system.
""Apple's hiding of that information in a way that is not directly reflected to the consumer seems to be anticompetitive,"" she said.
Throughout the day, Apple's attorneys argued that Epic's sweeping requests would make Apple just like the Android system, essentially decreasing consumer choice.

""Apple wants to keep its product differentiated,"" Apple attorney Veronica Moye said. Anyone who wants third-party app stores ""is free to go out and buy an Android device. The relief requested here is to force Apple to take a competing product off the market.""
To make her decision, the judge will have to wade through 4,500 pages of testimony, a process she said could take months.

Consequently, we think two major players in the shipping industry—Castor Maritime (CTRM) and Danaos (NYSE:DAC)—are well positioned to benefit. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) and Danaos Corporation (DAC) are two established players in the shipping industry. Based in Limassol, Cyprus, CTRM provides seaborne transportation services for dry bulk cargo, including iron ore, coal, grains, and steel products. Based in Piraeus, Greece, DAC owns and operates containerships across Australia, Asia, Europe, and the United States. Its principal business is the acquisition and operation of vessels.
Most shipping companies were hit severely by the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing restrictions and a contraction of international trade. However, because economies worldwide are resuming manufacturing and infrastructure activities, the demand for commodities, which are transported primarily by sea, is increasing. This is generating increased demand for shipping services. According to Globe Newswire, the global dry bulk shipping market is expected to grow at a 5.10% CAGR between 2020 - 2027. As a result, both DAC and CTRM should witness increasing demand for their services.
While DAC has gained 1,106.4% over the past nine months, CTRM has returned nearly 176%. In terms of past six months’ performance, DAC is again a clear winner with 344.5% returns versus CTRM’s 145.4%. But which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Monday, with the Nasdaq jumping more than 1% as a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields helped lift expensive stocks in sectors such as technology as investors attempt to gauge the trajectory of inflation. 
Among the 11 major S&P sectors, technology advanced 1.76% and communication services rose 1.84% as the top performing on the session, as yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond hit a two-week low, which also buoyed other richly-valued growth stocks.
Inflation concerns cooled for the time being as investors may be starting to view President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill as likely to be smaller, or unable to provide as big an economic boost, even after being pared down in size on Friday.
Bill Stone, chief investment officer, The Glenview Trust co in Louisville, Kentucky said growth stocks were likely getting a look on Monday due to the decline in yields. 
""It seems to be the continued bounce in a rotation back to growth, the top performing sectors today are all growth stocks,"" ""It's the continuing tug of war"" he said. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 186.14 points, or 0.54%, to 34,393.98, the S&P 500 gained 41.19 points, or 0.99%, to 4,197.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 190.18 points, or 1.41%, to 13,661.17.
Tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 1.33% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 2.29% on the day, were the biggest boosts to the benchmark S&P index. The sector has been among the worst performing for the month and year to date as inflation concerns have grown and bond yields have moved higher.

Equity markets have grown volatile in recent weeks as investors weigh strong economic data and fears that supply bottlenecks could lead to an extended stretch of higher prices, which would in turn force the Federal Reserve to scale back its massive monetary stimulus.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Tuesday he expects the inflation rate to be above 2% both this year and next but several Fed officials, including Bullard, continued to support the central bank's policy in separate remarks. 
After falling as much as 4% from its May 7 record closing high, the S&P 500 is now less than 1% off that level as investors begun to buy technology stocks that have come under pressure in a rising rate environment.
The release of U.S. personal consumption data on Thursday, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, will be a highlight of the economic data published this week.
Risk sentiment also improved as cryptocurrencies recovered some losses after a weekend selloff fueled by further signs of a Chinese crackdown on the emerging sector. Bitcoin added to gain late in the session after Elon Musk tweet about meeting with North American miners of the cryptocurrency.
 Cabot Oil & Gas  Corp (NYSE:COG) and  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) agreed to merge to form a U.S. oil and gas producer with an enterprise value of about $17 billion, the latest deal in a sector rebounding from one of its worst downturns.
Shares of Cabot (NYSE:CBT) and Cimarex both tumbled around 7% while the broader energy index climbed 0.99% as oil prices rose 3%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets gained on Monday while the dollar traded near four-month lows against major currencies as investors eye upcoming U.S. inflation readings for guidance on monetary policy.
Market participants were gearing up for U.S. personal consumption data - the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure - on Thursday, and a potential tapering of asset purchases in the face of strong economic data.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note dipped to one-week lows, while safe-haven gold inched higher.
""The market is taking a deep breath and is coming to terms with inflation,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York.

Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1% in slow trade. Japan's Nikkei added 0.2% and Chinese blue chips edged up 0.4%.
Emerging markets stocks fell 0.16% after Belarusian authorities on Sunday forced an airliner to land and arrested an opposition-minded journalist who was on board, drawing condemnation from Europe and the United States.
After the strong growth shown by Friday's surveys of the global services sectors, all eyes will be on U.S. personal consumption and inflation figures this week.
A high core inflation reading would ring alarm bells and could revive talk of an early tapering by the Federal Reserve.
""The market was afraid that the Fed will get behind the curve with tapering but that doesn't seem to be the case with commodity prices stabilizing,"" Hayes said.
The dollar index moved around the 90 mark, down 0.2% on the day in afternoon trading in New York, slightly above a four-month low of 89.646 on Friday. 
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.6046% from 1.632% late on Friday.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",Lordstown Motors says 2021 production will be half of expectations,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp said on Monday that 2021 production of its Endurance truck will be half of prior expectations and that the electric vehicle startup needs additional capital to execute its plans, sending shares down 9.5% in after-hours trading.
""Capital may limit our ability to make as many vehicles as we would like,"" Chief Executive Steve Burns said on a conference call. 
Lordstown is looking at options to raise more capital, including asset-backed financing and investments from strategic partners like other automakers, said Burns, who added the company is not for sale. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) owns a stake in Lordstown.
Burns said Endurance production this year will be limited and would be ""at best 50%"" of the company's prior expectations of 2,200 trucks. He said it was still on track for the September launch of the truck, with pre-production vehicle builds slated for July. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter.
The Ohio-based company blamed COVID-19 and industry-wide related issues that resulted in ""significantly higher than expected"" spending on parts, expedited shipping costs and third-party engineering resources.
Lordstown also said it was still pursuing a U.S. retooling loan from the U.S. Energy Department and hopes to complete that process in the ""next few months."" It previously said it was seeking a $200 million loan from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, which also awarded larger loans to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd to retool factories.
Lordstown's shares slumped in March after Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position on the electric pickup truck maker's stock, saying the company had misled consumers and investors.
Short sellers bet the price of a stock will fall by borrowing shares in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference.
Lordstown subsequently said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information related to its merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) DiamondPeak Holdings and preorders of its vehicles. Burns said on Monday the company was still cooperating with the agency's investigation.
The Ohio-based company said in January it had received more than 100,000 nonbinding production reservations from commercial fleets for its trucks. Hindenburg subsequently said those orders were ""largely fictitious"" and were meant to help raise capital and confer legitimacy.
Lordstown's board of directors formed a special committee to review the matters raised by Hindenburg. CEO Burns said Monday the investigation is ongoing and the company will respond by the end of the second quarter.
Several EV makers over the past year have gone public via mergers with SPACs, bypassing the rigorous scrutiny of a traditional initial public offering process and riding on Tesla's share price rally. 
Lordstown's shares fell last week after Ford introduced its electric F-150 pickup, the Lightning, and said it would initially target the same commercial customers Lordstown is aiming to attract.

Burns said it has begun work on its second vehicle, an all-electric van, and will show a prototype this summer.
On Monday, Lordstown reported a first-quarter loss of $125.2 million, or 72 cents a share, wider than the 28-cents-per-share loss expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",U.S. chip funding could result in seven to 10 new factories - officials,"By David Shepardson
MANASSAS, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday a proposed $52 billion boost in U.S. government funding for semiconductor production and research could result in seven to 10 new U.S. factories.
Raimondo said at an event outside a Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) chip factory that she anticipated the government funding would generate ""$150 billion-plus"" in investment in chip production and research - including contributions from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.
""We just need the federal money ... to unlock private capital,"" Raimondo said, adding, ""it could be seven, could be eight, could be nine, could be 10 new factories in America by the time we're done.""
She said she expected states will compete for federal funding for chip facilities and that the Commerce department would have a transparent process for awarding funding.
A global shortage of seminconductor chips, caused by factors including a rise in demand for electronic devices during the pandemic, has affected automakers and other industries. Automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have cut production this year due to the shortage.
U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said at Monday's event he thought the funds could result in ""seven to 10"" new fabrication plants. ""This is not going to solve this overnight,"" Warner said. ""It will take years for the Commerce Department to make these investments.""
Last week, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer unveiled revised bipartisan legislation to spend $52 billion for U.S. semiconductor chip production and research over five years.
Supporters of funding note the United States had a 37% share of semiconductors and microelectronics production in 1990; today just 12% of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States.
As first reported by Reuters, the bill includes $39 billion in production and R&D incentives and $10.5 billion to implement programs including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Manufacturing Program and other R&D programs.
Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who also took part in the joint event, has filed an amendment to remove prevailing wage provisions from the bill and said he wanted a vote on his amendment, saying the wage issue was jeopardizing Republican support.
""I don't expect this is going to stop our achieving what we want to achieve,"" Cornyn told Reuters, referring to the wage issue. ""It's important but I think getting the Chips for America Act passed is essential.""

He said China had left the United States no option but to make such investments. ""This is a vulnerability we must fix.""
Last month, Ford Motor warned the chip shortage might slash its second-quarter production by half, costing it about $2.5 billion and about 1.1 million units of lost production in 2021.

As such, we believe investors must exercise caution and avoid betting on WSB stocks Canoo (GOEV) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE) in the near-term because they look highly overvalued and could be due for further retreats. So, let’s discuss these two names.The growing excitement among investors about the automotive sector going electric was reflected in the impressive rally by electric vehicle (EV) stocks in 2020. Improved automotive performance, government subsidies, and cost-efficiencies have been motivating consumers to switch to EVs. As a result, the booming EV space has been spawning new companies, arguably overcrowding the industry.
Hence, investors must acknowledge that not all the players in this booming market possess sound fundamentals. In fact, the stock prices of many EV players have been witnessing a correction this year due to investors’ concerns over the industry’s overvaluation and production delays due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. Furthermore, investors should take a judicious approach following the huge success of Reddit’s online forum r/wallstreetbets (WSB), which largely targets struggling businesses and gains from them by squeezing short sellers out of their positions. The fundamental weaknesses in most of Reddit plays have caused the short squeezes to be short lived, with the stocks declining quickly after reaching their highs.
Hence, considering the clear disconnect between the fundamentals and price levels of highly speculative Reddit favorites Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (RIDE), we think it’s wise to avoid them now. These stocks have witnessed significant price declines lately and are susceptible to further pullbacks.

Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) was down about 8% in afterhours trading. 
""Expected Endurance production in 2021 will be limited and would at best be 50% of our prior expectations,"" the company said, adding that it would need to raise funds to execute on its strategy.

The company revised upward its 2021 expectations for operating expenses by $115 million at the midpoint of the guidance range provided in its fourth quarter 2020 earnings release to reflect significantly higher spending.
""[W]e have encountered some challenges, including COVID-related and industry-wide related issues, as we progress towards our start of production deadline.

So, we think leading players in this space—Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (TGT), Albertsons (ACI), and Macy’s (M)—are uniquely positioned to benefit, and as such are worth more than a second look by investors. Read on.As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic wane and the U.S. economy recovers faster than expected, retail sales are returning to pre-pandemic levels. An accelerated vaccine rollout, improving job market, and federal stimulus checks have been driving a substantial surge in consumer spending. Although this is fueling a rise in inflation as manufacturers pass cost increases onto customers, it is expected to be short-lived. Investors’ confidence in the retail industry is evident in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 15% returns over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 6.4% gains over this period.
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, consumer spending increased 4.2% in March, after falling 1% in February. Since approximately one third of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, increasing numbers of people are resuming out-of-home activities and returning to a pre-pandemic lifestyle. As a result, retail store traffic is gaining significant momentum.
Since a surge in income is expected to further boost consumer spending, retailers Walmart Inc. (WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Albertsons Companies, Inc. (ACI), and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) could emerge stronger with solid financials. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

Investing.com –The S&P 500 climbed Monday as tech continued its rebound and reopening stocks rallied amid easing pandemic restrictions as Covid-19 cases in the U.S. hit their lowest since the pandemic began.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.69%, or 235 points, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.62%.
The reopening trade - bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – underpinned by further progress on the reopening and signs the vaccine rollout is slowing cases.
President Joe Biden is set to sign a bill, which was passed in the Senate last week, that will allow cruise lines to resume operations in Alaska.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) rose nearly 3%,  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) was up 4% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) was up about 4%. Other reopening stocks including MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) were also higher.
Also contributing to positive sentiment on the reopening, New York City will allow all children to return in-school learning in September.
Energy, meanwhile, was boosted by oil prices even as an Iran nuclear deal draws closer, which experts say could result in global crude supply increasing by up to 2 million barrels per day. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasts Brent prices could reach $80 a barrel by the fourth quarter.
The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) was up more than 1%, with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) among the biggest gainers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were up more than 1%.
The Epic versus Apple battle entered its final day in court, with Judge Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) expected to deliver his ruling - on Epic’s claim that Apple's Appstore practices are anti-completive – in the coming months.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, was also in demand, rising more than 5% after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) initiated coverage on the stock with an equal-weight rating and $590 price target, citing better expectations for deliveries.  
Investors appear to be warming up to the narrative that the rapid pace of inflation will prove to be transitory, helping to ease fears the Federal Reserve will be forced to rein in its loose monetary policy measures sooner than many expect.
Broader sentiment on risk was also helped by a sharp rebound in cryptocurrencies following another selloff this weekend. Crypto-related names including MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) were also higher.
In other news, Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) surged 27% after completing its maiden spaceflight test over the weekend."

These stocks are benefitting from increased store traffic and strong consumer spending. 3 small-cap retailers that investors should consider are Haverty Furniture (NYSE:HVT), The Container Store (TCS), and Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH).In the current market environment, investors must remain cautious and selective when picking stocks. Though the Dow Jones and S&P 500 continue to remain strong, with both indices just a couple of percentage points away from their all-time highs, the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have been experiencing more significant pullbacks. 
And over the last month, the percent of stocks in the S&P 500 trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped from above 90% to 72%. Similarly, the number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange making new highs has dropped from averaging above 400 to around 100 over the last month. 
With this in mind, I believe one industry that investors should watch is the retail industry. Retail companies are benefiting from stimulus payments and the economy reopening and should continue to outperform in 2021. Further, many retailers posted strong Q1 results and issued guidance above expectations. 3 small-cap retailers that investors should consider are Haverty Furniture (HVT), The Container Store (TCS), and Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH).

Because rising inflation and high Treasury yields now make pricey growth stocks risky bets, we think it could be wise to bet on  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX),  Arrow Electronics  (NYSE:ARW), Albertsons (ACI), and Huntington (HII). These companies possess solid growth potential but are trading at discounts to their peers. Read on.The stock market has continued its rally so far this year, except for a few stocks that have retreated. However, the fundamental difference between this year’s rally and last year’s is that the broader economy is not significantly disconnected to the stock market this year. Because the economic recovery this year is a solid support for the stock market, investors are rotating to undervalued turnaround candidates that lagged the broader market last year due to lack of support from the economy and respective industry trends. Concern over rising inflation is another motivator for investors to shift away from expensive growth stocks. 
This trend is evident in the Vanguard Value ETF’s (VTV) 17.1% returns year-to-date compared to the Vanguard Growth ETF’s (VUG) 4.7% gains.
The continued reopening of the economy on the back of a strong vaccination drive is expected to keep driving demand in various industries that struggled amid the pandemic, helping their stocks attract investors. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on POSCO (PKX), Arrow Electronics, Inc. (ARW), Albertsons Companies, Inc. (ACI), and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII). They are all well positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery and are currently trading at discounts to their peers.

So, we think it wise to invest in undervalued tech stocks  Teradata  (TDC), NetScout (NTCT), and Plantronics (NYSE:POLY) (PLT), which hold immense growth potential. Read on for details.After a remarkable run last year, most tech stocks plunged sharply this year as the economic recovery caused investors to shift their focus to cyclical stocks. Fears over rising inflation and Treasury yields have led investors to rotate away from expensive tech stocks. Tech stocks’ weakness is evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 0.1% gains over the past three months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 6.4% returns.
However, the sector still holds solid growth attributes. Because the world continues to depend on technology in myriad ways, companies in this space are well positioned to benefit. The increased use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G technology, for example, will drive the sector’s growth in the coming months.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC), NetScout Systems, Inc. (NTCT), and Plantronics, Inc. (PLT). They are currently trading at deep discounts considering their immense growth potential.

Peloton has emerged as a pandemic winner as home workouts became popular during the prolonged coronavirus-led lockdowns. 
The factory will be the latest addition to the company's growing global manufacturing network, which includes third-party partners in Asia and Peloton's own facilities, the company said.
Peloton said it would commit about $400 million to the facility and add more than 2,000 jobs over the next few years.
""The new Peloton Output Park gives us a massive strategic lever to make sure we have capacity, quality, and economies of scale in our bike and tread product lines,"" said Chief Executive Officer John Foley.
The factory in Troy Township, Wood County will produce its flagship Peloton Bike as well as the Bike+ and Peloton Tread.

Shares of the exercise equipment maker pared early declines of as much as 2.8% after the news and is down about 1% in afternoon trade.
Peloton's stock has fallen 34% this year as the company in May recalled its treadmills and forecast hit to current-quarter revenue after reports of multiple injuries and the death of a child in an accident.

However, because the company has cut its dividend because of the deal, will T be able to retain investors’ interest in its stock? Let’s find out.Investors’ optimism surrounding the proposed spin-off of AT&T Inc.’s (T) WarnerMedia to Discovery, Inc.

However, most investor interest fizzled out as soon as investors realized that the deal comes with a proposed dividend cut. Following the transaction with DISCA, T’s dividend payout ratio is expected to be in the low 40% range, and its annual revenue growth is expected to be in low single digits CAGR.
As a result, the stock is currently trading 11.4% below its 52-week high. Income-focused investors especially were disappointed by the dividend-cut news.

So, let’s evaluate these names more closely.Department stores have been seeing an increase in foot traffic over the past few months, which has contributed significantly to impressive retail sales data. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s advance estimates, total retail sales for the February 2021 -April 2021 period were up 27.1% year-over-year.

With the United States now ahead of its vaccination schedule, the reopening of the nation’s economy is driving increased demand for apparel, accessories and cosmetics, among other discretionary goods. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have already announced their plans this month to lift most of the states’ capacity restrictions, which could provide a further boost to department stores’ sales. In fact, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), retail sales are expected to exceed a $4.33 trillion valuation in 2021.

Investing –  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares rose more than 2% Monday as the company sought to strengthen its global presence as a key supplier of Covid-19 vaccines by expanding its agreement with Aldevron, its existing supplier of plasmid DNA.
Moderna and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX) Covid-19 vaccines, based on mRNA technology, have been found to be most efficient in developing antibodies against the coronavirus.
Aldevron’s production of DNA is already taking place in its 70,000 square foot facility in Fargo, North Dakota. Buildout and validation of an additional 189,000 square foot expansion has been completed, enabling additional manufacturing capacity.
The company, founded in 1998, will supply plasmid DNA to serve as the genetic template for generating the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and other investigational programs in Moderna’s pipeline.
Aldevron provides critical nucleic acids and proteins used to make gene and cell therapies. It is a leading provider of high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and recombinant proteins necessary for vaccines, gene and cell therapy, gene editing and diagnostic applications.
Moderna has forecast supplying 800 million to 1 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 with another 2 billion doses to be supplied in 2021, the production coming from its own and partners’ facilities.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Next month's Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona is shaping up as an early test of how quickly the global business events industry will bounce back from the pandemic, with a range of hi-tech solutions being rolled out to try to keep visitors safe.
The normally annual event - which was cancelled last year - is one of the world's biggest industry conferences, typically attracting around 100,000 attendees as telecoms companies show off their latest products and executives meet to do deals.
While organisers will offer online access for people who want to stay away, they are hoping to welcome thousands of attendees from across the world, including from countries where the pandemic is still raging. 
There will be regular rapid COVID-19 tests, a digital badge that will give access to the venue, and a contact-tracing app if there are any infections. 
Live monitoring of the site will allow organisers to regulate the number of people in any given area, while attendees will have to wear face masks and keep to one-way routes. 
""We feel now is the time to resurface again and to do a comeback show, while knowing that it's not going to be the same type of show as before, but it's at least a start,"" said Mats Granryd, director general of telecom carriers association GSMA, which organises the MWC.
The Spanish government is on board. It has agreed to special arrangements to allow attendees from countries where travel restrictions are still in force. Spain itself reported 33 COVID-19 deaths on Friday, the lowest figure since August.
But holding the event remains a gamble for the GSMA. Major companies including Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Samsung (KS:005930) won't be attending in-person, and attendance is expected to be less than half the 100,000 of a normal year.
""Talking to people in the industry, there is a real desire to get back to physical events, but it is all about timing,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""We'll find out in coming weeks whether the GSMA has made the correct decision.""
Cancellation of last year's event was a big blow for the GSMA and forced it to lay off about 40% of its employees. Sub-par attendance, or another cancellation, would mean more pain.
A successful show, on the other hand, could offer a model for other event organisers looking to get their businesses back on track.
FACE-TO-FACE
The GSMA decided in mid-January to go ahead with the MWC in Barcelona, with a rescheduled February event in Shanghai as a warm-up.
""Shanghai was in a way a test bed. Is it possible to have a big show with face masks, with social distancing, with testing beforehand? It was, and we had zero cases,"" Granryd said.
""It was really after Shanghai, I think, we felt confident that we are able to pull it off.""
About 25,000 people attended MWC Shanghai this year and more than 100,000 watched presentations online. That was one of the GSMA's first hybrid events, with online and in-person access.
The MWC's online platform will be integrated with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products, allowing attendees to connect in video conference meeting rooms.
But sometimes there is no substitute for face-to-face meetings, Granryd said.
""We can build trust to some extent over virtual meetings, but not if it's a deal worth billions, then you need to sit down and look each other in the eye, and that is the reason why we feel confident that this will be something,"" he said.
GRABBING THE LIMELIGHT
While some worry the absence of big names will reduce the conference's appeal, smaller companies are looking to grab the limelight. Over 400 startups will exhibit their latest products at the MWC. 
""This is an unique opportunity for the smaller vendors to rise up and get their message out and maybe become a big vendor in the future,"" said Danielle Royston, founder of cloud consultancy firm TelcoDR.
Royston scooped up one of the biggest exhibition stands, measuring 6,000 square metres, after Ericsson pulled out.

TelcoDR, which got the stand at a reduced rate but still paid millions of dollars, will have 30 startups which it advises and/or invests in showcasing their products at the booth.
""This is your chance as a small vendor,"" she said. ""We go back to the old way, next year.""

(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc and rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Monday launched COVID-19 vaccine ride programs in partnership with the White House, offering Americans free rides or discounts for their trips to and from a vaccination site.
Customers who have booked a vaccine appointment can request a ride through the Uber (NYSE:UBER) app and either incur no charges if the trip costs less than $25, or receive a $25 discount for their journey, the company said.
With two of the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States requiring two separate shots, Uber would pay a maximum of $100 per passenger under the program. A company spokesman said Uber does not have an estimate for the number of vaccine rides it expects to provide.
Lyft said it would provide a $15 discount for one round trip, for a total discount of $30 per passenger.
Drivers will receive the full payment for the trip, the companies said.
U.S. President Joe Biden two weeks ago announced the partnership with Uber and its rival Lyft Inc in an effort to boost COVID-19 vaccination rates at a time when U.S. demand for vaccines has declined.
Many states are offering incentives, from free food and drinks to a chance at winning a lottery, in order to get more Americans to roll up their sleeves for a COVID-19 shot.

Biden has set a target of getting 70% of U.S. adults inoculated by July 4 so the country can be safely reopened for celebrations and small Independence Day holiday gatherings. As of Sunday, 49% of Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
For Uber and Lyft, the vaccine efforts also come as the companies seek to have drivers and riders return to the road and recover revenue lost during the pandemic.

Read on.Based in Beijing, China, TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) offers tutoring services to after-school K-12 students in China. Its shares have declined 40% year-to-date and 31.9% over the past month because of Chinese government’s efforts to curb the explosive growth of private tutoring services providers.

TAL is currently trading 52.8% below its $90.96, 52-week high, which it hit on February 16.
Even though the company has been able to increase its total student enrollments year-over-year, its staggering losses and premium valuation could cause the stock to suffer further downside.

(Reuters) -FirstGroup's biggest investor on Monday renewed its demand shareholders of the London-listed transport operator reject the company's sale of two North American bus businesses, and proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis joined in the opposition. 
The $4.6 billion sale of First Student and First Transit including debt to Swedish private equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) Infrastructure has triggered a shareholder rebellion after Coast Capital, FirstGroup's top investor, opposed the deal.
""Unless the deal terms are materially improved upon, along with proposed use of proceeds, Coast Capital urges its fellow investors to vote against this destructive proposal,"" the activist investor, with a 14% stake in the British company, said in its latest statement.
Coast Capital also stepped up its criticism with a rebuttal of the arguments presented by FirstGroup on the deal's financial details and questioned whether the board was behaving responsibly towards its shareholders.
FirstGroup Chairman David Martin said the deal was credible and executable. ""The process is entirely in line with market practice ... and the board fully complies with its fiduciary responsibilities at all times,"" he said in an emailed statement. 
""Shareholders have waited long enough for change ... The transaction delivers the strategy we publicly set out,"" Martin added.
EQT also backed the deal, and said it was struck when debt and equity markets were trading at all-time highs, supporting robust valuations.
While EQT said it respected shareholders' right to decide for themselves, the group was ""an ideal counterparty"" for the deal. 
Shares of FTSE 250-listed FirstGroup were more than 2% higher at 85.55 pence by 1545 GMT.
DEAL OR NO DEAL
Proxy advisory group and analysts are divided.
Glass Lewis has recommended that investors vote against the deal at a meeting set for Thursday. 
However, ISS, IVIS and PIRC have advised shareholders to support the deal, FirstGroup said on Friday.
""We tend to agree with Coast when it says any sale or carve out of these U.S. businesses would be better done after a return to normalcy in the U.S.,"" Glass Lewis said.
On the other hand, ISS said in the absence of a competing bid, it proposed a ""cautionary support"" for the EQT offer, recognising that it was supported by ""sound strategic rationale"" and FirstGroup's ""comprehensive"" sale process.

Analysts at Peel Hunt, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), RBC Capital Markets and UBS have found merits in the deal. 
It also faces opposition from  Schroders  (LON:SDR), FirstGroup's second-largest shareholder. However, the deal is being supported by the company's third-largest shareholder, Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Monday that media lawyer Kimberley Harris would become its newest board member, a move that means nearly half of the Wall Street bank's board of directors will be women. 
Harris is NBCUniversal Media's general counsel and an executive vice president at the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 
Her appointment comes as banks face growing calls to add diverse and women candidates to their top rungs of leadership. 
The financial industry is almost entirely run by men, although a handful of women have broken through to executive ranks in recent years. Last September, Jane Fraser became the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank when she was named chief executive of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
Goldman has publicly set specific internal targets aimed at hiring and promoting more women into its senior ranks. 
Last August, bank management said that by 2025 they want 40% of Goldman vice presidents to be female. That followed a goal set in 2019 that half of new analysts and entry-level associates hired at the bank in the United States be women.
In 2020, Goldman said it would only help take a company public if that company's board had at least one diverse board member, such as a woman.
On Goldman's own board, Harris' appointment means that six of 13 directors are women.
By comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s board has 10 directors, including four women, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s board has 16 directors, including six women. 

Prior to her work at NBCUniversal and Comcast, Harris was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. She also worked as senior counsel to the assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, and during President Barack Obama's administration, she was principal deputy counsel and deputy assistant to the president. 
Among her duties as board member, Harris will sit on Goldman's governance, compensation and public responsibilities committees.

Trading activity was subdued with markets in Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Norway, Switzerland and Germany closed for a holiday. 
UK's Cineworld Group Plc rose 3.2% after animated adventure comedy ""Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway"" pulled in more people than expected after a months-long COVID-19 lockdown.
Helping sentiment, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Friday it was still too early to discuss policy after the end of its 1.85 trillion euro ($2.3 trillion) emergency bond purchase scheme.
Her comments followed calls by some colleagues to consider tapering. The central bank is set to meet early next month to discuss its policy. 
The STOXX 600 ended last week marginally higher despite worries about inflation as a survey showed euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over three years in May.
There were some concerns as Germany's public health institute declared Britain and Northern Ireland a virus variant region, requiring anyone entering the country from the United Kingdom to quarantine for two weeks on arrival.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions.
Some companies have argued that protecting executive pay in a downturn is necessary to keep top managers incentivized, given the crucial role they play in steering their business. That idea has been increasingly met with skepticism from investors who say that the shifting of performance goalposts is unwarranted and demoralizes employees who are not shielded in the same way.
A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year. That number is set to rise as more executives face votes in the coming weeks, according to ISS Corporate Solutions. Investors voted down a total of 12 CEO pay plans in 2020.
""We still have 200 or more meetings to go, and we are likely to see more failures,"" said Brian Johnson, an executive director at ISS Corporate Solutions. 
The record was reached last week, when 53% of shareholders invested in oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co voted down CEO Jeff Miller's $22.3 million pay plan, which is roughly $10 million more than he earned in 2019. 
Cruise ship operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd also faced a defeat from its investors on executive pay plans on Thursday, according to a securities filing.
Investors this year have also rejected executive pay plans at industrial company  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, coffee retailer  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and chip maker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). 
Losing the shareholder vote can put pressure on corporate boards and executives to negotiate new pay deals. Roughly two years ago, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co renegotiated the compensation of its chief executive at the time, Bob Iger, to toughen his performance targets after shareholders voted down his pay.
Roughly 10.6% of companies changed short-term incentive programs in the pay plans, and 3.3% adjusted long-term awards, ISS Corporate Solutions found, bolstering executive pay in many cases.
In most years, ""investors almost uniformly reject those changes because you're completely disrupting the link between pay and performance,"" Johnson said.

Pay plans at companies that underperformed financially, such as Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, were also rejected by investors, Johnson said. 
ISS Corporate Solutions found that automobile and auto part makers, real estate firms and technology hardware and equipment companies changed pay the most during the year compared to other industries.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan will meet executives from some 20 large U.S. companies on Wednesday to discuss investing in Turkey, three sources told Reuters, with one saying it was meant as a prelude to a June meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.
The sources, with knowledge of the May 26 conference call, said it was organised by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Turkish presidency's investment office, the Turkish Embassy and the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB).
An industry source said the call was being organised in anticipation of a planned meeting on June 14 between Biden and Erdogan on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels, their first in-person encounter since the U.S. election last November. 
Another source familiar with the call said the U.S. government was not involved in planning the call. 
It was unclear which companies would attend. 
""It is a way to test the waters with U.S. companies, (a) kind of preliminary work prior to a face-to-face meeting with Biden,"" the first source, who was from industry and like others requested anonymity, told Reuters.
Ankara ""wants the domestic and international audience to get the message that basically says Turkey is an important partner,"" the person added. 
A fourth informed source said executives from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would attend the call. Representatives of both companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman said via email: ""This meeting is private and off the record, so we are not able to provide any details.""
The Turkish presidency's Investment Agency and TOBB declined comment. The presidency, the Turkish Embassy in Washington and the U.S. Chamber did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Biden has kept his distance from Erdogan since taking office and, in a pivot from predecessor Donald Trump, his administration has criticised Ankara's human rights record.
The leaders have held only one call, on April 23, when the NATO meeting was scheduled and when Biden told Erdogan that the White House would call the Ottoman massacre of Armenians a century ago a genocide, a move that drew Turkish condemnation.
A third source said top executives from the companies, including some chief executives, would be on the call during which Erdogan was expected to give a speech and take questions about investment and business in Turkey. 
The call was set for around 1500 GMT on Wednesday, the person said. 

U.S.-Turkish trade reached about $21 billion in 2019 and the NATO allies have said they aim to lift that to $100 billion. 
Yet there are hurdles including U.S. tariffs on Turkish steel and Ankara's purchase of Russian missile defences in 2019, which prompted the Trump administration to oust Turkey from a consortium producing F-35 jets.

Investing – Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) shares fell 3% Monday after UBS reiterated its sell rating and price target on the stock, given adoption of the company’s fitness app has fallen for three consecutive months in the U.S.
UBS analyst Eric Sheridan’s $74 target for the stock is 25% lower than its current level of $99.
The popularity of the company’s fitness equipment and the app has taken a hit since the death of a child last month raised safety concerns around its Tread+, forcing the U.S. consumer safety regulator to ask consumers to stop using the treadmill if there are small children or pets at home.
Concerns around the equipment had been raised earlier as well. After much dithering and defense of the safety of its equipment, public outcry and pressure from the authorities, the company felt compelled to recall its Tread+ and Tread treadmills early this month.
According to StreetInsider, UBS Evidence Lab data appears to show that adoption level of the Peloton digital app in the U.S. is down three to four percentage points year-on-year in April and is down one percentage point more in May. Share of downloads started the year-on-year decline in March.
As of January this year, that share of downloads stood at 6.4% and has been declining sequentially to now closer to 2.9% share.
The report noted Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT), the top workout app in the U.S., has nearly quadrupled its share of downloads from 6% in May 2020 at the height of the pandemic.

Since the wallstreetbets’ short squeeze saga has now abated considerably, analysts believe three of the most heavily discussed Reddit stocks—Palantir Technologies (PLTR), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Virgin Galactic (SPCE)—will witness massive corrections in the near term. So, we think it’s wise to liquidate one’s investments in them as quickly as possible. Let’s take a closer look.Market participants appear pleased with the U.S. government’s stimulus measures and improving economic data. Consequently, the stock market is continuing its incredible rally this year, except for a few short-term pullbacks. However, as consumer spending steadily returns to pre-pandemic levels, rising inflation has started to worry investors.
Though the Fed views any rise in inflation as temporary, economists fear that rising inflation might force the central bank to tighten its policies earlier than expected. Adding to this concern, some retail investors are speculating that wealthy investors have started to take profits now, ahead of the government's proposed increase in capital gains taxes. As such, some investors are rotating away from equity to safer and fixed-income assets. Consequently, overheated stocks, especially in the tech space, have already started witnessing a correction.
The short squeeze frenzy triggered by millennial investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets (WSB) chatroom has piqued the interest of retail investors and Wall Street analysts in following the stocks discussed on the forum. Because WSB favorite stocks usually possess weak fundamentals, analysts are pessimistic on the prospects for Palantir Technologies (PLTR), DraftKings Inc. (DKNG), and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SPCE). We believe a much-anticipated market sell-off may bring them back to earth soon. So, it’s wise to get rid of these stocks now.

CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Automakers  Renault  (PA:RENA), its alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co face temporary factory closures in India due to growing unrest among workers concerned about rising COVID-19 infections.
Workers at Renault-Nissan's car plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu will go on strike on Wednesday because their COVID-related safety demands have not been met, a union representing the workers told the company in a letter on Monday.
Hyundai said it would suspend operations at its plant, also in Tamil Nadu, for five days starting Tuesday, after several workers staged a brief, sit-in protest on Monday amid rising cases in the state.
""The management agreed to close the plant after workers expressed concerns over safety after two employees succumbed to COVID,"" E. Muthukumar, president of the Hyundai Motor India Employees Union, told Reuters.
The unrest highlights the challenges companies face in India amid a huge wave of COVID-19 infections, an overwhelmed health system and a shortage of vaccines which is making employees more fearful.
Tamil Nadu is one of the worst hit states with more than 30,000 cases a day last week. The state, an auto hub known as India's Detroit, has imposed a lockdown until May 31 but allowed some factories, including auto plants, to continue operating.
The strike threat at the Renault-Nissan plant came ahead of a court hearing on Monday over allegations from workers that social distancing norms were being flouted and factory health policies did not sufficiently address the risk to lives.
Renault-Nissan has said it is following COVID-19 safety protocols.
At the hearing, a lawyer for the workers argued that while the company had reduced the number of shifts, production numbers had not been cut and the headcount remained the same leading to crowding on the factory floor.
The company told the court it had reduced the workforce to around 5,000 from 8,000. It also said it had vaccinated employees over 45 and was willing to inoculate those under 45 if vaccines were made available.
The two-judge bench presiding over the case said that while the health of workers is paramount, if industries go down there will be no place for them to work. They also said the company must not take advantage of the exemption granted by the state and should reduce production to meet only necessary export orders.
""The production should have fallen ... You also have to assuage the feeling of the workers,"" said the court, which will next hear the case on May 31.
The union, which represents about 3,500 workers at the plant, said in its May 24 letter to Renault-Nissan that workers would not return until they felt safe. 

The workers' demands include lower production so there is better social distancing, vaccinations and higher insurance cover to include medical expenses for their families.
Nissan, which owns a majority stake in the plant, declined to comment.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>","With electrification, Nissan's Gupta sees new spark for Renault tie-up","By Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co will standardise and share electric-vehicle components with alliance partner  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), the Japanese automaker's chief operating officer (COO) said, describing electrification as the partnership's new lynchpin.
The Franco-Japanese alliance, which also includes junior member Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp, was strained in the aftermath of the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has provided an impetus to rebuild the collaboration, and the companies have looked to standardise parts and platforms to cut costs.
Nissan has already been sharing common platforms, powertrains and components with Renault (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi, but those efforts have ""reached the maximum we should do,"" Ashwani Gupta, Nissan's COO, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
""That's why we are shifting the gear of further synergies using electrification as the main pillar,"" he said.
The focus will be on sharing batteries, electric powertrains and electronic architecture, he said, adding that adopting a uniform standard across the alliance would ""contribute significantly"" to economies of scale.
Gupta said electrification would not pose a supply challenge because of Nissan's global sourcing of components. He said it had battery sourcing in China, Japan, Europe and the United States.
Together the alliance sold more than 7.8 million cars last year, down about 23% from 2019 as the companies were hit by the pandemic.
The push to share more of the work on electric vehicles (EVs) illustrates the scope of the challenge facing automakers everywhere, as the industry is being transformed by fast-moving technology.
Ford has a strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), under which Ford will use its German partner's MEB electric vehicle platform to build some models.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has expanded ties with companies including Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp and Chinese battery and automaker BYD to jointly develop EVs, while Honda Motor Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will introduce two jointly developed large-sized EV models using GM's Ultium batteries in 2024.
BATTERY HURDLES
Nissan, one of the world's first car makers to embrace fully EVs with its Leaf model, will share the platform of its upcoming all-electric Ariya SUV with Renault. 
Batteries are one of the costliest components of EVs, with raw materials accounting for the largest part of the cost. Yet battery development has been one of the weaker points of the more than 20-year alliance, with both Nissan and Renault sourcing batteries separately.
Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo said this month the two companies are in talks to collaborate more by using the same battery technology, and Gupta said on Friday they have agreed on the common specifications of batteries.

Gupta also said that while keeping the distinctiveness of each brand was important in the alliance, the automakers would share ""to eliminate the duplication of resources"".
Nissan, Japan's number three automaker by sales, has said it will electrify all new models in key markets by the early 2030s. It expects yearly sales of more than one million electrified vehicles by the end of fiscal 2023.

Alaska cruises on Norwegian Bliss sailing from Seattle will mark the resumption of the services that have remained shut for well over a year even as most other businesses have reopened.
The reopening is still contingent on Norwegian obtaining a conditional sailing certificate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure Covid-19 safety protocol is followed by all.
Voyages will operate with all guests and crew required to be fully vaccinated, along with the implementation of CDC and the company’s safety guidelines.
The company continues to expect a phased-in approach to reintroducing additional vessels across its three brands, namely Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

Centessa is offering 15 million American depositary shares (ADSs), each representing one ordinary share, for a price between $18 and $20 per ADS. At the top end of the range, the IPO would rake in $300 million.

The firm also gave the stock its lowest price target. Shares of Dollar General have been historically negatively correlated with retail gasoline prices going higher, as they are now, according to analyst Robert Ohmes as he downgraded Dollar General from neutral, Bloomberg reported.  
The company has a high valuation amid expected pressure from higher wages and promotions at grocery stores, as well as increased traffic to gas station convenience stores. Rivals including Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and traditional grocery chains that count on a high online penetration could also hurt.

Dollar General is down 8% from a record hit in November. The stock gained as revenue and profit rose during the pandemic but that is beginning to unwind in the U.S. Post-Covid, employers are scrambling to find workers, offering bonuses and higher wages as stores, restaurants and pretty much everything returns to the status quo.

That's why David Cohne is recommending Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and HP (HPQ), three top-rated stocks down from their highs.Six of the past eight trading days have ended in the red, driven by fears of inflation. Last week, the market was startled by the news that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) posted its largest month-over-month increase since 2009. Making matters worse was that CPI also had its largest year-over-year rise since 2008.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, also rose 0.9% in April, the most since 1982. Inflation weighs heavily on both growth and value stocks. Higher inflation discounts a growth stock’s present value and raises the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates, which harms cyclical stocks. In the Fed’s minutes, we also just learned that it was considering taking action to tackle high inflation.

LONDON (Reuters) -Belarus government bonds tumbled back to the lows of last year's political crisis on Monday, after authorities forced an airliner to land on Sunday, arresting a journalist on board and drawing condemnation from Europe and the United States.
The moves came with Western leaders threatening sanctions over Sunday's incident, in which a Belarusian warplane forced a flight between Greece and Lithuania to land in Minsk, where a dissident journalist, Roman Protasevich, was arrested.
The 2030 and 2026 bonds slumped more than 4 cents before recovering some ground although they were still heading for their biggest drop since a disputed election in 2020 caused widespread protests. 
Spreads of Belarus government bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries also blew out by 61 basis points to 627 bps from Friday's levels on the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) closely followed emerging market bond index (EMBI global diversified). 
EU leaders are set to discuss additional sanctions at a summit in Brussels with some leaders describing the grounding as a hijacking.
""It is really difficult to comprehend the move"" said Viktor Szabo, portfolio manager at fund manager ABRDN which had held the bonds. ""There is a European summit coming up in Brussels and that will be a perfect opportunity to address the issue."" 
Belarus has long been in the cross hairs over its human rights record. The EU first imposed sanctions on Belarus in 2004 and tightened them in 2011 over abuses of human rights and democratic standards, including vote-rigging.
The disputed August 2020 election and a crackdown on protests prompted Brussels - along with the U.S., Britain and Canada - to slap asset freezes and travel bans on near-90 officials, including long-serving and Russia-ally President Alexander Lukashenko.
""We thought there was a chance of a peaceful transition away from Lukashenko... but clearly now that chance has fallen off a cliff,"" added Szabo.
Michael Every, senior macro strategist at Rabobank, said the events risked sparking ""massive geopolitical/economic tensions,"" adding that the EU's small Baltic states suddenly appear much more exposed. 
Belarus bonds, currently yielding over 7%, pose a headache for major asset managers increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investments. 
The bonds are held by major fund managers such as Amundi Asset Management, PIMCO, HSBC Asset Management and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Management, filings showed. None of the firms immediately responded to a request for comment. 
""Maybe we are seeing Belarus become uninvestable from an ESG perspective,"" said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management. 
Fitch said earlier in May the country's external debt position remained strained after FX reserves had almost halved in 2020 and stood at just 2.2 months of current external payments at the end of last year.
Nonetheless, total 2021 sovereign foreign currency debt repayments looked manageable at $2.77 billion with nearly half of external debt repayments owed to Russia, Fitch added.

Gupta's family conglomerate had been seeking refinancing of its cash-starved web of businesses in steel, aluminium and energy after supply chain finance firm Greensill filed for insolvency in March. 
It said on Monday it was planning to sell three 'non-core' UK plants as part of a major restructuring.
""As part of this restructuring, Liberty will look to sell its aerospace and special alloys steel business in Stocksbridge,"" the company said in a statement. 
""Liberty has also already commenced the formal sale process of Liberty Aluminium Technologies and Liberty Pressing Solutions,"" it added.
The statement also said that after meetings in Dubai this weekend, Gupta was in advanced discussions with Credit Suisse about a formal standstill agreement about its Australian business.
The agreement would hold until ""refinancing is completed that will repay CS out in full"", it added.
Among the investors burnt in the widespread fallout from Greensill's collapse were clients of Credit Suisse, who had invested in a $7.3 billion finance fund exposed to debt issued by the finance firm. 
Greensill Capital lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, but it collapsed in March after one of its main insurers declined to renew its cover.

Palantir will provide the U.S. Air Force senior leadership with a continuously improving operational readiness analytics platform by integrating disparate data sources from across the service. This will improve DAF’s readiness in a variety of mission-critical areas, cutting across organizational and functional silos.
It will deploy and maintain its core software as 'Data-as-a-Service' platform to support Space and Missile Systems Center’s cross-mission ground and communications enterprise’s space command and control program element.
The company will support NORAD-Northcom’s joint all-domain command and control transformation, modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive operational planning and execution.
The latest order marks another win for Palantir from the U.S. defense sector.

Shirzad joins the company against the backdrop of increased regulatory scrutiny around digital currencies globally. 
He served as deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs at the White House and was most recently the global co-head of government affairs at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), where his tenure spanned 15 years.
Previously, he was also the assistant secretary for import administration at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Last week, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability. The U.S. Treasury is also backing a proposal that would require cryptocurrency transfers over $10,000 to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.
Coinbase, which went public earlier this year, in March named Brett Redfearn, a former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as vice president of capital markets division.

The restart of cruising in the United States is contingent on obtaining a conditional sailing certificate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the company said, adding it expected approval in the coming days.
Norwegian Cruise had earlier planned to restart U.S. sailing in July, but later said the time needed to prepare its ships after receiving the go-ahead from the CDC could delay the restart.
Rivals Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group last week said they also planned to return to sailing in the United States, starting in July.
The announcements came after the U.S. health agency began a key step for the eventual resumption of U.S. cruise industry operations by issuing new technical instructions, such as starting simulated trips and applying for a COVID-19 conditional sailing certificate.
Simulated voyages allow crew and port personnel to practice new COVID-19 operational procedures with volunteers before sailing with passengers.
Cruise companies have been sailing on and off in Europe and Singapore in the last few months.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) shares rose nearly 8% Monday following a double upgrade to outperform from Bernstein’s Alexia Howard.
Howard set a $130 target for the stock, 22% higher from the stock’s Friday closing of $106.59.
The analyst called for buying the dip as the alternative meat company’s sales should rise again on wider reopening of the economy, also helped by its recent tie-ups with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD),  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).
The company’s last quarter results reflected the growing competition for the company.
Beyond Meat’s shares have more than halved from their 52-week high of $220.8, falling back after the company reported losses that ballooned to $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a $500,000 loss in the same period in 2019.

1471,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>",Exxon Activist Battle Turns Climate Angst Into Referendum on CEO,"(Bloomberg) -- An unprecedented fight over who should sit on the board of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is turning into a referendum on Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods as a decades-long struggle by climate campaigners comes to a head.
Activist investor Engine No. 1 LLC wants to replace one-third of Exxon’s board in an effort to force the Western world’s largest oil explorer to embrace a transition away from fossil fuels and end a decade of what it calls “value destruction.” Shareholders are set to gather — virtually — for their annual meeting on May 26.
The stakes are high. Under Exxon’s bylaws, a victory for any dissident director would mean an incumbent must step down, equating to a zero-sum proxy contest: of 16 candidates, only 12 will prevail. Any dilution of Woods’s influence over the board could derail his long-term plans and force strategic and tactical changes he has previously rejected.
Although Engine No. 1 hasn’t targeted Woods for removal, even a partial victory for the activist would be a serious, and perhaps fatal, blow to his leadership, according to Ceres, a coalition of environmentally active investors managing $37 trillion.
“I don’t see how Darren Woods remains as CEO if one of the dissidents, let alone all four, are elected,” said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas at Ceres. “It would be such a sign of fundamental dissatisfaction with the status quo that something would have to change. And that starts with the CEO.”
Exxon's engagement with environmental activists was once characterized by a sense of bemusement — under former CEO Lee Raymond, Greenpeace protesters outside its annual meetings were offered donuts. But as worries about climate change have gone mainstream in the investment world, the clash has evolved into a confrontation over boardroom seats.
In other corners of the commodities sector, shareholders this year have already shown frustration with executives’ reluctance to embrace tough environmental goals. DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD) Inc. suffered an 81% vote against management on plastic-pollution disclosures, while ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) lost a contest on adopting more stringent emission targets.
Exxon’s meeting this year threatens to be one of the stormiest on the U.S. corporate calendar, made all the more remarkable for being instigated by a newly formed fund that only has a $54 million, or 0.02%, stake in the oil behemoth. Investor dissatisfaction with the company largely centers on two issues that are becoming more interlinked: climate change and profits. The oil giant envisages a profitable, long-term future for fossil fuels, but sees no point in investing in traditional renewable energy businesses. It also refuses to commit to a net-zero emissions target, unlike European rivals.
Climate concerns are are resonating more deeply with investors at the same time that Exxon’s status as a financial powerhouse crumbles after multiple corporate missteps, some of which preceded Woods’s elevation to CEO in 2017. Returns on invested capital are a fraction of what they were in Exxon’s heyday a decade ago and debt ballooned 40% last year as Covid-19 paralyzed economies and energy demand around the world. 
Under mounting pressure and concerns over Exxon’s ability to pay the S&P 500’s third-largest dividend, the CEO slashed an ambitious $200 billion expansion program by a third late last year. It was a relief to some investors who had questioned both the cost and the need for such projects at a time when policymakers — and even rivals like BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc — are planning for the twilight of the petroleum era.
Still, Engine No. 1 says Exxon needs higher-quality directors who are willing to challenge management. Exxon missed key industry trends such as the shale revolution, “the shift to focusing on project returns over chasing production growth, and the need to gradually prepare for rather than ignore the energy transition,” according to the San Francisco-based activist.
After receiving early backing from major state pension funds, Engine No. 1’s campaign gathered momentum this month as two prominent shareholder-advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co., threw their partial support behind the activist’s efforts. ISS wrote a scathing rebuke of Exxon’s climate strategy, saying the company had only taken “incremental steps to prepare for the inevitable.”
Top 20 shareholder Legal & General Investment Management, a previous critic of Exxon, is also backing Engine No. 1 and has pledged to vote against Woods. However, the voting  intentions of some other major investors, such as Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). aren’t clear —  all three declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Norway’s giant sovereign wealth fund said late last week that it would support the reelection of most Exxon directors, but not Woods, part of its long-standing push to separate the roles of CEO and chairman at Exxon.
With such animosity brewing, the usual course of action would be for Exxon’s board to meet with the activists and hash out a compromise. But that has yet to happen, and both sides appear to be entrenched.
Exxon said in a May 14 letter to shareholders its board “listens and responds to shareholder feedback,” but that Engine No. 1, founded only a few months ago, wasn’t interested in engaging and “is trying to replace four of our world-class directors with unqualified nominees.'' The company added that the activist fund's plans would “derail our progress and jeopardize your dividend.”
In another letter to shareholders on Sunday, Exxon said that over the next 12 months it plans to name two new directors, one with energy industry and one with climate experience.
For its part, Engine No. 1 said Exxon refused to meet its nominees: Gregory Goff, former CEO of refiner Andeavor; environmental scientist Kaisa Hietala; private equity investor Alexander Karsner; and Anders Runevad, ex-CEO of power producer Vestas Wind Systems A/S.
Exxon did talk with another investor, hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co., which built a stake in an effort to push for change. Those discussions led to the appointment of the new directors, including activist investor Jeff Ubben. The oil company has also announced new emissions targets, started a low-carbon business, and supported policies that will help technological innovations like carbon capture.
In some respects Exxon is in a better position that it was at the start of 2021. Its stock has rallied more than 40% as oil prices rebounded and lockdowns are eased. Engine No. 1 points to its involvement as the turning point, while Exxon claims the market is rewarding prudent cost cutting and high-return investments made over the last couple of years. The forthcoming vote will help to determine which side of the debate other investors lean toward.
“There’s a governance challenge at Exxon,” said John Hoeppner, head of U.S. sustainable investments at Legal & General. “How seriously is the current board questioning management’s business model? It’s important to add urgency to the debate.”

Investing.com – Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) shares rose 3% in Monday’s premarket as the cryptocurrencies that bring the exchange most of its revenue tried to claw back losses after a bruising week.
Last week’s rout shaved 30% to 50% of the market value off many cryptocurrencies in a sell-off sparked by China, whose miners account for some 70% of the supply, according to Reuters. Traders spent much of last week dumping digital currencies.
A draw down of 30% is not unusual for cryptocurrencies. Still, China's warning about speculation in digital currencies compared with conflicting comments from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who has been the biggest crypto champion. That added to the unease.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 08:17AM ET</span>",U.S. pot sellers stash cash as banks leave them high and dry,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - The U.S. cannabis business has a very particular cashflow problem -- too much of it.
Marijuana can be sold legally in 36 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) for medical use and in 15 of them and in D.C. for recreational purposes. But it's still illegal on a federal level, meaning most banks won't service the industry in case they fall afoul of money laundering laws.
With the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing legalisation driving a surge in cannabis use, the sector's producers, manufacturers and retailers are awash in cash, adding risk and costs to the most basic business transactions from paying employees and filing taxes to finding somewhere to store their income.
""All this cash flowing around is just a recipe for disaster,"" said Smoke Wallin, chief executive of hemp health products maker Vertical Wellness Inc. ""How do you account for it? Where do you keep it? How do you move it? Even in a safe, it's a security risk for employees.""
Ryan Hale, a U.S. Navy veteran and co-founder of cash management firm Operational Security Solutions, had to persuade a weed farmer in California to stop hiding cash in a tree. On another occasion, Hale had to help a bewildered cannabis retailer who had lost count of the dollar bills overflowing from his store's lockers.
Legal U.S. cannabis sales grew 30% to $22 billion last year, more than the $17.5 billion Americans spent on wine, according to data from Euromonitor. Sales are expected to jump more than 20% this year.
(Graphic: U.S. cannabis consumers growth: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-CASH/rlgpdybdovo/chart.png)
The sales boom could have left cannabis companies with a cash pile of more than $10 billion to deal with last year, according to research firms Headset.io and New Frontier Research. 
Big players can afford unmarked armoured vans and heavily armed guards to transport money but smaller operators have to rely on themselves.
One weed producer in Los Angeles, who declined to be identified, said he had to carry $120,000 in a bag and drive for six hours from Los Angeles to Oakland to pay a supplier instead of taking a flight and put himself at greater risk of being robbed or the money being confiscated by airport security.
During the last weekend of May 2020, when protests erupted across the United States against police brutality and racism after the murder of George Floyd, there were at least 43 attacks on weed dispensaries along the West Coast, according to Cannabis media site Leafly's review of police reports and business owners' statements.
One of the stores attacked was Cookies Melrose in Hollywood, owned by rapper Gilbert Milam Jr, known by his stage name 'Berner'.
It suffered damages in the ""high six figures"" when around a hundred people attacked the store on May 29, a company spokesperson said.
A DIFFERENT BALL GAME
As legalisation of cannabis gathers steam across states -- New York and New Mexico will allow marijuana for recreational purposes in the next few years -- politicians are looking at ways to make it easier for the sector to access banking services.
(Graphic: Marijuana Legalization by State Marijuana Legalization by State: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CANNABIS/jznvnnwwqvl/chart.png)
The House of Representatives passed a bill in April that would allow cannabis firms to have bank accounts, get loans and accept credit card payments but it may not make it to the Senate because Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to work instead towards lifting the federal ban on cannabis.
A full federal green light is the industry's ultimate goal but it isn't counting on Schumer's pledge to make it happen by next year.
Shares of U.S. cannabis companies, listed in Canada because they are barred from U.S. exchanges, are up just 9% so far this year according to the AdvisorShare Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF and off nearly 29% from a February peak.
In the meantime, marijuana businesses have to hunt for friendly banks.
Only 515 of the more than 8,200 federally registered banks and one in 30 credit unions in the United States worked with marijuana businesses at the end of 2020, according to data compiled by government agencies.
(Graphic: Cannabis banking in the U.S: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANNABIS-CASH/jznpnrowkpl/chart.png)
The service comes at a premium as the federal illegality increases the amount of paperwork needed by banks. 
Chris Driessen, chief executive of pot producer SLANG Worldwide (OTC:SLGWF) Inc, said it cost his firm $40,000 to avail of banking services in Colorado, just one of 12 states in which the company operates. Normally, a business checking account will cost less than $100 to open.
""Standard banking for companies is often 95% cheaper than the cost to bank cannabis companies,"" Driessen said.
Maps Credit Union is one of the longest-serving financial institutions working with the cannabis industry. It has taken in more than $1.79 billion in cash deposits from the sector in Oregon since January 2017 but that has entailed filing tens of thousands of reports required under financial crimes watchdog FinCEN's guidance for cannabis banking.
""Serving these businesses is not cheap. It's a completely different ball game,"" said Rachel Pross, Maps' operations chief, pointing to its use of costly anti-money laundering software, external auditors and legal counsel.
As demand for pot grows, investors have poured more than $2.5 billion into cannabis tech startups since 2018 and special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs that target the broader cannabis industry, have raised $3.9 billion to date, according to Viridian. 
Within the industry, however, some cannabis executives can't get loans and struggle to even retain personal accounts. 

Cookies store chain owner Berner said many banks had declined to be associated with him since he got into the cannabis line in 2015.
""My clothing business did $32 million last year, but multiple banks have asked us to leave,"" he said. ""You'd like to go into a normal banking establishment and just be treated like a normal human being.""

The aim of the study is to understand if the combination of the vaccines is safe, and the immune response after adding the pneumonia vaccine to the existing COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer said.
The vaccine candidate, 20vPnC, is being developed to help protect adults against 20 serotypes responsible for the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia.
The new study will include 600 adults who will be recruited from the two companies' late-stage COVID-19 vaccine study, after having received their second dose of the vaccine at least six months before entering the co-administration study.

COVID-19 vaccines were previously recommended to be administered alone. But based on experience with non-COVID vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said COVID-19 shots and other vaccines can be given simultaneously or on the same day.
In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)accepted for a priority review Pfizer's biologics license application for the investigational 20vPnC in adults over 18 and set an action date for a decision in June. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the company's marketing authorization application for 20vPnC two months later.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>",Big banks look for post-pandemic rebound of credit card revenue,"By David Henry
(Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are prepared for credit-card balances to start ticking up again this year as pandemic restrictions ease and stimulus checks stop arriving, setting up the industry for a bump in one of its most profitable businesses. 
Lenders, including Capital One,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan, have been sending out more promotions to enroll new customers and encourage borrowers to spend, said Andrew Davidson of marketing-tracker Mintel Comperemedia. Some 260 million offers were sent in March, the firm estimates.
Banks have increased digital marketing, too, on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, video sites and podcasts, he said.
""The big banks are ramping up in anticipation of the recovery post-pandemic,"" Davidson said. ""They are really trying to make up lost ground from last year."" 
At the same time, lenders have been easing credit standards, according to a recent Federal Reserve survey and public comments by bank executives, including from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
The change in posture is a stark difference from last year when lenders halted most card offers and pulled back on credit limits, worried that skyrocketing unemployment would create major loan losses. 
The losses did not happen. Instead, the U.S. government sent out stimulus checks, offered enhanced jobless benefits and propped up small-business owners with forgivable loans. That allowed many credit-card reliant Americans to spend while also paying down balances. Others leaned on higher housing prices to borrow cheaply against their homes rather than use plastic. Altogether that left card businesses in the lurch – still profitable, but pulling in less revenue. 
Card balances declined 14% during the pandemic, according to data https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The portion of accounts with revolving balances fell to 39.7% at the end of 2020 from 44.1% a year earlier, according to the American Bankers Association. 
Quarterly financial reports from major card lenders, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup and Capital One, showcased those trends. But as pandemic lockdowns have started to ease – the return of indoor dining, travel restrictions lifted, concert announcements, offices reopening and masks coming off – executives have expressed optimism about consumer spending and borrowing ahead.
That is particularly true for rebounding card charges for travel and entertainment, which were down 80% at the beginning of the pandemic, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts last month.
Capital One is encouraging the spending revival by gradually increasing credit limits, he said. ""That represents an extra part of growth opportunity,"" Fairbank said.
'MORE ENTICING'
Even as balances fell, the number of card accounts increased during the last two quarters and a decline in credit lines stopped in the March quarter, according to the Fed data.
The banks declined to comment on their plans beyond their public statements.
What does it all mean for credit-card borrowers? It largely depends on whether they will be able to maintain enough income to cover their spending when they can go out to dinner and travel again. 
Any shortfalls would be sweet spots for banks. The average credit-card rate is over 16%, with the highest at 25%, according to CreditCards.com.

The APRs have remained high, even as the Fed has kept overnight rates near zero and as most conventional mortgages cost a little above 3%. 
That helps banks earn twice the return on assets with cards compared with other businesses. Now that the industry has a better feeling about the economy, banks will try to get customers to borrow more on cards, said Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody. ""They do have a good sense of consumer behavior,"" he said. ""They will make it more enticing.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, starting the week on a positive note as bitcoin makes something of a recovery and the earnings season winds down.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 125 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 85 points, or 0.6%.
Wall Street saw a mixed week last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its fourth negative week in five and the S&P 500 registered two straight weeks of losses for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite, by contrast, snapped a four-week losing streak, gaining marginally.
That said, with only a few days left in the month, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the broad-based S&P 500 are down month to date for May, losing 3.5% and 0.6% respectively. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen around 1% so far this month as inflation concerns loom over growth names.
The earnings season is gradually winding down, and there are not many companies reporting Monday. Still, there are a number of retailers left to report this week, most notably  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).
Companies in focus Monday include Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), after the company completed its first space flight in more than two years, boosting its chances of becoming commercially successful in taking paying customers into outer space.
The likes of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) could also be in focus after Cineworld (LON:CINE), the world's second-largest cinema chain said on Monday its UK reopening weekend had topped expectations as animated comedy ""Peter Rabbit 2"" drew crowds after months of lockdown.
The data slate looks pretty empty Monday, but there are a number of Federal Reserve policymakers due to speak, including Governor Lael Brainard, who attends a virtual cryptocurrency conference. 
Bitcoin regained some lost ground, but sentiment surrounding the world’s biggest digital currency remains weak as authorities in China and the U.S. moved to tighten regulation and tax compliance. 
The digital currency was last seen 4% higher at $36,550, but this is still down nearly 50% from it's all-time high of just under $65,000, hit in mid-April. It shed as much as 17% on Sunday.
Oil prices gained Monday, bouncing after doubts emerge over the likelihood of Iranian crude supplies reentering the global market.
Crude fell almost 3% last week after Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, said the United States was ready to lift sanctions on his country's oil exports as part of reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
However, such a move seemed less likely Monday after the speaker of Iran's parliament said on Sunday a monitoring deal between Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog had expired and that its access to images from inside some Iranian nuclear sites would cease.
U.S. crude futures traded .7% higher at $64.68 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.7% to $67.44. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,882.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2218.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>",Hyundai raises hydrogen game as new trucks roll into Europe,"By Vera Eckert and John Revill
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor plans to ship a new series of fuel-cell trucks to Europe later this year, turning up the heat on rivals in a battle to test the viability of hydrogen-powered heavy goods transport.
A new class of the Xcient Hyundai truck, equipped with more efficient fuel cells with longer life-span, is due to arrive in Europe in the fourth quarter, said Mark Freymueller, CEO of Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM).
Hydrogen lags electric batteries in the green transport stakes because it is more expensive, but proponents say for long-haul transport hydrogen-powered trucks have the advantage because they have a greater range.
HHM, a joint venture between Hyundai and Swiss hydrogen company H2 Energy, has been renting out ""green"" hydrogen trucks to commercial clients in Switzerland since last October in the world's most advanced pilot in the field.
HHM plans to go into other European countries next year. ""Germany and the Netherlands are the most likely,"" Freymueller told Reuters, adding there was also interest for pilots from Austria, Norway, France, Italy, Spain and Denmark. 
Hyundai's latest push will put more pressure on local players, which are developing their own hydrogen plans.
    These include Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) with Sweden's Volvo and Italy's Iveco, a unit of Italian-American vehicle maker CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), which is cooperating with low-emission truckmaker Nikola . 
Hydrogen has come into the spotlight in Europe, where EU environment ministers want truck CO2 emissions cut by a third by 2030 from 2019 levels, threatening potential diesel bans and higher taxes but promising up to 75% of lower road tolls for greener vehicles.
Although more expensive than battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, driven by on-board hydrogen, will potentially benefit from Europe's desire to build a world-leading industry around the hydrogen technology.
    A study by consultancy Berylls Strategy Advisors reckons that by 2030, 25% of new truck sales in Europe will be battery powered and 10% fuel cell. But the ratio could change if green hydrogen is scaled up, it said.
POSITIVE FEEDBACK
Hyundai chose Switzerland for its pilot on the basis of benign regulation, environmentally conscious customers and reliable hydropower, which accounts for 58% of the country's power mix. Local road tax is waived for no-carbon vehicles while fossil fuel ones pay around 800 euros ($977) for each tonne of CO2 they emit. 
    ""Anyone wanting to see how fuel cell technology works on the road should go to Switzerland,"" said Steffen Stumpp, head of the business unit commercial vehicles at Berylls.
    Initial customer feedback on Hyundai's pay-per-use pilot seems positive. Drivers at grocery chain Coop like the similar payload to diesel trucks and with only a few minutes of refuelling, a spokeswoman said.
""There was no need to change my driving style,"" Nadine Sigrist, a driver for retailer Migros in the Zurich region, said ""What was new for me was the huge acceleration and the quiet engine.""
As more Hyundai trucks arrive, Swiss power utility Alpiq is planning to ramp up its electrolysis capacity at Niedergoesgen where it produces green hydrogen that is then transported on trucks as gas to filling stations.
""We will go from 2 megawatts in the direction of double-digit, or 5-10 megawatts,"" said Amedee Murisier, head of hydropower generation at Alpiq and board member of Hydrospider, a Swiss green hydrogen joint venture between Alpiq, gases group Linde (NYSE:LIN) and H2 Energy.
Hydrospider could reach breakeven as soon as 2022, Murisier said. 
BATTERY VS FUEL CELLS
McKinsey expects hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles to achieve break-even with diesel only in 2028 at the earliest, but carmakers are pushing ahead with plans, albeit at different speeds.
Nikola and Iveco say they will produce a fuel cell electric vehicle by 2023, putting them two years ahead of Volvo and Daimler Truck, which are muscling in but will not have test trucks for three and a half years.
Separately, Daimler group subsidiary Mercedes Benz will prepare customer trials for its GenH2 Truck in 2023.
""Nikola's timeline is significantly ahead of Daimler/Volvo,"" said Stumpp. ""Hyundai will be neck on neck with Nikola/Iveco if they offer the Xcient in other European markets.""
Daimler Truck chief executive Martin Daum said that a hydrogen fuelling network needed to be in place first before fuel cell trucks would find buyers, which would take years to develop, so they were timing their moves in line with the infrastructure.
Truckmaker Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR)'s DAF is also in the game, but its priority is battery electric vehicles, where Nikola is also active and plans market entry in fourth quarter 2021.
Other companies have also chosen to put fuel cell technology second.
Traton, the truck division of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), recently said that only the battery route had been chosen by its MAN and Scania units.
""Hydrogen trucks have a decisive disadvantage. Only a quarter of the original energy goes into propulsion, three quarters are lost through conversion,"" Traton CEO Matthias Gruendler and alternative drivetrains specialist Andreas Kammel wrote in a column in newspaper Handelsblatt.
""With e-trucks, the ratio is the other way around,"" they said.
Traton has left the door ajar by raising its investment in truck maker Navistar (NYSE:NAV) that is developing fuel cells in the Americas.
SUPPLIERS
On the automotive supply front, companies are hedging their bets.
Bosch, a fuel cell proponent, has entered into a joint venture with China's Qingling Motors to supply fuel cell systems for 2022/2023.
Elringklinger and Mahle, too, are also working on fuel cell technology.
U.S. engine maker Cummins (NYSE:CMI), due to start building a fuel cell system factory in Herten, Germany, later this year, sees no conflict.
""Fuel cells will complement the BEV (battery electric vehicle) system in places where energy storage, range, weight and power requirements are unable to be met by batteries alone,"" said Amy Davis, president of New Power at Cummins.

""That's why we are investing in the electric vehicle drivetrain components, because we think those will be maturing too, and they will be key to both fuel cells and batteries.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son warned of significant dangers around holding the Olympics in Tokyo, where the government on Monday kicked off a mass vaccination drive to catch up with other countries and ensure a ""safe and secure"" Games.
In a series of tweets, the influential SoftBank Group CEO expressed bewilderment and concern about the Tokyo Olympics, calling Japan a ""vaccine laggard"" and saying the slow inoculation drive less than two months before the start of the Games could put people's lives at risk.
""Currently more than 80% of people want the Olympics to be postponed or cancelled. Who and on what authority is it being forced through?"" the billionaire executive, wrote in a tweet in Japanese over the weekend.
In a follow-up tweet late on Sunday, Son, who has 2.8 million followers, wrote: ""Does the IOC (International Olympic Committee) have the power to decide that the Games would go ahead?
""There's talk about a huge penalty (if the Games are cancelled). But if 100,000 people from 200 countries descend on vaccine-laggard Japan and the mutant variant spreads, lives could be lost, subsidies could result if a state of emergency is called, and gross domestic product could fall. If we consider what the public has to endure, I think we could have a lot more to lose.""
Son's tweets followed comments on Friday https://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-2020-idCNL2N2N80BL from IOC Vice President John Coates that the games would ""absolutely"" go ahead even if Tokyo was under COVID-19 restrictions.
Earlier this month, Son said in a TV interview he was ""afraid"" of having the Olympics, partly due to the severity of the pandemic in some countries.
VAX LAGGARD
Japan remains under state-of-emergency curbs https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-approve-more-covid-19-vaccines-state-emergency-set-widen-2021-05-21 that have progressively been expanded as a fourth wave of infections rips through the population. Several sources with knowledge of the decision told Reuters the government was leaning towards extending the emergency status - set to end on May 31 in most regions, including Tokyo.
That contrasts with some other major economies that are beginning to ease lockdown measures as vaccinations race ahead. The Games begin on July 23. 
Japan has delivered vaccinations to just 4.4% of its population, the slowest among the world's larger, rich countries, and has recorded 711,360 infections and 12,232 COVID-19 deaths from the virus.
The military began mass vaccinations in Tokyo and Osaka on Monday with the newly approved  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc dose. The medical system in the western city of Osaka is particularly feeling the pressure of surging infections.
The government has vowed to finish vaccinating all eligible elderly who wish to be inoculated by the end of July.
Japan's slow vaccination progress has kept the majority of the public opposed to holding the Games this year. A Reuters corporate survey found nearly 70% of Japanese firms also want the Olympics either cancelled or postponed.
While opinion polls show strong opposition to the Games, public protests have been limited.
On Sunday, a group of fewer than 20 gathered in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, calling on the government to cancel the Games, holding placards like ""No Olympics"".
Meanwhile, more aspiring Olympians saw their dreams dashed due to the virus that has killed more than three million worldwide.
A team of Australian skateboarders was disqualified from a qualifying event in the United States after three positive COVID-19 tests in their group.
IOC President Thomas Bach on the weekend added his voice to those insisting the Games proceed.

""The athletes definitely can make their Olympic dreams come true,"" Bach said in comments to the International Hockey Federation on Saturday, Indian media reported. 
""We have to make some sacrifices to make this possible,"" Bach said.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 05:25AM ET</span>",IATA's Walsh says airline industry will be smaller after crisis,"DUBAI (Reuters) -The head of global airline body IATA expects the industry to emerge from the coronavirus crisis smaller and more cautious, doubting airlines will try to expand through acquisitions.
The airline industry has been crippled by the pandemic, which continues to leave many aircraft around the world grounded or flying near-empty as demand limps towards a recovery.
""It will be a smaller industry. We are not going to recover all the capacity,"" International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh said in a pre-recorded online interview broadcast on Monday. He cited the swathes of aircraft retired and employees laid off or placed on furlough.
""It will be a more cautious industry. I don't expect to see M&A (merger and acquisition) activity, principally because people will be guarded about the cash they have.""
Walsh, the former chief executive of British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), said that spending ""valuable cash resources"" would be ""too risky"" but he believes there will be consolidation through airlines shrinking their operations and some failing.
""It's going to take airlines time to repair their balance sheets,"" he said.
IATA has forecast global travel demand to return to 2019, pre-pandemic levels in 2024.
While those airlines that survive would fill the gaps left by those that fail, they would have to be careful how quickly they rebuild, Walsh said, urging caution.
""Airlines are not going to be able to take the risk of operating unprofitable routes in the short term,"" he told aviation consultant John Strickland.

However, Walsh does not believe the crisis has undermined airline business models such as those for regional or low-cost carriers among others. 
""Nothing has changed the competitive nature of this industry,"" he said.

The all-cash deal seeks to capitalise on state infrastructure investments and private-sector growth in the two U.S. states.
The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company said it entered an agreement with HeidelbergCement's U.S. affiliate, Lehigh Hanson Inc, to buy assets including 17 active aggregates quarries and two cement plants.
The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year and will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full year following closing, Martin Marietta said.
German seller Heidelberg said it would focus on other regions in North America where it has the strongest market positions, and that the divestment was part of a strategic push to lift profit margins.

HeidelbergCement told Reuters in February it identified five assets to sell, in a review of its business.
The group, which is active in Europe, Asia and the Americas, has in the past said its North American business was underperforming, leading it to launch a margin improvement plan.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 05:02AM ET</span>",Sea change: global freight sails out of the digital dark ages,"By Nick Carey and Lisa Baertlein
LONDON (Reuters) - If suppliers in China fail to pick up freight containers to fill an order for MediaShop, Marcel Schneider gets an alert via a digital freight system, allowing the retailer to reach out and fix the problem swiftly. 
Before July 2020, Austria-based MediaShop's deputy supply chain director says he would discover problems in his supply chain only when containers failed to arrive in Hamburg as scheduled. 
""It was like being in a tunnel where you had only a limited view of what was going on,"" Schneider said. 
Lost containers means lost sales for MediaShop, which sells consumer goods ranging from kitchen knives to fitness equipment. A missing load can mean the company pays penalties to wholesale customers for late shipments. 
Global supply chain snarls, from shortages of freight containers in China to a blockage in the Suez Canal, have thrown a wrench into the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. They have also accelerated the freight industry's shift out of the digital dark ages. That's benefiting a fast-growing cluster of startup companies that had struggled to sell their software-powered freight tracking technology, until now.
A Reuters analysis of digital freight startups shows there are close to 250 companies globally, including Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s logistics arm Uber Freight, and some Chinese operators looking to go public like Full Truck Alliance. 
""Really, the pandemic gave us a chance to shine, with capacity being taken offline and demand surging in unpredictable ways,"" says Ryan Petersen, Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-based Flexport, a freight forwarder whose revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion last year and which has raised $1.3 billion from investors. MediaShop is a client.
Digitization in the freight industry has been under way for years, but the expense of grafting digital tracking systems onto legacy databases has discouraged many companies. 
Now, a number of startups staffed by alumni of tech companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber have developed platforms that integrate with customers' transportation management systems, making them easy to use from home.
""We have seen a massive acceleration in products that normally wouldn't have been adopted for three, four or five years from now because people have had to figure out how to operate remotely,"" said Sune Stilling, former head of growth at the venture capital arm of shipping giant Maersk, which has invested in several of these startups. 
Deep-pocketed traditional freight giants are also beefing up their own systems to compete. But smaller companies may find it hard to fund the transition to digital, which should drive consolidation, especially in the freight forwarding industry.
'RUN YOU OVER'
Before Michael Wax founded Berlin-based digital freight forwarder Forto five years ago, he toured a traditional company's offices in Hamburg and was shocked by the antiquated operations.
""We saw a bunch of white males there managing a lot of colored Post-It notes stuck around their computer screens, and running around with bits of paper,"" Wax said.
Forto has raised $53 million from investors, including Maersk Growth. Like Flexport, Forto built a software platform to handle shipments from factory to warehouse - including cumbersome customs declarations - online, with customers able to track containers as they are scanned at various points along the way. 
""We will orchestrate your entire supply chain for you,"" Wax said. ""This is the future of logistics.""
Forto's system integrates with transportation management systems developed by the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP for major customers, making it easier for them to use.
It also sells software to shippers as a standalone supply-chain tool. The company tripled its business in 2020.
Integration with transportation management systems has also been key for Loadsmart, a U.S. digital truck brokerage and Ofload, an Australian equivalent.
When U.S. customers, which include  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), book an order on their own transportation management systems, rather than having to reach out to a truck broker, they get an instant guaranteed quote from Loadsmart. 
Loadsmart has raised $150 million from investors and saw its revenue jump 208% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
""The switch to digital used to be seen as a vitamin, now it's a painkiller,"" says Loadsmart CEO Ricardo Salgado. ""If you don't do it, your competitors are going to run you over."" 
Ofload launched in Australia in March 2020 as the pandemic hit hard and has companies with around 15,000 trucks combined using its system. Maersk Australia - also an investor - uses it to manage all of its freight, not just the loads booked using Ofload. 
CEO Geoffroy Henry says Australia's trucking sector is highly fragmented so around one in three trucks ""is running empty at all times and we aim to tackle those empty miles directly.""
And Hong Kong-based digital freight startup Freightos saw a twentyfold increase in bookings between freight companies and airlines on its WebCargo platform from March 2020 to March 2021 as the air cargo industry went online during the pandemic.
'CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES'
Big traditional operators in the global supply chain are also not standing still.
U.S. logistics provider XPO, for instance, said its own digital platform powered an 83% year-over-year growth in truck brokerage revenue in the first quarter.
Increased digitization also comes amid a wave of consolidation in the sector, especially in China, sparked by the e-commerce boom during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swiss logistics firm Kuehne & Nagel said on Monday it would buy Asian logistics provider Apex International Corp from private equity firm MBK Partners, making it the world's largest air-freight forwarder.
And last month DSV Panalpina said it would acquire the logistics division of Kuwait's Agility Public Warehousing Co in an all-share deal worth $4.1 billion, creating the world's third largest freight forwarding company.

After hosting a meeting with Forto's CEO Wax last month,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a client note that the rise of digital forwarders means more deals are likely.
""The continued use of legacy systems and processes by incumbent freight forwarders suggests market share opportunities for new digital operators,"" the analysts wrote. ""It may also provide consolidation opportunities for the top tier.""

1486,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Faster than expected: Cineworld rides 'Peter Rabbit 2' success in UK reopening,"By Muvija M and Chris Peters
(Reuters) -Cineworld said on Monday its UK reopening weekend had topped expectations as animated comedy ""Peter Rabbit 2"" drew crowds after months of lockdown, in a promising sign for the cinema industry ahead of the release of summer blockbusters. 
The world's second-largest cinema chain, which operates the Regal Cinemas brand, said more than 97% of its U.S. cinemas had resumed operations, while most of its screens in the rest of the world were expected to reopen by the end of the month. 
Shares in the only UK-listed cinema operator rose 3% to 89.4 pence, among top gainers on the mid-cap index by 0813 GMT.
The strong weekend is an encouraging sign for Cineworld, which in March sunk to its first-ever loss as the pandemic closed cinemas and disrupted movie releases across the world. 
The UK, which went into a third national lockdown in January this year, has been gradually easing restrictions thanks to a successful vaccination drive, with cinemas now able to operate at 50% capacity.
""With improving consumer confidence and the success of the vaccination rollout, we expect a good recovery in attendance over the coming months,"" Cineworld Chief Executive Mooky Greidinger said.
UP NEXT: ""CRUELLA"" AND ""A QUIET PLACE 2""
Nearly half of U.S. adults have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, and around three quarters of the UK population.
Greidinger said he expected a strong performance next week too, helped by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS)'s ""Cruella"" and Paramount thriller ""A Quiet Place 2"". 
Hollywood studios have promised a slate of big-ticket releases for the summer, including Marvel's ""Black Widow"" and the new James Bond movie ""No Time to Die"", with top actors, directors and executives previewing upcoming films in theatres.
However, the UK has warned that its plan to lift all restrictions next month could be delayed due to a spike in infections linked to the virus variant first found in India. 

A catastrophic second wave in India has again closed theatres in the country, which added millions of dollars to the box office receipts of Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" and superhero movie ""Wonder Woman 1984"" last year.
Cineworld, which has 9,311 screens globally, said it had received the full $203 million tax refund under the U.S. government's coronavirus relief program for companies.

1487,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2021 03:09AM ET</span>","Biden Tax Hikes Are Hitting Resistance, With ‘No Room for Error’","(Bloomberg) -- Weeks after President Joe Biden pitched the first major set of tax increases since 1993, signs are mounting that anxiety among congressional Democratic will significantly temper any increases that manage to pass Congress.
“We are trying to identify a menu of options” that can pass, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said in an interview. “You need to get every one of your 50 Democratic Senators on board. There is no room for error.”
The Treasury Department is slated to release the administration’s most detailed tax proposals yet, in a report known as the Green Book. But congressional staff are already paring down the ideas that have been floated and fine-tuning them to make them workable from both policy and political standpoints, a Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity.
With the economic recovery still leaving more than 8 million Americans without jobs compared with before the coronavirus pandemic, some Democrats are wary of criticism that higher taxes could damage growth. Moderate Democrats in the House -- vital to holding the party’s slim majority in next year’s elections -- are well aware of Republicans’ success in tarring the Obama administration’s spending and tax plans in the 2010 midterm elections.
Biden’s proposal to increase the corporate tax to 28% from 21% hit a roadblock early on, with moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia saying he preferred 25%. Another element -- a dramatic hike in the capital gains tax, especially for the wealthy at the time they inherit assets -- has recently been subject to potential easing, with the staff of House Ways and Means Committee Richard Neal floating options, Bloomberg News has reported, has reported.
Corporate Tax Steadily Dropped
At the same time, a group of lawmakers from high-tax states are demanding greater relief for some taxpayers, whose state and local tax deductions were capped in the Republican tax overhaul of 2017.
Months of negotiations are likely, not least because lawmakers need to determine how much new spending has to be funded from the tax measures. Talks on a bipartisan infrastructure deal showed no progress Friday, increasing the likelihood of a Democrat-only push for Biden’s $4 trillion in spending and tax proposals.
Neal, whose committee is in charge of drafting tax legislation, said he’s been inundated with ideas from colleagues about how to craft a package, and said he intends to move quickly. Yet he’s mindful of what can get through the 50-50 Senate.
“As closely as we can align ourselves with Senate thinking and administration thinking, the better off we are going to be,” Neal said in an interview. “That’s why I’ve been so deliberative about not thinking out loud about tax policy. I’ve been very guarded on it and I’m going to stay that way” until a consensus is reached among Democrats and on the panel, he said.
Polling Encouragement
These machinations showcase the challenges the White House faces to finance the president’s sweeping legislative proposals on infrastructure and social spending.
White House aides and Democrats are continuing to make the case with the public, while assessing what is politically possible on Capitol Hill. Biden aides frequently cite non-partisan polling from CBS News, Monmouth, Morning Consult and ABC/Washington Post, which shows a majority of Americans support raising taxes on the rich or corporations. But there is no guarantee this level of public support will translate into Democratic lawmakers voting for a raft of tax increases ahead the 2022 midterms.
One Democratic operative who has worked with both the White House and lawmakers highlighted that many of the party’s lawmakers remember the 2010 elections, during which nascent Tea Party Republicans pummeled them for passing the Affordable Care Act and its accompanying tax increases. Democrats lost the House that November.
Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat who co-chairs the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, has cautioned that there is little enthusiasm for tax increases among moderates. Gottheimer is also leading a charge to balance out some of the hikes with a more generous state and local tax, or SALT, deduction that had been limited under President Donald Trump.
‘So There’
Progressives in turn have become frustrated with the moderates, arguing that the coming year is the party’s best chance to roll back the Trump tax cuts and use that money to fund spending on items including child care, community college and universal preschool.
“The tax increases, in a way, are the most popular parts of the proposal,” said Chuck Marr, who served as an economic policy adviser to former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, and now works for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “The public is so there.”
Marr said lawmakers need “more education” on the tax hikes.
“It’s critical that Democrats do all we can with this opportunity to make real progress for the American people,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden. “While conversations about infrastructure are ongoing, it’s critically important that we move forward.”
Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he soon plans to schedule public hearings from stakeholders who would be affected by Biden’s infrastructure and tax proposals. Among the target groups are the AFL-CIO labor group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Trucking Associations and the Teamsters union.
“I think they may get the broad support at the end of the day,” said Ben LaBolt, who worked in the Obama White House and remains close to several Biden aides. “If you are someone like Manchin, if this can be the ticket to getting a bunch of middle class union jobs in West Virginia that don’t require a four-year, or even two-year degree, this could have a major impact on the state.”

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung BioLogics' shares ended lower on Monday, after rising as much as 5.2% on the South Korean contract drug maker's deal to make  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine, one of four such contracts announced in the country.
The companies gave no details on how many vaccines will be made as part of the ""fill and finish"" deal that will run through 2022. This type of a contract involves putting vaccines into vials or syringes, sealing them and packaging them up for shipping, but not making the vaccine itself.
It was also unclear if the Moderna deal would mean faster access to more doses for South Korea, which has managed to give just 7.4% of its 52 million population at least one dose due to supply snags.
U.S. vaccine maker  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) also reaffirmed its partnership with South Korean firm SK bioscience Co Ltd to expand vaccine production. SK shares rose 1.9% compared to a 0.3% fall in the wider market.
Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics pared gains to close down 0.4%, while SK bioscience shares closed up 0.9% compared with a 0.4% fall in the wider market. 
The announcements came after South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited U.S. President Joe Biden, and the two leaders promised to collaborate on vaccines.
Moon had hoped to return home with a ""swap"" deal with Washington to hasten access to U.S.-made shots in return for domestically producing more doses later, but secured vaccines for only 550,000 South Korean soldiers.
South Korea already had a deal with Moderna to procure 40 million doses of its vaccine, but no timeline had been agreed.
The first batch of 55,000 Moderna doses will arrive on May 31, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said on Monday, adding that the drug safety ministry will decide later who will get those doses.
Moon, whose approval ratings have slipped over his handling of the pandemic, called the summit a success, saying the country's vaccine partnership with the United States will help make it a ""vaccine hub.""
""Best ever visit and best ever meeting,"" he tweeted.
""The announcement that the U.S. would send vaccines to us, in addition to 'Vaccine Partnership', was literally a surprise.""

But South Korea's opposition denounced Moon for ""paying cash, but returning with just a promissory note"".
""How did we become a country that is moved to tears with vaccine aid for just 550,000 soldiers from the United States?"" Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -A Singapore court has approved a freeze on up to $3.5 billion of assets of the family behind collapsed Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, boosting the prospect of debt recovery from the former oil trading empire that counts some of the world's biggest banks among its creditors.
Hin Leong was wound up in March after failing in a year-long effort to restructure more than $3 billion in debts after the COVID-19-led oil crash laid bare huge losses. Founder Lim Oon Kuin admitted in a court document last year to directing the company not to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over several years.
In an email reviewed by Reuters on Monday, Hin Leong's liquidators said Singapore's High Court had accepted a request to freeze up to $3.5 billion of the global assets of the 79-year-old tycoon, known as O.K. Lim, his son Lim Chee Meng, and daughter Lim Huey Ching.
""Our lawyers will be following up with the next steps in the next few days including to require the Lim Family to disclose their assets on affidavit,"" Goh Thien Phong, one of the liquidators wrote in the email sent on Friday to more than 200 creditors of Hin Leong.
As part of what sources say is the biggest legal case in living memory in Singapore, creditors have been able to recoup just $270 million from the collapsed company and have been hunting for personal assets belonging to the Lim family, from Singapore to China to Australia, along with the liquidators.
The liquidators had asked the court to freeze the family's assets, from multi-million-dollar homes to shares, funds and country club memberships, to recover money owed to about two dozen banks and other creditors globally.
Last month, a Singapore prosecutor filed 23 additional forgery-related charges against Lim. Last year, police had charged him with two counts of abetment of forgery for cheating.
The court-appointed liquidators of Hin Leong, the Lim family and their lawyers, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. The Singapore High Court declined to comment.
Goh said in the email that the Lim family may file an appeal.
HSBC, DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), Bank of China and ICICI are among those that are together owed billions of dollars by Hin Leong, while some of the world's top commodity companies figure among its trade creditors.

The Lim family has sold millions of dollars worth of assets in recent months, including a stake in a prized Singapore oil storage facility and dozens of ships worth millions owned by their Xihe Group.
The elder Lim, who started his sprawling empire by delivering diesel in a truck in 1963, was once ranked among Singapore's 18 richest people by Forbes.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",Pressure to accept China vaccines intensifies as Taiwan battles COVID surge,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A surge in domestic COVID-19 cases in Taiwan after months of relative safety is intensifying pressure on the government to accept vaccines from China, as the island has vaccinated just 1% of the population with no immediate sign of new shots arriving.
The Chinese-claimed island and Beijing have repeatedly sparred over the pandemic since it began. 
Taipei accuses Beijing of spreading fake news and preventing its full participation at the World Health Organization, while Beijing says Taipei is playing political games with its people's lives by refusing Chinese vaccines.
Taiwan has only received about 700,000 vaccine doses to date, all from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, which are rapidly running out. It has millions more on order, including from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Over the weekend, Hung Hsiu-chu, a former head of Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said the government should allow in Chinese vaccines as soon as possible, saying that they are internationally accepted and that Taiwan cannot wait.
""At this moment, lives are at stake, and we respectfully tell the Tsai government: the real enemy is the virus, not the mainland,"" she said, referring to President Tsai Ing-wen.
The KMT, always wary of being painted as pro-China, has not explicitly backed or rejected the idea, but has called on the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) not to tar as Communist Party sympathisers those who are trying to obtain more vaccines.
Pressure is growing from industry too to address the issue, especially after China's Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said on Saturday it was willing to provide Taiwan with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccines.
A source familiar with the situation said major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn was exploring directly approaching Fosun for the shots to vaccinate its employees and their families, though the company had not formally started discussions with the Chinese firm or Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre.
Fosun has 10 million shots that are expiring in August and is anxious to offload them, the source added. Fosun did not respond to requests for comment.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, told Reuters that information on vaccines should come from the command centre.
""If we can do what we can to prevent the epidemic in Taiwan, then our company is willing to assist,"" it added.
Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said on Sunday that if companies wanted to buy vaccines they had to talk to his ministry.
Chen has said that China has not provided enough evidence that its vaccines are safe, and that most Taiwanese would not want to take them anyway. Chen has also said the law prohibiting the imports of any Chinese vaccine would need to be revised.
Beijing has called on Taiwan to cast aside political prejudices.
""Most Taiwanese compatriots are eagerly anticipating the use of mainland vaccines,"" China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement to Reuters, without offering evidence. ""The pressing task is to remove artificial political obstacles on the island.""
Taiwan's government has kept vaccine purchase details under close wraps, but has promised more are on the way. 

Chen met virtually with his U.S. counterpart, Xavier Becerra, last week and discussed vaccines, but no announcements of any U.S. help have come yet, even after President Joe Biden said the country would release stocks to other parts of the world.
However, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the United States was trying to help speed up deliveries of the vaccines Taiwan has already ordered.

The regulator added that the Irish airline had a ""seriously unfair conduct"" in cancelling planned flights, using the pandemic as the reason, and giving passengers vouchers rather than paying them back the price of their tickets. 

In past days, the authority had also fined British carrier EasyJet 2.8 million euros and Spanish airline Volotea for 1.4 million euros for the same reason, it said.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",U.S. investors look to Europe for next leg of stock gains,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -As U.S. stocks are hit with a bout of volatility, some investors are looking to European equities, attracted by lower valuations and the region’s nascent emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
European equity funds have notched their longest streak of net inflows in more than three years, according to data from EPFR, while fund managers globally surveyed by BofA Global Research said they are more overweight European stocks than at any time since March 2018. Morgan Stanley’s strategists, meanwhile, have named holding European stocks as one of their top trades. 
The focus on Europe comes as the region’s benchmarks have kept pace with their U.S. counterparts after years of underperformance. The STOXX 600 is up 10.7% year-to-date, broadly matching the S&P 500. The S&P 500 was off 1.7% from its record high as of Thursday, while the European index has slipped 0.8% from its peak.
""We have been more exposed to the U.S. over the past years and now we are becoming more interested in foreign equities,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management Company.
Investors see an opportunity as Europe's recovery begins to take root while the U.S. economic growth rate is expected to soon peak. European indexes are also more heavily weighted in the types of stocks expected to perform particularly well as the global economy bounces back, such as financials and industrials.
“Vaccinations are ticking up, you are likely to see restrictions come off and that should mean a decent economic recovery which will bleed into the markets in the euro zone,” Schutte said. 
After contracting in the first quarter, the euro zone's gross domestic product is expected to increase in the second quarter and post its fastest growth in the third, rising on an annualized basis by 9.2%, according to Oxford Economics. U.S. GDP, meanwhile, is expected to post its peak growth rate of 13.3% in the second quarter, after it expanded in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, nearly 48% of the U.S. population had received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, compared with almost 28% of the European population, according to Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.
“The story for the first few months of this year has been around U.S. exceptionalism,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""As we look through to the next three to six months, that may fade a bit especially if Europe continues to play catch-up.”
Many European stocks are also trading at relative discounts to their U.S. counterparts. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 21 times forward earnings compared with 16.7 times for the STOXX index, according to Refinitiv Datastream - a wider gap than on average over the past 10 years, although that difference has recently narrowed. Part of the gap stems from the fact that U.S. indexes are more heavily skewed towards tech and other growth stocks that tend to carry higher valuations. Those stocks have helped propel the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago and helped push S&P 500 performance ahead of European markets, but could fall out of favor as rising bond yields and inflation fears cut into their valuations.
Several factors could complicate the decision to shift into European stocks. With tech and internet giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continuing to put up strong profits, investors may be reluctant to cut back on a trade that has worked for years.
As inflation worries have hit U.S. stocks in recent weeks, there are also some concerns about euro zone inflation, which is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years.

Any setbacks to Europe's COVID-19 response and economic rebound also could undermine the case for equities there, investors said. So could a reversal in the dollar’s recent weakening trend, which would hurt U.S. investors seeking to convert profits in their euro-denominated assets back into their home currency. The dollar is down about 4% against the euro since the start of April.
""The next move we make is probably going to be to decrease the U.S. and increase international just because of the forces that we are seeing in the market,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut. But, Traynor added, ""when the dollar is moving up, that hurts you if you’re investing internationally.""

London-listed Cairn is involved in a long-drawn out tussle with the Indian government over tax claims and was awarded damages of more than $1.2 billion by an international tribunal late last year. 
New Delhi has filed an appeal against the decision it calls ""highly flawed"".
Citing government officials and a banker, Reuters and other media reported on May 6 that the finance ministry had asked state-run banks to withdraw the foreign funds on concern that courts abroad could order that assets in their jurisdiction - including bank accounts - be remitted to Cairn.
The ministry, which gave no comment at the time, called the reports ""false"" in a statement on Sunday, saying no such instructions had been issued.
""Government of India is vigorously defending its case in this legal dispute ... Constructive discussions have been held and the Government remains open for an amicable solution to the dispute,"" the statement said.
Separately this month, Cairn also sued India's flagship carrier Air India to enforce the arbitration award, according to a U.S. District Court filing reviewed by Reuters.
The international tribunal had ruled unanimously that India had breached its obligations to Cairn under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty and awarded Cairn damages of $1.2 billion plus interest and costs.

Indian authorities in 2014 had demanded 102 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) from Cairn for taxes it said were owed on capital gains related to the 2007 listing of the company's local unit.
""The Government has raised several arguments that warrant setting aside of the award,"" the finance ministry's statement on Sunday said.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan has told an Indian court it needs to continue production at its car plant to meet orders, rejecting claims from an employee union that COVID-19 safety protocols were being ignored at the factory, legal filings show.
Renault-Nissan India and workers at its plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu have been locked in a legal tussle after workers petitioned a court to halt operations because social distancing norms were being flouted and company-provided health benefits were outweighed by the risk to their lives.
In response, Renault-Nissan has argued in a court filing - which is not public - that there was a ""compelling need"" to continue operations to fulfil domestic and export orders. It said all COVID-19 norms were being followed.
The case will next be heard on Monday at the Madras High Court when the state government, which is also party to the case, is expected to file its response. 
A top Tamil Nadu state official told Reuters on Sunday automobile companies will be allowed to continue operations, but action will be taken against violations of social distancing protocols by any company.
The legal battle highlights the challenges big companies are facing to keep operating in India amid heightened worries from employees who fear for their health and safety. 
""It is a question of life versus livelihood,"" M Moorthy, general secretary of  Renault  (PA:RENA) Nissan (OTC:NSANY) India workers union which represents all 3,500 permanent factory workers, told Reuters. ""We just want social distancing protocols to be followed and the management to be responsible for any risks to the workers or their family members.""
The factory, which produces Nissan, Renault and Datsun cars, also employees 3,000 contract workers, 2,500 staff members and 700 apprentices.
Nissan, which has a majority stake in the Renault-Nissan India plant, declined to comment for this article.
India is currently facing its second wave of coronavirus infections. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst hit states recording more than 30,000 cases each day.
The state, an auto hub dubbed as India's ""Detroit"", has imposed a full lockdown until May 31 but has allowed some factories, including automobiles, to continue operating. 
Renault-Nissan's May 16 court filing shows it has pending export orders of about 35,000 vehicles for the May-October period, which if not fulfilled could lead to penalties and loss of business. It also has 45,000 pending domestic bookings for the recently launched Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger cars.

The company's petition says it has always prioritised employee safety and ""has left no stone unturned"" to ensure the infection does not spread.
""The travelling public consider private vehicles as a safe mode of travel ... there is a compelling need for the state to ensure the continued operations of the automobile manufacturers,"" the petition said.

(Reuters) - Flying at Mach 3 and reaching more than 55 miles above the Earth Saturday, British billionaire Sir Richard Branson's private spaceship company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc completed its first manned space flight from its new home port in New Mexico.
This is a milestone in Branson's near two-decades effort to create a commercial ""spaceline"" to take paying customers into outer space.
Touted as the first human spaceflight from the state, Branson's SpaceShipTwo craft lifted off in the desert about 45 miles northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, about 10:35 a.m.
About 50 minutes later, traveling at more than 2,300 miles an hour, it reached a height NASA recognizes as space and attained suborbital flight status.
""Welcome to space"" the company posted on Twitter.
Branson shared videos of the flight on social media and said on Twitter, ""Delighted to be on the flightline to Virgin Galactic's first human spaceflight from the majestic Spaceport America.""
On the flight deck were CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay who reached space, while Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci piloted a carrier plane that helped the craft lift off, the company said.
The space plane, which can hold six passengers, glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots about 11:45 a.m.
""The crew experienced extraordinary views of the bright, blue-rimmed curvature of the earth against the blackness of space ... Their experience today gives Virgin Galactic’s future Astronaut customers a glimpse of what lies ahead,"" the company said in a release.
Branson founded the company in 2004 and this is the third time his company reported reaching space.
The Washington Post reported that this flight comes at a critical time for Branson as his space venture is facing competition from billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder's own efforts to create a commercial spaceline.

Saturday's flight is the first time Branson's crafts have reached space in more than two years, when the company moved its operations from Mojave, California, to New Mexico.
Michael Colglazier, the CEO of Virgin Galactic, said in a statement: ""Today's flight showcased the inherent elegance and safety of our spaceflight system, while marking a major step forward for both Virgin Galactic and human spaceflight in New Mexico.""

(Reuters) -A federal judge on Friday grilled Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook over whether the iPhone maker's App Store profits from developers such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games are justified and whether Apple faces any real competitive pressure to change its ways.
Cook testified for more than two hours in Oakland, California, as the closing witness in Apple's defense against Epic's charges that the iPhone maker's App Store controls and commissions have created a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses.
App makers including music service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology, European regulators and U.S. politicians who question whether the company that once urged the world to 'think different' has now become too big and too powerful.
At the end of testimony, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) questioned Cook, pressing him to concede that game developers generate most App Store revenue and help subsidize other apps on the store that pay no commission. 
Gonzalez said the profits Apple reaps from game developers ""appear to be disproportionate.""
""I understand this notion that somehow Apple is bringing the customer to the dance,"" she said. ""But after that first time, after that first interaction, the developers are keeping customers with the game. Apple is just profiting from that, it seems me.""
Cook disagreed. ""The free apps bring a lot to the table. Only the people who are really profiting in a major way are paying 30"" percent commissions, he said.
Epic has tried to show that Apple's iPhone is a lucrative platform that locks in users, pointing to an internal Apple document that Epic alleges showed the App Store had 78% operating margins. Cook said the document did not reflect the full costs of running the App Store.
The testimony constitutes Cook's most extensive public remarks on the App Store, which anchors Apple's $53.8 billion services business.
Gonzalez Rogers also cited a survey that found 39% of software developers were unhappy with Apple's app distribution services.
""It doesn't seem to me that you feel pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act with developers,"" Gonzalez Rogers said.
Cook replied that ""we turn the place upside down"" to respond to developer complaints, but later conceded that he does not receive regular reports on how developers feel about working with Apple.
At the start of the three-week trial, Gonzalez Rogers also pressed Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney with tough questions https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-presses-epic-ceo-during-second-day-apple-antitrust-trial-2021-05-04 on how forcing Apple to change would ripple through the software world. Sweeney said he had not thought the issue through.
The maker of ""Fortnite,"" an online game which pits players against in each other in an animated ""Battle Royale"" fight to the last survivor, has waged a public relations and legal campaign against Apple.
Epic parodied Apple's iconic ""1984"" commercial and argued in court that it acts anticompetitively by only allowing approved apps on the world's 1 billion iPhones and forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment system which charges sales commissions of up to 30%.
See FACTBOX:

Apple has sought to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that its rules for developers are aimed at keeping its customers' information private and safe from malware.
""We have a maniacal focus on the user and doing the right thing by the customer,"" Cook said. ""Safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built on. Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people with tools to circumvent that.""

Phoenix World Trade, a company based in Panama and controlled by Venezuelan businessman Camilo Ibrahim, took over operation of Inditex stores in the South American country in 2007.
""Phoenix World Trade is re-evaluating the commercial presence of its franchised brands Zara, Bershka and Pull&Bear in Venezuela, to make it consistent with the new model of integration and digital transformation announced by Inditex,"" the company said in response to a Reuters request. ""The five stores which remain open… will cease to operate in coming weeks"".
Spanish group Inditex did not respond to Reuters' request for information about the closing measures. 
The closures come as Inditex, the world's largest clothing retail group, scales back smaller outlets worldwide in favor of expanding flagship stores, with 1,200 closures expected by the end of 2021.
Up to 700 stores are due to close in Europe, as well as 100 in the Americas and 400 elsewhere in the world.
In at least three large Venezuelan malls, the spaces formerly occupied by Zara and Pull & Bear - another Inditex brand - are empty, said two local retail executives. Both spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk publicly about the decision.
In the capital, three stores have closed in May, according to Reuters witnesses. The Zara stores open until last week in Caracas were offering items from the spring collection.
Ibrahim became Inditex’ local partner in 2007 to assist in dealing with changing local regulations and keeping shelves stocked as socialist former President Hugo Chavez' government exerted tight control over the foreign-exchange market, and businesses needed approval from the government to buy the dollars needed to import clothing. 
That occasionally left clothing stores empty as businesses struggled to obtain hard currency. 

Despite the decision to shut Zara locations, Venezuelan businessmen are currently allowed to import goods and sell them at hard-currency prices, a break from years of price controls on many key items. Luxury stores known as bodegones, and coffee shops that advertise prices in dollars, have surged as part of a chaotic economic liberalization.
The white walls blocking the entrance of a closed Zara store in Caracas announce the upcoming opening of a store by the name of Lola, an unknown brand in the country. According to local sources, Ibrahim's group will reopen those stores, without the commercial agreement with Inditex.

Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) was initially expected to launch flights in April, but its chief executive said last month that services would begin in July because talks with the European Commission over state aid had reached a stalemate.
CEO Fabio Lazzerini said he wanted flights to start in time for the busy summer season as low-cost rivals including Ireland's Ryanair expanded their services.
But Saturday's Corriere della Sera said the planned start date had now been pushed forward to September because of a lack of progress in the talks between Rome and Brussels.
ITA could, however, reach a deal with Alitalia that would allow it to start selling tickets for the old carrier while it waits for the EU go-ahead to buy the rest of the Alitalia's assets, the newspaper said.
No one at ITA could immediately be reached to comment.

Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, who is currently responsible for Alitalia's management, is due to meet EU Competition Head Margrethe Vestager in Brussels on Wednesday.

Fosun signed a deal with BioNTech to exclusively develop and commercialise COVID-19 vaccine products developed using BioNTech's mRNA technology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
BioNTech's development and distribution partner for the rest of the world is U.S. firm  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
Wu said certain groups in Taiwan he did not name had been in touch for an emergency purchase of vaccines and the company was willing to ""provide vaccine services to Taiwan compatriots"".
Since last year, Fosun has been promoting vaccines for Taiwan, Wu said, adding they hope shots can arrive on the island soon to help prevent a resurgent spread of the virus.
Fosun did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. 
Taiwan's government has said it is talking with BioNTech rather than Fosun, and that the two sides were on the verge of announcing a deal in December when BioNTech pulled the plug.
Taiwan has implied China was to blame for the failed deal, while China has blamed Taiwan for trying to circumvent Fosun.
BioNTech said in February it planned to provide the vaccine to Taiwan, but has not provided further details and declined to comment on the progress of talks in a statement to Reuters this week. 
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, and has repeatedly sparred with the island over the coronavirus pandemic. Taiwan has accused China of spreading fake news, which Beijing denies.

Taiwan has received only around 700,000 vaccine doses to date, all from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, and those are rapidly running out as it steps up vaccinations during a spike in domestic infections.
Taiwan has millions more doses on order, including from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, but like many other parts of the world has faced delivery delays due to global shortages.

An outgoing board member, Waseda University business professor Yuko Kawamoto, praised Son's willingness to listen to others but called on the group to ""develop an even better form of governance that is genuinely representative of SBG and its unique qualities.""

1505,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>",India's JSW Steel examining bid for Gupta's British business -sources,"By Neha Arora, Clara Denina and John O'Donnell
(Reuters) -India's largest steel producer, JSW Steel, is considering a bid to buy Liberty Steel in Britain as well as mills elsewhere, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as would-be buyers circle Sanjeev Gupta's global commodities empire.
JSW's interest, which extends to plants including Gupta's Adhunik steel mill in eastern India, could mark yet another chapter for Britain's steel industry, which has been privatised and sold to overseas buyers as its pre-eminence slid in lock-step with the country's manufacturing might.
In a statement on Saturday, JSW Steel said its focus remained in India for now and it was not looking at acquiring any overseas assets. 
A sale would chip away at Gupta's sprawling network of businesses, comprising hundreds of privately held companies with interests spanning steel, aluminium, mining, financial services and real estate, built up over years of acquisitions.
Gupta has been scrambling to refinance after his go-to source of funding, British supply chain finance firm Greensill, filed for insolvency in March. Britain's Serious Fraud Office said this month that it was investigating Gupta's businesses, including their links to Greensill.
Although JSW Steel, part of the metals-to-cement conglomerate JSW Group controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, was interested in bidding, one of the sources said, there were obstacles to any deal, including navigating the fallout from Brexit as well as India's coronavirus crisis.
And no final decision had been taken on whether to bid for what the source described as a ""surprise package"".
""The due diligence has not yet started. After Brexit, it will not be easy to operate these assets,"" he said.
A spokesman for GFG said it ""continues to serve its customers around the world and is making progress in the refinancing of its operations, which are benefiting from the operational improvements it has made and the very strong steel, aluminium and iron ore markets.""
Gupta was lauded as the saviour of steel in Britain who bought distressed assets in economically deprived areas. His group has 35,000 workers, including 5,000 in Britain, and annual revenues of $20 billion.
UK 'MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS'
Any change of ownership of Liberty Steel, which employs around 3,000 people in Britain, will be politically sensitive. 
Darren Jones, who chairs the UK parliament's business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said he expected any buyer to require ministerial clearance.
""Steel production can also be considered to be an important part of our economic resilience and national security,"" he said.
The government said it was ""closely monitoring developments around Liberty Steel and continues to engage closely with the company, the broader UK steel industry and trade unions"".
Private equity investor Endless and China's Jingye Group, which owns British Steel, were also interested in Gupta's business in Britain, said people familiar with the matter.
Separately, commodity trader Trafigura has expressed an interest in investing in GFG's aluminium smelter at Dunkirk in France, which is Europe's largest, said one source. 

JSW and Endless did not respond to requests for comment and Jingye's British Steel declined to comment. Trafigura, which provided a loan to GFG's Liberty House to help finance Dunkirk's purchase in 2018, declined to comment.
Gupta bought the smelter for $500 million from Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).

1506,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 09:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive-U.S. prepares to downgrade Mexico air safety rating, sources say","By David Shepardson, Frank Jack Daniel and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The U.S. government is preparing to downgrade Mexico's aviation safety rating, a move that would bar Mexican carriers from adding new U.S. flights and limit airlines' ability to carry out marketing agreements, four sources briefed on the matter said.
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) planned move is expected be announced in the coming days and follows a lengthy review of Mexico's aviation oversight by the agency.
Sources briefed on the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FAA has had lengthy talks with Mexican aviation regulators about its concerns. The sources said these concerns had not all been addressed following an in-country assessment.
The sources added that Mexican government officials have been informed about the planned action and raised concerns.
One airline industry source said the FAA's concerns did not involve flight safety issues but rather Mexico's oversight of air carriers.
Downgrading Mexico from Category 1 to Category 2 would mean that current U.S. service by Mexican carriers would be unaffected, but they could not launch new flights and airline-to-airline marketing practices such as selling seats on each other's flights in code-share arrangements would be restricted.
The action would mean that the FAA has determined that Mexico does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards as part of its safety assessment program.
Mexico has been a top vacation spot for U.S. travelers during the COVID-19 pandemic, spurring U.S. airlines to redirect capacity they had previously flown to Europe before transatlantic travel restrictions were imposed last year.
In April, Mexico was the by far the busiest foreign air destination - with nearly 2.3 million passengers on U.S.-Mexico flights - more than three times that of the Dominican Republic, the next highest country, according to industry data.
An FAA spokesman declined to comment. 
Mexico's Communications and Transport Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which has a codeshare arrangement with Aeromexico, will have to issue new tickets for some passengers booked on Aeromexico flights as a result of the downgrade, sources said.
Delta and Aeromexico declined to comment.
Delta and Aeromexico, joint venture partners since 2017, are together offering about 3,900 transborder flights in June, more than any other carrier, according to global data aviation company Cirium. Delta owns 49% of Aeromexico but took a $770 million charge on its investment last year after the carrier's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
Carlos Ozores, an aviation consultant at global consulting and digital services provider ICF, said the move could impact Delta and Aeromexico's codeshares, which drive incremental sales, and force growth-driven low-cost airline Volaris https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-volaris-idINL1N2IB2QA to revisit expansion plans to the United States.

This would not be the first time the FAA downgraded Mexico's air safety rating. In 2010, the agency downgraded Mexico to Category 2 due to suspected shortcomings within its civil aviation authority, then restored its top rating about four months later.
The FAA has said that downgrades mean an aviation authority is deficient in areas such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping and inspection procedures. Mexican authorities said in 2010 there was no deterioration of flight safety and that the downgrade was due to a shortage of flight inspectors.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",U.S. investors look to Europe for next leg of stock gains,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks are hit with a bout of volatility, some investors are looking to European equities, attracted by lower valuations and the region’s nascent emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
European equity funds have notched their longest streak of net inflows in more than three years, according to data from EPFR, while fund managers globally surveyed by BofA Global Research said they are more overweight European stocks than at any time since March 2018. Morgan Stanley’s strategists, meanwhile, have named holding European stocks as one of their top trades. 
The focus on Europe comes as the region’s benchmarks have kept pace with their U.S. counterparts after years of underperformance. The STOXX 600 is up 10.7% year-to-date, broadly matching the S&P 500. The S&P 500 was off 1.7% from its record high as of Thursday, while the European index has slipped 0.8% from its peak.
""We have been more exposed to the U.S. over the past years and now we are becoming more interested in foreign equities,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management Company.
Investors see an opportunity as Europe's recovery begins to take root while the U.S. economic growth rate is expected to soon peak. European indexes are also more heavily weighted in the types of stocks expected to perform particularly well as the global economy bounces back, such as financials and industrials.
“Vaccinations are ticking up, you are likely to see restrictions come off and that should mean a decent economic recovery which will bleed into the markets in the euro zone,” Schutte said. 
After contracting in the first quarter, the euro zone's gross domestic product is expected to increase in the second quarter and post its fastest growth in the third, rising on an annualized basis by 9.2%, according to Oxford Economics. U.S. GDP, meanwhile, is expected to post its peak growth rate of 13.3% in the second quarter, after it expanded in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, nearly 48% of the U.S. population had received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, compared with almost 28% of the European population, according to Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.
“The story for the first few months of this year has been around U.S. exceptionalism,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""As we look through to the next three to six months, that may fade a bit especially if Europe continues to play catch-up.”
Many European stocks are also trading at relative discounts to their U.S. counterparts. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 21 times forward earnings compared with 16.7 times for the STOXX index, according to Refinitiv Datastream - a wider gap than on average over the past 10 years, although that difference has recently narrowed. Part of the gap stems from the fact that U.S. indexes are more heavily skewed towards tech and other growth stocks that tend to carry higher valuations. Those stocks have helped propel the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago and helped push S&P 500 performance ahead of European markets, but could fall out of favor as rising bond yields and inflation fears cut into their valuations.
Several factors could complicate the decision to shift into European stocks. With tech and internet giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continuing to put up strong profits, investors may be reluctant to cut back on a trade that has worked for years.
As inflation worries have hit U.S. stocks in recent weeks, there are also some concerns about euro zone inflation, which is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years.
Any setbacks to Europe's COVID-19 response and economic rebound also could undermine the case for equities there, investors said. So could a reversal in the dollar’s recent weakening trend, which would hurt U.S. investors seeking to convert profits in their euro-denominated assets back into their home currency. The dollar is down about 4% against the euro since the start of April.

""The next move we make is probably going to be to decrease the U.S. and increase international just because of the forces that we are seeing in the market,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut. 
But, Traynor added, ""when the dollar is moving up, that hurts you if you’re investing internationally.""

1508,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 07:56PM ET</span>","Airbus to boost A220 jet's range, newest operator says","PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airbus will go ahead with plans to increase the range of its smallest jet, the A220, its newest operator said, allowing airlines to open more niche routes internationally.
Airline entrepreneur David Neeleman said last month he was discussing adding extra endurance to the jetliner with Airbus, which took over the Canadian-designed programme in 2018.
Speaking to Reuters on Friday as he launched his latest venture, U.S. startup Breeze Airways, Neeleman said a decision to offer the longer-range jet was now a given.
""It is under way, so we are ... kind of arguing about when. But it is not a matter of 'if,' it is just a matter of 'when',"" Neeleman said.
Airbus declined to comment. 
""We are always working with our customers and listening to their fleet needs, and we don’t comment on the status of our confidential discussions,"" an Airbus spokeswoman said.
The upgrade would require an extra fuel tank, which means Airbus would also have to increase the plane's maximum take-off weight in order to preserve and then improve performance. Airbus has already announced some increases in that metric.
""We need to get up to 4,000 (nautical) miles,"" Neeleman said. The A220-300 currently flies about 3,400 nm (6,300 km).
Breeze has ordered 60 of the 130-seat jets, sitting between smaller Embraer regional jets and the larger Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 7.
Neeleman declined to comment on a recent Reuters report that Breeze had already expanded this order by another 20 jets. 
Airbus reported the order without disclosing the name of the buyer, but industry sources have linked it to Breeze, making it potentially the second-biggest A220 customer.
Breeze, which aims to link underserved U.S. cities, will take delivery of A220s from October and use them on routes of two hours or more, including eventually international markets.
For shorter trips it will use older Embraer 190/195 aircraft inherited from Neeleman-founded Brazilian carrier Azul.
Neeleman said Breeze would take more Embraer 195s from Azul, allowing the Brazilian carrier to speed up deliveries of Embraer's latest E2 model.

Breeze's mixed fleet differs from the strategy of most budget carriers, which use one type to reduce expenses. 
Neeleman denied this would put Breeze at a disadvantage and said any ""small"" cost increase would be offset by the ability to open dozens more routes.

(Reuters) - Wall Street closed mixed at the end of a volatile week of trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average being the only bright spot, as inflation concerns loom over growth names. 
The Dow was lifted by industrial heavyweights, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).. Boeing jumped 3.1% as industry sources said the planemaker has drawn up preliminary plans to increase in 737 MAX output to as many as 42 jets a month in fall 2022.. 
Banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and JP Morgan , also supported the Dow.
The S&P 500 pared its earlier gains, down 0.08% to 4,155.86, marking the index's drop for a second consecutive week. Information technology and consumer discretionary led the selloff while economy-linked financials and energy posted biggest sectoral gains.
Analysts expect the rotation trades to continue to play out with the vaccine rollouts and reopening of the economy. 
""Once we get to the latter part of 2020, we expect to see a greater rotation out of technology and into more cyclical and defensive stocks as the recovery takes greater shape,"" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive at AXS Investments. 
Strong economic data has put pressure on growth stocks, which are more likely to be impacted by potential interest hike. IHS Markit's data showed U.S. business activity picked up in May amid strong domestic demand, but backlogs of uncompleted work are piling up as manufacturers struggle to find raw materials and labor.
Following a three-day slump, Wall Street's main indexes gained ground on Thursday after data showed the fewest U.S. weekly jobless claims since the pandemic-driven recession in 2020, pointing to a pickup in labor market.
Nasdaq Composite finished Friday down by 64.75 points, or 0.48%, to 13,470.99. Despite the weakness on Friday, the Nasdaq quit a four-week losing streak as investors continue to rotate around tech-related mega-cap shares, which recently took the biggest hit on inflation worries.
""Investors have to change their mindset and understand that tech is going to be a longer trade now. They're unlikely to see that 20% pop in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the next couple of months,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. 
Bitcoin dropped after China's Vice Premier Liu He said his government will crack down on the virtual currency's mining and trading activities. Cryptocurrency-related stocks such as Coinbase Global fell by 3.9%. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co surged by 6.7% in its biggest one-day gain since December after it announced plans on Thursday to form a battery joint venture in the United States with South Korean battery maker SK Innovation to support its electric vehicle rollout, confirming a Reuters report earlier. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp added 2.6% after announcing a four-for-one stock split, as it looks to make its stock less expensive for investors.
VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) slumped after the parent company of Vans and The North Face reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.08 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

In a filing https:// dated May 19, the SEC said Nasdaq's proposed rule change was consistent with the regulator's rules and regulations and could be beneficial to investors as an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.
The move is a big breakthrough for the exchange operator that has been pushing for an alternative for companies to raise money.
Reuters had reported in August https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nasdaq-direct-listing-exclusive-idUSKBN25L1BC that Nasdaq had filed with the SEC to change its rules to enable companies that debut on the stock market through a direct listing to raise capital. 
The latest rules will widen the options available to private companies that are looking to go public, but are wary of the role played by investment banks in the IPO process. 
Prominent venture capitalists like Bill Gurley have often criticized investment banks, which for decades have organized IPOs, for underpricing the offerings to help their clients reap large gains when the stock begins trading on the first day.
The new IPO alternative could also potentially attract companies that are currently looking to go public via deals with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), given the recent slowdown in blank-check dealmaking due to a cooling off in investor appetite and tighter regulatory scrutiny around SPACs.

In December last year, the SEC had approved a proposal by the New York Stock Exchange to let companies raise capital through direct listings. Prior to that ruling, the SEC allowed direct listings for companies that did not raise capital in the process. 
In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) was the first major company to go public through the direct listing route.

U.S. Treasury yields slipped as the market mostly shrugged off the data.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 61.5 in the first half of this month. That was the highest reading since October 2009, and followed a final reading of 60.5 in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 60.2 in early May.
Rising U.S. inflationary risks have spooked markets, and minutes on Wednesday from the last Federal Reserve meeting suggested some policymakers were ready to talk about reducing stimulus by tapering bond purchases.
On Friday, Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker said Fed officials should start talking about the best way to reduce their asset purchases ""sooner rather than later.""
But not all data has suggested the economy may be at risk of overheating.
Also, rising COVID-19 cases globally remain a concern. Official tolls showing the number of deaths directly or indirectly attributed to the pandemic are likely to be a ""significant undercount,"" the World Health Organization said on Friday, saying 6 to 8 million people may have died so far.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Want to know if your next new love interest has been vaccinated against COVID-19? Just check your favorite app.
The White House has partnered with popular online dating platforms such as Match, Tinder and Bumble to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated against the virus that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone.
With restrictions loosening across the country as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths decline, people are increasingly getting back to some semblance of normalcy in their lives, including dating.
President Joe Biden's administration has set a goal of getting at least one vaccine shot into at least 70% of U.S. adults by the July 4 Independence Day holiday. The partnership with dating sites is meant to attract young people otherwise reluctant to get vaccinated.
""Social distancing and dating were always a bit of a challenging combination,"" White House coronavirus adviser Andy Slavitt told reporters on Friday.
He said OkCupid, one of the dating sites, reported that people who display their vaccination status were 14 percent more likely to get a match.
""We have finally found the one thing that makes us all more attractive: a vaccination,"" Slavitt said.
The dating platforms, which cater to more than 50 million people in the United States, will offer badges showing vaccination status, free access to ""premium content like boosts, super likes, and super swipes"" for vaccinated individuals, and filters to potential hook-ups based on people's vaccination status, the White House said.
 Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH) confirmed the participation of its top U.S. brands including Tinder, Match, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, BLK and Chispa. Promotional campaigns will launch in coming weeks and run until July 4.
Shar Dubey, CEO of Match Group, said: ""We are honored to work with the White House on increasing vaccinations across America, which will allow people to once again meet in person and engage in meaningful ways. This will make dating safer for everyone, everywhere.""

To meet the 70% target as demand slows for vaccines, the White House this month announced partnerships with ride-hailing services Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT).
As of Thursday, the United States has administered about 279.4 million doses, with 48.2% of its people receiving at least one shot, according to the latest data https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1515,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>",Inside the race to find a COVID-19 treatment pill,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In early 2020, as a new deadly coronavirus began spreading around the world,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) assembled what it called a “SWAT team” of scientists and chemists to identify a potential treatment to fight COVID-19.
The U.S. pharmaceutical giant, which had begun exploring a vaccine, also wanted to produce a pill that could stop the infection from progressing, similar to how the widely-used Tamiflu drug fights influenza. The team scoured Pfizer’s library of molecules looking for unused compounds to help jumpstart the process, and quickly identified a promising candidate.
More than a year later, Pfizer has yet to embark on large-scale human trials of a COVID-19 oral treatment - something it says it hopes to start by July.
Pfizer and its rivals, including U.S.-based Merck & Co Inc and Swiss pharmaceutical Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF), are racing to produce the first antiviral pill that people could take at early signs of the illness. Their shared goal: filling a key treatment hole by helping people recently-infected with coronavirus to avoid becoming seriously ill and needing hospitalization.
But after almost 18 months of the pandemic, there is still no easy-to-administer treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That is despite the development of a number of effective COVID-19 vaccines, including one from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), which in December became the first to gain authorization for use in the United States.
Pfizer’s experience underscores the challenges drugmakers face in developing an oral treatment for the virus. Unlike a vaccine, which needs only to trigger the body's own immune system, an effective antiviral pill must block a virus from spreading throughout the body while also being selective enough to avoid interfering with healthy cells.
Testing antivirals is also difficult, drug company executives say. A drug needs to be given early in the course of an infection, which means finding trial participants who have recently contracted COVID-19. Many people infected with the virus develop only mild symptoms, but studies need to prove that a drug has a meaningful impact on patient health.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla has said the company could seek emergency authorization in the United States for a COVID-19 pill as soon as late this year. 
""Right now we have very good reason to believe that we can be successful,"" Bourla told an economic forum in Greece via video conference last week.
Pfizer and its rivals say the development process has been much faster than the several years it typically takes to produce a drug that can be taken as a pill.
Merck and Roche recently started late-stage human trials and have also said their drugs could be ready by later this year. Merck is developing its drug in partnership with biotech Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP and Roche is working with Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Governments around the world have poured billions of dollars into vaccine development, but Pfizer, Merck and Roche say they have not received government funding to develop oral antivirals for the disease.
‘HUNT FOR THE NEXT TAMIFLU’
While the rate of new COVID-19 infections is currently in retreat in some countries, others continue to struggle with a rapid spread of the virus. And with vaccines in short supply in many countries, much of the world will not be vaccinated for several years. Many people also remain reluctant to take vaccines.
Scientists forecast that COVID-19 – which has killed more than 3.5 million people globally - could become a seasonal disease similar to influenza.
""We need a pill that can keep people out of the hospital,"" said Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, a professor and infectious disease specialist at Harvard Medical School.
Doctors have tried a number of existing oral drugs in fighting COVID-19, but none of them have succeeded yet in rigorous clinical testing.
Currently, the only treatments shown to help COVID-19 patients avoid hospitalization are antibody drugs that require lengthy intravenous infusions and work less well against variants of the coronavirus.
Pfizer and its rivals say their oral antiviral candidates could be effective against a broad spectrum of coronavirus variants, but no relevant data has been made public.
For patients already hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment often involves steroids or anti-inflammatory drugs to manage symptoms of the infection, but these medications do not target the virus itself. The only antiviral drug approved in the United States to treat COVID-19 is Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) Inc’s remdesivir, which is delivered intravenously and used only for hospitalized patients.
Gilead is currently testing an inhaled form of remdesivir and is exploring other compounds that may be effective oral agents.
""We are all on the hunt for the next Tamiflu,"" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.
Tamiflu is recommended for people who have had flu for no more than two days and has been shown to shorten the duration of flu symptoms.
‘CHEMISTRY MASTERPIECE’
Pfizer’s scientists and chemists began hunting for an antiviral treatment in January last year. They quickly zeroed in on a compound from 2003, when the company had sought a treatment for the first global SARS pandemic, said Charlotte Allerton, Pfizer's head of medicine design.
The compound belongs to a class known as protease inhibitors, designed to block a key enzyme, or protease, essential to the ability of the coronavirus to multiply. Similar drugs are used to treat other viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis C, both on their own and in combination with other antivirals.
Pfizer’s scientists hit an early stumbling block. Laboratory (NYSE:LH) testing showed the drug candidate was active against the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, but concentrations were not strong enough to combat the virus in humans, Allerton said.
Pfizer continued working with the active component of that compound to formulate a drug that could be given intravenously. But antivirals are most useful if you catch a disease early, “and that isn’t easy with an IV drug,” said Allerton.
In March 2020, Pfizer scientists also started designing a new compound that could be absorbed through the stomach and taken as a pill, which they finalized in July, according to Allerton.
Discovering a protease inhibitor that could be delivered orally was ""a bit of a chemistry masterpiece,"" said Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten.
Antivirals are more complex to develop than vaccines because they have to target the virus after it is already replicating inside human cells, without damaging healthy cells. COVID-19 vaccines typically teach the human immune system to recognize and attack a portion of the “spike” protein that is specific to the coronavirus.
A COVID pill would likely be taken for only a few days, but drugmakers have had to move slowly to ensure safety.
TRICKY TRIALS
The Merck and Roche drug candidates use different mechanisms to Pfizer’s, and to each other, to disrupt the replication machinery of the virus. But the companies share similar challenges in testing.
One is ensuring a patient receives the drug soon after infection with COVID-19. “It's all about treating as early in the disease process as possible, when the virus is expanding,"" Pfizer’s Dolsten said.
And with vaccination rates high in some regions, trials have to be located in countries where COVID-19 is still on the rise.
In March of this year, Pfizer began early-stage human trials in the United States of its experimental oral COVID-19 treatment, known as PF-07321332. It followed a separate trial by the company of the intravenous drug started last fall.
Dolsten declined to comment on how the pending late-stage trials of either drug will be structured.
Merck’s antiviral drug candidate, called molnupiravir, recently had a setback. The company said last month it would not pursue its use in hospitalized patients. But Merck said it was moving the drug into late-stage trials of a narrow group of non-hospitalized patients - specifically those who have had symptoms for no more than five days and with at least one risk factor for serious disease, such as advanced age, obesity or diabetes. 

Merck said it could have definitive data by September or October.
Roche and its partner Atea are also limiting participation in their recently launched late-stage trial of their AT-527 drug to COVID-19 patients experiencing symptoms for less than five days. Atea said final trial results are expected before the end of this year.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Law firm Frank R. Cruz said on Friday it was participating in a lawsuit against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) over the Swiss bank's dealings with Archegos and Greensill.
The City of St. Clair Shores Police & Fire Retirement System, based in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, in April filed a class action lawsuit against the bank in federal court in Manhattan, accusing the Swiss bank of misleading investors and mismanaging risk exposure to high-risk clients, alleging violations of federal securities laws.
Credit Suisse has been plunged into crisis after losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos and suspending funds linked to collapsed British supply chain finance company Greensill Capital. The fallout has prompted internal and external investigations, sackings and a capital raise at Switzerland's second-largest lender, in what new chairman and veteran banker Antonio Horta-Osorio had described as his biggest challenge yet.
Its share price has fallen nearly 30% since the beginning of March, when it first disclosed issues related to its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds.

Credit Suisse investors have until June 15 to file a lead plaintiff motion in the lawsuit.
Credit Suisse declined comment.

So, with this, we think it is wise to now scoop up the shares of discount retailers Costco (COST) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). They are well positioned to benefit from the industry tailwinds. Read on.The COVID-19-pandemic-led restrictions were a massive obstacle for discount stores last year because supply chains and operations were disrupted.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -Planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has drawn up preliminary plans for a fresh sprint in 737 MAX output to as many as 42 jets a month in fall 2022, industry sources said, in a bid to extend its recovery from overlapping safety and COVID-19 crises.
The plans would lift output beyond an early 2022 target of 31 a month, which the sources said Boeing aims to reach in March. 
But implementation will depend on a cocktail of factors including demand, the uncertain capacity of some suppliers and Boeing's success in reducing a surplus of jets already built.
Boeing declined to comment and pointed to its latest guidance. Last month it reaffirmed plans to raise MAX output from an unspecified ""low"" rate to 31 a month by early 2022. 
Shares in the planemaker rose as much as 3.7% in early trading, outpacing a slightly firmer U.S. market.
Production was halted in 2019 after Boeing's fastest-selling model was grounded in the wake of fatal crashes. It resumed last May at a fraction of its original pace while Boeing navigated regulatory approvals and a fragile supply chain.
It is still awaiting the go-ahead from China after winning Western approvals late last year. Chief Executive Dave Calhoun has warned that the timing of remaining approvals will influence the shape of Boeing's final production ramp-up.
As an interim step, Boeing hopes to speed monthly output from single digits now to about 26 a month at the end of 2021 at its Renton factory near Seattle, two of the sources said. 
Higher production could inject much-needed cash into the supply chain and reduce Boeing's component costs.
The Puget Sound aerospace industry has already started to pick up steam. Sources say Boeing has been placing parts orders again, while fuselages can be seen heading by rail to the Seattle area from Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR)' Wichita factory.
STEEP CLIMB
That comes as demand for medium-haul jets such as the 737 MAX and competing Airbus A320neo begins to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, boosted by widespread vaccinations, especially in the busy U.S. domestic market.
However, several U.S. and European suppliers view output plans of both planemakers as optimistic, saying that concerns remain over the health of the global aerospace supply chain.
""The biggest risk that we can see with Boeing's plans is the inability of the supply chain to keep up,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote in a client note about Reuters' story. 
Boeing's efforts to restore production are also tied to the pace at which it offloads an inventory of parked airplanes that swelled during the nearly two years the MAX was grounded. 
The published target of 31 a month has already slipped from late 2021 to early 2022. 
In Europe, Airbus has ordered suppliers to get ready for higher output while warning them over quality glitches that can reflect overstretched supply chains.
Both plane giants are embarking on their steepest ever climb in output, drawing reassurance from accumulated parts inventory and the fact that their plants had already covered the same territory in the past, albeit at slower rates of increase.
But neither yet feels ready to return to the record volumes seen before recent shocks to the industry.
Before the 2019 grounding, Boeing was producing 52 MAX a month on its way to a target of 57. Airbus was making close to 60 of its A320neo airplanes a month before last year's lockdowns.

Airbus plans to raise output from 40 to 45 airplanes a month by end-2021. Reuters reported last week it had asked suppliers to prepare for 53 a month by end-2022. 
Output of larger long-haul jets remains depressed by a business travel slump and is not expected to recover soon.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) is set to report on Wednesday a 90% slump in full-year profit after the COVID-19 pandemic hammered its clothing sales.
Analysts on average expect the 137-year old M&S, one of the best known names in British retail, to report a pretax profit before one-off items of 43 million pounds ($61 million) for its year to April 3, down from 403 million pounds in 2019-20.
That outcome follows the group reporting in November a first half loss - its first loss since joining the stock market in 1926.
It reflects an expected 34% crash in UK clothing and homewares like-for-like sales, due to multiple lockdowns which shut the retailer's non-food space, slightly offset by an expected 1.2% rise in food sales.
All UK clothing retailers have been hit hard by the crisis. Last month Primark which does not trade online, reported annual profit was down 90%. Next, which has a huge online business, has shown greater resilience but its full-year profit still fell 53%.
In 1998, M&S became the first British retailer to make a annual pretax profit of over 1 billion pounds. It repeated the feat in 2008.
Chairman Archie Norman, along with CEO Steve Rowe, has been driving the group's latest turnaround plan.
They have looked to transform M&S's culture, have closed stores, increased the use of technology, and improved product and value to broaden the retailer's appeal.
Norman has called 2020-21 a ""lost year"" for the retailer's profitability. But even before the pandemic hit, M&S was still struggling.
A year ago M&S said the crisis would indelibly change its business and it would speed up its plan, delivering three years of change in one. In August it cut 7,000 jobs.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the outlook for the year ahead is more consequential than looking back at the past year.
""We will be interested in any colour as to how trading has developed in the early part of full year 2021-22 - there could be positive noises as stores have been able to reopen and because M&S faces weak comps from this time last year,"" they said.

Earlier this week, M&S promoted strategy chief Katie Bickerstaffe and food boss Stuart Machin to joint chief operating officers, marking them as the internal frontrunners to succeed Rowe.

So, are they still worth a closer look? Read on.The stock market has raced ahead since its major correction in March 2020. The U.S. economy has recovered steadily and has been delivering positive data over the past three quarters. In fact, domestic GDP registered a 6.4% annual growth in the first quarter of 2021, marking its second-fastest pace for growth since 2003. Among other favorable economic data, consumer spending is steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels, thanks to the fiscal stimulus packages, a better-than-anticipated mass vaccination drive, and steady job growth.
This improving economic health has translated into solid market momentum. All three major indexes have hit multiple highs over the past year and have continued to rise this year. Notably, the S&P 500 has returned 38.5% over the period. However, Wall Street has also been subjected to extreme volatility over the past few months. Amid this environment, many investors have turned to exchange traded funds (ETFs) because their broad and diversified exposure to securities helps them mitigate risk related to volatility and generate stable returns.

Financed largely by debt, Norwegian Air grew rapidly, serving routes across Europe and flying to North and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East before the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the budget airline into crisis.
Courts in Ireland and Norway had demanded the airline raise at least 4.5 billion crowns as part of a scheme to emerge from bankruptcy protection in the two countries on May 26. 
The private placement of new shares raised 3.73 billion crowns and was ""significantly oversubscribed"", the firm said in a statement.
The perpetual bond sale added 1.88 billion crowns from current creditors, while the rights issue to existing shareholders was oversubscribed and the final results are to be settled on May 25, the company said. 
The courts in Oslo and Dublin last month gave their approval for Norwegian to sharply cut its debt by converting it to stock so long as it raised the 4.5 billion crowns.
With the pandemic still curbing travel, the company then decided to try and raise an additional 1.5 billion crowns to bolster resources as it exits the restructuring process it began last December.
The survival plan brings an end to Norwegian's long-haul business, leaving a slimmed-down carrier focusing on Nordic and European routes. 
But Europe's airline industry faces a second summer holiday travel season hampered by travel restrictions and uncertainty.
Travel companies including EasyJet, TUI Cruises and IAG (LON:ICAG) have sold bonds to boost their balance sheets or refinance debt.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, raised 1.2 billion euros in a five-year bond sale on Tuesday. 

DNB, ABG Sundal Collier, and Seabury Securities LTD advised Norwegian Air on the capital raise.

(Reuters) -Deere & Co on Friday raised its full-year earnings on buoyant demand for farm and construction machines, but warned a global shortage of semiconductor chips posed a ""significant"" risk to its production schedule.
As the global economy roars back from the pandemic-induced recession, it is generating unusually high orders for parts and materials at a time when COVID-19 disruptions have caused capacity constraints all along the supply chain.
This has left manufacturers short of labor, steel, plastics, microchips and tires they need for their products, making it tougher to keep up with orders.
Deere (NYSE:DE) said it is ""cautiously optimistic"" of fulfilling customer orders. The company revised up raw material and freight costs for the year to $1 billion, from $500 million estimated in February.
Supply constraints mean farm equipment inventories, which are at a record low, will remain lean this year, it said.
However, a combination of higher farm income, the need to replace aging fleets and low inventory levels is expected to prolong equipment demand beyond 2021.
The world's largest farm equipment manufacturer said orders for large tractors now extend into next year.
""The current market dynamics, coupled with production constraints for the industry, point to a multi-year cycle for ag equipment,"" Cory Reed, head of Deere's Production & Precision Ag unit, told investors on an earnings call.
The Illinois-based company said net income in fiscal 2021 would be between $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion estimated in February. It is the second time in four months it has upgraded the outlook. 
Deere's shares, which have outperformed the S&P 500 with a gain of about 32% this year, were up 1.8% at $361.73 in afternoon trade.

The company expects industry sales of large agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada - its biggest combined market - to grow by 25% this year compared with growth of 15% to 20% estimated in February.
Earnings for the second quarter came in at $5.68 per share, up 169% from a year ago. Equipment sales rose 34% year-on-year to about $11 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Kentucky's state securities regulator is investigating plant-based plastics maker Danimer Scientific after a financial researcher told the office that the newly public company failed to make certain material disclosures.
The Division of Securities of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions told Reuters on Friday that it has ""launched an inquiry into the investor complaint related to Danimer Scientific.""
The regulator earlier this week sent a letter to activist short-seller Ben Axler, whose firm Spruce Point Capital conducts forensic financial research, saying it ""has opened a formal inquiry into the matter.""
Axler told Reuters he had approached the Kentucky regulator in early May to say Danimer failed to tell investors that it is subject to environmental regulations, which can be costly. Axler also said he told the regulator that Danimer, which has a production facility in Kentucky, revised numbers on air pollutants by 100% in certain months and again failed to alert investors.
The Kentucky regulator said it will not comment further on the matter ""until the review is complete.""
Danimer, which is headquartered in Georgia, said it will cooperate with any inquiries from the regulator. 
""Our company will not be distracted by these hapless attempts to undermine our contributions to solving the global plastic waste crisis. We stand by our disclosures and remain committed to educating and informing investors about our business,"" a Danimer spokesman said. 
Spruce Point has a short position in Danimer, betting the company's shares will fall. 
The company, which listed its stock in December after merging with a so-called blank-check company, quickly became a market darling as investors increasingly focus on environmental, social and governance issues, worrying about, for example, how plastic bottles are clogging rivers and oceans.
Danimer's share price surged 145% to a high of $64.29 in its first weeks of trading, as investors hoped its Nodax PHA product, the first PHA polymer verified to fully degrade in the ocean, would become a huge seller.
Hedge fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital listed Danimer as a top position in its last quarterly letter and index fund giants Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) are also big holders.
But over the last three months Danimer's stock price has tumbled 46% as doubts surfaced about Nodax and the company's financial data.
Spruce Point said in a report published in April, that ""there are several corporate governance red flags with Danimer's management team that should worry ESG investors."" In that report it said the stock should trade closer to $8.75 a share.
It was trading up more than 11% at $22.53 on Friday.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A responsible-investment arm of Canada’s Bank of Montreal sold roughly $275 million worth of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares because of the company's recent U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, a bank spokesman said on Friday.
BMO's responsible investment managers worried that the $22 billion Army contract Microsoft won in March moves the technology from a proof-of-concept phase to a battlefield-ready product outside its investment strategies' mandate, BMO representatives said. 
The contract ""sits at odds with our central investment philosophy to avoid companies with damaging businesses practices, and we class bespoke military equipment as one component of our avoid criteria,"" Jamie Jenkins, head of the Responsible Global Equities team at BMO, said in an e-mailed statement.
Microsoft representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Many traditional socially focused investment funds bar ownership of defense contractors or companies involved in areas like alcohol or gambling. BMO's move shows how such prohibitions can extend to technology companies doing business with government agencies.
On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) indefinitely extended a moratorium it imposed last year on police use of its facial recognition software due to civil rights concerns.
Over the past two years, Microsoft has worked with the Army on the prototyping phase of what is called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, or IVAS. The project is based on Microsoft's HoloLens product and backed by the Azure cloud computing services. In March the company said the Army had moved into the production phase of the project.

BMO will continue to own Microsoft in traditional investment strategies not bound to social-investing strategies, a spokesman said. 
A deal by BMO to sell its European asset-management business to Ameriprise Financial Inc (NYSE:AMP) for $1.1 billion remains on track to close in the fourth quarter, the BMO spokesman said.

Investing.com – AT&T (NYSE:T) was a gainer Friday as a pullback in its share price and the refocusing of the company on its telecom business prompted two upgrades.
As per a deal announced Monday, the HBO owner will merge its assets under WarnerMedia with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA). AT&T shareholders will get stock representing 71% of the new company with Discovery shareholders owning the rest.
UBS (NYSE:UBS) analyst John Hodulik raised the price target to $35 from $32 while putting a buy on the stock, up from neutral. The latest target is 16.7% higher from the stock’s current level of $30. The simplified structure and improved visibility create attractive risk-reward, he said.
Hodulik believes that while AT&T lowered its dividend by ~45%, the deal structure will provide an estimated ~$7-8 per share in one-time, tax-free payment (in the form of DiscoveryWarner shares), equating to 4-5 years of dividend payment in lump-sum, according to StreetInsider.
New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin also upgraded to a buy rating from neutral with a six-month target of $35, StreetInsider said.
The deal with Discovery will provide AT&T the much-needed cash to trim its $169 billion debt that ballooned by $21 billion in the March quarter alone. It will also help it focus on 5G, the next broadband frontier for telecom companies.
AT&T will receive $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt.

The Canadian rivals have been locked in a takeover battle for the U.S. railroad operator for two months to create the first railway spanning the United States, Mexico and Canada, as they stand to benefit from a recent pick-up in trade.
Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) last week accepted Canadian National's $33.6 billion offer, upending a $29 billion deal with its competitor Canadian Pacific.
The U.S. railroad on Friday said it paid Canadian Pacific a breakup fee of $700 million, which would be reimbursed by Canadian National.
Canadian Pacific said on Friday it was willing to re-engage with Kansas City, hoping that the rival bid would be shot down by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), a regulator that oversees railroad companies.
Canadian National's deal has recently run into regulatory hurdles, with the STB having denied its motion for approval of a voting trust earlier this week. The U.S. Department of Justice had also said last week that Canadian National's bid for Kansas City appears to pose greater risks to competition. 

Canadian National and Kansas City said they expect to gain all the required regulatory approvals, including that from STB.
Kansas City said the deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, following which its shareholders will own 12.6% of the combined company.

CLOV has been in the headlines due to its high-profile investors, while CNC is lesser-known. Patrick Ryan explains why CNC is the better buy.The healthcare sector has been a long-term outperformer as the healthcare sector takes an increasing share of the economy. This is due to costs rising faster than the pace of inflation as well as demand increases due to the aging population.
Further, the improving labor market is another catalyst as it tends to mean more customers. However, there's considerable competition in the space especially as new healthcare tech companies are attempting to disrupt the space by offering services and products that threaten the legacy companies.

This should bode well for two of the most prominent defense players— Lockheed Martin  (LMT) and Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). Since both companies have long-term contracts and are involved in evaluating emerging military priorities for governments, we think they are poised to generate substantial returns this year and beyond. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and The Boeing Company (BA) are two of the world’s largest aerospace, defense, and security technology companies. Founded in 1912, LMT operates through the following segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space. BA operates through four segments: Commercial Airplanes; Defense, Space & Security; Global Services; and Boeing Capital.
According to Deloitte’s 2021 aerospace and defense industry outlook, global defense spending is expected to grow by approximately 2.8% in 2021, crossing the $2 trillion mark. Heavy investments in research and development, as well as planned procurements of advanced military equipment to replace aging equipment have been accelerating the defense industry’s growth. Intensifying geopolitical tensions have motivated countries to strengthen their military capabilities significantly. Because defense spending is expected to remain stable, prominent players in the defense market—LMT and BA—are well positioned to benefit. While LMT has gained 3.8% over the past year, BA has returned 72.1% over the same period. In terms of their performance over the past three months, LMT is the clear winner with 14.9% gains versus BA’s 3.2%. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

However, this state of affairs may be about to change. Jaimini Desai identifies 4 concerning developments that indicate a deeper pullback may be in the works.Since the coronavirus lows set in March 2020, the S&P 500 is up an impressive 89.8%. The first few months of this rally featured outperformance from tech stocks, due to increased tech spending and remote working during the pandemic. Then, as the vaccines were announced, the combination of massive stimulus (already issued and in the pipelines) and the expectation of the economy reopening, led to accelerating economic growth for a few quarters. As a result, value and cyclical stocks roared higher, along with technology stocks. 
This dynamic changed in February, as tech stocks started to slip lower, while other parts of the market kept moving higher. In recent weeks, the market’s advance seems to have stalled while rotation to certain parts of the markets continues. To be clear, I believe that the market’s underlying fundamentals such as earnings growth, interest rate policy, and economic data continue to indicate that the bull market is in the initial phases of a multiyear move higher.
However, there are increasing signs that a deeper pullback may be brewing. As a result, investors in stocks and ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) should consider taking some risk off the table for the near term.

(Reuters) - Jeremy Barnum is not the hard-charging, power-hungry type that people often associate with those in the top echelons of Wall Street.
Instead, the man who this week became JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s finance chief is a studious, detail-oriented person who enjoys mentoring junior staff and does not let his ego get in the way of others' success, according to half a dozen associates who spoke to Reuters.
Barnum, 48, would fit in just as well teaching students in an elbow-patched sweater as presenting JPMorgan's strategy in a tailored suit, several said.
""He struck me as thoughtful, serious, and transparent,” said Boaz Weinstein, a hedge-fund manager who interacted with Barnum in the late 1990s when Barnum worked in JPMorgan’s credit trading business and the credit derivatives market was in its infancy.
""He was successful in building one of the top desks on the Street.""
JPMorgan declined to make Barnum available for an interview.
The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described Barnum as an ""extraordinary talent"" known for his ""deep intellect and integrity"" in announcing his elevation on Tuesday as part of a broader executive shuffling.
Barnum joined JPMorgan in 1994 and had been leading its global research division since February. Previously, he had been CFO of two business units and a trading executive.
Although he is known well in some parts of Wall Street and within JPMorgan, Barnum has made few appearances at conferences or meetings with regulators in Washington and is not the type to be spotted at prominent social events.
But behind the scenes, Barnum has been influential within JPMorgan, current and former colleagues said.
He is the kind of leader who likes interacting with the most junior employees and getting into the guts of businesses to understand how they operate, they said. He rarely makes an important decision without scrutinizing everything that transpired before an issue reached his desk.
It was not rare to see Barnum sitting at a junior staffer's desk, poring through Excel sheets to learn how they came to their conclusions, said Al Moffitt, JPMorgan's head of capital and liquidity management within the treasury department, who previously worked for Barnum.
""In the same morning that he has substantive conversations with the C-suite, he was presenting on Excel spreadsheet tips and tricks,"" Moffit said.
In 2005, JPMorgan let Barnum go in a broader restructuring of its credit-trading business, which had a rough prior year. He then headed the London office of hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management before returning to JPMorgan as a trader in 2007.
His star rose after JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns the following year, several people said. The bank needed people who understood the risks they were absorbing, and higher-ups took notice of Barnum’s talents, they said.
Barnum later became the “go-to person” when JPMorgan was implementing the post-crisis Volcker rule that required banks to prove they were not trading speculatively to earn profits.
Dimon once described the rule as something that required a trader, a lawyer and a psychotherapist to implement correctly.
""He knows how to tackle complex issues and breaks them down into simple to-do's,"" said Shahraab Ahmad, chief investment officer at hedge fund Decca Capital, who worked for Barnum after joining the bank as a trainee.

Barnum spent time as a youth in Spain, where he learned to speak Spanish fluently. He returned to prep school in New England and attended Harvard University.
Some who know him say that banking was not a preordained choice, calling him a ""real intellectual"" and noting he is married to an author and could just as easily have become an academic.

Seaboard in April sought to pursue a 10-1/2-month delay to the decision after U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen in Minnesota ruled against a Trump administration policy that allowed pork plants to slaughter pigs as fast as they want, as long as they prevent food contamination.
As the first U.S. pork company to invest in machinery to run slaughter line speeds faster under the rule, Seaboard stands to lose from the decision. 

Ericksen ruled on Thursday that Seaboard's attempt to intervene in the case came too late, though. The company, owned by Seaboard Corp, declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are ramping up scrutiny of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, with a hearing set for Monday as they consider legislation aimed at curbing liability protections for the industry.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has heightened its focus on SPACs in recent months through a series of public statements, new guidance and a Wall Street bank inquiry led by the agency's enforcement team. Republican Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana last month introduced a bill aimed at boosting transparency for investors in SPACs.
SPACs are shell companies that raise money via a listing to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, sidestepping a traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. Critics say banks and SPAC sponsors have reaped big payoffs at a cost to later-stage investors.
Monday's hearing in a House Financial Services subcommittee is aimed at SPACs, direct listings and IPOs, according to a hearing notice published on May 19. The House is considering legislation that would redefine ""blank check company"" from a key 1995 law to include special purpose acquisition companies, according to the notice.
The law created a safe harbor that protects listed companies from shareholder litigation provided forward-looking statements are made in good faith, identified as such and couched in cautionary language. 

The safe harbor does not protect IPOs or certain blank check companies, but sponsors have generally operated on the basis that it does apply to SPAC deals, and have leaned on it heavily to issue growth projections. The SEC has been mulling guidance that would curb these projections, Reuters reported earlier this month.
The prospects for the bill to become law are unclear, but it signals growing Congressional attention on the industry.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels has persuaded Washington to ease restrictions on exports of materials needed by German biotech firm CureVac to make its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, three people familiar with the matter said. 
EU officials said the decision will enable CureVac to produce vaccines until August and is part of a months-long effort by Brussels to get the White House to drop or ease some of its export curbs, following the election of U.S. President Joe Biden. 
Supplies beyond August, however, remain uncertain.
The U.S. Defense Production Act (DPA), a decades-old law, gives federal agencies the power to prioritise procurement orders related to national defence and to non-military crises. 
It has been deployed during the pandemic to put the U.S. government first in line to buy American-made vaccines and treatments and control the inputs that go into them.
CureVac relies on U.S.-imported filters and bioreactor bags to manufacture its vaccines.
The German company and other vaccine makers including the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest producer of vaccines by volume, have criticised the U.S. law for hobbling supplies of critical equipment for their vaccines.
The government intervention comes as drugmakers scramble to boost output of vaccines and concerns grow that low supplies in poor countries will slow the fight against the pandemic which has killed more than 3.5 million people. 
The German biotech confirmed it had received government help, but declined to give details of what was agreed.
""CureVac is grateful that with the help of the EU and U.S. officials, some critical issues could be resolved,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
It added that overall pressure on the mRNA vaccine manufacturing supply chain, which it relies on, remains intense. Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) use mRNA technology.
The EU is a major producer of COVID-19 vaccines, with more than 200 million shots made in the bloc having been exported to dozens of countries since December, about half of the total produced on the continent. But EU factories rely on substances and equipment made in the United States.
URGENT BOTTLENECKS
The arrangement for CureVac was the result of regular meetings between a White House COVID-19 taskforce led by Biden's aid Jeffrey Zients, and an EU team of experts chaired by EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton, aimed at easing urgent bottlenecks in vaccine production, two EU officials familiar with the discussions said.
The meetings addressed CureVac's bottlenecks, one of the EU officials told Reuters, while a second EU official said the effort has ""made sure that supplies from the U.S. continue to flow,"" allowing CureVac to ramp up vaccine production until August. They declined to be identified. 
CureVac is manufacturing vaccines ""at risk"" as it has yet to win approval in the EU for its experimental COVID-19 shot. If authorised, the vaccine would be distributed across the 27-nation bloc under a deal to supply at least 225 million doses.
""Since its creation in February the task force has been in contact with CureVac and its suppliers as well as with our American counterparts to resolve bottlenecks,"" a spokeswoman for the EU Commission said, but declined to comment further.
The White House declined to comment.
A U.S. official said that, under the arrangement with the EU, Washington is prioritising requests from EU manufacturers with approved vaccines, but CureVac, which has yet to win EU authorisation, would have priority over companies with earlier-stage vaccine candidates.
The source added that communication lines had been established to deal with CureVac's needs, though no delivery guarantees were given.
PARTIAL SUCCESS
The CureVac case comes as a debate rages over the impact of trade barriers and patents on vaccine production.
The Biden administration earlier in May joined India, South Africa and many other developing countries in calling for a temporary waiver of patents, in the hope that would boost production.
EU nations and other vaccine-making countries have opposed that and urged instead the removal of U.S. trade barriers that they consider the main bottleneck preventing a ramping up of global vaccine production.
The EU-U.S. talks, however, have so far failed to convince Washington to end the use of the DPA for vaccine products, the EU officials said. They have also not persuaded the United States to export finished jabs to the EU.

Merck KGaA, one of the world's largest suppliers of lab gear and materials, this month said the DPA posed a challenge amid soaring global demand.
It is investing in U.S. and French sites that make vaccine production gear but the added capacity in France will not come on stream before year-end.

MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit has decided to skip the payment of coupons on some financial instruments, in a U-turn that sent the bond in question into a tailspin and hurt some other debt sold by Italy's No. 2 bank. 
In presenting full-year results in February, Finance Chief Stefano Porro had told analysts the bank expected to pay a coupon on the legacy bond it issued over a decade ago, as well as on Additional Tier 1 bonds.
But a spokesman on Friday said UniCredit would not do so after posting a 2.79 billion euro ($3.4 billion) loss last year.
UniCredit has withheld coupon payments on the CASHES notes in the past after ending the year in the red, but the latest decision, taken by new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel barely a month after his arrival, took bond investors by surprise. 
""We review our approach on a regular basis, in particular, with the recent management change, we reviewed it internally and took a decision coherently with our approach in the past and the terms and conditions of CASHES,"" the spokesman said.
A reported loss is one of the conditions which allow UniCredit to forego payments on the 2.98 billion euro convertible and subordinated hybrid equity-linked securities, dubbed CASHES, issued in 2008 to bolster its capital reserves.
The withheld interest payments amount to 120 million euros for 2021. (Graphic: Unicredit (MI:CRDI) CASHES bonds tumble on coupon shock, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvywrjjvg/UniCredit%20bond%20shock.png) 
The cash price of the notes traded over the counter fell to 50.47 from 60.83 just two days ago, before the CASHES' fiduciary bank informed investors of the decision, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.
Bond investors have worried since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis that banks may opt not to pay coupons on some debt where they have the option to defer payments. 
These fears were fanned by regulatory restrictions on dividend payments, which investors thought might be extended to CoCo bonds as well. 
Citi analysts played down the implications of the decision on the CASHES instruments for UniCredit's capital distribution policy.
""While this can be a negative surprise for the CASHES bond holder, this should not affect the bank's ability to pay dividends on 2021 profit nor impact the announced buyback,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
UniCredit paid out 268 million euros to investors as dividends in April and is currently conducting a share buyback worth 179 million euros which it expects to conclude by the end of September.

Shareholders in April approved an additional 652 million euro buyback subject to current pandemic-induced regulatory restrictions on investor remuneration ending after Sept. 30.

Investing.com – Shares of VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC), which recently acquired Supreme, were down over 7% Friday after reporting an earnings miss and margin erosion for the fourth quarter even as revenue topped estimates.
On the issue of supply chain, a critical situation that has plagued many manufacturers and retailers with several countries still locked down, the company said governmental restrictions have resulted in isolated product delays and that it is working with suppliers to minimize disruption.
VFC, which also owns the The North Face, announced earnings per share of $0.27 on revenue of $2.58 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.28 on revenue of $2.51 billion.
Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 52.1% for the quarter ending March. The company blamed this on elevated promotional activity to clear excess inventory and the timing of net foreign currency transaction activity. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage points.
The company forecast fiscal 2022 EPS of $3.05, versus the consensus of $3.02, according to StreetInsider. The sales estimate of $11.8 billion compares to the consensus of $11.41 billion.
VF Corporation completed its acquisition of red-hot streetwear brand Supreme, which had been a privately-owned, for $2.1 billion. The company’s net income came at $89.52 million, a swing from a net loss of $483.77 million in the same quarter a year.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. investors flee to money market funds in the week ended May 19-Lipper,"(Reuters) - U.S. money market funds lured massive inflows in the week ended May 19 as investors turned risk averse on concerns over higher inflation levels and chances that the Federal Reserve might scale back its monetary support measures.
Refinitiv Lipper showed U.S. money market funds received a net inflow of $25.34 billion, a four-fold increase over the previous week. 
U.S. inflation-protected bonds also were in demand, as they received inflows worth $1.37 billion.
The U.S. Fed minutes published this week said ""a number"" of officials thought that if the recovery holds up, it might be appropriate to ""begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases"".
Overall, U.S. bond funds obtained $2.83 billion, the lowest in 10 weeks, with taxable bond funds getting inflows of $2.15 billion and municipal bond funds receiving $485 million.

In particular, U.S. tech funds had a net selling of $2.1 billion in the week.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares were up 2% in Friday’s premarket following a Reuters report that said the maker of the 737 MAX has drawn up preliminary plans to raise output of those jets to as many as 42 units a month in fall 2022.
The plans would extend the U.S. company's recovery from overlapping safety and COVID-19 crises and lift output beyond the March 2022 target of 31 a month, the report said.
The development comes soon after the plane manufacturer secured on May 13 a much-awaited regulatory nod for an electrical fix that had kept some 100 of its 737 MAX series grounded.
The electrical problem has kept Boeing’s popular 737 MAX planes suspended for an extended period.
Two accidents in 2018 and 2019 forced authorities to ground 737 MAX, which was at the time Boeing's biggest money maker in a booming market for narrow body planes. The 20-month safety ban was lifted in November after the company made the fixes.
But the flights were halted in April after a separate electrical issue led the manufacturer to stop deliveries of the planes with an advisory to its clients not to fly those in their fleet.
While Boeing gets its act together, rival Airbus (PA:AIR) too is preparing to produce more A320-family planes that compete with 737 MAX.
A May 11 Reuters (TSX:TRI) report said Airbus had asked key suppliers to get ready for a further 18% increase in A320-family jet output by the end of 2022, on top of existing targets for this year.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland may adopt a COVID-19 certificate to help citizens move more freely across the European Union earlier than late July, as previously flagged, amid mounting pressure from airlines and employers to reopen foreign travel.
Ireland has the strictest travel restrictions in the 27-nation bloc. It advises citizens against non-essential travel, imposing fines on people heading to airports to go on holiday and a two-week mandatory hotel quarantine for arrivals from a number of countries.
While Irish ministers have said it will be late July or early August before they put the EU's so-called ""green certificate"" into operation, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said on Friday that it could be earlier.
""The finalised date is being worked on and will be announced next week. The government's view is that we want to participate in this as early as possible,"" Donnelly told RTE as EU leaders look to finalise discussions to enable the certificate to be operational by June 21. 
The head of global industry group IATA, Irishman Willie Walsh, said on Wednesday Ireland's air connectivity was likely to shrink by 30% and may need five years to recover from Europe's most ""repressive"" travel restrictions.
International Airlines Group-owned Aer Lingus shut its cabin crew base at one of Ireland's largest airports this week, while Ryanair has said it will give priority to other European markets in the coming months and base fewer planes in Ireland.
The Irish chief of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Friday that mandatory hotel quarantine had created a difficult environment for Ireland's big multinational employers. 
The United States is one of 56 countries from which people arriving in Ireland must pay almost 2,000 euros each to quarantine for up to 14 days in a secure hotel.

""Many felt, especially at the beginning when it was applied to people even if they were fully vaccinated, that it was excessive and potentially even a little discriminatory,"" Gareth Lambe told an American Chamber of Commerce Ireland event
""That was definitely a bit of a hiccup so it's really, really important that we have a clear roadmap on how we're going to open up travel again,"" said Lambe, currently the chamber's president.

""The proposed capital raising seeks to take advantage of favourable market conditions and the bank's strong financial position,"" Alpha Bank said in a bourse filing.
The bank said it viewed prospects for the Greek economy as ""especially positive"" and wanted to support the government's efforts to boost economic growth and attract foreign investment.
The announcement drove Alpha's shares down 30% to 0.868 euros on the Athens stock exchange, dragging the bourse's banking index down 14.9% to 482.85 points.
Since mid-March, Greek bank shares had climbed about 22% to a peak of 635.72 points on the index, before a correction started this month.
""It's a pretty standard reaction amidst fears of dilution as new shares are issued at discounts to the prevailing market price,"" said a banker who declined to be named. 
Alpha Bank's total capital adequacy ratio was reported at 18.4% at the end of December while its core equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 17.3%.
""This is not about dealing with a capital shortfall, it is not a recapitalisation. But Alpha's equity story needs to be explained,"" the banker said.
Alpha Bank says it has already has adequate capital buffers to further reduce the risks in its balance sheet from impaired loans.
""This will be the first capital boost for growth by a Greek bank in years,"" said another banker. ""Alpha sees a unique opportunity to fund an expected investment-driven growth phase in Greece with new loans that will boost its profitability.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The transition to zero-emission fuel cell trucks will slash about half the jobs at Europe's truck engine plants in the next 15 years,  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck Chief Executive Martin Daum said on Friday, urging policymakers to prepare for that now. 
Truck makers are moving towards a zero-emission world as hitting sustainability targets becomes more important for their customers but the fuel cells have fewer moving parts and require less labour to make than combustion engines.
""We have to be cognizant that about 50% of the jobs will go away because a fuel cell and a battery are far less complex than a diesel engine and a transmission today,"" Daum told Reuters. 
""But the good thing is, we have a transition period of about 15 years and we have to start preparing for that today.""
The world's largest truck maker is going ""all-in"" for electric and hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles and on Thursday said zero-emission vehicles should make up 60% of its sales by 2030 and 100% of sales by 2039.
However, Daum said building hydrogen fuelling infrastructure is crucial to persuade sceptical fleet operators to buy the trucks that will help Europe meet its climate goals.
""If we already had the trucks today that we will have in 2025 and beyond, we wouldn't sell a single one. Why? Because we have no hydrogen fuelling network,"" he said.
This week Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn)'s truck unit announced an agreement with Shell (LON:RDSa) under which from 2024 the oil major will launch heavy-duty hydrogen-refuelling stations between the green hydrogen production hubs at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and in Cologne and Hamburg in Germany. 
The German company and rival Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY) last month called for EU policies to boost fuelling infrastructure.
""The fear of running out of power is the issue where the customer is the most sceptical,"" Daum said. ""The decisive edge will be the availability of fuelling infrastructure.""
Carmaker Daimler will spin off Daimler Truck later this year as it seeks greater investor appeal as a focused electric, luxury car business.
Ahead of that spin-off, Daimler Truck said this week it would focus on raising profit margins by 2025, in particular in Europe.

Daum said the company's problems in Europe revolved around cutting product costs and improving its service quality. 
""We have a good product in Europe, it's too expensive to produce,"" he said. ""So we have to get the complexity out of the product.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Start-up low-cost U.S. airline Breeze Airways on Friday said it would begin service next week, focusing on flights between smaller U.S. cities that don't have direct service from larger carriers.
The airline is founded by David Neeleman, his fifth commercial airline start-up including JetBlue and Canada's WestJet.
Breeze, which originally went under the launch name Moxy, is beginning service as U.S. air travel demand hits new post-pandemic highs and is focusing on leisure travelers ready to exit months of working at home during COVID-19.
Breeze will have 39 nonstop routes between 16 cities by July. The first flights will operate between Charleston, South Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and Hartford, Conneticutt starting May 27.
Neeleman notes 95% of Breeze's routes have no nonstop airline service, arguing larger airlines will not be able to undercut Breeze.
""If I'm charging $39, are they going to charge no dollars and fly you through a hub?"" Neeleman asked in an interview. ""People focus on fares, but it is equally important to have a convenient flight, where you can get there in an hour instead of three hours."" 
Neeleman said with more Americans working remotely, they can live near smaller airports and still have options for direct flights.
Neeleman vows Breeze will be ""the nicest airline in the world"" and fares include both ""Nice"" or ""Nicer"" seats with extra legroom.
Breeze said in a filing with U.S. regulators that ""by flying a smaller aircraft with a lower trip cost, there are hundreds and hundreds of city pairs that can support a nonstop flight.""
It aims to focus on underserved U.S. cities starting with 13 older Embraer 190/195 jets, some inherited from Brazil's Azul, another Neeleman venture.
Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Breeze will focus on Tampa, Charleston, New Orleans, and Norfolk, Virginia. It will serve other cities like Louisville, Kentucky; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Akron, Ohio, and fly three or four flights a week on most routes. 
Breeze will take delivery of 60 new Airbus A220s, beginning in October, at a rate of about one per month for five years. Longer A220 flight routes will be announced this fall.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>","Generalist funds flow back into mining as prices, inflation climb","By Zandi Shabalala and Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - Surging prices for commodities, stronger balance sheets and rising inflation have lured back to mining stocks generalist investors that for years shunned the sector, data shows.
Shares in diversified mining companies Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), BHP,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) have doubled in the last year, as policy support measures in advanced economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic stoked inflation.
Commodities serve as a hedge against inflation, meaning their prices are expected to stay strong, and at the same time the transition to a low carbon economy and channelling of stimulus funds into infrastructure is generating demand for raw materials. 
The size of natural resources mutual and exchange-traded funds tracked by Refinitiv Lipper data exceeded $70 billion by the end of April for the first time since September 2018 at $72.4 billion. (Graphic: Assets and flows of funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yxmvjmxdopr/Assets%20and%20flows2.jpg) 
Many generalist investors - or money managers whose focus is not solely on mining companies - fled the sector when a commodity boom crashed in 2015 as China's appetite for raw materials slowed down.
""The inflation fears and metals price action has brought investors back to mining stocks,"" said London & Capital head of equities Roger Jones, whose fund holds mining stocks.
A Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey of fund managers published in May found that a net 21% of European investors participating in it were overweight metals and mining versus a net 56% that said they were underweight a year ago. 
The survey found fund managers were underweight defensive sectors such as utilities and pharma. 
This is not only visible in Europe, as several hedge funds have piled into Canada-listed Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) Ltd, for example, U.S. regulatory filings show. (Graphic: Miners vs FTSE, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdpzognwvw/minersvsftse.JPG) 
AVOIDING BOOM AND BUST 
Miners have learnt a hard lesson since the last boom, when they overpaid by billions to buy assets, sometimes in complex jurisdictions or difficult geologies. 
By maintaining discipline on costs, spending and acquisitions, they cut debt and gave shareholders dividends that have become loftier as commodity prices rose.
Prices for copper, which is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower carbon economy, hit a record this month, while battery minerals nickel, lithium and cobalt have also jumped.
Sell-side analysts have hailed the latest rally as the beginning of a supercycle, but some fund managers caution against too much enthusiasm, as supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 restrictions ease, potentially curbing prices.
""Supply chains are still not working as smoothly because of COVID lockdowns, so we have to wait until there is a normalisation to get a better idea of what is really driving commodity prices,"" said Ben Ritchie, head of European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
Fund managers also said China was not consuming as much metal as it was during a 2000-2008 supercycle, and mining stocks are trading on low multiples compared to tech for example, which suggests broader scepticism that prices can be sustained.
Another concern for investors has been the level of risk associated with mining that has led to environmental disasters and legal action.
As ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria have shot to prominence, miners have drawn up sustainability reports and ethical and green targets that may reassure some investors.

""ESG has been a challenge for miners to adapt to, but it is arguably the best thing that has happened to the mining sector,"" said Janus Henderson fund manager Tal Lomnitzer, whose funds hold Anglo American and copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).
""Decarbonisation should bring in those investors who would otherwise avoid the sector.""

1570,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>",Oil drillers and Bitcoin miners bond over natural gas,"By Laila Kearney
(Reuters) - On U.S. oil patches stretching along the Rockies and Great Plains, trailers hitched to trucks back up toward well pads to capture natural gas and convert it on the spot into electricity.
The trailers - carrying pipes, generators and computers - are called “mining rigs.” But their owners aren’t there to drill for oil. They are using stray natural gas unwanted by oil companies to power their search for another treasure: cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies are virtual coins exchanged without middlemen, such as central banks, to purchase goods and services. Extracting the currency from cyberspace, however, requires vast amounts of often-expensive electricity. Supercomputers must run constantly in a race against other “miners” to solve complex math problems in order to unlock digital vaults holding the currency.
Placed in mobile trailers, these supercomputers run as hot as 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius), and in the cold of western North Dakota, people stay warm just by sitting near them, cryptocurrency miners say.
The miners are increasingly sending these rigs out to oil fields because it’s one of the cheapest ways to obtain the energy they need. Oil and natural gas come from the same wells, but at these sites, drillers are seeking crude oil and have no pipelines to get the gas to market. That typically forces them to burn it off in a process called flaring - creating carbon dioxide emissions - or to vent it into the atmosphere directly as methane.
""The sweet spot for us is stranded, low volumes of gas that don't justify a pipeline,"" said Steve Degenfelder, land manager at Wyoming-based producer Kirkwood Oil and Gas LLC, which has formed an alliance with Bitcoin miners.
Oil companies face pressure from investors and government officials to reduce emissions that lead to global warming. Sometimes they give the gas away for free to cryptocurrency miners; other times they sell it.
""Oil and gas companies don't like to flare their gas - that's money that's burning away,"" said Degenfelder, which works with miners connected to EZ Blockchain, a Chicago-based energy and technology company, to cut flaring at some of its 600 oil wells across the Rocky Mountains.
HIGHLY UNCERTAIN
Some environmental advocates and investors say cryptocurrencies are not a long-term solution to unwanted natural gas emissions, both because the currency’s future is highly uncertain and because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency companies produce their own emissions.
The global Bitcoin industry’s overall C02 emissions have risen to 60 million tons, equal to the exhaust from about 9 million cars. That’s up from 20 million tons from two years ago, according to a March report by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts.
Values of Bitcoin, the best known cryptocurrency, plunged from record highs after billionaire Elon Musk tweeted that his electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc would no longer take the virtual coins as payment, citing concerns over ""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions.” The currency plunged in value https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/bitcoin-is-now-worst-all-financial-worlds-2021-05-19 over two weeks before starting to recover Thursday.
Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, the Boston-based clean-energy investor group, said there are better ways to use stranded gas, including to power hospitals and schools. However, that would require building pipelines to carry the product out of the oil patch, he said.
""I think we need much more durable and long-term solutions that really bring that gas to market and let it be used for whatever its highest purpose is,"" he said.
Proponents say the new oil-cryptocurrency alliances in North America move mining for virtual coins away from Asia, home to more than 60% of such operations, which largely rely on coal-powered electricity. Coal combustion produces roughly twice as much C02 as natural gas.
""It helps cut emissions at (an oil) producer level, but also globally by reducing mining in parts of the world where coal is likely the power source,"" said Mark Le Dain, vice president of strategy at oil and gas software company Validere Technologies Inc, which tracks energy molecules and their use.
Environmental advocates and some investors note, however, that the harmful emissions don’t disappear - they are transferred from one industry to another.
""It's not like you're eliminating the emissions, it's that you're turning them into this other thing, Bitcoin,” Logan said.
CATCHING IMAGINATIONS
The allure of Bitcoin remains for miners despite the challenges of cryptocurrency markets. Even after the recent price crash, a single Bitcoin was worth more than $40,000 on Thursday - almost 90 times its value five years ago, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Some cryptocurrency mining companies say the mobility of their natural gas-fueled operations is key, giving them flexibility to draw natural gas from different sites as it becomes available.
""The idea that you could plug in these (computers) and then take them somewhere else just really caught my imagination,"" said Haley Thomson, a former electricity trader and president of new cryptocurrency mining company Imperium Digital.
A variety of business models have been born. In some cases, cryptocurrency miners pay the oil firms for their natural gas wholly or in part using the coins they mine. In the case of Kirkwood, EZ Blockchain uses stranded natural gas to make Bitcoin, giving it all to Kirkwood. EZ Blockchain makes money by supplying equipment and mining services for a fee.
Industry experts and academics who study energy uses say there are fewer than 10 large-scale Bitcoin mining companies in North America that run on stranded natural gas. Many cryptocurrency miners run smaller operations in the United States and Canada - some fueled by a single well.
But some major oil companies have signed on.
In North Dakota, a top oil-producing state, Norway's Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) and Canada's  Enerplus  (NYSE:ERF) Corp are among those that have used such mining to reduce flaring, company spokespeople confirmed to Reuters.
Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems Inc is one of the continent’s largest Bitcoin mining companies using otherwise stranded gas. It expects to double its current staff of 55 this year, said Cully Cavness, co-founder and a former oil and gas engineer.
Crusoe has about 40 mobile containers in oil shale basins. It plans on increasing that number to 100 after receiving $128 million in financing last month from investors including Chicago-based firm Valor Equity Partners LP and Lowercarbon Capital.
Crusoe’s partners have included Kraken Oil & Gas Partners LLC, which produces about 10,000 bpd of oil, making the company the largest oil producer in Montana.
""We're going to need a lot more people,"" Cavness said.
Meanwhile, government regulations and incentives are in the offing that could benefit oil and cryptocurrency companies. 
The U.S. Senate passed a measure in April to reverse former President Donald Trump's weakening of methane emission regulations. That could fuel the use of Bitcoin mining to cut flaring, academic experts said. Lawmakers in Texas and New Mexico also are looking to crack down on emissions.

North Dakota and Wyoming this year passed laws that give tax breaks to oil producers that provide gas to cryptocurrency and other data miners that would otherwise have been flared.
""I think it's gonna be a big chunk at what we look at for the future in North Dakota,” said state Senator Dale Patten, who authored North Dakota’s bill.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",Will bankers embrace sensors under their desks when they return to work?,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reservation systems for seats. Algorithms that say whether a location is crowded or not. Cameras to show what's happening in real-time. Trackers that let others know you are there.
    Technology that has swept the world for convenience, curiosity, and accountability is arriving at workstations of U.S. bank employees, as they prepare to return to offices in coming months because of the pandemic easing, industry sources and outside vendors said.
    Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC plan to have workers commute to buildings in New York and other U.S. cities as soon as this month, after more than a year of largely work-from-home situations.
    But not everyone can return at once: banks will have to extend practices like those used for small teams of traders during the pandemic. Shifting rotations of people will pass through giant buildings on different days, without clustering in the same areas on the same floors, to avoid spreading COVID-19.
    Some of the banks are implementing systems where employees will book ""hot seats"" on particular days and be monitored while they are sitting at them, sources said. 
    In some buildings, that could mean cameras that monitor a room's occupancy level and even sensors that tell building management whether someone is sitting at a desk.
    ""That feels a little personal,"" one bank employee said about desk sensors. 
The comment reflects a sentiment that some banks could face as they bring in tech that monitors employees more closely after an unprecedented period of working from afar: they are okay booking dinner reservations online, sharing locations with friends, live-streaming videos or wearing activity trackers for their own health, but not necessarily okay with having their employers knowing when they are seated at a desk.
    Employees will need to get over these hang-ups because the technology is necessary for safety and saves companies money, industry sources and consultants said. 
    ""We have to be more mindful about how space is being used and when it is being used,"" said Neil Murray, CEO of corporate solutions at JLL, which manages offices for JPMorgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs and others. 
    Murray said public health initiatives like contact-tracing have forced us to make certain concessions. 
    ""There is an element of having to watch interactions more closely. At the same we have to be respectful of individual privacy."" 
JLL would not comment on specific clients, and Reuters could not independently determine which banks were using the technology.
    SEARCHING FOR 'OPTIMUM ROTATION'
    Staff returning to JPMorgan's Manhattan headquarters will soon have a new app that uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to book seats. 
    It is part of an ""optimum rotation"" plan, Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's co-president and chief operating officer said recently. That means getting the right people together on the right days for in-office collaboration.
    HSBC and Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) also plan to launch reservation apps and online systems. While all three banks are still working out the details, apps like these can use card-swipes at security turnstiles to identify patterns and suggest when someone should book a desk to meet teammates. 
    Some companies in JLL's portfolio are taking it a step further and linking their reservation systems to building cameras, which count bodies in a room, and desk sensors, which record when a seat is occupied, Murray said. 
    In addition to flagging when a room may be near its 50% capacity limit, the data can tell companies when an office, or whole floor, is empty. That helps determine when to turn off lights, cancel janitorial services or downsize office space. 
    JPMorgan expects to need just 60 seats for every 100 employees, on average, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon wrote in his April shareholder letter.
    ""This will significantly reduce our need for real estate,"" Dimon wrote.
    WHAT ABOUT LUNCH? 
    A not insignificant number of bank employees have resisted going back to work in the office — whether because of COVID-19 concerns, because they moved out of big cities during the pandemic, or because they simply prefer more flexible work arrangements.
    On the flip side, some junior investment bankers have complained about working from home without the hands-on guidance and camaraderie they would get in person, and without perks like free meals for late-night duties.
    Banks will have to balance those dynamics to get their workforce back to the office, and some are leaning on the idea of free and subsidized food. 
     Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and others are using Sharebite, which coordinates orders from restaurants and directs delivery drivers to a building's service entrance. Meals are then sent to a common space where employees collect them.

    The service has been popular at investment banks looking for contactless food delivery, said Sharebite CEO Dilip Rao.
    ""When you offer people food it brings people back to the office,"" Rao said. ""They feel safe. They feel fed.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, continuing the previous session’s rebound ahead of housing data and key business surveys.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 120 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
Wall Street ended a three-day losing streak on Thursday, with the broad-based S&P 500 closing 1.1% higher, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.8%, helped by healthy gains from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Yet, despite these gains, the Dow is on track to see its fourth negative week out of the past five weeks and the S&P 500 is on pace for its second negative week in a row. The Nasdaq Composite, on the other hand, is positioned to break a 4-week losing streak.
Investors have been fretting this week over the minutes from the April Federal Reserve meeting which showed that the FOMC members had started discussions about potentially tapering the central bank’s asset purchase programs.
Data showed a new pandemic-low in weekly jobless claims on Thursday, but the rise in continuing claims also played into the idea that the central bank will maintain its ultra-easy monetary policies for some time to come.
Friday’s data slate includes existing home sales for April at 10 AM ET, which are expected to show a slight improvement as the spring selling season gets going, as well as May purchasing manager indices data, 15 minutes earlier. PMI releases from Europe earlier in the session showed the region’s services sector coming back to life as manufacturing cooled.
In corporate news, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) could be in focus after its quarterly report after the bell on Thursday detailed record quarterly sales as the global chip shortage boosted its equipment business.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) announced a new $20 billion share repurchase program late Thursday after the hardware retailer posted stellar results earlier in the week.
Deere (NYSE:DE) is the highlight of a dwindling bunch of companies reporting Friday, with the farm equipment manufacturer raising its full-year profit forecast, boosted by surging agriculture markets.
Oil prices gained Friday, rebounding after the week’s sharp losses as traders started to factor in the potential return of Iranian crude supplies.
Iran and world powers have been in talks since April on reviving the 2015 deal which limited Iran’s nuclear program, and appear to have made progress this week. If the United States signs off on any deal, lifting sanctions on Iran’s oil sector could see around 1 million barrels of oil a day reentering the global market.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $62.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $65.93. Both contracts are still down around 4% this week and on track to post their biggest weekly loss since March.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,878.90/oz, but are still on track for a third consecutive weekly rise, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2217.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",U.S. defended Amazon after article showed company bypassed Indian law,"By Aditya Kalra and Steve Stecklow
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. officials rushed to defend Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s business practices in India after Reuters reported in February that the company had favored certain sellers on its website and bypassed local law that requires foreign e-commerce companies to treat all vendors equally, documents obtained by the news agency show.
Emails obtained through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) showed that U.S. officials prepared a note for John Kerry, a top envoy of President Joe Biden, about the Feb. 17 Reuters report. The note, contained in an email dated Feb. 18, said that India's antitrust watchdog had reviewed many such allegations against U.S. e-commerce companies and found nothing wrong.
Biden's envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, is in charge of climate change policy. He was scheduled to speak that day with India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. The U.S. government was concerned that Goyal would bring up the Reuters story, so it hastily drafted a note about the article in case he did, the emails show.
""This could come up in the call since as you know Minister Goyal is prone to bring up tangential topics,"" Thomas Carnegie, a U.S. embassy official in New Delhi, emailed an official at the USTR.
Philip M. Ingeneri, another U.S. embassy official, also told the USTR official in an email on Feb. 18 that he had ""verified"" the contents of the note prepared for Kerry with Amazon India's government affairs chief as ""true and accurate."" The emails do not describe what ultimately happened during the Kerry-Goyal call.
The U.S. embassy in New Delhi referred questions to the U.S. Department of State in Washington, which said it expected that any issues regarding U.S. e-commerce companies' practices in India would be reviewed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ""with the same level of independence, transparency, and professionalism it has demonstrated in the past.""
Spokespeople for Kerry, the USTR and Goyal did not respond to Reuters queries.
The Reuters report http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W in February, based on internal Amazon documents, revealed that the U.S. firm has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its India platform, circumventing the country's tough foreign investment rules that are aimed at protecting small Indian brick-and-mortar retailers.
The article stirred up weeks of controversy in India, sparking calls from traders to ban Amazon. The CCI said in March that the story corroborated evidence it had received against Amazon, while the Enforcement Directorate, India's financial-crime fighting agency, asked Amazon for information and documents related to the company's Indian operations, Reuters has reported. The CCI enforces India's antitrust laws.
'SENSATIONALIST LANGUAGE'
In a March 16 email to U.S. officials, including at the USTR's office, Ingeneri wrote, in an apparent reference to the February article, that a Reuters reporter had used ""sensationalist language"" and relied on Amazon's ""activity before 2018 that was aggressive but not illegal at the time."" The next sentence in the email was redacted.
In response to questions from Reuters, a spokeswoman for Amazon in India said the company had no comment.
Amazon has previously told Reuters it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace,"" and that it ""treats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner.""
But internal Amazon documents show that the e-commerce giant discounted its fees to certain sellers on its platform, and that a few dozen of Amazon's more than 400,000 sellers in early 2019 accounted for about two-thirds of the e-commerce site's online sales.
The note prepared for Kerry summarized the Reuters story's findings. Among them: that Amazon senior executive Jay Carney had been advised by colleagues in 2019 not to disclose to India's ambassador in Washington that two sellers on Amazon's Indian website accounted for a large chunk of its sales. Amazon holds indirect equity stakes in those sellers.
From 2009 to 2011, Carney served as President Biden's communications director when Biden was vice president, before going on to serve as press secretary to President Barack Obama. The note for Kerry identified Carney as ""Amazon Senior Vice President and former Obama Administration spokesman.""
Carney had no comment for this article, the Amazon spokeswoman said.
Under the headline ""If Asked: Allegations of Amazon E-Commerce Violations,"" the note stated: ""We have seen a February 17 Reuters report raising concerns about U.S. e-commerce companies' practices in India and note many of the allegations have been previously reviewed by the Competition Commission of India without any negative findings.""

1577,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 06:33AM ET</span>",Tesla cars barred from some China government compounds - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Staff at some Chinese government offices have been told not to park their Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc cars inside government compounds due to security concerns over cameras installed on the vehicles, two people with knowledge of the matter said. 
The people said officials of at least two government agencies in Beijing and Shanghai have been instructed verbally by supervisors not to park their Tesla electric cars at work. It wasn't clear how many cars were affected, the people said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
It wasn't immediately clear whether all government offices in Beijing have imposed such restrictions, nor whether the measure was a formal government injunction or a step adopted by agency officials. It was also unclear whether curbs applied to state agencies nationwide.
While sensors and cameras that can assist driving feature in many automakers' vehicles, the people with knowledge of the matter said the restriction currently only applies to Tesla cars. In March, Tesla vehicles were banned from entering some military complexes in China, sources told Reuters then, citing security concerns over vehicle cameras. 
Neither the State Council Information Office (SCIO), which handles media requests for China's government, nor Tesla China officials immediately responded to requests for comment. 
The restriction provides a fresh indication of China's continued wariness of the U.S. electric carmaker amid tensions with Washington.
Facing greater scrutiny after safety and highly publicised customer service complaints in China, Tesla is boosting its engagement with mainland regulators and beefing up its government relations team, industry sources told Reuters previously.
China, the world's biggest car market, is the electric car maker's second-biggest market, accounting for about 30% of its sales. Tesla now makes electric Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in a Shanghai plant. 
Automakers like Tesla have been equipping more vehicles with cameras and sensors that capture images of a car's surroundings. Control of how those images are used and where they are sent and stored is a fast-emerging challenge for the industry and regulators around the world.
Tesla cars have several external cameras to assist drivers with parking, changing lanes and other features. Chief Executive Elon Musk has commented frequently on the value of the data that Tesla vehicles capture which can be used to develop autonomous driving.

Days after the March ban on Tesla cars in military complexes, Musk appeared by video at a high-level Chinese forum, saying that if Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down. 
Tesla said it would open a data centre in China and is developing a data platform for car owners in China.

(Reuters) -Halliburton Co's shareholders voted against the oilfield services provider's proposed executive compensation plan in an advisory motion, the company said on Thursday. 
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said the company was ""disappointed by the shareholder advisory vote"" and that it had led its peers in shareholder returns despite challenges stemming from the coronavirus pandemic and a supply and demand imbalance in oil markets.
Halliburton did not provide vote tallies. The company revised its executive compensation program in 2019 and received 91% approval of the plan from shareholders last year. 
Shares of Halliburton are up about 18% year-to-date to $22.38 as oilfield activity has slowly returned amid higher prices.
Miller and other executives pledged to cut salaries last year after the pandemic crippled the oil market and set off a wave of layoffs in the industry. 
Although Miller cut his base salary by $200,000 between 2019 and 2020, he received some $9.7 million in stock awards, versus $3.6 million the previous year. Overall, his compensation was 293 times the median compensation for Halliburton employees, the company said in an April filing.
Chief Financial Officer Lance Loeffler's base salary jumped from $650,000 to $709,000 between 2019 and 2020, and his earnings were also bolstered by stock awards. 

Halliburton in April said the sharp increase in 2020 compensation was due to changes to the plan and reporting.
Companies are not required to comply with advisory votes.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",Analysis-How the post-pandemic labor crunch is curbing U.S. manufacturing,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - A foundry in Indiana couldn’t ship $1.6 million worth of metal parts to customers last month because it didn’t have enough workers to make them, while a Massachusetts plastics factory has outsourced nearly a quarter of its business to subcontractors to keep up with orders it otherwise couldn’t fill.
Welcome to the great post-pandemic labor crunch.
As economic growth revved up in recent months, employers rushed to pull back workers shed during the COVID-19 crisis. But it hasn’t been easy. The Labor Department’s latest jobs report showed decreases in manufacturing, retail, and courier services employment in April, sparking a heated and increasingly politicized debate over whether generous unemployment benefits were keeping workers on the sidelines.
The enhanced benefits, which include a $300 weekly supplement, pay more than most minimum wage jobs. They were extended to early September as part of the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March. So far, more than 20 Republican-led states have moved to end the extra payments ahead of schedule citing local labor bottlenecks. 
Other issues suspected of holding back workers include a childcare crunch and general anxiety about health risks, but no one - from Federal Reserve officials to corporate executives - can point to a definitive reason for the squeeze.
As Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida remarked this week: ""It may take more time to reopen a $20 trillion economy than it did to shut it down."" (Graphic: U.S. factories struggle to keep up with demand, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/LABOR-SHORTAGE/yzdpxzwexpx/chart_eikon.jpg) 
NOTHING LIKE IT
For many manufacturers, the labor problem is compounded by a surge in demand that began during the lockdowns as homebound Americans shifted consumption to goods from services. Factory backlogs hit record highs in each of the last two months, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
“I’ve never seen anything like this - ever - and I’ve been in manufacturing for 30 years,” said Dave Reilly, chief executive of United Solutions Inc, a plastics producer in Leominster, Massachusetts, that churns out Rubbermaid storage totes among other things.
Reilly has shifted work to two subcontractors, because he couldn’t meet orders with a staff that is short about 100 workers. United has two factories, one outside Boston and the other in Mississippi, which together normally employ almost 700 people. Both have lost people in recent months.
He estimates he’s about 25% short of the production he needs, although the company has been able to cover some of that by pulling from inventories as well as using the subcontractors. All his office staff and managers now spend time on the factory floor running molding machines.
Staff shortages are driving up operating costs. The company runs 24/7 and always struggles to find people to work the third, overnight shift. Staffing has grown so thin they are spending heavily on overtime to pull people onto that shift. Reilly said staffing problems, together with surging plastic resin costs, could soon make it unprofitable to run a third shift and force him to suspend it - even though that will magnify his problem meeting production goals.
'BIG FOR US'
Labor shortages are not yet causing shutdowns like those seen in auto plants running short of computer chips. Instead, they are forcing companies to delay shipments and miss opportunities for growth.
BCI Solutions Inc, a foundry in Bremen, Indiana, missed $1.6 million in shipments last month due to a lack of workers. “That may not sound like much, but it’s big for us,” said J.B. Brown, the family-owned company’s president. The missed shipments are equal to about 4% of annual sales of around $40 million.
BCI needs about 250 people to run production at the pace to fill all its orders - but Brown said he’s been steadily losing workers since the start of the year. He is now down to about 121.
Brown blames a variety of factors, and the $300 extra unemployment benefit is one, he said. Many of his workers have left for jobs in the recreational vehicle factories that are concentrated in his corner of Indiana. Those offer large production-based bonuses when business is strong, driving up wages during a boom. He raised starting wages by $2 an hour in February, to $15 an hour, and will boost them again to $20 an hour on Monday, which means pushing up his whole wage scale to avoid upsetting established workers.
“We talk to the companies around us - the ones just in a (half-mile) radius are now collectively short over 1,000 people,” said Brown. The town’s Dairy Queen has started closing one day a week, he said, due to lack of workers - to give its remaining staff time off.
Workers' migration to higher-paid jobs fits in with what the White House and some congressional Democrats have been saying: Pay people more, and they will come. 
Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), the largest parts supplier to the RV industry, also is losing workers to more lucrative jobs. “The RV makers have the highest wages in our region,” he said, as high as $50 an hour. “So generally, workers will look to jump from $20-an-hour jobs if they are not happy where they are at.""
With margins at risk, employers are trying new strategies to lure people to their assembly lines, in addition to raising pay. 

In Mississippi, where United Solutions has its second factory, the company is preparing to participate next month in a “drive-thru job fair.”
""They don't even have to get out of their car,"" said John Bergeron, United's human resources director. They just drive up to people waiting at tables representing different employers.

The hub of 38 charging stations, will include 26 ultra-rapid chargers from Fastned and Tesla, with additional AC chargers from Spain's Wenea, and is scheduled to open at the end of 2021.
The intial 10 Fastned charging stations will be able to charge EVs simultaneously at rates allowing drivers to add up to 300 miles (482.8 km) of range in 20 minutes, the company said.
Fastned shares rose almost 8% to 55.6 euros at 0837 GMT.
""Partnering with Tesla ... should indeed help (Fastned) further increase its public profile in the UK and may allow it to replicate the same development strategy in other municipalities across Europe,"" Berenberg's research analyst Jan Richard said.
The hub will be Europe's most powerful electric vehicle charging hub with up to 10 megawatts of power available for future expansion, Fastned said.
""We can assume (this site) will be an important revenue contributor,"" Juri Zanieri, research analyst at Kempen, said. 
Delivering 100% renewable energy to EV drivers day and night, it will also be the Britain's largest public EV charging hub, EDF (PA:EDF) Renewables, whose unit Pivot Power is also participating in the project, said https://www.edfenergy.com/media-centre/news-releases/europes-most-powerful-electric-vehicle-charging-hub-heading-oxford.
Located on the ring road around Oxford, the hub is near the Cowley industrial site, where BMW is producing electric MINI cars.
Fastned, based in Amsterdam, has built 137 fast charging stations across the Belgium, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands and aims to expand into France. 

It plans to build at least 40 stations across its markets in 2021 and increase the number substantially in 2022.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Cartier owner Richemont on Friday proposed doubling its dividend back to pre-pandemic levels after strong demand for jewellery helped lift net profit and contain the fall in sales in its fiscal year 2020/21. 
Luxury watch sales have been recovering from the severe pandemic hit and Richemont, the global No.2 in luxury goods, has fared better than rival Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) thanks to its exposure to fast-growing jewellery.
""The trend is continuing, not only in Asia and China, but also in regions like the United States. Europe has not recovered,"" Chairman and controlling shareholder Johann Rupert told reporters, adding Japan was also still suffering. 
He said the company had a very strong balance sheet and a strong free cash flow. ""So having been stress-tested, this year, all things being equal, we're optimistic,"" Rupert said. 
Net profit rose by 38% to 1.289 billion euros ($1.58 billion) in the year to March, beating expectations thanks also to a reversal in net foreign exchange losses and the recalculation of the value of its financial investments.
Richemont proposed a dividend of 2 Swiss francs per share for fiscal year 2020/21, after halving it to one franc amid the pandemic last year.
Sales fell 5% at constant exchange rates to 13.14 billion euros, although less than expected, as sales of jewellery brands Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels rose 62% in the final quarter. Growth in Asia Pacific mitigated declines in other regions.
""In jewellery basically everything sells,"" Cartier head Cyrille Vigneron said on the call. 
Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said ""it is all about jewellery and the future is bright"", reiterating his Buy rating. The shares, up over 18% this year, rose 4.6% at 0750 GMT. 
Industry majors LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have also reported rebounding sales as COVID-19 restrictions eased in China and the United States.
Asked about potential interest in Kering's watch brands following market rumours, Richemont declined to comment.

Rupert said Richemont had a good relationship with Kering and the Pinault family and had been contacted by them in the past to talk about collaboration, but not about an acquisition.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies is expanding its smart car partnership with state-owned Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd to include the design and development of auto-use semiconductors, four sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
The two companies, which unveiled their smart car tie-up in November, have been working together informally on chips for the last few months, two of the sources said. A third source said they might soon form a joint venture for chip development.
Shares in Changan rocketed higher on the news, closing up 8.5% compared to a 4% decline earlier in the day.
Huawei has pivoted to electric vehicles after its global smartphone business was hammered by U.S. sanctions. The previous Trump administration labelled the company a threat to U.S. national security - a charge it denies.
In addition to the deal with Changan to develop smart cars under a joint as-yet-unnamed brand, Huawei is also planning EVs under its own marque and is in talks to take control of a small domestic automaker's EV unit, sources have said.
Huawei's new chip partnership with Changan would come amidst a global semiconductor shortage that has hit automakers particularly hard.
It would also represent a significant expansion for Huawei's chip business after U.S. sanctions meant it lost access to the underlying chip design software needed for more advanced chips used in smartphones.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. 
Changan did not respond to a request to comment. Huawei said it defers to automakers in public announcements regarding their tie-ups. Battery maker CATL, which is also part of the smart car partnership, also did not respond to a request for comment.
Changan, which has partnerships with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) in addition to making its own cars, has been working on developing its own chips but has not made much progress, two sources said. 
Huawei and Changan's smart car partnership calls for the tech giant to be in charge of the vehicle's operating system and cabin technologies while the automaker would be in charge of vehicle design and engineering.
Two sources said the partnership would build cars that would target the mid to high-end market, competing with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc. 
The business will be housed in an old venture with Nio that is no longer active and has been renamed Avatar, they added.
The companies aim to begin sales early next year, said one source. Another source added that Avatar will open an office in Shanghai and has started hiring staff.

Avatar might go public, Changan said on Friday on a question and answer service for investors managed by the Shenzhen stock exchange. 
Earlier this week, sources told Reuters that Changan plans to list its EV unit, which is separate from Avatar, on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market. Changan did not respond to a request for comment.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",China fund managers embrace robots as competition intensifies,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese fund managers, grappling with a rapidly-growing list of publicly-traded securities and mountains of data, are rapidly embracing machine learning and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost efficiency and bolster returns.
From using computers for analyzing news and research reports and crunching numbers to getting robots to pick stocks, the move comes as foreign players are expanding their footprint in China's $3.4-trillion mutual fund industry.
While AI has already been widely used in China's mammoth e-commerce and manufacturing sectors, it is now being adopted by asset managers as Beijing aims to digitize the economy further and close the technology gap with the western world.
Last week, Zheshang Fund Management Co launched a fund that uses robots to predict the market outlook and select stocks. It came after China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) announced its partnership with Toronto-based AI company Boosted.ai. 
""I think it's a must. Every major player is actively looking for AI solutions. The competition is really tough,"" said Bill Chen, chief data officer of ChinaAMC, which managed $246 billion worth of assets at the end of last year.
Global fund managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) have been using computer artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze fundamentals, market sentiment and macroeconomic policies in the last couple of years to get an investment edge.
""Companies like BlackRock have very powerful, advanced technology. They are leading us in AI for sure, by at least several years,"" said Chen. ""But I think we understand the Chinese market better.""
Fund managers' increased usage of AI in the world's second-largest economy comes as Beijing is stepping up digitalization drive, a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and as it increasingly clashes with the West over technology policy.
China's stock market listing reforms have boosted the number of public companies, leading to a data explosion that also fuels demand for AI, said Zhou Yu, chief product officer of ABC Fintech, a Beijing-based AI company.
ABC Fintech counts asset managers such as China Universal Asset Management and Hwabao WP Fund Management Co as clients, and serves as their data factory, Yu said.
REGULATORY CHALLENGES 
Growing investments into AI are also being fueled by early signs of success.
Zheshang Fund's first AI-powered fund, Zheshang Intelligent Industry Preferred Hybrid Fund has gained 68.34% since its launch in Sept 2019, according to its Q1 report, compared with a 21.64% gain in its benchmark, which is a combination of stock and bond indexes. 
The fund has built an ""AI Beehive strategy model"" in which robots team up like humans to buy stocks. More than 400 robots compete for the right to make decisions as their models constantly evolve through trial and error.
Peter Shepard, managing director at MSCI Research, said that instead of providing super-human intelligence, AI provides super-human scale that will open up fresh sources of information that drive new levels of insight and efficiency.
""These new tools on their own can't predict the future any better than people can, but they are key to unlocking new, alternative and unstructured data sets that will continue to transform the investment process."" 
""AI will be an important edge,"" said Larry Cao, senior director at CFA Institute, who authored several reports on AI-powered investing. ""The hard truth with AI is that the bigger firms can invest a lot more resources.""
Some Chinese industry officials, however, expressed concerns that the use of machine learning algorithms to pick stocks and better returns could run into regulatory challenges. 
""From a regulatory perspective, you need to go through a lot of compliance procedures. You need to write reports on your decision making. Some AI-powered models are like black boxes, and unexplainable,"" said Yu of ABC Fintech.
""That's hardly acceptable to regulators.""

As learning algorithms are increasingly used in trading rooms, local fund managers are working with regulators to try to design new standards for the industry.
""One of the main barriers we face ... is that we are so highly regulated,"" ChinaAMC's Chen said. ""Every decision you make, you have to be responsible for that decision, and you should be able to explain a decision when you lose money.""

The law protects the animals and makes them subject to seizure. 
""There is probable cause to believe that the 68 big cats and the jaguar continue to be harmed and harassed and, therefore, unlawfully taken in violation of the ESA"", the affidavit said.

The couple was accused in November of violating the ESA and the Animal Welfare Act in a 110-page civil complaint. The Justice Department had accused them of exhibiting the animals without a license and of jeopardizing their health, the New York Times reported.
""Tiger King,"" the true crime series set in the world of private zoos and their eccentric owners, became a worldwide phenomenon when it was aired in March last year.
It told the story of flamboyant Oklahoma zoo keeper Joe Exotic, his rivalry with Florida big cat rescue activist Carole Baskin and his imprisonment for hiring a hitman to try to kill her.
Lowe, who became the owner of the private wildcat zoo at the center of the series, said last August he was closing its doors permanently, citing pressure from animal rights activists and inspectors.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The owner of a 71-floor office tower in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen closed the building on Friday pending an investigation into what caused the skyscraper to begin shaking on Tuesday. 
Shenzhen Electronics Group Co Ltd will close the 356-metre (1,167 feet) SEG Plaza to tenants and shoppers to carry out inspections into the cause of the swaying, it said in a notice posted on the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media account of the state-owned Xinhua News agency.
Reuters could not immediately contact Shenzhen Electronics for a comment on the closure.
The swaying caused objects on desks in the building to move and workers were evacuated from the tower. Videos shared on social media showed panicked pedestrians fleeing the area after the rocking began. 
Several nearby buildings were also evacuated, with police and fire crews sealing off the surrounding area.
The main structure of the building is safe and no cracks were found in the building or its surroundings, the Shenzhen Housing Authority said in a statement on Wednesday. An initial investigation ruled out an earthquake as the cause. 
SEG Plaza opened in 2001 and several of the lower floors contain electronics shops. 
On Wednesday, the U.S. Consulate General in Guangzhou, recommended that U.S. citizens avoid the Huaqiangbei area where the building is located because of ""inadequate information to assess the safety risks.""
Business has continued as normal for those working nearby.
""Most of my colleagues are making fun of this, they're not worried,"" said Keyman Guan, whose robotics company continued its anniversary in a nearby building hours after the evacuation on Tuesday. 
""I didn't realise what happened until I saw a picture of the crowd in the streets.""

Others say they will remain cautious until there is a clear explanation. 
""I wouldn't dare to go back and work unless there's a very thorough and reasonable report,"" said Donny Zhang, who runs a hardware consulting and sourcing company in the area.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 11:11PM ET</span>",Commerce chief says U.S. could help boost chips transparency,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Thursday she held meetings with three dozen senior industry leaders on a semiconductor chip shortage and said the United States could help boost transparency in the market.
The meeting included General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Stellantis NV, chip suppliers and other users of chips.
Raimondo and the Biden administration back $50 billion in U.S. government spending to dramatically boost U.S. semiconductor production and research, but it will take significant time for that spending - if approved by Congress - to boost supply.
Asked if there was any action the Biden administration could take to address short-term auto production issues, Raimondo suggested it could help with demand forecasting and address a ""lack of transparency"" around the chips market and various sector needs.
""We are thinking about ways that we might be able to help with more information-sharing between suppliers and consumers,"" Raimondo said. 
""It may be that there is a role for the government to play, either in encouraging industry to do that or somehow helping to increase the transparency and information-sharing.""
The global semiconductor chip shortage will cost automakers $110 billion in lost revenue this year, up from a prior estimate of $61 billion, consulting firm AlixPartners said last week, as it forecast the crisis will hit the production of 3.9 million vehicles.
Last month, Ford warned the chip shortage might slash second-quarter production by half, costing it about $2.5 billion and about 1.1 million units of lost production in 2021. GM has extended production halts at several North American factories because of the shortage. Both continue to announce new production cuts.
GM said in a statement it was ""grateful for the Biden Administration’s support of this critical issue impacting the global auto industry and applaud Secretary Raimondo’s continued focus on the matter.""
Reuters reported on May 5 the Biden administration had concerns about invoking the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law that allows the government to force companies to produce materials for national security reasons, quoting an official who said reallocating semiconductors to automakers ""would result in fewer chips for others.""
Asked Thursday if the administration had ruled out that approach, Raimondo said ""that's a challenge because the shortage is affecting a large variety of industries"", not just autos but electronics, technology companies, and medical device companies as well.

""We want to do everything we can but I think that's a challenge,"" Raimondo added.
U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer unveiled revised bipartisan legislation late Tuesday that includes $52 billion in emergency funding to significantly boost U.S. semiconductor chip production and research over five years as part of a larger bill, but lawmakers are still debating provisions especially whether it should require companies to pay prevailing wages.

1591,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2021 10:57PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Inflation, COVID-19 Fears Overshadow Improving Economic Outlook","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Friday morning even as the economic outlook improves and investor fears of a decrease in U.S. stimulus eased.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.43% by 10:39 PM ET (2:39 AM GMT). The National Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April contracted by a better-than-expected 0.1% year-on-year in April while the 0.4% contraction in the National CPI month-on-month was larger than the previous month’s 0.2% growth, according to data released earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.20%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.07%, with retail sales data for April released earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.51% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.41%.
Concerns about runaway inflation as well as the COVID-19 outbreaks in some countries that led to more restrictive measures, alongside a brightening economic outlook in places like the U.S. and Europe, continue to dictate market moves.
U.S. Treasury yields continued to retreat, as demand for Thursday’s auction of 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities disappointed. The demand also indicated waning confidence in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s insistence that any inflation is likely to be temporary.
The minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, released on Wednesday, hinted that debate on scaling back unprecedented stimulus to support the economy through COVID-19 took place.
U.S. initial jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since March 2020, with 444,000 claims filed during the previous week.
Some investors warned that the road towards economic recovery from COVID-19 remains long.
“While inflation has been the star of the show, keep in mind that the Fed’s mandate is twofold, with employment as the other side... the jobless claims read shows once again that we’re heading in the right direction, but we’re a ways away from where we were pre-COVID-19,” E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) managing director of investment strategy Mike Loewengart told Bloomberg.
However, other investors struck a more optimistic note.
“Overall we’re still quite risk-on,” UBS Chief Investment Office head of global asset allocation Adrian Zuercher told Bloomberg. COVID-19 vaccine rollout and reopening up of the economy “should lead to higher equity markets” and that the “reflation trade is not over yet,” he added.
Further data on existing U.S. home sales for April are due later in the day.
Investors also focused their attention on U.S. President Joe Biden’s tax agenda as the Treasury Department unveiled details of a proposal to raise $700 billion in additional revenue over the next ten years.
The funds will be raised via Internal Revenue Service enforcement, with cryptocurrency transfers worth $10,000 or more required to be reported to tax authorities. The U.S. also separately called for a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15%.
Across the Atlantic, Eurozone finance ministers and central bank chiefs are due to meet informally later in the day, with a larger, more formal European Union gathering taking place a day later."
1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2021 09:09PM ET</span>",Oatly Rises 18% in Debut After Raising $1.4 Billion in IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, climbed 18% in its debut after pricing its initial public offering on the high end to raise more than $1.4 billion.
The shares closed Thursday at $20.20 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $12 billion. The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares on Wednesday at the top of a marketed range of $15 to $17 each.
In July, the Swedish company secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in that round.
Both Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, and Schultz also participated in the IPO, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for Oatly declined to comment. Roc Nation and Schultz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.
Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be its own popularity. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017, finding Oatly in coffee shops and supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers.
The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.
In March, supermarkets across the U.S. -- and even its big new customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders.
While the current shortage won’t end overnight, Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson sounded an optimistic note.
Fulfilling Orders
“This year, we will bring on board new capacity every single quarter,” he said in an interview ahead of the first trade. The company is expanding its Netherlands plant, putting out commercial products from its Utah plant, and is doing test runs in Singapore, where the factory will be “up and running” in the second quarter, he said.
For now, Oatly is only filling 70% of orders in its key markets, so it is “not really” taking on new customers, Petersson said, adding that the gap is between supply and orders, not supply and demand. “First we will close the gaps, then expand with new retail partners,” he added.
Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.
Oatly’s offering was led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.

Google had asked for the case to be moved for several reasons, including that its headquarters is in California, as are many of the witnesses who would likely be called.
Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, however, disagreed that that and other arguments made by Google were adequate reason to change venue.
""Google has failed to meet its burden to establish that the Northern District of California is a clearly more convenient venue for the ... litigation than the Eastern District of Texas,"" he wrote in denying the request.
Google declined to comment on the ruling.

Texas and several other states sued the search and advertising company in mid-December, accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it dominates all steps in the process of placing digital advertising. Publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues. Google has denied wrongdoing.
The government antitrust lawsuit is one of three faced by Google. Another was filed by the U.S. Justice Department while the last was filed by a big group of states and has different allegations. Separately, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) faces lawsuits from the Federal Trade Commission and another group of states.

(Reuters) -Strong stock market debuts by oat milk maker Oatly Group AB and construction software firm Procore Technologies eased investor concerns on Thursday that U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) could suffer a bout of volatility.
At least three IPOs, including those of mortgage insurer Enact Holdings Inc and hearing care services company Hear.com, were canceled last week, the companies citing choppy market conditions for their decision. 
A sudden drop in the stock market, driven by concerns over inflation, pushed investors into safe-haven assets and prompted them to dump risky stocks. As these fears eased this week, the volatility that hampered IPOs subsided.
Shares of Sweden-based Oatly, which counts celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman among its investors, closed up 19% on its first day of trading on Thursday, while Procore Technologies rallied 30%.
""We had a red hot market that everything was getting done. I don't see the windows being closed at all now. Healthcare and technology remain the open spot,"" said Mitch Nussbaum, chair of the capital markets and corporate department at Loeb & Loeb. 
The U.S. IPO market has been on an unprecedented tear in the last 18 months, driven mainly by investor appetite for tech stocks. Several high-profile technology companies, including Airbnb, Doordash, Snowflake, Roblox, Coinbase and Palantir Technologies took advantage of the hype to go public. 
More big startups, such as online brokerage Robinhood Markets, grocery app Instacart and electric vehicle maker Rivian are preparing to go public later this year. 
The IPO market raised a record $167 billion through new issues in 2020, according to data from Dealogic. That record is set to be comfortably eclipsed this year, as offerings have already raised well over $150 billion, driven mainly by floats of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 

More companies are now turning to IPOs as investors fret over a bubble in the SPAC market.
""The volatility is not really scaring off good IPO companies. And that's a good sign. Because if they keep going public, investors are not going to miss the window – they are not going to sit on the sidelines and be nervous for very long,"" said David Peinsipp, co-chair of the global capital markets practice at law firm Cooley LLP.

By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Stock indexes rose around the globe on Thursday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 1% led by sharp gains in technology shares, while U.S. Treasury yields fell after a weaker-than-expected U.S. business activity reading.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 31.5 from 50.2 in April, its highest pace in nearly half a century. The reading was shy of economists' expectations of 43.0, a Reuters poll found, and cast doubt on how fast the economy can continue to heat up.
Cryptocurrencies bounced back from their recent sharp drop, but were well off the day's highs by afternoon New York time, as U.S. regulators signaled greater oversight for the sector.
Bitcoin was most recently up about 8% at $40,035 after some of its prominent backers reiterated their support for the digital currency, having plummeted to 54% below its record high, hit just over a month ago.
Smaller rival ether gained about 14% to $2,782. On Wednesday, it fell 22.8%, its biggest daily fall since March 2020. 
Investors are also still digesting minutes from the Fed's meeting last month, which showed a number of officials thought that if the recovery holds up it might be appropriate to ""begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases.""
Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped further below 500,000 last week, but jobless rolls swelled in early May, which could temper expectations for an acceleration in employment growth this month.
The S&P 500 technology index ended up 1.9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.11 points, or 0.55%, to 34,084.15, the S&P 500 gained 43.44 points, or 1.06%, to 4,159.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 236.00 points, or 1.77%, to 13,535.74.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.27% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.95%.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell 4.3 basis points to 1.640%.
Market expectations of a further rise in inflation would need evidence of the economy moving past full employment very, very rapidly, said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC.
""We've probably already reached the peak level of economic activity, and that probably happened in March and April,"" Ricchiuto added.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar lost ground and was hovering near multi-month lows.
Late in New York, the dollar index fell 0.491%, with the euro down 0.01% to $1.2225.
The bounces in cryptocurrencies came after crypto backers such as Ark Invest's Cathie Wood and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk indicated their support on Wednesday.
Concerns over tighter regulation in China and unease over the extent of leveraged positions in the cryptocurrency world had caused this week's big selloff.
Outages at several major trading platforms during the maelstrom, which also set ether tumbling nearly 50%, did little to inspire confidence.
SPACs - special purpose vehicles set up and listed to buy up other firms - experienced huge growth last year, as did the ARK innovation fund that focuses on tech companies.

Oil prices dropped more than 2% after diplomats said progress was made toward a deal to lift U.S. sanctions on Iran. Brent crude fell $1.55, or 2.3%, to settle at $65.11 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude ended $1.31, or 2.1%, lower at $62.05 a barrel. Both contracts fell around 3% in the previous session.
Spot gold was nearly flat.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union and the United States are working to resolve a dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers and should be able to do so by July, the EU's trade chief said on Thursday in a further sign of improving transatlantic trade ties.
Both sides agreed in March to suspend tariffs on billions of dollars of imports in a 16-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA). The suspension runs until July 10, with tariffs re-applying on July 11 if there is no solution.
""We had intensive and broad discussions on this topic with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai last week and so during today's video conference she confirmed this timeline,"" European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference.
""The work is advancing so I would say this timeline is realistic. Of course it requires effort from both sides."" 
While U.S. President Joe Biden has made clear his focus remains on protecting American jobs, European officials hope his administration will make trade ties with the United States more predictable than during the Donald Trump presidency.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier described the talks with Tai as ""extremely constructive"".
""I think we are entitled to say that there is a historic window of opportunity to resolve trade disputes between Europe and the U.S.,"" he told reporters.
Earlier this week the Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, declared a partial truce in a three-year dispute over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, saying it would not impose retaliatory tariffs on more U.S. products. [L5N2N42PT]
""All in all, it's now more than 100 days since the Biden administration entered office and we have seen many positive developments and much more active engagement,"" Dombrovskis said.
Dombrovskis said U.S. metals tariffs and the EU's initial retaliatory duties from 2018 should be removed as soon as possible, and in any case by the end of the year. He said both the EU and the United States were working on this timeline.
Separately, 12 EU countries including Germany, called for an extension of steel ""safeguard"" quotas beyond their expiry at the end of June to protect industry from a flood of imports.
Dombrovskis said the Commission should present a proposal in early June, adding there was a difficult balance to be made between steel-making and steel-consuming industries.
""If we extend beyond three years, as would be the case, we open ourselves to legal retaliation by third countries,"" he continued.
Another area of emerging consensus between the EU and United States is the need for a tougher line on China. Their partial truce included a joint statement on the need to ""hold countries like China that support trade-distorting policies to account"".
Separately, the European Parliament on Thursday halted ratification of an investment pact with China until Beijing lifts sanctions on EU politicians, deepening a dispute in Sino-European ties and denying EU companies greater access to China.
The resolution to freeze ratification passed with 599 votes in favour, 30 votes against and 58 abstentions.
Beijing's punitive measures, blocking travel to China and business with its companies, were imposed in March in response to Western sanctions against Chinese officials accused of the mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs in northwestern China.

EU lawmakers say the Chinese sanctions are not based on international law, while the bloc's measures tackle abuses of human rights upheld in United Nations treaties. Beijing denies any wrongdoing.
Despite all the tensions, Germany earlier announced that exports to China in April rose by 16.3% year-on-year to 8.4 billion euros. It also said exports to the United States leaped by more than 60% to 10.1 billion euros in the same period, underlining the importance of trade to Europe's top economy. [S8N27Z087]

1597,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 07:51PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Latin America poised to benefit as U.S. raises exports of COVID-19 shots - sources,"By Carl O'Donnell and Jeff Mason
(Reuters) - Latin America is poised to receive millions of U.S.-made COVID-19 shots in the coming weeks as the United States emerges as a top exporter of vaccines against the novel coronavirus, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The United States is considering prioritizing countries within its own hemisphere for the 80 million domestically-made vaccine doses it has pledged to send abroad, one person familiar with the matter said.
Meanwhile,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has begun exporting millions of its U.S.-made shots largely to countries in Central and South America, a second person familiar with the matter said. 
Many Latin American countries have a dire need for COVID-19 vaccines as they combat outbreaks. Brazil has been one of the world's hardest hit countries by the pandemic, reporting a total of more than 15 million cases and 400,000 deaths as of this week.
Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), is producing around 10 million shots in the United States each week for export as its domestic output pulls ahead of U.S. demand for vaccines, the second person said.
The drugmaker is making shipments from its Michigan facility to U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as nearly 10 other Latin American countries, the person said. 
Recent recipients of Pfizer's U.S.-made vaccine doses include Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay, the person added. 
The White House is still deliberating how to direct the shots it promised to send abroad and President Joe Biden has not yet made a decision. But giving preference to countries that share a hemisphere with the United States is one argument under consideration because it would be in the American people's interest to do so, the first person said. 
The criteria for sharing the vaccine would be epidemiological and include geographic flexibility so that adjustments could be made as the pandemic shifts, another person familiar with the matter said. 
VACCINE DIPLOMACY
The United States is competing with China and Russia to deepen its ties around the world and further its geopolitical clout through so-called ""vaccine diplomacy.""
Republican Senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Thursday urged the United States to speed up global vaccination sharing to better compete with global rivals.
Gayle Smith, the U.S. global coordinator on COVID-19, said on Wednesday that the United States will donate a significant number of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX program for distributing doses to poorer countries being co-led by the World Health Organization.
Pfizer is directing its U.S.-made shots to Latin America because of the region's proximity to its manufacturing plants and because of the U.S. drugmakers' goal of getting more shots to low and middle income countries, the second person said. 
The United States is becoming a top supplier of COVID-19 shots to the world as the success of its own vaccination campaign has led to reduced demand at home. 
More than 60% of U.S. adults have received at least one COVID-19 shot, according to federal data. Meanwhile, countries such as India and Brazil are struggling to obtain the doses they need to help bring severe outbreaks under control.
Brazil has only distributed enough shots so far to have vaccinated around 13% of its population, even as it records almost 65,000 new cases per day on average, according to Reuters data. 
Biden said on Monday the White House will give out 20 million shots previously earmarked for U.S. residents by the end of June. They will include vaccines made by Pfizer,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
The White House is also planning to give other countries around 60 million U.S.-made doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine, which is not yet authorized for use in the United States.

Pfizer began exporting doses from its Kalamazoo, Michigan plant last month, with the first batch of shipments abroad going to Mexico. A deal with the White House last year had barred it from exporting doses until after March 31, Reuters reported.
Pfizer is continuing to hold talks with India, where the virus is raging out of control, as its shot is not yet authorized by India. The timeline for any potential agreement is not clear, the second person said.

LONDON (Reuters) - India's export ban on COVID-19 shots risks dragging the battle against the pandemic ""back to square one"" unless wealthy nations step in to plug a gaping hole in the COVAX global vaccine-sharing scheme, health specialists said on Thursday.
COVAX, which is critical for poorer countries, relies on AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots made by the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest maker of vaccines. It was already around 100 million doses short of where it had planned to be when India halted exports a month ago amid a surge in infections there. 
Rich countries with plentiful COVID-19 vaccine stocks must now share them immediately, at scale, the global experts said, otherwise the pandemic could be prolonged as the world struggles to contain a virus that is continuing to spread and mutate. 
""It is a huge concern,"" said Anna Marriott, health policy manager at the global charity Oxfam. She and others said it was imperative that wealthy countries and regions make good on their rhetoric and share excess vaccines now.
""The current approach that relies on a few pharma monopolies and a trickle of charity through COVAX is failing - and people are dying as a result.""
Reuters reported on Tuesday that India is extending its ban, meaning it is now unlikely to resume major exports before October.
Will Hall, global policy manager for the Wellcome global health trust, said COVAX's heavy reliance on the Serum Institute left it vulnerable. India's extension of its export ban made it even more crucial for rich countries to share doses via the scheme, he said, ""not in six months' time, not in a month's time, but now"".
""We're not going to beat this virus unless we think and act globally,"" he added. ""We all should be concerned about this – the more the virus continues to spread, the greater the risk of it mutating to a stage where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. If that happens we're back to square one.""
A highly transmissible new variant of the novel coronavirus first identified in India has spread to several countries around the world.
'VERY FEW OPTIONS'
COVAX aims to get vaccines to at least 20% of the populations of the more-than 90 low and middle-income countries signed up to receive the shots as donations. It has so far distributed about 65 million doses of mainly the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, many of them to Africa.
A spokeswoman for the GAVI vaccines alliance, which co-leads COVAX, said the facility was working hard to make up supplies.
""We're trying to find different ways of making sure that those countries that have received the first dose are able to also receive a second dose and that vaccinations can continue,"" she told Reuters. ""What we need right now, to meet the immediate needs, is dose sharing.""
The United States said on Wednesday it would share a total of 20 million doses of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccines by the end of June, donating a significant amount via COVAX, on top of 60 million AstraZeneca shots it had already planned to give to other countries.
EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said this week that the bloc was working to significantly ramp up vaccine donations through COVAX in the second half of 2021. Vaccine sharing announced by EU member states has so far amounted to 11.1 million vaccines, he said, of which 9 million are being shared via COVAX.
Britain, meanwhile, will have enough surplus doses to fully vaccinate at least 50 million people in poorer countries once every adult at home has been fully vaccinated, according to analysis by UNICEF's UK office last week.

The GAVI spokeswoman said COVAX'S reliance on the Serum Institute was based, largely, on its vast production capacity, ability to deliver at low cost and on assurances that it would be able to produce the millions of doses needed at speed.
""It always was COVAX's plan to grow and diversify its portfolio to 10-12 vaccines but at the start of the year when approved vaccines were only slowly coming online, we had very few options available to us,"" she said.

WeWork said its business was recovering as more people returned to offices due to easing of COVID-19 curbs, after work-from-home arrangements last year weighed heavily on the company by reducing occupancy and increasing operating costs.
Total occupancy ticked up to 50% in the first quarter compared to 47% in the fourth quarter, the company said.
WeWork in March agreed to go public through a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company, in a deal that valued it at $9 billion. SoftBank Group Corp said it would retain a majority stake in the company after the merger. 
The company, whose attempt at an initial public offering in 2019 spectacularly imploded due to investor concerns over its business model and co-founder Adam Neumann's management style, said first-quarter revenue nearly halved to $598 million from a year ago.
WeWork said it had 490,000 members in the first quarter, compared to 693,000 in March 2020.

The company said it incurred restructuring costs of $494 million, driven by non-cash SoftBank stock purchases and a settlement with Neumann. It posted an impairment charge of $299 million partly due to an exit out of some real estate.
SoftBank and Neumann, WeWork's former chief executive officer reached a settlement in February ending a legal battle that started in 2019 when SoftBank agreed to buy around $3 billion in WeWork stock belonging to Neumann and other employees, but later contested its obligation to purchase the shares.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>",McDonald's is sued for $10 billion for alleged bias against Black-owned media,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) was sued on Thursday for at least $10 billion by two companies owned by media entrepreneur Byron Allen, who accused the fast-food chain of racial discrimination for not advertising enough with Black-owned media outlets.
The complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court said McDonald's violated federal and state civil rights laws through its ""racial animus and racial stereotyping"" in allocating ad dollars.
According to the complaint, Chicago-based McDonald's has refused to advertise with Allen's Entertainment Studios Networks, which owns several lifestyle channels, or his Weather Group, which owns The Weather Channel.
The complaint said Blacks comprise about 40% of McDonald's customers, but the company devoted less than $5 million of its $1.6 billion U.S. ad budget in 2019 to Black-owned media.
""McDonald's, like much of corporate America these days, publicly touts its commitment to diversity and inclusion, but this is nothing more than empty rhetoric,"" the complaint said.
Allen sued on the same day McDonald's said it would boost its national ad spending with Black-owned media to 5% from 2% by 2024, and also spend more on Hispanic-, Asian-American, women- and LGBTQ-owned platforms.
""We have doubled down on our relationships with diverse-owned partners,"" McDonald's said in a statement. It said it will ""review and respond accordingly"" to Allen's lawsuit.
In April, General Motors (NYSE:GM) Corp pledged to advertise more with Black-owned media, after Allen and other entrepreneurs took out full-page newspaper ads accusing the automaker of ignoring those media.

A former stand-up comic and co-host of the NBC reality TV show ""Real People,"" Allen also sued Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) for $20 billion in 2015 over its refusal to carry his channels.
He settled in June, three months after the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Comcast in setting a high burden for Allen to prove he was discriminated against.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rebounded on Thursday after a three-day slide, buoyed by gains in technology stocks as the smallest weekly jobless claims since the start of a pandemic-driven recession lifted the mood.
Bitcoin clawed back some lost ground to trade near $40,000 a day after a brutal selloff, helping renew appetite for risk. Crypto-exchange operator Coinbase Global rose 3.83%, while Crypto-miners Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings gained 0.17% and 0.83% respectively.
""There's a big risk, regulatory risk, to crypto that's not fully appreciated,"" said Jay Hatfield, founder and chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. ""The central banks have a monopoly on currency. And so we just think that it's a little bit surprising they haven't enforced that monopoly.""
The number of Americans filing for new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 444,000 in the week ended May 15, down for the third straight time, suggesting job growth picked up this month, though companies still are desperate for workers.
Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday, extending losses since, after minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month indicated some policymakers thought it would be appropriate to discuss easing of crisis-era support, such as tapering bond purchases, in upcoming meetings if the strong economic momentum is sustained.
""Right now really there is just one driver of the market, and that is the Fed and potential timing of tapering and quantitative easing,"" Hatfield added.
Signs of rising inflation have increased bets that the Federal Reserve may tighten its policy soon, hitting rate-sensitive growth stocks that set the tech-heavy Nasdaq on track for its fifth consecutive weekly drop.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.11 points, or 0.55%, to 34,084.15, the S&P 500 gained 43.44 points, or 1.06%, to 4,159.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 236.00 points, or 1.77%, to 13,535.74.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.30 billion shares, compared with the 10.05 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Retailers were a weak spot. Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) dropped 7.01% after it forecast full-year sales below analysts' estimates, making it the largest percentage decliner on the S&P 500
Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) slumped 10.17% after warning of a hit to its full-year profit margin from higher labor and shipping costs, as well as selling fewer products at full price.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 28 new lows.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 07:01PM ET</span>","California regulator adopts EV mandate for Uber, Lyft ride-hail fleets","By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) -California's clean air regulator on Thursday adopted rules to mandate that nearly all trips on Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s ride-hailing platforms have to be in electric vehicles over the next few years, the first such regulation by a U.S. state.
In written comments to the agency ahead of Thursday's vote, Uber and Lyft said they supported the regulation's goals but called for more government to aid their many lower and middle-income drivers with the costs for the transition.
The rules, adopted through a unanimous vote by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), mandate that EVs account for 90% of ride-hailing vehicle miles traveled by 2030.
Graphic on CARB electric-vehicle goals: https://tmsnrt.rs/3u5EVaq
That is a lesser goal than the companies themselves have set: both Uber and Lyft last year committed to converting their U.S. fleets entirely to EVs by that year. 
But the companies said achieving those goals is unrealistic without additional government subsidies for EVs and charging infrastructure. 
The companies said CARB's targets were based on uncertain and unrealistic assumptions, risking harm to drivers if EV and charging availability does not expand as projected by regulators.
Several of CARB's 14 board members shared concerns over the impact on drivers during Thursday's hearing, criticizing the companies for not doing more to help them.
""There is no way for us to make sure that the (companies) actually bear the costs to address the greenhouse gases and air pollution they're creating and profiting off,"" said board member Nathan Fletcher.
The total cost of meeting the 2030 standard could reach $1.73 billion, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization.
Uber and Lyft have partnerships with rental companies and charging station providers to lower drivers' EV costs. Uber has also said it will invest $800 million through 2025 to help drivers globally switch to EVs. 
The question of who will finance the costly transition is complicated by the drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees, leaving regulators little ability to protect them. 
Some twenty groups submitted comments on the regulation, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving unit Waymo.
For the vehicle industry, the rules offer a way to ensure EV sales at a time when many automakers pivot to battery-powered production in response to tighter emissions regulations, but fear lackluster consumer demand.

Steve Douglas, vice president at auto industry group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, urged CARB to expand EV rules to the taxi industry and other public and private fleets.
""The simple truth is sales require purchases and sales requirements should be matched to purchase requirements,"" Douglas said during Thursday's hearing.

The Wall Street bank named its institutional securities business chief Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein, the head of its wealth management unit, as co-presidents.
It also appointed investment management chief Dan Simkowitz as co-head of strategy alongside Pick, and made finance boss Jon Pruzan chief operating officer.
""I am highly confident one of them will be the CEO in the future,"" Gorman said earlier in an interview with Bloomberg. (https:// Gorman, who joined the bank in 2006 and took over as CEO in 2010, has informed the board of his plans to stay on for at least three more years, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. The fact that all four potential CEO successors are white men drew criticism from some corporate diversity advocates. ""I think the first question to ask is who were considered as candidates"" for these roles, said Charlotte Laurent-Ottomane, executive director at the Thirty Percent Coalition, which encourages diversity in corporate boardrooms. ""Did the candidate pool have diverse people, women and people of color in it? If not, I think the bank probably is not in alignment with the thinking of today."" The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The shake-up comes days after JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) named Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, widely seen as the two top contenders for the CEO role, as co-heads of its consumer and community bank. Saperstein runs  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s wealth management business, which Gorman has been trying to build out with moves like the $13 billion purchase of trading platform E*Trade last year to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking. The unit's revenue surged 47% in the first quarter to account for roughly half of the bank's total revenue. 
Morgan Stanley has also benefited from an unprecedented boom in dealmaking that drove a 66% jump in revenue at its institutional securities unit, which is led by Pick. The bank on Thursday also named Sharon Yeshaya, the head of investor relations, as CFO.

(Reuters) -Shares of Oprah Winfrey-backed Oatly Group AB jumped 30% in their market debut on Thursday, valuing the Swedish oatmilk maker at about $13 billion, as demand for plant-based food products surges globally.
Oatly's strong debut, along with that of construction software firm Procore Technologies, is expected to restore short-term confidence in U.S. initial public offerings. That market has been rocked by recent inflation fears that forced investors to abandon growth stocks.
Shares of Sweden-based Oatly, whose investors also include rapper Jay Z and former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) head Howard Schultz, opened at $22 a share.
The vegan milk maker, which has been widely credited for popularizing oatmilk in several countries, on Wednesday went public at $17 a share, raising $1.4 billion.
Oatly, which sells in more than 20 markets across Europe, the United States and China, is known chiefly for its oat milk products and has tie-ups with several U.S. cafes, including Starbucks. Oatly is so popular in some key markets that it has faced supply shortages. 
""The proceeds that we're going to get is going to be used to build out the capacity across these three continents, where we are building the demand,"" Toni Petersson, chief executive of Oatly, said in an interview.
""Demand keeps organically increasing all the time. So we have had a hard time keeping up.""
Plant-based foods have gained investor interest over the past few years, especially as fast-food chains and upscale restaurants create new menus to attract health- and environment-conscious diners.
Much of the demand is being led by millennials and generation Z consumers, who are more than willing to spend on sustainable products that are also healthy.
In 2020, U.S. plant-based retail sales hit $7 billion, up 27% year-on-year, according to a report by the Good Food Institute and the Plant-Based Foods Association (PBFA).
SUSTAINABILITY THEME
Oatly, founded by brothers Rickard and Björn Öste in 1990, has benefited from surging interest in companies that care about environmental, social and governance issues. 
Oatly, which mentions the word ""sustainability"" more than a 100 times in its regulatory filing, has said that on average, a liter of Oatly product consumed in place of cow's milk results in around 80% less greenhouse gas emissions, 79% less land usage and 60% less energy consumption.
Last year, Oatly raised $200 million in a star-studded investment round led by private-equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and including Winfrey, Natalie Portman, an entertainment company founded by Jay Z and Schultz.

Verlinvest, the investment company of the family behind brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, remains Oatly's majority owner through a joint venture with Chinese government-owned China Resources, which invested in the company in 2016. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P.Morgan and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are among the lead underwriters for the offering.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>",Apollo co-founder Josh Harris to step down from private equity firm,"By Chibuike Oguh and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) -Apollo Global Management Inc said on Thursday co-founder Joshua Harris has decided to step down from his day-to-day role, the latest in a series of governance changes at the private equity firm.
Apollo said Harris will leave his role when the $11 billion all-stock merger with annuities provider Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd closes in the first quarter of next year. Harris, 56, will retain his seat on Apollo's board and executive committee, the firm said.
The move comes after Apollo co-founder Leon Black stepped down from all his executive roles at the private-equity firm earlier this year, in the wake of a law firm report that revealed he had paid late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017. The review had cleared Black of any wrongdoing. 
In March, Black, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago alongside Harris and Marc Rowan, stepped down as the company's chairman, with Jay Clayton, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chief, taking over as non-executive chairman. Earlier in January, Black relinquished his post as chief executive officer to Rowan after the report was published.
In elevating Rowan to become CEO, Apollo passed over Harris, who had been widely expected to take over the top job from Black.
Margaret Brown, a member of the board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), said she will take a wait-and-see approach on how Rowan fares as CEO. 
""What I’m looking for is stability, honesty and ethics in that leadership,"" Brown said.
Analysts on Thursday said Harris' departure from his day-to-day responsibilities was expected given Rowan's promotion and will not impact Apollo's fundraising of its flagship funds.
""The announcement seems orderly and, based on our conversations with investors, inevitable given the recent promotion of Mr. Marc Rowan to the CEO role,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note. ""Beyond the headline nature of the update, we do not think it will have an impact on PE Fund IX or the upcoming Fund X capital raise.""
Apollo said Harris will turn his attention to his investing business, his family's foundation and HBSE, a sports and entertainment company he co-founded with David Blitzer, a Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc senior managing director. HBSE's brands include National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils and the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers.

""After nearly 31 years at Apollo, it is time for me to start the next chapter of my career, where I will focus full-time on the platforms I've created outside of the firm,"" Harris said in a statement on Thursday.
Apollo's shares were trading at $56.48, down 0.89% as of 3PM ET on Thursday.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",One million U.S. households sign up for broadband subsidy -FCC,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -More than 1 million U.S. households have signed up to take part in a temporary $3.2 billion broadband subsidy program created by Congress in December, the Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday.
Over 900 broadband providers have agreed to take part in the program that provides lower-income Americans or people impacted by COVID-19 with discounts on monthly internet service and on purchasing laptops or tablet computers. Some providers estimate the program, which has been running since May 12, could run out of money in four to six months.
FCC acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, responding to reports that some carriers were not allowing customers with some plans to take part in the subsidy, told reporters the practice was unacceptable: ""They need to knock it off.""
Rosenworcel said consumers asked to sign up for a more expensive plan to take part should file a complaint with the FCC and she pledged to follow up with carriers.
""They may be finding a way to provide service consistent with the letter of the law but that behavior violates the spirit,"" Rosenworcel said.
 Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) said ""moving forward"" it would allow customers to enroll even if they have legacy service plans no longer offered.
""We are not asking customers to upgrade their plan in order to take advantage of the (program) benefits. Our goal is to help eligible customers find the plan that best meets their needs, the company said in a blog post.
Carriers declined to say how many consumers signed up. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) said the company had ""seen strong early participation.""
There are 33.2 million households eligible for the subsidy that already qualify for an existing program called Lifeline funded through surcharges on phone services.

AT&T (NYSE:T) said in January if only half of those Lifeline-eligible households take advantage of the emergency benefit, the new broadband program would cost as much as $800 million a month.
One big question remains whether Congress will choose to extend the program once funding runs out and how it would pay for it.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 04:38PM ET</span>","Robinhood to allow users to buy into IPOs, ahead of its own market debut","(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc on Thursday unveiled a new platform that will give retail investors the opportunity to buy shares in initial public offerings, something that has long been the exclusive domain of Wall Street funds. 
The popular online brokerage startup, which is preparing to make public its own IPO paperwork in the coming weeks, is rolling out the investing platform in phases for users of its trading app, a step in its quest to ""democratize"" finance.
Reuters was first to report plans for the new product, called IPO Access, in March. Sources have also told Reuters that Robinhood will set aside some of its own shares, expected to be floated in a blockbuster debut, for sale on the platform.
""Most IPO shares typically go to institutions or wealthier investors. With IPO Access, everyday investors at Robinhood will have the chance to get in at the IPO price,"" Robinhood said in a blog post.
Robinhood will work with Wall Street investment banks to get allocations for retail investors, it said.
Robinhood said the new platform will be available to all customers, without any account limit restrictions. It plans to list a number of upcoming IPOs for customers.
While Robinhood did not identify specific offerings which would be available, FIGS Inc on Thursday became the first company to offer shares to retail investors this way. The maker of medical scrubs, face masks and shields is reserving 1% of its IPO offering of 22.5 million shares for Robinhood users.
Several big names, such as grocery delivery app Instacart, Brazilian digital bank Nubank and electric vehicle maker Rivian, are expected to go public later this year.
TAKING ON WALL STREET
Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been the first in line for allocations on IPOs, as the investment banks that control share allocations find it easier to arrange it when only a handful of recipients are involved and because they need to keep these deep-pocketed clients happy to win other business.
That leaves most amateur traders with no option but to buy into stock of a newly listed company only after its shares start trading - which often means paying a higher price. The average first-day trading pop on U.S. listings of businesses in 2020 was 36%, according to data provider Dealogic.
Robinhood will gradually roll out IPO Access to all users in the coming weeks. 
Online lending startup Social Finance (SoFi) also said in March that it would allow retail investors to buy into IPOs. 
Robinhood's move, if adopted more widely in stock market listings, would be another disruptive step forward for Silicon Valley tech companies that have been attempting to erode the iron grip of Wall Street's biggest institutions on market flotations.

The new offering comes months after a Reddit-fuelled retail trading frenzy propped up several so-called ""meme stocks,"" most notably fledgling video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) Inc.
At the time, Robinhood faced widespread criticism over its decision to place restrictions on trading of the heavily-shorted stocks. Robinhood later said its clearinghouse forced it to place the curbs because it lacked sufficient capital to settle the trades.

Consequently, investors have been taking profits in tech stocks and rotating into cyclical stocks to capitalize on the economic recovery. This has caused the share prices of Oracle (ORCL), Intel (INTC), SAP SE (DE:SAPG) (SAP), and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) (ERIC) to decline since their last earnings reports. However, given that these companies are innovating quickly, we think they should recover with the continuation of some pandemic-driven trends. Let’s discuss this.Companies in the tech space have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic and their stocks have been red hot over the past year. But as government rescue packages and the central bank’s accommodative monetary policy fuel a robust economic rebound, concerns over rising inflation and Treasury yields are motivating investors to sell overvalued tech stocks and buy non-tech stocks that have turnaround potential.
Acknowledging the better-than-expected vaccination drive, investors are now anticipating slowing growth in demand for tech products and services this year because the United States is returning to more normalized conditions for commerce. This has caused tech stocks to lag the broader market so far this year, which is evidenced by the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF’s (VGT) 3.5% gains compared to the S&P 500’s 10.5% returns over this period.
However, some major multinational companies have already adopted a remote work culture permanently. Furthermore, investors must acknowledge that the current wave of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G network, cloud computing and virtual reality advances are expected to continue driving the tech industry’s growth. This year could see more spending on cloud and edge computing infrastructure, and tech stocks should continue their accelerated growth even in the post-pandemic world. Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to scoop up Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), SAP SE (SAP) and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson (ERIC). They could offer handsome upside from their current price levels based on solid fundamentals and strong earnings momentum.

Heavy rain in May 2020 caused high inflows in the Tittabawassee, resulting in the breaching and failure of the Edenville Dam, the license for which FERC had already revoked in 2018 for Boyce's failure to comply with safety directives and other license requirements.
Those floodwaters caused the Sanford Dam downstream to overflow and submerged parts of the central Michigan town of Midland, displaced thousands of residents and spread into a Dow Chemical Co plant in the riverfront city.
Midland is a city of some 42,000 residents about 120 miles (190 km) northwest of Detroit.
Following the flood, FERC said Boyce repeatedly failed to comply with additional safety directives.
As a result, FERC assessed Boyce a $15 million penalty for its inaction, which the commission said would not be paid until the victims of the flood recover from Boyce's liquidation.
FERC said it revoked the dam licenses because Boyce failed to meet the obligations of its licenses due to its loss of project property in condemnation and bankruptcy proceedings.
Four Lakes Task Force, a nonprofit organization, now owns the property associated with the projects and is coordinating the safe repair and management of the facilities, FERC said.
FERC said Four Lakes has no intent to generate hydropower at the sites. 

Together, the dams, including Edenville, were able to generate about 11 megawatts of power. The dams entered service in 1923, according to federal data.
One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.

Investing.com -- Markets bounced back today thanks to those cheeky tech stocks.
The taper game is in full swing, with indications on Wednesday that the Fed's starting to think about tapering bond purchases being countered by weak job numbers for April, themselves going contrary to the jobless claims that came out at the lowest yet in the pandemic earlier today. 
Bitcoin cut gains after the Treasury Department said it would require that any transfer worth $10,000 or more be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. In case you missed it, yesterday, billions of dollars were wiped off the total crypto market, leading to a plunge in BTC to $30,261. The crypto has since climbed back to $40,340.   
We'll get insight on home sales tomorrow, along with some more earnings and a little diplomacy in Washington, D.C. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Homes for sale
Existing home sales for April should show a slight improvement as the spring selling season gets going, though a lack of inventory will still work to keep numbers down and prices up. Consensus is for a monthly gain of 0.7% to 6.05 million. The numbers are due at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
2. Nothing runs like a...
Deere (NYSE:DE), which is one of the lone standouts reporting on Friday. Surging agriculture markets should help drive strong results for the farm-equipment maker. Estimates are for adjusted earnings of $4.47 a share on $10.3 billion of revenue.
3. A little Friday diplomacy

1622,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2021 02:59PM ET</span>",BigCommerce Eyes Global Growth in Online Sales Boom,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Like many other IPOs of 2020, BigCommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC) was received with a bang, with shares almost tripling on the first day of trading. 
The Software as a Service (SaaS) ecommerce platform company is down more than 35% since then, partly because of skepticism over upcoming comparables (with so many vendors going online, it had a pretty good 2020) and partly because anything in the growth and tech space has gotten beaten up amid the reopening -- the Nasdaq 100 has underperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. 
But for Chief Financial Officer Robert Alvarez, it's the long-term outlook that really matters. And it'll get here fast with BigCommerce's bet on a more flexible -- and more modern -- type of platform than competitors, he said.
""We've designed a whole architecture to make it easy to integrate,"" Alvarez said last week in an interview. ""That level of customization is a big reason we think we're going to be pretty disruptive in the market.""
What does this all actually mean? BigCommerce provides businesses with the technology to support and easily expand their websites. It uses headless architecture, which means it can plug and play with various kinds of old and new technology, in contrast to competitors that require customers to be entirely on their platforms. Without the ability to plug and play, merchants can end up incurring heavy costs, time and resources to build or rebuild software.
It's a differentiated view on the market, said Needham analyst Scott Berg. Big companies require  a depth of functionality and flexibility that BigCommerce can provide -- versus smaller companies that can do well with a basic platform -- and that's the target.
""BigCommerce has taken the approach to change the platform to serve the larger, upper-end of the market, and they've done a very effective job,"" Berg said in a phone interview. 
The company's closest competitor is Magento, owned by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which Berg says competes ""semi-effectively,"" but in order to truly rival BigCommerce, investments in research and development would be needed -- but that's not necessarily where their focus is.
""The more complex the business, the more integrations you need,"" Alvarez said. ""That's where we really shine, what we've done is differentiate.""The pace of innovation in ecommerce is accelerating daily, weekly, and merchants want to expand globally at a fast pace and tap the modern stack and modern code language used by BigCommerce. Customers include SkullCandy,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). Notably, annual recurring revenue (a closely-watched SaaS business metric that shows how much recurring revenue to expect a year from memberships) in enterprise plans (for mid- and large-sized companies) grew at 58% in the first quarter. The international business is also growing, with annual recurring revenue up 65% in the first quarter. Alvarez said. ""Ecommerce is growing even faster outside the U.S.,"" Alvarez said.  Regarding the weak performance of the share price, Alvarez cited strong results for the second quarter of 2020 and investor expectations for the ongoing quarter -- ""Is the company doing great just because of last year, or is the company doing great despite that?""  The recent dip in tech stocks overall led analyst Berg to lower his price target by 30% to match the ""valuation compression in the space.""
Still, the ""fundamentals of the business are really strong,"" Berg said.  Earlier this month,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight, noting ""the increasingly strategic importance of their eCommerce software. With strong fundamentals and more reasonable valuation, we upgrade to EW from UW, while keeping PT at $57."" 
BigCommerce has also yet to report a profit, and don't expect one in the near-term. Alvarez said breakeven is expected at the end of 2022, largely because of investments in growth areas. ""We believe this market is massive. The window to really differentiate ourselves is right now,"" Alvarez said.

Tech stocks have underperformed for a couple of months as economic growth surprises to the upside. Taylor Dart explains why you should consider buying now.Thus far, it’s been a turbulent year for the Nasdaq Composite, with the index starting 2021 with a 15% gain, before wiping out all of its year-to-date gains with inflation and the prospect of higher rates spooking the market. Currently, the Nasdaq is trying to find its footing near its 100-day moving average, but with minimal fear out there and still a significant amount of complacency, it’s unclear whether the bottom is in yet. While many stocks remain expensive after being bid up relentlessly last year, two QQQ constituents are reasonably valued after blowout Q1 earnings reports. So, if the market weakness continues, they look like two potential ideas to buy on dips.

Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA) have little in common other than being neighbors in the Nasdaq-100 Index, focusing on making self-driving a reality over the long run, and delivering solid results in their Q1 reports. In Alphabet’s case, the company smashed revenue estimates and reported $55.3BB in revenue, a massive beat vs. consensus of ~$52BB. This translated to 34% growth year-over-year and the company’s strongest quarter for sales growth in over two years.

For instance, we think the current valuations of  Carvana  (CVNA) and CarParts.com (PRTS) are not justified by their financials or growth prospects. So, these stocks are best avoided now. Let’s discuss.Automobile and auto parts sales took a major hit during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the demand for used cars and aftermarket auto parts and accessories increased later, with people moving to get their old cars fixed or buy used cars to avoid using public transportation. As the economy has started to recover, the overall industry has been witnessing a decent growth. While it is still grappling with a semiconductor chip shortage, it’s future growth looks hopeful with government support for the electrification of vehicles and proposed investment to address the semiconductor shortage.
According to Grand View Research, the global automotive aftermarket is expected to expand at a 3.8% CAGR from 2021 - 2028, to reach $529.25 billion. Investors’ increasing interest in automotive stocks is evident in First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 98.5% returns over the past year versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 45.9% returns.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 01:57PM ET</span>",Big pharma and private equity seek healthy returns in Europe's east,"By Agnieszka Barteczko, Anna Koper and Michael Kahn
WARSAW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - In the race to supply vaccines to end the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. drug developer  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) turned to emerging Europe to speed up production with a pair of deals that endorsed a growing trend for consolidation in the region.
As part of a doubling in merger activity, buoyed by a combination of private equity and big pharma, Novavax bought the Praha Vaccines factory near Prague in a $167 million transaction last May. It followed up by partnering with Polish biotech company Mabion in March.
Novavax decided the Praha Vaccines factory in Bohumil, Czech Republic, was the best solution to expanding vaccine production in Europe, spokeswoman Laura Keenan said, adding: ""Talent in the region was a key consideration.""
The pharmaceutical industry focused around Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland is dwarfed by that of nearby Germany, but industry insiders and analysts see scope for growth based on moderate costs and an expectation of higher healthcare spending, as well as a scientifically educated workforce.
For private equity, there is the lure of high returns, while big pharma can reduce costs by buying growing firms that have carried out large amounts of research and the location in the European Union means widely recognised standards are met.
The total value of inbound deals with disclosed value in the healthcare and pharmaceuticals industry in central and eastern Europe doubled to 1.9 billion euros ($2.31 billion) in 2020 from 932 million euros a year earlier, a report from consultancy Mergermarket and Mazars found.
""Even without COVID-19, the region's demographic and economic trends point towards activity in the sector,"" the report said.
""As the population ages and incomes rise, investors will continue to see a clear upside in consolidating the industry to cut cost and gain scale.""
MEDIEVAL PHARMACY MEETS THE MODERN AGE
A focal point of the activity has been Zentiva, a Czech company that traces its roots back to a medieval Prague pharmacy and last year acquired Alvogen's central European business for undisclosed terms from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. 
""For sure, consolidation in our region is inevitable,"" said Krzysztof Krawczyk, a partner at CVC.
For the drug companies, small innovators are of particular appeal. 
""It is easier for companies with strong shares in mainstream market segments to buy an innovative biotechnology company and thus skip the research and development phase and quickly expand their product range,"" Krawczyk said. 
Adam Pietruszkiewicz, a board member at Mabion, and also a partner at private investment company Twiti Investments, took a similar view.
""Most likely, the more of these companies and start-ups that appear, the more transactions there will be,"" Pietruszkiewicz said.
POLISH BIOTECH
Upstart biotech companies in Poland – eastern Europe's biggest economy – are attractive targets, investors and companies say, and also ambitious to grow themselves.
Selvita based in Krakow, southern Poland, completed its first international acquisition in January with a $38 million deal for Croatian Fidelta - owned by Belgium's Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) in January.
Although Selvita has drawn investor interest, it plans to remain a buyer rather than seller, executive vice president Milosz Gruca said.
He too predicted a combination of bigger drug companies and private funds would step up the pace of acquisitions of emerging companies.
""We have many new, young and successful innovative companies, which are shaping the new perspective for the CEE region and the way it is seen by investors,"" Gruca told Reuters. 
""Big pharma companies are interested in the programmes these smaller firms are bringing to the market. These companies will also be subject to potential acquisitions or partnering deals.""
POTENTIAL TO GROW
So far,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s 1.9 billion euro sale of Zentiva to U.S. private equity group Advent in 2018 is one of the biggest deals in the region.
Since then Zentiva has made two more acquisitions in emerging Europe and is scouring the region for others as it builds up its branded generics business, the director for the company's CEE business Hacho Hatchikian told Reuters.
He said Zentiva was targeting late-stage assets and openly exploring all options in biosimilars, or cheaper versions of biologic drugs made from living organisims.
The value of drugs sold in the 38.5 billion-euro German market is still more than three times that in the Czech, Hungarian and Polish markets combined, figures from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations show.
But the gap is expected to narrow as healthcare standards in eastern Europe converge with those of the West.

""The CEE markets provide a significant growth prospect as they follow a clear convergence trajectory to the Western European (and U.S.) standards both in treatment options and healthcare spending,"" Zentiva's Hatchikian said.

This, along with optimism surrounding the potential for federal decriminalization of cannabis, and growing awareness of the possible health benefits of cannabis, makes Wall Street bullish about the prospects of fundamentally sound pot stocks Green Thumb (GTBIF), The Supreme Cannabis Company (OTC:SPRWF), and CV sciences (CVSI). Analysts believe these stocks could rally by more than 50%. So, read on for details.Amid widespread legalization, increasing sales, and growing medical and recreational usage, the cannabis industry continues to attract the limelight. In fact, last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor of the upper chamber that he hopes to see an end to marijuana’s prohibition by next year’s 4/20. Now that federal decriminalization is up for discussion, pot stocks’ prospects look bright.
In just the past seven months, conservative Mississippi, Montana, and South Dakota, along with state legislatures in New York, New Mexico, and Virginia, have approved bills to legalize cannabis for recreational use. With more lawmakers from Delaware to Minnesota working on ending the prohibition, the cannabis industry has the potential to gain more momentum. Also, a growing awareness of the medicinal benefits of cannabis, and surging demand for plant-based treatments in pain management, are among the key factors that are expected to drive the industry’s growth. In fact, the cannabis market is estimated to grow at a 28.0% CAGR over the next 5 years to reach $90.4 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may be around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday, while cautioning that it did not yet have enough data to be conclusive.
Britain has suffered one of the worst death tolls globally from the pandemic, but has also had one of the fastest vaccine rollouts, generating a lot of data about the use of the shots in real-world settings.
It was the first country to roll out AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine, which faced questions over the construction of its clinical trials, the efficacy of the vaccine and the optimal gap between doses of its shot.
PHE said the preliminary findings were the first of its kind on the effectiveness of two doses of AstraZeneca in a real-world setting but cautioned that it had ""low confidence"" in the findings, and the results would be inconclusive until more evidence was gathered.
In a weekly surveillance report, Public Health England said the estimated effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, invented at the University of Oxford, was 89% compared to unvaccinated people.
That compares to 90% estimated effectiveness against symptomatic disease for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
""This new data highlights the incredible impact that both doses of the vaccine can have, with a second dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine providing up to 90% protection,"" vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said. 
AstraZeneca welcomed the preliminary findings.
""This latest real-world data from PHE adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of our vaccine against COVID-19,"" a spokesman said.
""It is reassuring to see the data from both the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines. They are essentially comparable in terms of effectiveness against symptomatic disease, which is very high after two doses,"" said Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health at the University of Southampton.
Britain has been rolling out the shots manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca since December and January respectively, and in April also started deploying  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine. 
PHE said there was a ""small reduction in vaccine effectiveness"" from 10 weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer shot before the second shot is given. 

Britain extended the gap between doses to 12 weeks, though Pfizer warned there was a lack of evidence of its efficacy outside the three-week gap used in trials.
Last week, Britain cut the gap between doses down to 8 weeks for the over 50s, aiming to give maximum protection to more vulnerable people in light of concern about the B.1.617.2 variant first found in India.

The retailer, however, beat expectations for first-quarter profit as efficient inventory management allowed it to sell more products at full price and offset supply-chain disruptions triggered by the pandemic.
The company does not expect the current pricing environment to be sustainable though as economies reopen, easing those constraints. 
""There is more full-priced selling that is available to us. So we're taking advantage of that now. We do believe as the year progresses ... some of those tailwinds will ease,"" Chief Financial Officer Jill Timm said on a post-earnings call.
With the economic reopening, U.S. retailers, including Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Macy's (NYSE:M) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), are moving past their inventory issues as they prepare to grab a bigger slice of consumer spending in the upcoming shopping boom.
Kohl's also said it expects its digital business, which made up only about 30% of its sales in the first quarter, to hurt its margins due to higher shipping costs.
The retailer also forecast annual sales growth largely below analysts' expectations.

""It's not just their comments on margins, specifically supply chain ... but they also just took a very prudent approach to the rest of the year,"" CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said.
Net sales rose about 70% to $3.66 billion for the quarter ended May 1, beating estimates.

Launched in 1995, Internet Explorer became the dominant browser for over a decade as it was bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system that came pre-installed in billions of computers.
The browser, however, started losing out to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Chrome in the late 2000s and has become a subject of countless internet memes for its sluggishness in comparison to its rivals.
To compete better, Microsoft launched the Edge browser in 2015 that runs on the same technology as the Google browser.
As of April, Chrome has a 65% share of the global browser market, followed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Safari, with an 18% share, according to web analytics firm Statcounter. Microsoft Edge has a 3% share, while Internet Explorer has a miniscule share of the market it once dominated.
The Windows software maker said on Wednesday the future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 was in its faster and more secure Microsoft Edge.
""Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022, for certain versions of Windows 10,"" the company said in a blog post. (https:// 
The browser was at the heart of an antitrust case against Microsoft more than two decades ago, with a U.S. judge deciding that the software titan had broken the law after it combined Internet Explorer and the Windows operating system.

Investing.com – Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) shares fell more than 8% Thursday after Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said, “We're not completely done with Covid.”
The restoration of a dividend, suspended due to the pandemic, didn’t help the stock price.
Louvet’s comments during a call for analysts come at a time when the global luxury industry is seen making a quick rebound as the pandemic retreats in the U.S. and Europe.
The luxury industry was among the worst affected in the pandemic as world economies went into multiple lockdowns at various intervals and companies like Ralph Lauren were forced to temporarily shut their stores.
The maker of polo shirts is not untouched by supply chain pressures and inflationary stress like higher freight costs, problems affecting so many other manufacturers and retailers.
The high-fashion retailer said it expects 2022 revenue to increase approximately 20% to 25% in constant currency. For the ongoing quarter, it is expected to increase approximately 140% to 150% in constant currency over last year.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters (TSX:TRI) expect net sales to surge 84%, to $1.13 billion for the quarter and 31.1%, to $5.66 billion for the year.
Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) analyst Michael Binetti called the forecast “Ultra conservative,"" according to Reuters.
The company’s fourth quarter revenue increased 1%, to $1.29 billion, driven by 35% growth in Asia revenue. North America revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 10%, to $569 million.
On a reported basis, net loss in the fourth quarter was $74 million.

By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators fined UBS, UniCredit and Nomura 371 million euros ($452 million) on Thursday in connection with a European government bond trading cartel. 
The penalties are the latest to punish the financial industry for alleged involvement in foreign exchange cartels, Euribor and Libor benchmark cartels, and bonds cartels.
The three banks said in statements that they would appeal or were considering doing so. 
The European Commission said the European government bond cartel ran from 2007 to 2011, with traders from the banks informing each other on their prices and volumes offered in the run-up to the auctions and the prices being shown to their customers or to the market in general via multilateral chatrooms on Bloomberg terminals.
""A well-functioning European government bonds market is paramount both for the eurozone member states issuing these bonds to generate liquidity and the investors buying and trading them,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
UBS said the fine related to ""a legacy issue"" and it had since taken action to improve its processes.
""Taking into account relevant provisions, this matter may have an impact of up to $100 million on UBS's second quarter 2021 results,"" it said.
UniCredit said the findings did not show any ""wrongdoing on its part"". 
""UniCredit will appeal the decision before the European Courts,"" the Italian bank said in a statement.
Nomura said it had introduced measures to ensure ""the highest levels of integrity at all times"" and would consider all options, including an appeal.
""The decision issued today by the European Commission and associated fine imposed on Nomura relates to historic behaviour by two former Nomura employees for an approximate 10 month period in 2011,"" it said.
The European Commission said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), RBS (LON:NWG) (now known as NatWest), Natixis and WestLB (now known as Portigon) also took part in the cartel.
NatWest escaped a 260-million-euro fine as it alerted the cartel to the EU competition watchdog. Bank of America and Natixis were also not fined because their infringement falls outside the limitation period for imposition of fines, the Commission said.

It said Portigon, the legal and economic successor to WestLB, received a zero fine as it did not generate any net turnover in the last business year.

The move comes after activist hedge fund Coast Capital asked other FirstGroup investors to vote against the proposed sale of the ""crown jewel assets"" unless the offer was improved. 
""We appreciate this has been a very difficult period in which to carry out a sales process,"" a Schroders spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
""However, after careful consideration of the merits of the proposed sale...we have the intention of voting against the deal as it stands, as we believe it undervalues these businesses.""
FirstGroup said on Tuesday it ""followed a comprehensive and competitive process in order to seek the best possible price"" for the assets. 
The deal has the backing of Columbia Threadneedle Investments, FirstGroup's third-largest shareholder with a stake of around 10%.
Schroder Investment Management owns nearly 12% of FirstGroup, while Coast Capital owns nearly 14%, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
""We continue to have full confidence in Chairman David Martin to provide the necessary leadership and vision for the ongoing business,"" the spokesperson for Schroders added.
Coast Capital founding partner James Rasteh welcomed Schroders' move to vote against the deal but declined to comment on whether the fund still has confidence in Martin.
FirstGroup plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt, contribute to its UK pension schemes and return money to shareholders.
Coast, however, also criticised the portion of proceeds that shareholders stand to receive from the deal.

FirstGroup, which will focus on its UK bus and train operations and the sale of Greyhound, had said that it would consider making additional distributions to continuing shareholders on top of the 365 million pounds it had earmarked.
The company will hold a general meeting on May 27 to vote on the proposed deal.

Investing.com - Bitcoin pared some gains Thursday as the Treasury Department said it would require that any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.
BTC/USD was up 3.06% at $40,536, but had traded as high as $42,425 prior to the news.  
“As with cash transactions, businesses that receive cryptoassets with a fair-market value of more than $10,000 would also be reported on,” the Treasury Department said in a report on tax-enforcement proposals released Thursday.
The announcement arrived a day after billions of dollars was wiped off the total crypto market, led by a plunge in BTC to $30,261.   
The U.S. crackdown comes amid concerns cryptos are being used in criminal activity including tax evasion. 
“Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion,” the Treasury said.
This isn't first time the U.S. government has mentioned cryptocurrency including bitcoin, and illegal activity in the same the breath. But some argue that as data on Bitcoin's blockchain, a public ledger of transactions, is recorded and can be verified, the popular crypto is unfairly dragged into the 'criminal activity' conversation.
But there has been a rise in Ransomware, a malicious software hackers use to gain control of sensitive data, and then demand a fee - usually in crypto - to restore access.   
""As of May 10, 2021, we know that ransomware attackers have taken in at least $81 million worth of cryptocurrency from victims. Again though, $81 million must be considered a floor for the time being, as the figure will almost certainly grow as we identify more ransomware addresses,"" according to Chainlink. ""The average known ransomware payment has more than quadrupled from $12,000 in Q4 2019 to $54,000 in Q1 2021."""

This strong rally can be partially attributed to a new multi-year high in inflation of 4.2%, which pushed real rates to a reading of (-) 4%, putting a relentless bid under the gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) price. While this sharp rally has left quite a few miners close to fully valued, there are still several miners trading at a deep discount to peers with the potential for more than 50% upside over the next 12 months.

MADRID (Reuters) - Iberia, the Spanish arm of IAG (LON:ICAG) airline group, expects its monthly flights to reach 60% of 2019 levels by July, as travel starts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
This month, Iberia is flying at 40% of May 2019 levels and expects to reach 50% of the last pre-pandemic June next month, Commercial Director Maria Jesus Lopez Solas told reporters on Thursday during the FITUR tourism trade fair in Madrid.
CEO Javier Sanchez Prieto said Spain needed to open up to the rest of the world, especially Latin America, following months of restrictions to air travel imposed to curb COVID-19.
The decision to reopen routes between Spain and Latin America should come within weeks, Prieto said.
""There's enormous pent-up demand: as soon as restrictions are lifted, we see bookings start pouring through,"" Lopez Solas said, adding Iberia planed to fly to 18 Latin American capitals in June.
The flag carrier wants to increase flights to Asia from Spain - now only 5% of the total - hoping to bring Madrid's Barajas airport in line with other European hubs, which average 20-25% of flights to Asia.

It said it had already seen a strong recovery in sales in the United States and Central America in March and April, with the Americas region, which also includes South America, contributing 53% of net sales in the first quarter of the year. 
Diaz said there was limited visibility on reopenings in the UK and continental Europe since it is not known when the European Union will introduce COVID-19 vaccination passports. 
The EU entered what was intended to be a final round of negotiations on Thursday to bridge differences over the use of COVID-19 certificates designed to open up tourism this summer.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Fugitive former car executive Carlos Ghosn suffered a setback on Thursday when a Dutch court ordered him to repay 5 million euros ($6.1 million) in wages to Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Mitsubishi in a case he had brought. 
The case, one of a series of legal battles involving one of the best known figures in the auto industry, centres around the Dutch-registered joint venture Nissan-Mitsubishi BV (NMBV), where Ghosn was ousted as chairman in 2019.
Ghosn claimed the Japanese companies violated Dutch labour laws when they dismissed him and had demanded compensation of 15 million euros for missed wages and severance payments.
But the district court in Amsterdam sided with the car companies, stating that Ghosn did not have a valid employment agreement with the joint venture, as it lacked the required consent of the boards of Nissan and Mitsubishi.
Ghosn was therefore ordered to pay back the 5 million euros in net payments he received from the Amsterdam-based joint venture between April and November 2018.
A spokesperson for Ghosn said the former chairman of the Nissan-Mitsubishi-Renault alliance would appeal the verdict so that the testimony of witnesses who would support his case could be heard.
Both Nissan and Mitsubishi said they were glad that their allegations were supported by the court. 
""We are pleased that the court has dismissed Carlos Ghosn’s unfounded claims against NMBV and ordered Mr Ghosn to repay the significant sums he appropriated unlawfully,"" Nissan said in a statement. 
The court found that Ghosn had wrongfully determined his own salary and sign-on bonus at NMBV, and that the board member who had signed his employment contract at the joint venture on behalf of the car companies did not have the power to do so. 
Ghosn, who has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, was chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi and chief executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes. 

He fled to Lebanon in December 2019 hidden in carry-on luggage on a private jet that flew out of Kansai Airport, and has remained in that country since.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - El Al Israel Airlines said on Thursday it was cutting 1,900 jobs as part of a broader plan to recover from the impact of COVID-19, even as its net loss narrowed in the first quarter due to steep cost-cutting measures. 
Israel's flag carrier reported an $86 million loss in the January-March period, versus a net loss of $140 million a year earlier. Revenue slid 64% to $117 million, while expenses such as salaries and jet fuel dropped 54%.
El Al, which has new ownership and management, has reported losses for three years and racked up debt to renew its fleet. It 
suspended scheduled passenger flights in March 2020 at the outset of the health crisis when Israel closed its borders to most foreign citizens, compounding its financial woes.
Following a rapid vaccination roll-out that has led to a steep drop in virus infections -- there are just 588 active COVID cases nationwide -- Israel has begun to open up some international routes again to its citizens.
Tourists will begin to enter on May 23 on a limited basis since there are still concerns over new coronavirus variants.
With fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza in a second week, El Al is one of a few airlines flying since some foreign carriers have suspended flights.
""These days we are going through a sensitive security period in which El Al is committed to its role in continuing to provide air travel to and from Israel,"" said CEO Avigal Soreq.
As part of a recovery plan mandated by the government to receive a bailout package, Soreq said El Al is laying off 1,900 employees, nearly one-third of its staff, in a process that will be completed in the second quarter.
""This step, along with other measures we are taking, on the financial and operational levels, will lead us to put El Al back on track and ... achieve a cash flow balance"" in 2021, Soreq said.

Earlier this month, the government approved a bailout package for El Al that has the state covering $210 million of company security costs. El Al also raised $83 million in the first quarter from the sale of options and plans a share issuance of $105 million by July.
On Wednesday, the state gave permission for U.S. businessman Kenny Rozenberg to join his son -- 28-year old religious student Eli Rozenberg -- in controlling El Al after he became an Israeli citizen. Funded by his father, Eli Rozenberg bought control of El Al last year.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 11:31AM ET</span>",Ralph Lauren's forecast for revenue surge falls short on pandemic uncertainty,"By Mehr Bedi and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Ralph Lauren Corp forecast on Thursday full-year revenue growth below analysts' estimates, as the high-end apparel maker remains cautious of fresh lockdowns, store closures and curbs in some of its markets from a new wave of virus cases.
Shares of the company, best known for its Polo shirts, tumbled 8% as the downbeat outlook comes when the global luxury industry is seen making a quicker-than-expected comeback from the pandemic blow. 
""We're not completely done with COVID, as you look at what's happening in Japan, what's happening in parts of Europe and other parts of Asia,"" Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet told analysts.
A spike in infections has forced many governments to put their economies back into lockdown, severely constraining a major market for high-fashion labels and reining in the momentum from digital sales across geographies.
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) also said it expects significantly higher freight costs and global supply chain pressures, particularly in the first quarter.
Several retailers, ranging from packaged food to apparel, are facing increased inflationary pressures from higher labor, raw materials and freight costs.
Still, Louvet noted that the company's brands should benefit later in the year from investments in digital platforms and a new fashion cycle as customers return to stores. 
For fiscal 2022, Ralph Lauren forecast revenue to increase about 20% to 25% on a constant currency basis. Analysts were expecting a 31.1% rise, according to Refinitiv.
""Ultra conservative,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Michael Binetti called the forecast. 

First-quarter revenue is expected to rise about 140% to 150%, but the company warned of a hit from lockdowns and other restrictions.
The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose about 1% to $1.29 billion and beat expectations for the first time in four quarters, but sales in North America fell a bigger-than-expected 10%.

Read on to find out.Fabless semiconductor company Himax Technologies, Inc.’s (HIMX) shares have more than tripled since hitting their 52-week low of $2.91 on May 27. Since HIMX’s chips are used in laptops, car navigation systems and augmented reality (AR) devices, the company saw solid demand during the pandemic, and its shares have gained 130.8% over the past six months to close yesterday’s trading session at $11.17.

In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E ratio, HIMX’s 6.64x is 72.5% lower than the 24.14x industry average. In terms of forward EV/S and P/S, its 1.31x and 1.37x, respectively, are lower than the 4.11x and 4.19x industry averages.
The rising demand for semiconductors has created a huge shortage of chips. And because HIMX is now ramping up its production, it should benefit significantly in the near-term.

Investing.com – Ford Motor shares (NYSE:F) rose than 3% after twin announcements, that of the company putting a price tag on its new electric truck and the other of it disclosing plans to form a joint venture with a South Korean firm to make batteries.
The base model of the company’s latest electric truck, F -150 Lightning, will carry a tag of $40,000, making it 20% more affordable than the next cheapest truck, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck. Rivals like the Rivian R1T and the Hummer EV cost a lot more.
Under the other announcement, Ford and SK Innovation have signed an initial pact to create a joint venture, BlueOvalSK, to produce approximately 60 GWh annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade, with potential to expand.
The tie-up with the Korean company, a pioneer in development of mid- to large-size EV batteries since 1991, shows Ford’s seriousness about its EV plans.
Last month, Ford announced a new global battery center of excellence – named Ford Ion Park – to accelerate its battery and battery cell technology research and development – including future battery manufacturing.
Ford is also putting in more equity in Solid Power, a producer of all-solid-state batteries for EVs. Solid-state batteries are showing great promise.

Colombia has come into focus after President Ivan Duque was forced to withdraw a tax reform proposal seen as important for fiscal stability in early May amid staunch opposition from lawmakers and deadly street protests. 
On Wednesday, S&P Global Ratings lowered its long-term foreign currency rating on Colombia to BB-plus from BBB-minus, predicting that fiscal adjustment will be more protracted and gradual than previously expected.
""It is highly likely that Fitch will choose to join them once the fate of the fiscal package is clarified, probably in 3Q, becoming the second agency to rate Colombia sub-investment grade,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Katherine Marney wrote in a note to clients.
Fitch rates the South American country at the lowest investment grade rank, with a negative outlook, while for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) it is two notches above ""junk.""
""Exact timing is difficult, with the bottom line instead being that we think the downgrade is coming close enough for markets to trade on it,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Simon Weaver, who also predicts that Fitch will become the second ratings agency to slash Colombia to junk.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) agreed that Fitch would follow in the ""near future"" given the bank's expectation that political restrictions will prevent ""meaningful"" structural tax reform.
Citi said it expected state-owned firms, banks and utility companies rated BBB- by S&P at the sovereign ceiling will likely also be downgraded.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) was surprised by S&P's decision before proposed tax reform discussions, describing it as ""premature"".
In markets, the peso shed about 0.8% to touch a one-week low to the dollar, while Colombian stocks fell more than 2%.
Sovereign Eurobond action was more mixed, with the 2026 issue slipping 0.6 cents to a seven-month low, Refinitiv data showed. Several longer-dated bonds advanced by similar amounts.
""We believe that much of the news is already priced in to both hard currency and local currency denominated sovereign bonds,"" said Lewis Jones, portfolio manager of emerging markets debt at William Blair Investment Management.
In May, JPMorgan calculated that Colombia could suffer outflows of more than $11 billion from its fixed income markets upon losing its investment grade ratings. This would include $3.2 billion out of its hard-currency sovereign bonds, $3.5 billion out of local sovereign treasury bonds as well as $4.7 billion of potential outflows from investment grade corporates.
Morgan Stanley said there could be potential forced selling of as much as $5.1 billion in the event of a potential full downgrade to high yield for Colombia.

""Another 50 basis point widening would at least bring Colombia closer to the level where other downgraded credits ended up trading six months after being downgraded, meaning around 240 bps for 10-year spreads,"" Weaver said.
Investment grade ratings from several agencies are a condition for inclusion of bonds in many key indexes while junk ratings preclude some investors from putting money to work in a country, with downgrades leading to forced selling especially among index tracking investors.

LONDON (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank has hired  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Stephane Gruffat as co-head of its equity capital markets unit in Europe, marking the departure of another senior banker from the Swiss lender which has been involved in a run of scandals. 
Gruffat joins the German bank's equity capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa after over two decades at Credit Suisse, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
Gruffat was most recently head of the equity capital markets syndicate at Credit Suisse. His move represents something of a coup for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which trails its Swiss rival in the global ECM stakes, and follows other recent departures from Credit Suisse.
Credit Suisse confirmed Gruffat's departure, declining further comment.
Last week, Reuters reported that Didier Denat, who spent 21 years at Credit Suisse, was to join Citi to help lead its alternative assets franchise in EMEA.
Credit Suisse has been plunged into crisis after losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos and suspending funds linked to collapsed British supply chain finance company Greensill Capital. The scandals have forced the bank to trim bonuses at a time when most of its rivals are expected to raise payouts after a bumper quarter for trading.
The ECM sector has been one of Credit Suisse's bright spots though, with its strong tech franchise in the United States helping keep it competitive with its Wall Street rivals. 
At Deutsche Bank, Gruffat will also be head of ECM syndicate for the EMEA region, and will report to Henrik Johnsson, the German lender's co-head of capital markets and European investment banking. 
Deutsche Bank reported its highest profit in seven years for the first quarter, driven by its investment bank that benefited from the boom in listing special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).

Data from Refinitiv shows that Deutsche Bank lies 16th in the league table of capital raised on stock markets globally with $6.65 billion. Credit Suisse is in seventh place in that table with $15.38 billion of league table credit. 
Gruffat has helped manage several high-profile stock market fundraisings in Europe including the listing of Spanish fund distribution firm Allfunds in Amsterdam last month.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd reported a forecast-beating 65% rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, while management reiterated the company's focus on compliance as China steps up scrutiny on tech giants.
Tencent, the world's largest gaming firm by revenue, booked profit of 47.77 billion yuan ($7.42 billion) for the three months through March, higher than the average analyst estimates published by Refinitiv of 35.45 billion yuan.
The results come as Chinese regulators have stepped up an anti-trust clampdown on internet giants, and have already penalised Tencent rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) $2.75 billion. Reuters reported last month that Tencent was told by Chinese anti-trust regulators to pay a fine that could exceed 10 billion yuan, give up exclusive music rights, and sell some of its music assets.
Tencent, along with Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, is also facing regulator scrutiny of its non-bank payment business.
Addressing a question on general regulatory compliance, Tencent president Martin Lau said the company is very focused on compliance and risk management, and very self-restrained in terms of the size of non-payment financial products. ""When we look into internal review, and when we look... to make sure that we are compliant with the spirit of regulators, it's actually relatively manageable,"" said Lau.Tencent is also facing mounting competition from ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, and the similar short-video platform Douyin, which have made sizeable inroads into the video games business.
Tencent also said on Thursday the company is investing in business services, games and short-form video content.Tencent, which gets 32% of its revenue from video games, unveiled more than 60 new titles at its annual video gaming conference last week. It is looking to launch a mobile version of its League of Legends game, and also a Pokemon game in partnership with Nintendo later this year.
Revenue rose 25% to 135.3 billion yuan, versus market expectations of 134.39 billion yuan.

Tencent said revenue from online games grew by 17%.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",How Ford burned $12 billion in Brazil,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -A century ago Henry Ford came to Brazil and established the town of Fordlandia, hoping to become an Amazonian rubber baron, but retreated deep in the red. 
Now the automaker he founded is once again licking its Brazilian wounds, having abandoned production in the challenging market after burning through roughly 61 billion reais ($11.6 billion) in the past decade. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co announced the closure of its manufacturing plants in January, dealing a heavy blow to its more than 5,000 workers in the country and almost 300 dealerships. 
Previously unreported corporate filings show the scale of the financial woes that led to the decision. Ford had burned through $7.8 billion, the bulk in accumulated losses but also some cash injections, according to the documents filed in Sao Paulo state, where the automaker is registered in Brazil.
Add to that the $4.1 billion that Ford will shell out to extricate itself from its commitments, and the price tag for the Brazilian operation rises to almost $12 billion. 
Almost all the losses and cash injections were in the past eight years, when the company has lost about $2,000 for every car it sold, Reuters calculations based on the filings and sales data indicate. 
Ford, which does not separate out Brazil from South America in its financial results, declined to comment on the losses, cash injections and calculations. 
The expensive retreat of the U.S. heavyweight underlines the risks for global automakers in Brazil, a country seen not long ago as one of the most promising growth markets in the world, but where tax, labor and logistics costs are high.
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained finances while Ford's problems also reflect, in part, a strategic misstep that saw it lag rivals in transforming its lineup of unprofitable compact cars into higher-margin SUVs, according to half a dozen sources familiar with the company's Brazilian operation.
Ford had in fact drafted a plan to shift into SUVs, larger cars with higher profit margins, but was too slow to implement it, they said. 
""There were no other viable options,"" Lyle Watters, Ford's head for South America, told Reuters in a statement about the decision to exit the country. 
Watters, who will start a new Ford role in China in July, cited an ""unfavorable economic environment, lower vehicle demand (and) higher industry idle capacity"" for the Brazil retreat.
He declined to comment on the SUV project, saying he would not ""speculate on new product plans.""
A Ford spokesman in Brazil said the company was implementing ""a lean and asset-light business model in the region, with a truly customer-centric mindset"".
BRAZIL VS MEXICO
Brazil is largely a lossmaker for global car companies, despite the government providing federal subsidies totaling $8 billion over the past decade and a 35% import tariff to shield local production. 
Domestic costs are high. Even though local factories can make 5 million cars a year, more than double the number sold in the country, exports are minimal because prices are uncompetitive. And it costs automakers money to keep factories open while operating at low capacity. 
Mexico, by contrast, exports more than 80% of the cars it makes, helped by free-trade agreements with the United States and Canada, making it an attractive alternative for the same carmakers that already operate in Brazil. 
A 2019 study by consultant PwC found that selling a Mexican-made car in Brazil was 12% cheaper for an automaker than selling a locally-made vehicle, including production, tax and logistics costs.
The study was commissioned by Brazilian auto industry group Anfavea, which is lobbying the government to reduce taxes and labor costs. 
The high Brazilian costs mean even carmakers who pivoted earlier than Ford to higher-margin SUVs, like the Brazilian units of players like Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Toyota Motors Corp, are struggling to stay in the black. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Brazil has lost $3.7 billion since 2011, according to the corporate filings in Sao Paulo state. GM Brazil has received $2.2 billion in cash injections since 2016, and Toyota Brazil last year required forgiveness on $1 billion of inter-company debt, the documents showed. 
Volkswagen and GM and Toyota all declined to comment on the filings figures. 
The Brazilian economy ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the Ford exit and problems faced by the auto sector.
PROSPECTS PLUMMET
Ford failed to develop a viable production business in Brazil despite a practice of pursuing tax subsidies, which totaled more than that of its rivals over the past decade. 
Since 2011, Ford has reaped about $2.6 billion in tax subsidies, or a third of all federal automotive incentives distributed in that period, according to Reuters calculations based on official tax forfeiture figures. 
Ford declined to comment on its tax benefits. 
In 2013, however, the business outlook began to change, as commodities prices crashed and dragged the local currency with it, sending Brazil into a deep recession made worse by corruption scandals. At the time, it was the world's fourth largest auto market. It now ranks seventh. 
Weak domestic demand and the uncompetitive exports pushed Ford to quintuple its bulk fleet sales between 2011 and 2019, and deepen the discounts to 30% or more, a person familiar with the pricing said.
Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, shored up its Brazilian subsidiary with $1.3 billion in cash injections, in nine transfers between March 2018 and January 2021, according to the Sao Paulo corporate filings.
By late 2019, Ford was considering the key strategic shift to manufacture SUVs in Brazil and had three models planned, according to three of the source 
Yet many of its competitors had already been revamping their lineup to produce such vehicles for about two years. 
""The truth is, Ford failed to modernize its product lineup at the same speed as its rivals,"" said Ricardo Bacellar, automotive head at KPMG's consulting arm in Brazil.
In the end, the SUV plans never came to fruition.
By April 2020, the economic pain wrought by the pandemic forced Ford to reevaluate its plans for Brazil, the automaker has said. 
Still, Ford made commitments to the government as late as November last year to invest more in Brazil and told its dealers in December that it expected improved sales in 2021, according to a government announcement and the dealers' association.
Yet just weeks later, it halted production.
It closed its three plants, the largest one in Camaçari, in the northeastern state of Bahia. It retains only a small operation selling imports, a niche market for high-end cars that the import tariffs make prohibitively expensive for many people.
On Thursday, Ford launched its new Bronco Sport SUV in Brazil. Made in Mexico, it is exported to the U.S. where it starts at $26,820. In Brazil, where per capita income is much lower, Ford said the Mexican-made car will retail for $48,000. 

While Ford sold 18,000 cars in Brazil in April 2019, it sold 1,500 cars in the same month this year.

LONDON (Reuters) -Daimler Truck aims to cut costs and boost profit across all regions by 2025 as it goes ""all in"" for electric and hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles, the world's largest truck and bus maker said on Thursday.
German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) plans to spin off Daimler Truck later this year as it seeks to increase its investor appeal as a focused electric, luxury car business. 
""Both technologies (electric and hydrogen) will be needed,"" Daimler Truck CEO Martin Daum told an investor presentation on Thursday. ""And we intend to lead the way in both technologies.""
Daimler Truck said zero-emission vehicles should make up 60% of its sales by 2030 and 100% of sales by 2039.
As truck makers move towards a zero-emission world - and their hitting sustainability targets becomes more important for their customers - electric trucks are expected to be used for shorter distances, but the batteries needed for longer journeys would be too heavy and hydrogen fuel cells will need to be used instead.
Daimler Truck executives said it will cut costs and capital expenditure while focusing on maintaining double-digit margins in North America. Daum said the truck maker will relentlessly target higher profits in both Europe and Asia. 
""We are absolutely committed to resetting profitability,"" Daum said. ""We have to deliver on this as a public company.""
""It will start first and foremost with fixing Europe,"" he added. ""Europe is our biggest challenge.""
By 2025 Daimler Truck is targeting margins above 10% under favourable market conditions, and between 6% to 7% under poor conditions, executives said.
Daimler Truck also plans to cut personnel costs by 300 million euros ($366 million) by 2022. 
The company said it was intensifying its partnership with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), choosing the Chinese battery maker as the supplier for its Mercedes-Benz eActros long-haul electric truck.
It also struck a deal with Shell (LON:RDSa) under which the energy firm will from 2024 launch hydrogen-refuelling stations between green hydrogen production hubs at Rotterdam in the Netherlands and in Cologne and Hamburg in Germany.
Shell has come under pressure from shareholders to intensify its efforts to tackle climate change.

Daimler Truck and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY) said last month they aim jointly to cut the costs of hydrogen fuel cells by a factor of five or six by 2027 as they seek to make the technology commercially viable for long-haul trucking.

Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich upgraded the stock to buy from a sell-equivalent following the Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) merger with WarnerMedia announced earlier this week to create a giant in streaming that will rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
""We believe the recently announced transaction between DISCA and Warner Media will spur further media consolidation as industry participants seek increased scale,"" the analyst wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. “In our view, VIAC’s deep breadth of content (library of 140K+ TV episodes and 3600+ films across sports, movies, comedy, news, children etc.) has value as an entire entity or if sold in individual parts.""
The analyst raised the price target to $53 from $38.
The firm had previously set a sell-equivalent on the stock on concerns over how it would manage the transition to streaming, but a merger would bring capital and scale needed to fuel spending on content, technology and customer acquisition, she said.
Shares of ViacomCBS are down about 60% since March after the company priced a $3 billion stock sale, and Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate shares of the company.

1661,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",The Great Commodities Boom of 2021 Is Facing Its First Big Test,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the biggest commodities booms in decades is looking for a fresh reason to power higher.
Markets from copper to oil to Corn surged recently as monetary stimulus and a recovery from the pandemic tightened supplies, fueling a debate about whether raw materials are in a new supercycle. But the rally is now wavering on worries about faster inflation, Federal Reserve hints at easing stimulus and China’s warning over measures to cool price spikes.
Commodities slid across the board on Wednesday on those concerns, in a wild day for markets that also saw huge swings in cryptocurrencies. Yet many reasons for higher prices -- from a stronger global economy to a coming wave of green spending -- are still intact. Plus, a big shift in monetary policy may be unlikely with economies in an uncertain stage of recovery.
“The commodities bull run is definitely not done yet,” said Eric Liu, head of trading at Chinese copper trader ASK Resources Ltd. “Every country is grappling with rising inflation, but as long as they don’t actually tighten monetary and fiscal policies, commodity prices can hardly cool off.”
There was a steadier tone on Thursday, with base metals mixed and grains markets edging higher, although iron ore futures fell and Brent crude extended declines. The oil market has been rattled by the prospect of a deal to end sanctions on Iran’s exports, while the coronavirus continues to hurt Indian demand.
Rally Cools
A Bloomberg gauge of spot commodities prices slid 1.8% on Wednesday as minutes of the Fed’s April meeting showed some policymakers were open to a debate on tapering at future meetings. Also, China issued a fresh warning of measures to curb rising prices, saying more needs to be done to prevent rising costs from being passed through to consumers.
The stronger rhetoric risks weighing on materials from copper to iron ore, which reached record highs this month on surging demand. Top commodities user China has also been buying huge amounts of crops, which helped push grains markets to multiyear highs, before the rally stalled.
Recent declines are “partly driven by a reversal of macroeconomic sentiment in the world, as some of the fundamental factors that helped push up asset prices eased,” said Zhang Chenfeng, a researcher at Chinese commodity hedge fund Shanghai Chaos Investment.
Bullish Reasons?
With markets looking for fresh drivers to resume the rally, energy bulls can point to the coming U.S. flying and driving seasons as lockdowns ease, as well as solid demand from Asia. Crops need almost perfect weather this summer in the U.S. and later in Brazil and Argentina for harvests to meet world demand, so any adverse weather could again cause price spikes.
Metals have benefited from a rush to replenish manufacturing supply chains and the prospect of years of green spending, which helped send economic bellwether copper above $10,700 a ton this month. Whether prices go higher partly depends on a clearer picture of infrastructure spending and how long loose monetary policies will last.
Wall Street has issued bullish outlooks.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). sees copper heading past $12,000 in the coming months. Major traders Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc and Trafigura say prices could jump much higher to spur enough supply to meet future demand from renewables and electric cars.
“I’m certainly in the camp of this being a healthy pause” for commodities, said Daniel Hynes, a strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY). “Any disappointing data or headwinds were always going to see some profit-taking, and I think the whole sector still has some upside.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, in a modest bounce from three straight days of losses after mixed economic data reassured market participants that the risk of the Federal Reserve withdrawing its stimulus this year was vanishingly smalll.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's main index of business conditions fell sharply to 52.7 from 66.6, according to data released earlier Wednesday, while the manufacturing index plummeted to 31.5 from over 50 a month ago. The index for prices paid by manufacturers hit a new 40-year high, but the indices for new orders and employment in manufacturing both fell
Combined with an unexpected rise in continuing jobless claims in the week through May 8, the numbers lent weight to the idea that evidence of the economy overheating is likely to be short-lived. 
Sentiment was also supported by a more vigorous rebound in crypto assets, relieving the pressure on many retail portfolios that had led to forced selling by leveraged accounts in Wednesday’s rout. Proxies for crypto exposure all recovered partially, with Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rising 2.3%, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock rising 6.0% and Square (NYSE:SQ) stock rising 1.4%.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively flat at 33,873 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. 
Among individual movers, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock fell 2.8% amid concerns that its strong last quarter could represent a cyclical high point. The maker of networking equipment said it expected margin pressure from the global chip shortage to last throughout the year. Ford.. another company to be hit by the global chip shortage, rose 4.4% stock, as the encouraging presentation of its electric F-150 model on Wednesday outweighed the news that it will have to stop production in a number of plants again in June.
Retail stocks were again in focus after the latest round of quarterly earnings. Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) stock fell 6.9% in response to news of a quarterly loss, driven largely by renewed lockdowns in Europe. The company nonetheless reinstated its dividend. Kohls (NYSE:KSS) stock fell over 11% after a swing back to profit and increased guidance for the full year failed to keep up with expectations that had already generated a 50% rally in the stock this year.
Among the gainers, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) jumped 13.5% after confirming that its repeatedly delayed test flight will go ahead on May 22 as planned. The stock is still well down from its February highs, however, after a sharp sell-off caused by the exit of key insiders such as Richard Branson and 'SPAC King' Chamath Palihapitiya. "

Kansas City last week accepted Canadian National's $33.6 billion bid, upending a prior $29 billion deal with  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP), which has until the end of Thursday to raise its offer.
The U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) on Monday denied Canadian National's motion for approval of voting trust agreement, while the U.S. Department of Justice last week said the company's bid for Kansas City appears to pose greater risks to competition.
The STB had earlier this month approved the voting trust for Canadian Pacific's proposed acquisition of Kansas City.
Canadian National said it was preparing a renewed motion for the STB to approve its proposed voting trust to be filed on or before May 21. 
""We respectfully believe there is no longer any basis to terminate the CP-KCS Merger Agreement,"" said Canadian Pacific in a letter to Kansas City Southern's Board. 

""The best way for the KCS Board to fulfill its fiduciary duties in light of recent developments would be to continue to pursue the CP-KCS combination, which already has the benefit of STB approval to use a voting trust,"" the letter read.
Billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hohn on Tuesday urged Canadian National to abandon its bid unless the Canadian railroad operator changed its agreement to drop the key voting trust feature that could invite more regulatory scrutiny.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>",Stellantis to restructure dealers network to face industry changes,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Gilles Guillaume
MILAN (Reuters) -Carmaker Stellantis will completely restructure its European dealers network as it seeks to adapt to changes in the industry brought by electrification, including a boom in online sales, and achieve promised post-merger synergies.
After Stellantis was formed at the start of the year by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has taken action on several fronts, from cost-cutting to technology partnerships.
The world's fourth largest carmaker has promised more than 5 billion euros ($6.10 billion) in annual synergies and said 7% of them would be driven by savings on sales operations and general expenses.
Stellantis will end all current sales and service contracts with European dealers for its 14 brands, with effect from June 2023, it said in a statement seen by Reuters on Thursday.
""Customers will benefit from a multi-brand and multi-channel approach with a wider range of services,"" the group said. 
Current contracts will remain valid for two years, but will be issued with termination notices at the end of this month, while the new distribution and servicing network will be selected shortly thereafter, based on objective key criteria and factors, it added.
""We are going to work with representatives of networks to establish factual criteria on which we are going to build in 2023 a performing network,"" a spokesman for the group said.
It was however unclear whether the process would bring to a reduction of Stellantis' network in Europe. 
The network restructuring will not involve dealers of Stellantis luxury brand Maserati and those in the United States, home of some of the group's most popular brands such as Ram and Dodge.
Stellantis said the decision was also taken in anticipation of upcoming regulatory changes in the industry. 
As of June 2023, significant changes will be made to the European Union's Block Exemption Regulation (BER), which has granted antitrust exemptions to carmakers allowing them to operate franchise networks where they can dictate who sells their products and where.
Regulation is also expected to evolve to take into account changes brought about by the boom in online sales and new market players such as e-commerce platforms.
European vehicle dealer and repairer lobby CECRA said in a statement it would carefully follow the evolution of the restructuring and called for ""a balanced distribution model between manufacturers and their networks after June 2023"". 

It also noted the Austrian Supreme Cartel Court had recently banned the Peugeot brand from tying dealer payments to customer satisfaction surveys and from subsidising prices of vehicles sold at its manufacturer-owned outlets.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>","India's vaccine output likely to fall short of target, sources say","By Neha Arora and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's output of COVID-19 shots for August-December is likely to be lower than the government's public estimate, according to internal projections shared with Reuters by two sources.
Lower-than-expected production could delay India's plans to vaccinate all its adults this year, amid fears the country will face another surge of coronavirus infections in the winter. India's ongoing second wave, the world's worst since the pandemic began, has overwhelmed its health system.
The government last week publicly estimated 1.46 billion doses of its three approved shots - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Sputnik V and Covaxin - would be made between August and December.
Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which the Serum Institute of India (SII) is the biggest maker in the world, is expected to reach 100 million to 110 million doses a month from July and stay at that level for the foreseeable future, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
That would be at least 200 million doses less than the government's public forecast of 750 million AstraZeneca doses for the last five months of the year, a 27% shortfall.
An internal government projection for August and September shared by a second source put the monthly number of AstraZeneca doses at 100 million, out of 200 million for all the three approved shots combined.
The sources declined to be named discussing a subject on which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been criticised due to a shortage of vaccines. Immunisations have fallen https://dashboard.cowin.gov.in sharply since an April peak.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare did not respond to queries from Reuters.
SII, which is facing raw material shortages for another vaccine that the government is banking on, declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Covaxin-maker Bharat Biotech said that last month the company raised its annual production capacity to more than 500 million doses, or about 42 million doses a month. It has been producing about 10 million doses a month.
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, the local distributor for Russia's Sputnik V, did not respond to a request for comment.
Apart from the approved vaccines, the government has also forecast August-December production of 866 million doses of five yet-to-be-approved vaccines. Overall, the government has pledged to make 2.67 billion doses available this year.

SII has already halted exports until the end of the year to meet domestic demand, in a major blow to dozens of poor countries relying on it for supplies.
India has so far administered 187 million vaccine doses, the most after China and the United States, but fully immunised only about 3% of its 1.35 billion people.

The unit, Morgan Health, will initially invest up to $250 million and work with the JPMorgan Chase's benefits team to collaborate with other healthcare organisations to improve care for its staff in the United States. It will be headquartered in Washington, D.C.
Dan Mendelson, founder and former CEO of health consultancy firm Avalere Health, will lead the unit and report to the bank's Vice Chairman Pete Scher. Mendelson was also the associate director of health in the White House Office of Management and Budget under the Clinton administration.

Haven, the joint venture between the three companies to lower healthcare costs for their U.S. employees, was disbanded in February. Its launch had raised concerns among other healthcare companies who feared a disruption in traditional insurance and drug benefit businesses.
The bank also said it has 165,000 employees in the U.S. and provides health insurance coverage to 285,000 employees and dependents.

TOKYO (Reuters) -EOS at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) has yet to decide if it will back a shareholders' resolution sponsored by activists seeking to push Mitsubishi UFJ Group (NYSE:MUFG) to align itself with global climate change goals, the asset manager said. 
EOS Hermes, which is in talks with the bank, spoke exclusively to Reuters after MUFG said this week that it aimed to achieve carbon neutrality in its lending by 2050.
""We believe the wording and request of the shareholder resolution appear sensible and in line with our engagement with the bank,"" said Sachi Suzuki, Japan lead engager for EOS Hermes, which has assets of $1.5 trillion under advice.
EOS Hermes welcomed Monday's announcement, along with the bank's commitment to align its business with the goals of the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, Suzuki added.
""We, however, have some remaining concerns,"" Suzuki told Reuters in an email late on Wednesday. ""We will continue to engage with the bank before we make our final decision about voting recommendations.""
Suzuki was referring to a shareholder resolution submitted to the bank by Japanese non-government organisation Kiko Network and Rainforest Action Network, for a vote at its annual general meeting (AGM) in June.
Contacted for comment by Reuters, MUFG said it acknowledged receipt of the shareholders' resolution and was formulating its response for the AGM vote.
Investors concerned about the impact of climate change are increasingly using such resolutions to push banks to withdraw from funding fossil fuels such as coal, making mines and coal-powered power stations unattractive investments.

Kiko Network said it would pursue the resolution after talks with the bank following its announcement on carbon neutrality.
EOS Hermes represents 0.85% of the shares in MUFJ on behalf of its clients, although it does not give advice on voting to all those shareholders.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 09:04AM ET</span>",Ford wires its electric trucks for business customers,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co's newly revealed electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup doubles down on a bet that the company can beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other rivals by giving new technology a familiar face and convincing long-time fleet and business customers that going electric saves money.
Ford officially unveiled the battery electric F-150 Lightning model on Wednesday evening, after giving it a cameo appearance during President Joe Biden's visit on Tuesday to the Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan, where the trucks will be assembled beginning next year.
Based on customer response, Ford has already moved to increase planned manufacturing capacity https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-ford-electric-idUKL1N2HV3DW for the electric F-150 by ""tens of thousands"" of vehicles a year, Ford's head of Americas and International Markets, Kumar Galhotra, told Reuters ahead of Wednesday's official debut. He did not disclose the new production targets.
Ford expects to boost annual production of the electric F-150 to 40,000 vehicles or more, starting in 2023, according to Sam Fiorani, head of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. 
Ford executives said ahead of Wednesday's debut they have a different strategy for selling electric trucks and vans in volume from Tesla or General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).. 
Where Tesla and GM are positioning their initial electric pickups as lifestyle vehicles for the affluent, Ford executives said they are focused on convincing commercial fleet operators - a market Ford dominates - that the F-150 Lightning and electric Transit are cost-effective, rational choices. 
""That's the only way you can build up the volume,"" said Ted Cannis, Ford's general manager for commercial vehicles. 
COMPETITION 
The electric F-150 and an electric version of Ford's Transit van due out late this year look like, and share many components with, the gasoline versions that are top-selling profit machines for the No. 2 U.S. automaker. 
A ""commercial base"" version of Ford's F-150 Lightning will start at $39,974 before tax credits, including a $7,500 federal tax credit Ford buyers can still get and Tesla and General Motors buyers cannot. That price is about $10,000 more than the cheapest gasoline-fueled F-150. 
Besides an estimated 230 miles (370 km) of range, the base F-150 Lightning comes with a 15.5-inch (39.37 cm), Tesla-style dashboard screen, a roomy ""frunk"" storage space where the gas engine would be, and enough plugs and juice to power a construction site for up to three days, Ford officials said.
A Lightning XLT model, which aligns with the best-selling version of the gasoline F-150, will start at $52,974, Ford said. That is 51% higher than the gasoline XLT's base price.
Ford plans more expensive versions of the F-150 Lightning, including a ""Platinum"" model with an extended-range battery likely to be priced around $90,000. 
Tesla's electric Cybertruck, which looks like it rolled off the set of a science-fiction movie, is due to begin high-volume production in 2022, and its price will start at $39,900. GM's first electric pickup is an ""electric supertruck,"" the GMC Hummer EV, priced from $79,995 to nearly $100,000. High-volume production will begin in fall 2022, after a small initial run of trucks this autumn.
GM plans to introduce a Lightning competitor, the Chevrolet Silverado EV, in late 2022, Fiorani said. It will be built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform that it shares with the upcoming Hummer EV, GM has said.
GM is also moving into the electric delivery van segment with a new unit, BrightDrop, and a new purpose-built electric van.
Ford is using a heavier-gauge steel for the frame of the F-150 Lightning, but did not undertake a complete redesign to integrate the battery pack into the chassis.
By staying close to the current model, Ford can offer the electric truck sooner, at a competitive price ""and make money on it,"" said Darren Palmer, general manager for Ford's electric vehicles.

Ford plans to offer software-enabled services to fleet and business customers, such as tracking driver behavior, predicting maintenance and planning delivery routes, said Ford's Cannis. 
Once Ford starts charging for these services, ""then you're in the subscription game,"" Cannis said.

The planned IPO move comes as many fitness chains have been forced to close gyms during coronavirus lockdowns. 
SmartFit has used the period to embark on acquisitions and increase its footprint in Latin America, where it has 928 gyms in 13 countries and 2.4 million clients.
An IPO filing on Wednesday by SmartFit, which has private equity firm Patria Investiments, Canada's CPP Investments and Singapore's GIC among its investors, did not mention its planned valuation.
GIC, CPP and asset management firm Dynamo have agreed to invest up to 750 million reais ($141 million) in the IPO, if SmartFit raises at least 1.75 billion reais in the offering and prices its shares at up to 420 reais each.
SmartFit posted net revenues of 1.26 billion reais in 2020, down 37% from the previous year. Its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell to 53.8 million reais in 2020, from 551.3 million reais in 2019.

Investing.com – Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) shares fell almost 7% in Thursday’s premarket on worries that its recent quarterly growth may not sustain once stimulus checks are spent.
The fact that quarterly sales remain below the 2019 levels is also not lost on the traders. That was when most in the world hadn’t heard about coronavirus.  
The company raising its guidance was of no help too for the stock.
Kohl's now expects full-year net sales to increase in the mid-to-high teens percentage range as compared to 2020. Its previous forecast saw only a mid-teens growth.
EPS is now seen between $3.80 and $4.20 as opposed to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.95 given on January 30.
Net sales for the quarter ended May 1 increased 69% from the same quarter a year ago to $3.66 billion but remain below the $3.82 billion that Kohl’s booked in the same quarter that ended May 4, 2019.
Net income bounced back to $14 million from a loss of $541 million in the quarter ended May 2 a year ago. It was a positive $62 million in the three-month period ending May 4, 2019.   
Today’s price movement in Kohl’s mirrors the trend other retail stocks like  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) have experienced as they lost momentum following the results announcement.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 08:38AM ET</span>",Private equity's falling out of love with plastic packaging,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A decade ago, private equity couldn't get enough of plastic packaging. They snapped up companies making bags, films and trays to contain everything from food and fashion to drink to drugs, drawn by reliable cash flows and consolidation prospects. 
But now the sector's not quite so in vogue. Many buyout firms are steering clear, and some of those holding assets are struggling to offload them at what they consider attractive prices, according to people involved in such deals. 
This reversal illustrates how much the investment world has recalibrated itself in a matter of years, with environmental factors becoming dealmakers or breakers.
""No plastic packaging firm would pass our internal ESG check and we would pass even if such an investment would promise a large return,"" said Marcus Brennecke, co-head of EQT (NYSE:EQT)'s private equity advisory team.
""While we have invested in plastic packaging in the past – we owned Faerch Plast from 2014 to 2017 – we would not buy a plastic packaging firm today.""
Such ESG - environmental, social and governance - risks include new EU rules due to be brought in next year requiring packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2030. 
Private equity investment in the global plastic packaging sector has already slowed in recent years, with the combined deal values in 2016-2020, of $1.3 billion, being a third lower than in the five prior years, according to Refinitiv data. 
HUNTING ECO-CHAMPS
That doesn't mean there are no deals to be done, though. 
The plastic packaging market was worth $265 billion in global sales last year, according to figures from Market Data Forecast. Many investors continue to see the value in packaging assets, banking on solid growth prospects as no comparable substitute has been found for mass-market goods like food. 
But they are hunting the eco-winners, which requires a close look at the details. 
This week, buyout firm Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Goldberg sold food and pharma packaging maker Schur Flexibles to Austrian investor B&C, days after CVC sold Sweden's AR Packaging (NYSE:PKG) to U.S.-based Graphic Packaging (NYSE:GPK) last week.
""We still consider the packaging sector to be highly attractive,"" Thomas Unger, managing partner at Lindsay Goldberg Europe, adding that the trend towards sustainability was becoming a decisive factor. 
""Companies that score points with material efficiency, closed material cycles and the most positive ecological footprint possible will win,"" he added. ""Companies that fail in this challenge will lose drastically in their value."" 
Partners Group, which was close to striking a deal to buy Schur in 2019, did not participate in the bidding this time, sources close to the matter said.
""We are very cautious about future investments in plastic packaging firms, for reasons including ESG concerns,"" said Juergen Diegruber, partner at Partners Group, whose portfolio firm Hoffmann, a caterer, recently switched to paper packaging from plastic to improve its environmental footprint. 
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
Having a plan to make an acquired company ""greener"" is proving essential, deal experts say.
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, which bought a majority stake in Portuguese packaging maker Logoplaste in February in a 1.4 billion euro deal, said it planned to make all the firm's packaging reusable or recyclable by 2025 and would increase the recycled content in its products.
Logoplaste even added ESG-linked interest costs to an institutional term loan last year, with the level of interest payments tied to its carbon emissions and use of recycled plastic.
Similarly, private equity firm SVPGlobal has revamped German packaging maker Kloeckner Pentaplast (kp) since it acquired it in 2012. 
""kp's use of recycled materials is about three times higher than the competition. We have supported the company to set tangible ESG targets and we were delighted when kp issued the first-ever ESG ratchet-linked term loan in the U.S. market earlier this year,"" said SVPGlobal founder Victor Khosla. 
That loan also sees interest payments linked to ESG factors.
Investors are likely to pore over ESG credentials in upcoming auctions. 
Information packs have just gone out to prospective buyers of Polish plastic packaging firm Alupol, owned by Grupa Kety, while London-based private equity firm  3i  (LON:III) is expected to launch a sale of Germany-based Weener Plastics next year.
Grupa Kety and 3i declined to comment on the upcoming auctions.
UNDER ESG MICROSCOPE
An investment banker who worked on a European plastic packaging deal earlier this year said the environmental factors had been under the investor microscope. 
""Does the target use recycled raw materials, how good is the recyclability of its products etc? A low ESG score translates into a low multiple,"" he added, referring to a company's valuation as a multiple of earnings.
""While ESG was a marginal topic two to three years ago a large amount of work went into preparing ESG reports this time.""
Some investors said that even companies in associated sectors face being impacted by the tougher line being taken on ESG.
A test of this could come when with the sale of printing ink maker Flint's flexographic unit, whose products are used to print on plastic and paper packaging, and which asked for first-round bids from prospective buyers earlier this month.
Flint declined to comment.
While there are doubtless opportunities to be seized in packaging, some investors aren't willing to take the risk.
""Plastic packaging - not for us. Our teams aren't fond of this, they'd struggle to explain it to our investors,"" said the Europe manager of one of the largest U.S. private equity firms. 

""And who'll buy it in five years when ESG will likely be taken much more seriously than today.""

1675,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",'I'm not very social': ByteDance founder to hand CEO reins to college roommate,"By Echo Wang and Yingzhi Yang
(Reuters) - Zhang Yiming announced he will step down as CEO of TikTok-owner ByteDance, saying he lacked the social skills to be an ideal manager and naming his college roommate Liang Rubo as his successor to navigate a rising tide of Big Tech regulations.
In a surprise announcement to employees on Thursday, first reported by Reuters and later disclosed by the company, Zhang said the change would enable him ""to have greater impact on longer-term initiatives"". He will move to a ""key strategy"" position at the end of the year, ByteDance said.
The 38-year-old will be succeeded by Liang, a long-time colleague and the current head of human resources at ByteDance, one of the world's biggest private tech companies with an estimated value of about $300 billion in recent trades.
The management shake-up - ByteDance's biggest since its launch in 2012 - comes as Chinese regulators are increasing scrutiny of the country's biggest technology firms. 
In April, they handed e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd with a $2.8 billion fine for anti-competitive practices, and last year suspended fintech affiliate Ant Group's initial public offering (IPO).
Anti-trust regulators have also told Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd they are preparing to fine the gaming giant as much as $1.55 billion, Reuters reported that last month.
Zhang, who turned ByteDance into a social media force, said he was not in fact a social person. 
He blamed the day-to-day challenges of a CEO as being a hurdle to research and innovation, while calling Liang ""an invaluable partner"" with ""strengths in management, organization, and social engagement"".
""I'm more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles, and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work, rather than actually managing people,"" Zhang, who will remain in his role as chairman, wrote in the memo.
""Similarly, I'm not very social, preferring solitary activities like being online, reading, listening to music, and contemplating what may be possible.""
In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Liang - also 38 - said the new role represented a ""huge challenge"" with ""a lot of pressure"".
Liang, not a household name in China, roomed with Zhang at Nankai University in Tianjin, China. He also worked with him at real estate website 99fang.com prior to joining ByteDance. Liang on his LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubo-liang-54744824 said he is a ByteDance co-founder. 
'WISE AND NECESSARY CHOICE' 
Tech consultant Zhou Zhanggui said ByteDance faced slowing growth of its core China business and needed to reinvent itself.
""If these problems cannot be resolved, it's highly possible that the company will encounter major setbacks in the future. I think Zhang's choice is wise and necessary, no matter whether his decision is made actively or passively.""
The announcement comes less than a month after Bytedance's chief financial officer, Shouzi Chew, became CEO of flagship short-video app TikTok. That post came up for grabs when Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, left after three months as TikTok became embroiled in a spat between Washington and Beijing. 
Zhang owns 20% to 30% of ByteDance and holds over 50% of voting rights, people with knowledge of the matter previously have told Reuters. ByteDance did not comment on Zhang's stake.
The founder said he began a discussion with a small group of people in March about the possibility of appointing Liang as his successor and will work with him over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition.
""Based on previous experience it's likely we could see a slowdown of investment in new businesses, while they could pay more attention to old businesses as the new management team needs some time for adjustment,"" said Shawn Yang, managing director of Blue Lotus Capital Advisors. 
ByteDance, which employs over 100,000 people worldwide, had been preparing for a much-anticipated IPO this year, but halted the plans in April.
""I think it's possible that Zhang is concerned that after the IPO he would see a ballooning of his wealth and get a lot of attention from the media. It is hard to be a rich person in China. You don't get as much recognition,"" said Beijing-based technology analyst Li Chengdong.
U.S.-CHINA TENSIONS
Zhang is the latest in a small group of founders of Chinese tech firms to move away from day-to-day management.
Colin Huang, founder of e-commerce firm  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc, stepped down as chief executive in 2020 and as chairman in March. The 41-year-old, who owns about 30% of Pinduoduo, will also give up his super voting rights.
ByteDance's previous big organizational shake-up occurred last year, when Zhang appointed Zhang Lidong as chairman at ByteDance's China business, and Kelly Zhang as CEO.

TikTok has sought to distance itself from Beijing after the United States raised national security concerns over the safety of the personal data it handles.
Former U.S. president Donald Trump's administration sought to force ByteDance to divest control of the app. A U.S. plan to sell TikTok's American operations to a consortium that included  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc languished, however, after ByteDance launched successful legal challenges.

(Reuters) - Companies with environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials have been high on the list of merger targets for U.S. special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) so far in 2021, data from Nomura Greentech showed.
U.S. IPOs by SPACs with a focus on ESG or sustainability and in sectors including environmental technology, transportation, industrials, water and energy totalled 49 in the first four months of 2021, out of a total of 306, Nomura's data showed.
That compares with 40 in the second half of 2020. 
Graphic: ESG SPAC IPOs since 2020 - https://graphics.reuters.com/SPAC-IPOS/azgpogmdqpd/chart.png
By transaction, 32 SPAC mergers with ESG firms have been announced so far in 2021, against 31 for all of 2020, Nomura's data showed said. 
The value of the deals, at $117 billion, is more than 2.5 times that raised in 2020 and accounts for 38% of total SPAC merger volume, up from 25.3% in the second half of 2020. 
Driving the ESG growth were three converging forces: lower costs, driven by technology and innovation; customer demand for sustainable products and services, and strong policy support, Jeff McDermott, Head of Nomura Greentech, said.
""With over 50 active ESG SPACs currently seeking targets, and more still to price this year, we believe... investors will continue to fund high growth ESG companies,"" he added. 
The growth in demand to invest in companies with a strong ESG profile has risen as policymakers drive a low-carbon economic transition to combat climate change and investors look for companies that will prosper in the new environment.
The election of President Joe Biden and subsequent commitment to accelerate U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has also underpinned a rush of demand to invest in funds focused on renewable energy.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an IPO to acquire a private firm, which then becomes public as a result of the merger. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over a traditional IPO.
Global SPAC volumes hit $286 billion in the first four months of this year, versus $163 billion in 2020, Refinitiv data showed. Sustainable bond issuance, meanwhile, hit a record high of $264 billion in the first quarter
However, the stellar growth has drawn the ire of regulators, concerned investors were being put at risk by the relatively laxer rules that allow a SPAC to avoid more intense due diligence accompanying a normal IPO.

Graphic: TOP-10 ESG SPAC worst-performers - https://graphics.reuters.com/SPAC-IPOS/jbyprylozve/chart.png
A Reuters analysis showed top 10 ESG SPACs have delivered a return of 4% this year, compared with a decline of 0.2% for non-ESG SPACs on average. 
Jonathan Bailey, head of ESG investing at Neuberger Berman, said the U.S. asset manager had ""looked at hundreds"" of SPACs but invested in ""very, very few"".

While a lot of companies being brought to market through a SPAC had an environmental theme, many were arguably at the venture capital stage of their growth cycle, without a proven product or positive cash flows, he said.
""So we have an appropriate scepticism both on the governance side and on some of the environmental themed offerings that are out there.""

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) shares were big gainers in Thursday’s premarket after the company confirmed May 22 as the date for the launch of the rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo Unity.
By 8:04 AM ET (1204 GMT), Virgin Galactic shares were up 21% at $21.54 apiece. They're still down by more than half from their peak in February, however.
The flight has been long delayed and is now pending only weather and technical checks, the company said.
The announcement comes as a shot in the arm for the company’s scientists and crew as it is seen as lagging SpaceX in the private space travel industry.
It follows a spate of negative news flow out of the company in the last two months. In April, its promoter Richard Branson and entities owned by him sold 5.58 million shares or a 2.5% stake in the company for about $150 million. They still hold a 24% stake in the company.

The airline, an affiliate of AirAsia Group Bhd, on Thursday reported a net loss of 5.67 billion ringgit ($1.37 billion) in January-March, more than 10 times the loss of 549.7 million ringgit seen in the same period last year.
The loss was primarily attributable to the impairment of assets, it said in a statement.
Revenue for the quarter fell 95.8% to 38.5 million ringgit.
AirAsia said it has assessed the recoverability of its assets in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its restructuring process, and impaired those assets by 5.28 billion ringgit.
The airline has been looking to reconstitute 64.15 billion in debt, and said the asset impairment does not impact the restructuring.
""Appropriate accounting entries will be made on a successful restructuring that will reflect more appropriately the assets and liabilities based on the final agreed restructuring terms,"" it said.
It also said it remains committed to resuming commercial operations as soon as possible on the successful completion of the restructuring plan and the opening of international borders.

The airline has changed its financial year end from Dec. 31 to June 30, expecting the outcome of the restructuring to be known then. It said the basis of preparation for its audited financial statements will clear and be of more value to shareholders at that point.

LONDON (Reuters) -EasyJet said it was poised to ramp up summer flight schedules with an easing of COVID-19 restrictions, but the low-cost airline warned that late announcement of travel rules reduced visibility as it reported a wider half-year loss.
EasyJet expects to operate about 15% of pre-crisis capacity in the current April-June quarter, it said on Thursday, before returning furloughed crews for a much-anticipated summer surge.
""We have the ability to flex up quickly to operate 90% of our current fleet over the peak summer period to match demand,"" Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in the airline's results statement.
As the peak season approaches, travel firms are pushing governments to drop quarantines and other curbs for vaccinated passengers and lower-risk destinations.
Britain's ""green list"" of unrestricted countries is up for review in coming weeks, but the government has warned that the highly contagious coronavirus variant first detected in India may yet slow the pace of reopening. 
EasyJet's pretax loss widened to 701 million pounds ($990 million) in the six months ending March 31, from 193 million in the year-earlier period affected only partially by the pandemic. Revenue fell 90% to 240 million pounds on a similarly sharp decline in passenger numbers to 4.1 million.
Underlining the summer doubts, the airline gave no firm capacity plan for its July-September fourth quarter.
""Given the continued level of short-term uncertainty it would not be appropriate to provide any further financial guidance,"" it said. The carrier said its cost-cutting programme was on track to save 500 million pounds this year.
EasyJet's shares, which have risen 18% since the start of 2021, were down 1.5% at 1118 GMT.
Conditions are nonetheless ripe for a summer rebound. European Union states agreed on Wednesday to ease restrictions on vaccinated visitors, boosting recovery hopes.
Pending deployment of the EU's digital health pass, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said, the announcement was ""an important step to opening up EU air travel and should support easyJet (LON:EZJ)'s and other EU airlines' share prices.""
EasyJet said it had added more than 105,000 seats - many to Portugal - within 24 hours of publication of the UK green list, which triggered a bookings spike.

Ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia announced their merge earlier this week into a tech company GoTo in Indonesia's largest-ever deal.
The combined entity, which will span online shopping, courier services, ride-hailing, food delivery and other services in Southeast Asia's largest economy, will be the biggest privately held technology firm in the region. 
Gojek and Tokopedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The KPPU said neither company has given the agency notice about the merger, but they are allowed to notify authorities 30 days after the transaction. 
The agency will then review the transaction ""to focus on various relevant markets in the GoTo Group ecosystem, as well as the potential for monopolistic practices or unfair business competition that can arise after the transaction,"" it said, noting that a transaction in the digital market usually requires a complex network effect analysis.

The KPPU also urged other business owners and members of the public to report any violation of regulations on business competition after the formation of the GoTo group.
If the KPPU assessment found that the merger could result in unhealthy business competition, the company will be told to make adjustments to their operation to maintain fair competition, but it does not rule out mergers.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 07:37AM ET</span>",Every second counts as startups race to deliver fresh food,"By Kate Holton, James Davey and Douglas Busvine
LONDON (Reuters) - In a railway arch in south London, pickers and packers are in a race against time: to get fresh food to the door of Alastair Dean within 15 minutes of his order hitting an app. 
Their company Weezy is part of a new army of European rapid delivery firms that, backed by billions of dollars of venture capital from Europe, the United States, China and Japan, are using electric bikes and scooters to deliver groceries.
They have placed a bet that demand for convenience will drive the next transformation in food retail and help crack the vice-like grip of the big supermarket stores which, in Britain, supply 95% of the country's groceries. 
The boss of one of Europe's biggest supermarkets, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that far from dismissing the new services as hype, they could pose ""death by a thousand nibbles"" to the dominant chains such as Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, Aldi and Lidl. 
Weezy enables shopper Dean, a 32-year-old finance worker, to select locally produced goods for delivery to his door for a fee of 2.95 pounds ($4.18). When ordering shaving foam he will throw in salad leaves for dinner. 
""Time is precious in the 21st century,"" he said on his doorstep in the affluent London district of Pimlico. ""The world of going and doing your weekly shop, like I remember growing up – it's all completely changed. We're always last minute.""
The combination of cash, tech and the surge in online delivery in a pandemic has shaken the kaleidoscope for the grocery industry, creating new players, challenging others and providing a new frontier for traditional supermarkets. 
The trend has taken root across European cities, where e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has yet to properly gatecrash the grocery market. 
In central London, residents have been bombarded with offers from at least four new rapid services. 
The likes of Weezy, Getir, Dija and Gorillas store goods from major suppliers and local producers in urban mini-fulfilment centres to supply customers at prices similar to supermarket convenience shops.
Holding up to 2,000 items instead of the more than 20,000 in supermarkets, mini centres built for delivery rather than customers can be picked quickly and located in cheaper areas. 
Weezy co-founder Alec Dent said orders had jumped since Britain started to unlock from COVID restrictions and people's lives became more complicated. Once they know they can rely on 15-minute delivery, he said, anything longer seems too slow. 
Many start by ordering snacks and alcohol before adding sourdough bread, vegetables, meats, herbs, fresh pasta, condoms, games and COVID tests, to be delivered in brown paper bags. 
""The industry is huge. It's a 200 billion pound market, and it's rapidly moving online and rapidly moving in the direction of convenience,"" Dent said of the British grocery sector.
AGGRESSIVE MOVES
Turkey's Getir has launched aggressively in London, with its purple and yellow scooters seen on roads and billboards, after it raised $300 million in March, valuing it at $2.6 billion. 
Berlin-based Gorillas has a valuation of more than $1 billion after it raised $290 million, including from China's Tencent. ""I strongly believe our business model is going to be the new normal,"" Chief Executive Kagan Sumer told Reuters.
U.S. operator Gopuff, valued at nearly $9 billion, has bought Fancy to expand in Britain and Europe, while Dija has been backed by Creandum, which invested in payments firm Klarna and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). 
Food-delivery riders from Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats will also bring groceries from established supermarkets.  
The different services are testing minimum order fees and delivery charges, or no restrictions at all, to see what works.
While the model has high costs and low margins, its riders are classed as workers, giving them basic rights and making the groups less vulnerable to future regulation. In full control of the supply chain, they can also deliver at speed.
The challenge remains stark however, as seen in the finances of German-based, 26-billion-euro Delivery Hero. 
Present in over 50 countries, the group has a long-term core-earnings margin target of 5 to 8%. However its rapid commerce division traded at a margin of minus 33% in 2020, its first year of operation.
Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg said all the emerging services were trying to find new ways to make the already razor-thin margin business of food retail work.
""It's no secret that this is very tough economically, but we have found a way to make it work,"" Ostberg told Reuters ahead of the launch of its fast commerce service in Germany.
Quick delivery operators say that low rents, ordering direct from suppliers and the option for brands to pay to promote goods on an app all help. 
FACING THE FUTURE
With so much activity, the supermarkets are watching and know they must respond in time. 
Online delivery has always posed a challenge, as supermarkets make more profit when customers browse instore. But the pandemic turbocharged the trend, and improved the economics of delivery. A record 16% of UK grocery sales were made online in January.
Now they risk losing out to ultra fast delivery, or confronting the cost of reconfiguring operations - most online orders are still picked by staff instore alongside traditional shoppers, an option that does not work when time is key.
""Shareholders would say 'if I want to invest in immediate delivery, I'll just invest direct',"" said one senior executive at a major British supermarket of the challenge ahead.
    Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket, is hedging its bets. While it is trialling its own one-hour delivery with a 5 pound delivery fee, it is also building a handful of automated urban fulfilment centres at the back of stores just for online orders.
Ocado (LON:OCDO), an online pioneer which runs out-of-town warehouses and trucks to stock the shelves of middle-class Britain, has partnered with a courier firm to test faster orders in London. 
Co-founder Tim Steiner questioned however just how many people would need instant delivery. ""I'm not saying it's a fad, but I think that some people's expectations of the size of the market are massively out of whack,"" he said. 
Still, the rapid delivery groups say the initial reaction has been strong, and there is a road to profitability after consolidation. Shopper Dean is sold. 

""We have a small kitchen with a small fridge,"" he said. ""The convenience thing is huge. Now we can finish work and fifteen minutes later we're cooking our evening meal.""

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said on Thursday it was recommending to the European Commission to permanently lower the threshold for reporting short positions to 0.1% from 0.2% of a company's issued share capital.
Short positions are a bet that the price of a company's stock will fall.
The threshold was temporarily lowered for the first time to 0.1% in March 2020 when markets suffered bouts of extreme volatility as economies entered lockdowns to fight COVID-19.
ESMA had said in March this year it had decided to allow the temporary lowering of the threshold to expire on March 19, saying markets no longer resembled the emergency situation of a year ago.
But on Thursday the watchdog said an analysis showed that a ""substantial amount of additional and essential information"" became available for market regulators when disclosure was set at 0.1%.

This additional transparency translates into an improved ability for regulators to conduct market oversight, ESMA said. ""ESMA therefore considers it essential to lower the reporting threshold to 0.1% on a permanent basis.""
Following Brexit in December last year, Britain announced in January it would cut the 0.2% threshold inherited from the bloc to 0.1%.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, on course for the fourth straight day of losses amid worries about future Federal Reserve policy as well as volatility in the cryptocurrency prices.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 120 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 27 points, or 0.2%.
Wall Street closed lower Wednesday, for the third day in a row, after a volatile session, with the broad-based S&P 500 falling 0.3%, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ending only marginally lower. 
Investors have been digesting the minutes from the April Federal Reserve meeting which suggested that some FOMC members were considering voting for tapering the central bank’s asset purchase programs in upcoming meetings.
Worries that the Fed may begin to rein in its ultra-easy monetary policies fairly promptly because of resurgent inflation have weighed on the stock market of late. The Nasdaq Composite, which is dominated by high-growth tech stocks, is down almost 5% in May so far. It’s also on course for its fifth consecutive down week, a run that hasn’t been seen since October/November of 2012.
Also causing anxiety has been the dramatic volatility in the cryptocurrencies, following a regulatory crackdown in China and as well as the talk of Fed tightening. Bitcoin, the largest of these digital currencies, fell as much as 30% on Wednesday to $30,000 before rebounding to currently trade just short of $40,000.
In corporate news, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is down sharply premarket after the tech company issued weaker-than-expected earnings guidance for the current quarter, and warned that supply chain issues will linger through the end of 2021.
The retail sector will remain in focus Thursday after L Brands (NYSE:LB), the parent of Victoria’s Secret, reported first-quarter earnings and sales that topped estimates, continuing the sector’s trend of strong numbers as shoppers returned to stores and spent their stimulus money. The likes of Kohls (NYSE:KSS) and BJs Wholesale Club Holdings (NYSE:BJ) are set to release earnings before the open.
Investors will also keep an eye on the weekly jobless claims to gauge the pace of labor-market recovery. New claims for unemployment benefits are expected to total 450,000, a new post-pandemic low, a drop from last week’s 473,000.
Oil prices weakened Thursday as traders digested the prospect of more supply entering the market. This follows Iranian President Hasan Rouhani claiming that a framework agreement had been reached on restoring the 2015 UN-backed deal limiting its nuclear programs, which would allow his country to restart exporting crude.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $62.37 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.7% to $65.50.

Tsargrad TV, which is owned by Konstantin Malofeev, says YouTube blocked its account in July 2020 without providing a reason. Google said at the time that it has a policy of suspending accounts found to violate sanctions or trade restriction rules.
In April, the Moscow Arbitration Court said Google must restore Tsargrad's account or face a daily 100,000 rouble ($1,358.29) fine, which would double each week that Google failed to comply.
Malofeev was placed under U.S. and EU sanctions in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, which he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal.
The dispute with YouTube is one of a number of cases in which U.S. tech and social media giants have drawn the ire of the Russian state. President Vladimir Putin accused social media companies of ""monopolism"" in a speech this year to the World Economic Forum.
Russia has been punitively impeding the speed of Twitter since March and warned other tech platforms, including YouTube, over failing to delete content it deems illegal. 
""We've now filed an appeal against last month's Tsargrad ruling, because it sets aside the prior decisions of multiple Russian courts, and comes with a penalty that is out of all proportion to the matter at hand,"" Google Russia said in a statement. 
""We're also appealing because the decision creates a great deal of uncertainty for foreign investors - like Google - in Russia. We look forward to presenting our arguments in detail at the appeal hearing."" 
Malofeev's representatives said they categorically disagreed with Google's appeal and its interpretation of the ruling. 
""We believe that the earlier ruling is absolutely legal and we will prove this in the appeal hearing, which is likely to take place at the end of June,"" Malofeev's press secretary Valeriy Rukobratskiy told Reuters. 

Google Russia said the appeal had been filed on Wednesday.

LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) -Britain's competition regulator cleared a $44 billion merger between broadband company Virgin Media and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF)'s UK mobile network O2 on Thursday, after a months-long review.
Virgin owner Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) and Spain's Telefonica, who agreed a year ago to forge a broadband and mobile powerhouse to challenge market leader BT, hailed the decision as ""a watershed moment in the history of telecommunications in the UK"". 
""We are reassured that competition amongst mobile communications providers will remain strong and it is therefore unlikely that the merger would lead to higher prices or lower quality services,"" Martin Coleman of Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
The companies said the deal, which values O2 at 12.7 billion pounds and Virgin Media at 18.7 billion pounds to give the new group a combined value of 31.4 billion pounds ($44.4 billion) including debt, is expected to close by June 1.
""We are now cleared to bring real choice where it hasn't existed before, while investing in fibre and 5G that the UK needs to thrive,"" Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries and his Telefonica counterpart José Maria Alvarez-Pallete said in a joint statement following the CMA approval.
The 50:50 joint venture, which will be led by Virgin Media boss Lutz Schüler, will have 11 billion pounds of annual revenue, the two owners said.
""For Telefonica, that's a big deal done,"" one financial source told Reuters. ""They're buying Oi in Brazil and need to finalise that, but this would mean consolidating major presence in the UK, Germany, Brazil and Spain.""
The CMA had been concerned about the possible impact of the merger on the British mobile market given that both companies sold wholesale services to other operators.
However it gave the deal provisional approval last month after concluding that other players offering rival services, such as BT and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), would maintain competition.

Telefonica has been selling assets to cut debt, which stood at 35.8 billion euros in this year's first quarter, and also fund an upgrade to next-generation 5G networks while, like European rivals, it tackles competition and the COVID-19 crisis.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India has ordered tighter surveillance of a rare fungal disease hitting COVID-19 patients, officials said on Thursday, piling pressure on hospitals struggling with the world's highest number of daily infections of the novel coronavirus.
Mucormycosis, or ""black fungus"" usually infects people whose immune system has been compromised, causing blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood. 
Doctors believe that the use of steroids to treat severe COVID-19 could be causing the rash of cases because those drugs reduce immunity and push up sugar levels. 
Health Secretary Lav Agarwal said in a letter to state governments that mucormycosis had emerged as a new challenge for COVID-19 patients on steroid therapy and those with pre-existing diabetes.
""This fungal infection is leading to prolonged morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients,"" he said in the letter reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. 
He gave no numbers of the Mucormycosis cases nationwide but Maharashtra, one of the states worst hit in the second wave of coronavirus infections, has reported 1,500 cases of it.
Agarwal asked state governments to declare it as a ""notifiable disease"" under the Epidemics Act, meaning they have to identify and track every case. 
India on Thursday reported 276,110 new coronavirus infections over the previous 24 hours, slightly higher than a day earlier but well below the 400,000 high seen at the beginning of this month in a devastating second wave. 
The total caseload stands at 25.77 million, the world's second highest after the United States. Deaths rose by 3,874 overnight, taking the total tally 287,122.
But with hospitals and crematoria overflowing and the health system overwhelmed, it is widely accepted that the official figures grossly underestimate the real impact of the epidemic, with some experts saying infections and deaths could be five to 10 times higher.
The second wave has penetrated deep into the countryside and the additional burden of mucormycosis has hit a rural health system ill-equipped to cope.

SP Kalantari, a doctor based in Sevagram, a town in Maharashtra, said that a team including ear, nose, and throat surgeons, ophthalmologists and neurologists was needed to treat mucormycosis.
""Unfortunately, this kind of team does not exist in rural areas,"" Kalantari said.

(Reuters) -Royal Mail said customers splurging online during lockdowns helped profits more than double last year as revenue from parcel deliveries outpaced letters for the first time, but it withheld 2021 guidance as Britain's high streets reopen.
The British company witnessed its fortunes turn last year as the pandemic, which forced shut brick-and-mortar stores and caused a surge in online shopping, came as a boon to its home delivery service and struggling UK business.
""We're likely to have quite a strong first quarter this year but then the uncertainty beyond that becomes really difficult,"" finance chief Mick Jeavons told Reuters in a phone call on Thursday.
 Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) said its parcel volumes in the United Kingdom were down 2% last month compared with the surge it saw in April 2020 during the first lockdown.
While annual revenue topped analysts expectations, its profit slightly missed market estimates as it dealt with higher costs to cater for the surge in parcels.
Nevertheless, it met its own forecast set out earlier this year, sending shares to a 3-year high before they reversed course to trade 2% lower by 1007 GMT.
""Keeping a lid on costs going forward will be a challenge,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said in a note, citing the retreat in the share price.
The over-500 years old company has been undergoing major changes in the past few years as emails replaced letters and e-commerce boomed, leading it to reposition as a technology-led parcel company that also delivers letters.
Business is flourishing at peers including UPS, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), DHL, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) since the pandemic shifted purchases of everything from food to furniture online.
Despite an expected return to the high street as Britain reopens for business, Jeavons said he expects a ""substantial"" part of the growth in parcels to stick and that behaviours of online shoppers are likely to be more permanent than not. 
Royal Mail's UK business, which was bound to make losses before the pandemic hit, recorded 344 million pounds ($485 million) in annual profit as advertising mail also recovered.
To deal with the greater load of packages, it employed more postal workers and kept extra vans and parcel sorting centres to improve its service.

The company reported a 116% surge in adjusted operating profit to 702 million pounds ($990.59 million), and a 17% jump in revenue to 12.64 billion pounds.

The bank also said it would aim for more female leaders within its ranks, with women making up 35% of managing director, director and vice president roles by 2025. That's up from 29% now. 
The announcements come as Deutsche Bank managers brief investors, analysts and the media on sustainability issues later on Thursday. 
Leading global lenders have been showcasing their commitment to sustainable investing, as pressure builds on banks to support the globally agreed transition to a low-carbon and more environmentally friendly economy. 
The bank last year committed to at least 200 billion in sustainable investments and financing by 2025, but Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said on Thursday that the bank had made significantly more progress than anticipated, reaching 71 billion euros by the end of March.
The investments and financing includes loans provided by the bank, bonds placed on behalf of its clients and assets managed by its private bank. 
Banking has long lagged other industries in Germany in leadership positions held by women.

Deutsche said that it would aim for women to hold at least 30% of positions in the two levels below its management board by 2025, up from 24% now.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",Judge suggests warning label as part of $2 billion plan to limit Roundup claims,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge suggested on Wednesday that  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) include a warning label on Roundup as part of a proposed $2 billion settlement to resolve future claims that the top-selling weedkiller causes cancer.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) asked U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco to give preliminary approval for the settlement deal, which would create a framework to resolve future lawsuits over claims Roundup causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate, the main active ingredient, are safe for human use. A World Health Organization agency said in 2015 that glyphosate was ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
""For years I've been wondering why  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) wouldn't do that voluntarily to protect itself,"" said Chhabria, of a warning label. He said a label would prevent further lawsuits and free up money to create a better offer for people already exposed. 
He even suggested wording for a label and tweaked it as he got feedback from Bayer's lawyer.
William Hoffman, a lawyer for Bayer, said he doubted the suggested label would protect against future lawsuits.
The settlement would cover two types of Roundup users. Those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma but who have not retained a lawyer were described by the judge as ""class one"" and likely to include lots of migrant farm laborers.
Class two covers healthy people who have been exposed to Roundup and become sick in the future.
""A settlement of this type could potentially be reasonable for class one,"" said Chhabria, by informing class members of their rights and providing compensation of up to $200,000.
For class two, Chhabria spent hours debating his concerns about the plan, including the likelihood that currently healthy Roundup users would never read their class settlement notice or understand the settlement proposal.
""The question is whether this is too confusing and is speaking of a problem that is too distant,"" he said. 
The judge said it would ""be awhile"" before he rules on the request for preliminary approval, ""assuming you don't come back and say you're withdrawing it.""
If the settlement gets preliminary approval, Roundup users could opt out in the coming months and retain their full legal rights. Those who become part of the class would be eligible for free medical exams and up to $200,000 if they develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma during the agreement's four-year period.
""We appreciate the court's direction,"" Bayer said in a statement on Thursday. ""It is common for courts to request some adjustments to class settlement agreements like this and we are confident that, working with class counsel, we will be able to address the matters raised by the Court. We remain committed to settling the Roundup litigation.""
The agreement would pause all litigation for four years and prevent class members from seeking punitive damages if they refuse compensation and ultimately decide to sue. 
The stakes are high. Bayer has said that more than half of its herbicide revenue, which totaled nearly 5 billion euros ($6 billion) in 2020, was related to glyphosate.
Bayer has already spent years and committed $9.6 billion to resolve existing lawsuits, which are separate from the future case settlement discussed in court on Wednesday. The company inherited Roundup in its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2018.
Critics of the settlement say the proposal would unfairly limit consumers' legal rights.
Chhabria said the biggest risk facing Roundup users who opt out was a U.S. Supreme Court ruling adopting Bayer's view that a federal pesticide law barred lawsuits alleging the company failed to warn users about glyphosate.
Bayer has said the law has been misapplied in the three cases that went to trial, each of which resulted in tens of millions of dollars for plaintiffs.

One of those trials, a $25 million federal jury verdict against Bayer, was upheld by an appeals court on Friday.
Bayer said it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.

The ministry of health said it was aware of the statement circulating online on media outlets and social media platforms, which implied that a new, previously unknown variant of COVID-19 originated in Singapore and risked spreading to India from the city-state. 
The move came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a Twitter post this week that a new form of the virus that was particularly harmful to children had come to Singapore, and urged for a ban on flights.
Both the Singapore and Indian governments have criticised the opposition politician, saying his comments were not based on facts and were ""irresponsible"".
The correction orders were issued under Singapore's fake news law, or the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.
Facebook and Twitter confirmed receipt of the order and said they complied as per the local law.
A prompt on users' Facebook news feeds linked to a government website that said there was no new ""Singapore"" variant of COVID-19. Neither is there evidence of any COVID-19 variant that is ""extremely dangerous for kids"", the health ministry said. 
It said the B16172 strain found in many new COVID-19 cases in Singapore was first detected in India.

Twitter sent notifications to its account holders based in Singapore, which included a tweet from the government's official account @POFMA_Notice. 
Singapore Press Holdings' SPH Magazines, which was also issued the order, said it had complied and posted the notice in its HardWareZone forum.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses, helped by strong earnings and as a receding pandemic allows the region to reopen its economy 
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4%.
The major European indices fell sharply Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting suggested that the central bank officials were considering tapering its asset purchase programs in upcoming meetings.
However, the tone is more promising Thursday, with investors turning their attention to promising corporate news throughout the European region 
 Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) stock gained 2% after the French conglomerate raised the full-year guidance for its telecoms division and reported a smaller than expected first-quarter core loss.
Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) stock gained 1.5% on raising its medium-term core profit outlook, while Nordic Semiconductor (OL:NOD) soared 11% after being linked to Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM).
Staying with the M&A theme, Britain's competition regulator has cleared a $44 billion merger between broadband company Virgin Media and Telefonica's (NYSE:TEF) U.K. mobile network O2, after a review lasting months.
On the flip side,  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) stock fell 1.6% after it decided not to give a forecast for the current year, with its U.K. parcel volumes down 2% last month. EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 1.3% after the budget airline posted a first-half loss of 701 million pounds ($990 million). EasyJet also trimmed its flying capacity to 15% of pre-pandemic levels for the current quarter (from 20% previously) but said it hopes to run at 90% capacity in the key summer quarter.
Adding to the positive tone, authorities across Europe are loosening restrictions as infection rates fall and vaccinations rise. The U.K. largely reopened on Monday and reports suggest the government is increasingly confident it can lift remaining restrictions on June 21, as planned. Italy, the original epicenter of the crisis in Europe, will phase out its national curfew in the coming weeks, and tough curbs are gradually easing across Germany. 
Yet, while the Covid situation is improving throughout the region, ECB chief Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday it was ""essential that monetary and fiscal support are not withdrawn too soon”, suggesting that the region has a lot less immediate risk regarding central bank policy changes than across the pond.
The European data slate is pretty empty Thursday, but more clues on the pace of the U.S. labor market recovery will come from the weekly initial jobless claims release.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, rebounding to a degree after the sharp falls of the previous session when traders digested rising U.S. stockpiles, the prospects of more Iranian crude entering the market as well as worries of the Fed tapering back its ultra-easy monetary policies.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $63.61 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $66.81. Both contracts fell around 3% on Wednesday, to near three-week lows.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,874.10/oz, just below the four-month high reached the previous session, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2199.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - PetroChina International Singapore Pte Ltd sold a cargo of jet fuel into Myanmar in April, according to government import data reviewed by Reuters, the first such shipment since before the military seized power in a coup in February.
Industry sources say suppliers have been particularly wary of selling jet fuel because it could be used in planes to bomb ethnic armed groups that have been supporting anti-junta protesters, as well as in civilian airliners.
The shipment could raise new questions over China's role in Myanmar at a time when it has been accused by the junta's opponents of backing coup leader Min Aung Hlaing - an accusation rejected by Beijing.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PetroChina, a listed company controlled by state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, did not respond to requests for comment about the fuel shipment.
The import data, which hasn't been published, shows PetroChina International shipped 13,300 tonnes of jet fuel and 4,000 tonnes of gasoline onboard tanker MT Yu Dong for discharge at Myanmar's Thilawa terminal on April 15.
Western nations including the United States and Britain have condemned the junta for killing hundreds of civilians and have applied limited sanctions, but there are currently no international measures outlawing oil product shipments.
And while the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which Myanmar belongs, has called for an end to violence and dialogue among the parties, it stopped well short of calling for sanctions in an April statement.
China has not been so forceful in condemning the junta and has simply said it wants to see stability in its neighbour, drawing accusations from some of the junta's opponents that it is supporting the military authorities.
""Given Beijing's desire to boost its influence in Naypyidaw, it seems unlikely that any Chinese state firm would be too concerned by the threat of backlash from the international community over doing business with Myanmar's government,"" said Henrick Tsjeng, an associate research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.
Activist group Justice for Myanmar condemned the fuel sale.
""We're appalled that PetroChina is exporting jet fuel to Myanmar, doing business with the war criminals who are conducting indiscriminate air strikes against ethnic communities,"" said spokeswoman Yadanar Maung. 
Data from Singapore trade agency Enterprise Singapore confirmed a mid-April shipment of aviation turbine fuel into Myanmar. The fuel can be used by both commercial and military planes, possibly needing to be blended depending on the grade.
Reuters saw no evidence that the fuel was destined for military jets. The junta spokesman did not respond to calls requesting comment.
Military jets have carried out frequent bombing raids against ethnic armies opposed to the junta in northern and eastern Myanmar as fighting has surged since the Feb. 1 coup that toppled elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
One of the forces that has been bombed, the Kachin Independence Army, told Reuters it had attacked seven oil trucks it suspected of bringing aviation fuel in by road from China this week. It did not comment on the PetroChina shipment.
The Myanmar data showed PetroChina International sold the jet fuel to National Energy Puma Aviation Services Co Ltd (NEPAS), a joint venture between Puma Energy and Myanma Petroleum Enterprise (MPE). The gasoline went to three other local fuel importers.
Puma Energy told Reuters NEPAS arranged for delivery of a cargo at the Thilawa terminal on April 15, but declined to comment on the type of fuel being offloaded.
Puma Energy, a fuel storage and retail firm majority-owned by global commodities trader Trafigura, said it had suspended operations in Myanmar on Feb. 10 to ensure employee safety.
Since then, operations of the NEPAS joint venture are being carried out by majority shareholder MPE, Puma Energy's spokesman said.
MPE, owned by the Ministry of Electrical and Energy (MOEE) which is now under junta control, did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to the jet fuel, 79,500 tonnes of gasoline and 110,700 tonnes of diesel were shipped to Myanmar last month from Asia's oil trading hub, Enterprise Singapore's data showed.

Myanmar last imported about 13,800 tonnes of jet fuel in February, according to government data. Monthly imports in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, were about 14,500 tonnes.
PetroChina International Singapore is the Singapore-based trading unit of PetroChina Co Ltd.

1697,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2021 03:09AM ET</span>",ByteDance Founder Steps Down as CEO Ahead of Mega IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. founder Zhang Yiming will cede the reins of TikTok’s owner to an old college roommate and lieutenant, stepping back from running the world’s most valuable startup ahead of its highly anticipated market debut.
Zhang will hand off the chief executive officer role at TikTok’s owner to human resources chief Rubo Liang, he announced in an internal memo posted online Thursday. The billionaire entrepreneur remains chairman but plans to relinquish most of his day-to-day duties because they were an increasing burden on his time, a person familiar with the matter said.
Zhang, who will instead focus on longer-term strategy, is retreating from the spotlight just as Beijing intensifies efforts to curb the influence of internet firms and their billionaire founders, from Jack Ma’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. That antitrust campaign coincides with a series of moves from ByteDance that could shake up the country’s internet landscape.
Liang takes the helm just as ByteDance prepares for a highly anticipated initial public offering in the U.S. or Hong Kong. It’s also orchestrating its next big act -- a move into e-commerce that could pit it against Alibaba and Meituan in a $1.7 trillion Chinese arena.
“I feel I did not achieve as much as I had hoped to on my previous objectives in the areas of new strategic opportunities, organizational management, and social responsibility,” Zhang said in his memo. “After several months of thinking about this, I came to the conclusion that transitioning out of the role of CEO, with all of the related day-to-day responsibilities, would enable me to have greater impact on longer-term initiatives.”
Read more: TikTok Took on President Trump Over App Ban and Won Big
Zhang’s handoff recalls a similar move by  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. founder Colin Huang, who relinquished the helm of his own firm to a deputy two months ago. The pressures of running fast-evolving, hyper-competitive businesses while dealing with mounting regulatory requirements may have exacted a toll on Zhang, who had begun delegating responsibility.
In 2020, he appointed two executives to run the Chinese side of ByteDance’s sprawling business. This month, he elevated recent hire and former Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. finance chief Shouzi Chew to CEO of its U.S. business. Zhang said in the memo he began discussing with a small group the possibility of having Liang as the new CEO this March. The two will work side-by-side over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition.
“The regulatory environment for technology companies in China has become ever-changing and that requires a lot of energy and effort,” said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “Wearing two hats at a company as sizeable as ByteDance is just too stressful.”

Zhang founded ByteDance in 2012 before using highly refined AI recommendation engines to create hit news service Toutiao and viral global video app TikTok. His first big success was Toutiao, which means “headlines” in Chinese. TikTok became a global phenomenon, while its cousin Douyin leads in China’s domestic market. The founder now ranks among the world’s richest people after ByteDance shares traded in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion, people familiar with the dealings have said.
Liang, an entrepreneur like Zhang, will shepherd ByteDance’s move into new arenas from e-commerce to education devices. The low-profile executive and Zhang studied microelectronics at Tianjin’s Nankai University and shared a computer for coding, Zhang said in a public speech in 2016. The pair co-founded 99fang.com - a search service for real estate -- in 2009 before teaming up to create ByteDance three years later.

The internet titan is now seeking to increase ad revenue for its China-based businesses including Douyin and Toutiao to 260 billion yuan ($40 billion) this year from 183 billion yuan in 2020, Bloomberg News has reported. The target excludes short-video sensation TikTok. It’s also aiming for e-commerce gross merchandise value of as much as 600 billion yuan, up from 170 billion yuan last year. Douyin is targeting 680 million daily active users, compared with around 610-620 million in March.
The aggressive targets underscore ByteDance’s intention to take on China’s largest internet companies from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. on their turf.
ByteDance -- whose overall revenue more than doubled to $35 billion last year -- has kicked off preparations for an IPO of some of its main businesses, including Douyin, and is choosing between Hong Kong and U.S. as the listing venue, people familiar with the matter have said. It could raise at least several billion dollars from a listing of the Chinese assets, although deliberations are at an early stage.
If ByteDance hits its sales goal, its Chinese arm will have done in nine years what it took Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) 13 to achieve, and that excludes TikTok and other businesses abroad. At $40 billion, the nascent ad business would be roughly twice that of YouTube’s. Reuters first reported Zhang’s decision.
“ByteDance is mature enough for him to step back,” said Ke Yan, a Singapore-based analyst with DZT Research. “He can now selectively do what he thinks is important, as opposed to being a CEO who needs to handle nitty-gritty things.”
