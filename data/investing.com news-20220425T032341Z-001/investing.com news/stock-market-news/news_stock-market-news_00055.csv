The world's biggest listed mining company reported higher profits on Tuesday and said its business could weather market volatility linked to trade tensions between the United States and China.
However, Arnoud Balhuizen, head of marketing and supply, who oversees procurement as well as sales, said protectionism was likely to add to inflationary pressures.
""All economically rational people know that protectionism will not be good for the U.S. population. It will increase prices in the U.S. and we are seeing that in the onshore U.S. (oil and gas) for example,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""Steel pipes in the U.S. are the most expensive worldwide.""
In its economic and commodity outlook, BHP said the impact of higher steel tariffs in the United States was uncertain, but it was clear end–users in the United States were paying more for their steel than those in other regions. 

Hot–rolled coil steel, used in construction has reached $1,000 per tonne in the United States compared with prices ""in the mid $600s and the mid $500s"" in northern Europe and China respectively, it said in its outlook.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",FDA extends EpiPen expiry date to combat shortage,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday extended the expiration date of specific lots of Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV's EpiPen allergy injectors by four months to mitigate the shortage of the life-saving treatment.
The decision https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/FDAInBrief/ucm617724.htm?utm_campaign=08212018_FiB_FDA%20extends%20expiry%20date%20for%20specific%20EpiPen%20lots%20to%20mitigate%20shortages&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua comes at a time when the shortage has come under focus at the start of back-to-school season, and applies to specific lots of 0.3 milligram EpiPen products, after the regulator reviewed data provided by Mylan.
Earlier this month, Mylan issued a warning that the devices may not always be available. The shortage has largely been due to ongoing manufacturing issues at a  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) plant which supplies EpiPens.
EpiPen autoinjectors allow the patient or a caretaker to administer a dose of epinephrine in case of a severe allergic reaction, such as to bee stings or exposure to peanuts. 

Last week, the FDA approved Teva Pharmaceuticals' generic version of Mylan's drug.

This year’s meeting is focused on shifting market structure and how tech giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). -- productive behemoths that have small wage bills relative to their sales -- are coming to define American and global industry.
To get you ready for the shindig, which kicks off at 8 p.m. Thursday, this week’s research roundup summarizes some of the top work on market concentration, changing firm dynamics, profit margins and the fall in labor share in our Amazonian economic future.

Pumped-up Profits
Profit Margins: Rising Wages Vs. Superstar FirmsPublished Aug. 18Available to Goldman Sachs subscribers
Profit margins at S&P 500 companies are at an all-time high at 11.2 percent, but  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts find that total corporate profits have been softer recently as a share of gross national product, as reported in the national income and product accounts (NIPA). That’s heralded a downturn in S&P 500 margins in the past, but this time may be different.
Softening national accounts margins may have offered a good signal in cycles past because the data more heavily weighed small companies, and smaller employers are especially sensitive to interest rate changes and wage growth.
But the fact that highly productive “superstar firms” with bargaining power over workers and consumers make up a bigger share of the S&P 500 these days means NIPA profits may be a more muted predictor. First, as they make up a bigger share of the S&P basket, there’ll be a boost through simple composition. Second, their high sales-to-compensation ratio and wage-setting power could limit how much the tight labor market drags on margins.
In the end, the economists expect profits to climb a little higher before trending sideways starting next year. “Further significant gains likely require both continued moderate wage growth along with rapid productivity growth, for instance driven by the continued outperformance of superstar firms,” Daan Struyven writes for his team.
Birth of a Superstar
The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar FirmsPublished May 2017Available on MIT website
The Goldman note builds on the work of many economists, including MIT’s David Autor, who wrote in a 2017 paper that globalization and new technology were driving the emergence of superstar firms. “Industries are increasingly characterized by a ‘winner-take-most’ feature where a small number of firms gain a very large share of the market,” he wrote.
The paper also pins the well documented decline in the proportion of income going to workers on superstar firms. Labor share, Autor argues, is not falling at the average company. Rather, those companies with higher profit levels and lower fixed labor costs -- and thus lower labor share -- are capturing more and more of total output. In other words, it’s a case of reallocation and not general decline. But it’s expected to get worse.
“As the importance of superstar firms increases, the aggregate labor share will tend to fall,” he wrote.
Profits Up, Competition Down
The Rise of Market Power and the Macroeconomic ImplicationsPublished August 2017Available at author’s website
One thing that’s not suffering in the U.S. is profitability. Jan De Loeker of Princeton University and Jan Eeckhout at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona show why that’s not necessarily a good thing, as it reflects a rise in “market power.”
From 1950 to 1980, average markups in the U.S. remained steady at an estimated 18 percent above cost. Since then, they’ve risen to about 67 percent, suggesting firms have much more power. That, they say, helps explain some huge secular trends in recent decades, including declining labor share, falling real wages for low-skilled labor and lower labor participation rates.
The change also augers poorly for investment and productivity, as successful companies insulated from true competition will feel less compelled to invest in the innovation that would otherwise be required to stay on top.
“With a long enough horizon, also capital investment adjusts to reflect the same first order condition as labor, and hence there will be a reduction in capital investment as markups increase,” the authors wrote.
The Amazon Paradox
Amazon’s Antitrust ParadoxPublished January 2017Available at the Yale Law Journal
It’s not only common sense that assumes that outsized market power goes hand in hand with high prices. U.S. antitrust enforcement law has narrowed over the years to focus on cases where companies exploit their position to harm consumers.
But what if a company forsook higher profits to build ever more market share, crushing would-be competitors along the way? And what if it used market power in one sector to grab share in others? Say hello to Amazon, argues Lina Khan of the Open Market Institute in Washington.The online retailing behemoth has a dizzying record of revenue growth, but a spotty history of making a profit. We shouldn’t be seduced by the latter to assume Amazon isn’t causing harm, Khan argues in a paper published in the Yale Law Review.
Khan painstakingly (there are 464 footnotes and citations) built a case that Amazon employs practices that should provoke a rethink of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. “Current law under-appreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive,” she wrote.
To help drive home her point, Khan points to Amazon’s market valuation, which is linked more closely to its revenue growth than profit. In other words, investors are convinced that, given time, Amazon will exploit its market share with higher prices and higher profits.
It also may be worth reading a relatively recent paper on productivity growth and income inequality by Jason Furman and Peter Orszag.

18,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Toll Brothers Surges the Most Since 2011 on Gain in Home Orders,"(Bloomberg) -- Toll Brothers Inc. surged after the biggest U.S. luxury-home builder reported rising orders, revenue and backlog -- setting the stage for further earnings growth -- as the supply of properties on the market remains tight and the labor market stays strong.
The company reported a 27 percent increase in revenue in the fiscal third quarter, to $1.91 billion, and an 18 percent gain in signed contracts per Toll housing community. The value of its backlog at the end of last month was $6.48 billion, a 22 percent increase.
Toll’s shares rose as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday jump since October 2011. They were trading at $38.99 at 9:38 a.m. in New York, up 12 percent. It was the biggest gain in an S&P index of homebuilders, which climbed 3.6 percent.
The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based homebuilder is among companies benefiting from a U.S. unemployment rate of 3.9 percent and an aging millennial population moving from renting to owning. Wealthy Americans are feeling confident, and that’s a big boost to Toll, according to Alex Barron, an analyst with the Housing Research Center in El Paso, Texas.
“Do you see any signs that the economy is slowing?” Barron said in an interview. “So why would wealthy people be scared to buy?”
U.S. homebuyers are at risk of rising borrowing costs, with the average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 4.53 percent, up more than a percentage point from a year ago, giving them impetus to purchase before they go higher. Wealthy buyers are less sensitive to rate increases, according to Drew Reading, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
“What you’re seeing in the stock is a relief rally because it’s been hammered so much in the last year or so,” Reading said in an interview. “Investors are relieved that it’s not a broad-based slowing of demand at the high end.”
Industry’s Health
The company reported net income of $193.3 million, or $1.26 a share, in the third quarter, up from $148.6 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier. That beat the $1.03 average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Our double-digit growth in revenues, contracts and backlog and our strong earnings reflect the health of the new-home industry in general and our unique position in the luxury market,” Toll Chief Executive Officer Doug Yearley said in a statement. The company’s community count rose to 301 at the end of the third quarter, and is on track to reach 315 by end of the fiscal year, he said.
The cost to protect Toll Brothers’ debt against default fell as much as 15.3 basis points after the company reported earnings to as low as 147.7 basis points, the biggest drop in more than two years, according to data provider CMA.
Toll also narrowed its revenue forecast for the full fiscal year to $6.76 billion to $7.22 billion. That would be the highest annual total in the company’s history, Chief Financial Officer Marty Connor said in the statement. In May, the builder projected full-year revenue of $6.64 billion to $7.31 billion.
Nationwide, the number of residential properties sold in which construction hadn’t yet started rose to a four-month high, a sign builders will stay busy in coming months, according to the latest government data.

19,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>","Slack just raised a whopping $427 million to become a $7.1 billion company. Now, it has to defeat Microsoft","Slack, the work chat app that's become a poster child for Silicon Valley startup success, is on something of a hot streak. 
First,  Slack bought the intellectual property to Atlassian's HipChat, which had been one of its chief rivals. Then, no less than  Microsoft recognized Slack as a major rival to the Microsoft Office suite in an official regulatory filing.
Now, Slack can add one more to its win column, as it takes in a whopping $427 million in an investment round led by Dragoneer Investment Group and General Atlantic, with participation from T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and others, including its existing roster of investors. 
This investment, in turn, leads to two other figures of interest: Slack is now valued at ""more than $7.1 billion,"" according to a press release. And now, all told, Slack has raised just about $1.27 billion of venture capital. That includes the $250 million mega-round it took in last September at a $5 billion valuation, in a deal led by Softbank. 
Slack is also using the opportunity to tout its growth. It has 8 million daily active users (DAUs), and 70,000 paid teams, up from the 6 million DAUs and 50,000 paid teams it  announced in September. Also in September, Slack said it was at $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), though it doesn't have an updated figure to share today.
All of that said, this funding round raises some questions for the future of Slack. 
This $7.1 billion valuation makes it that much more unlikely that Slack will get bought up by a big tech company. If Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), for example, were to revisit its reported interest in buying Slack, it would likely have to pay a big premium over that valuation to seal the deal. Even for a gigantic tech company like Amazon, that would be a hefty price tag. 
At the same time, Slack has  so far played coy about a possible IPO, declining to announce any plans one way or the other. With so much money going into the startup, though, some kind of exit seems like it will have to come sooner rather than later.
And all the while, Slack is facing down the continued threat of Microsoft, whose Microsoft Teams product comes bundled with the mega-popular Office 365 productivity suite for businesses. While Slack has its fair share of super-fans and champions, Microsoft wields significant might in this market, and the startup has its work cut out for it. 
Microsoft hasn't taken this lying down, either, and has made moves to make Teams more competitive with Skype — most recently, launching a  free version of Microsoft Teams to hook in smaller groups, and hopefully lure them to the paid version.
So while the ability to raise so much cash, so quickly, is a definite feather in the company's cap, it now falls on Slack to show the world that it can take on its much larger competitor...and win.

LONDON (Reuters) - Critical comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about the country's central bank saw the dollar fall for the fourth straight day in its worst spell since March, boosting emerging market stocks and currencies in the process.
In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump said late on Monday he was ""not thrilled"" with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates, and said the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy.
American presidents have rarely criticized the Fed in recent decades because its independence has been seen as important for economic stability. 
""The Fed is independent in setting monetary policy and markets were spooked by yet another comment from Donald Trump criticizing higher interest rates,"" said Artjom Hatsaturjants, an analyst at Accendo Markets. 
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.39 percent on Tuesday. 
It has now fallen 1.2 percent in the last four days, its worst such run since late March. 
EMERGING RELIEF
The dollar's weakness took pressure off many emerging markets, which have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey precipitated a sell-off across the globe. 
MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index (MSCIEF) rose 1 percent and was set for a third day of gains after Trump's comments.
Chinese mainland shares (CSI300) jumped 1.8 percent, South Korea (KS11) 1 percent and Indonesia (JKSE) 0.9 percent. In Europe, Turkish stocks (XU100) rose 1.6 percent and Polish shares 0.8 (WIG20) percent. 
The Chinese yuan rose by 0.17 percent to 6.8427 per dollar. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week.
The yuan had weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns over the country's economic growth, a Sino-U.S. trade war and a broad rally by the dollar. 
In his Reuters interview, Trump also accused China of manipulating its currency and said there was little hope of progress in the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries in talks due this week.
Other emerging-market currencies, including the South African rand , Thai baht , Mexican peso , Hungarian forint  and Polish zloty  were all higher by 0.2 to 0.9 percent against the dollar. 
Commodities that are priced in dollars and so benefit from any weakness were also higher across the board.
Base metals prices rose, with London copper  climbing for a second day and crossing the $6,000-a-tonne mark. Spot gold  rose 0.28 percent to $1,193.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) rose 0.33 percent to $72.45 per barrel. 
In developed market equities, defensive sectors were in favor, with areas considered less dependent on the economic cycle like healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P) and consumer staples among the leading gainers in Europe.
Futures in the United States pointed to the blue-chip S&P 500 index (ESc1) opening 0.2 percent higher.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Norway wealth fund allowed to stay on as investor if Tesla goes private,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Rules governing Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund would allow it to stay on as an investor in Tesla (O:TSLA) if the electric carmaker goes private, its deputy CEO said on Tuesday.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk stunned financial markets this month when he revealed on Twitter he was considering a $420 per share take-private deal for the money-losing carmaker. 
Norway is Tesla's third-biggest market and the country's wealth fund, the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, had a 0.48 percent stake in Tesla worth about $253 million as of the start of 2018, according to the latest data from the fund. 
Tesla shares have been hit by investor concerns about Musk's plan, and doubts about whether the company has secured the funding to go private, and the SEC has opened an inquiry related to Musk's tweets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Trond Grande, deputy CEO of the Norwegian fund, declined to say whether Tesla had approached the fund about going private.
However, he said that although the fund's main practice is to sell its stake when a company leaves an exchange, or soon after, rules regulating the fund set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry and parliament do allow it to stay on in a listed company that goes private.
""The priority is to try to preserve the value for the fund. That is the priority,"" Grande told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation. ""If that means that the fund will be invested in a company that has been delisted for a period of time, that could happen.""
""But as a main rule, we will exit the investments as and when, or soon after, it has been taken off an exchange,"" he said. 
CRITICAL OF TESLA
This year the fund has been critical of Tesla's approach on several issues. 
In March it voted against Musk's potential $2.6 billion payout. Then in June it backed an initiative to wrest the role of chairman away from CEO Musk, and another that would have allowed investors to nominate their own directors. 
Grande declined to speak specifically about the situation at Tesla. Generally speaking, he said the fund sees the importance of separating the roles of CEO and chairman and to allow independent directors on boards. 
""We acknowledge some companies do not operate ... in that sense, but we will not change our stance with regards to that,"" he said. 
The fund owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares. It invests in stocks, bonds and real estate worldwide. 
In the second quarter, the fund made a return of 1.8 percent, it said on Tuesday, helped by a rise in global equity markets, although it still underperformed the index it is benchmarked against.
""North American and European stocks had a positive development in the quarter despite the prospect of increased trade barriers,"" Grande told a news conference. 

The fund returned 0.2 percentage points less than a benchmark index set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry.

Worries over a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing have been a drag on markets, accompanied by escalating rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs. 
Investors hope the talks on Wednesday will ease some of the tensions but U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview that he does not expect much progress.

Sectors considered less dependent on the economic cycle led gains, however. Healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P) and consumer staples were in positive territory, suggesting that investors were cautious.

The probe was at a ""crucial stage"" and was being carried out by a division in Mumbai city, the paper quoted a senior government official as saying.
Siphoning of funds, according to Indian regulations, relates to a company using bank loans for purposes unrelated to its operations.
Jet, India's leading full-service carrier, said https://www.nseindia.com/corporate/listcontract1_21082018090532_jetAirways_017.pdf on Tuesday it had not received any communication from the ministry of corporate affairs. The ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The news comes days after the airline deferred its June-quarter financial results by a few weeks after its audit committee declined to sign off on them ""pending closure of certain matters"".
Jet also told staff earlier this month it was running out of money, a source had told Reuters, but it has denied this and said it is confident of cutting costs and keeping its planes flying.

Reuters reported on Monday that private equity firm TPG Capital was considering investing in Jet, which is part owned by Etihad Airways, but is not close to finalizing a deal.

(Reuters) - Huawei Technology Co's coming U.S. launch of a solar-panel control device is expected to collide with new Trump administration tariffs on Chinese electronics, undermining a product that analysts had seen as challenging rivals on pricing.
The Chinese company, best known for its smart phones and telecommunications equipment, has developed a new generation of low-cost solar inverters, which convert, manage and monitor energy produced by solar panels for home use.
Huawei has said it was aiming to roll out the product, called FusionHome, in the United States before the end of the summer, a year after its original target. Analysts and distributors had expected it to knock $100-$200 off current market prices of similar devices costing between $1,000 and $1,500 per household.
But a coming 25 percent tariff on Chinese electronics that would overturn much of Huawei's expected price advantage may have stalled talks with U.S. installers and distributors, said analysts and research firms.
Huawei will either have to reduce its margins or raise prices, they said, potentially benefiting rival producers including SolarEdge and Enphase Energy, which are ramping up manufacturing outside China.
Huawei declined to comment on tariffs and did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters on the current status of FusionHome.
Company spokesman Joe Kelly said in July that the company was planning to introduce the new product to its partners in the United States this summer and that the timing of the roll-out would depend on those distributors.
The 25 percent tariff, if implemented, will take effect Aug. 23, and analysts covering the sector say it will affect the new Huawei product.
""It certainly would eat into profits and is just a question on how aggressive Huawei wants to be,"" said Cowen & Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne.
Huawei's foray into the high-margin residential market comes after panel installations fell in 2017 for the first time in seven years. GTM Research recently cut its forecast for 2018 residential solar market installations by 8 percent to 2.2 gigawatts.
Of four major solar panel makers Reuters talked to, only Utah-based Vivint Solar confirmed it was considering adding Huawei's inverter to its lineup. 
SunPower Corp and Tesla's SolarCity did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. A SunRun spokeswoman said the company welcomed new innovations that made solar energy cheaper and more accessible.

""A 25 percent tariff could eat up the margins of cost-competitive Chinese manufacturers and potentially change the player landscape of the U.S. solar inverter market,"" said another analyst, Iben Frimann-Dahl from Rystad Energy.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>","Japan's Daikin, thriving in Asia and India, sets sights on Africa","By Makiko Yamazaki and Yoshiyasu Shida
TOKYO (Reuters) - Daikin Industries, (T:6367) the world's largest maker of air conditioning equipment, is turning to Africa for further expansion, 10 years after a successful gamble on sharing its key technology with a Chinese company.
As Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic stepped back from home appliances over a decade ago to avoid price wars with Asian rivals, Daikin did the opposite, going head-to-head with the likes of South Korea's LG (KS:003550).
Fighting off low-cost competitors through local partnerships and acquisitions, Daikin grabbed top share in markets such as India. Africa, where LG and China's Haier are established giants, may seem like another difficult target for Daikin.
But Yoshihiro Mineno, Daikin's senior executive in charge of Asia, said the company is used to silencing critics, recalling the controversy more than 15 years ago over its decision to target mass markets overseas.
""Many skeptics at the time said it would be impossible to make profits in the 'volume zone' in Asia, and that it was pointless to invest there,"" Mineno told Reuters in an interview.
Conventional wisdom, he said, held that the 94-year-old company should focus on high-end markets. 
Daikin saw limited potential for growth in that area, however, and executives knew the company would have to focus on low cost and high volume if it wanted to boost its global presence.
The company's market value now exceeds those of electronics conglomerates Panasonic Corp (T:6752) and Hitachi Ltd (T:6501).
""If advanced technologies or added-value products are your only selling points, your rivals are likely to catch up and overtake you,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at the research arm of Ace Securities.
""But Daikin's business model is backed by cost competitiveness,"" Yasuda added. ""It's among a few Japanese companies that can compete head to head with the Chinese.""
The United States, the world's largest market for air conditioning, has been tougher to crack.
Daikin has struggled to compete with local rivals such as United Technologies' (N:UTX) Carrier and Johnson Controls' York, which specialize in ducted air conditioning.
Daikin acquired the U.S. company Goodman in 2012 to strengthen its expertise in that area, but has made little headway. 
The prospect of tariffs from a trade war between the United States and China adds another headache: Daikin assembles air conditioners in the U.S. using some Chinese-made parts.
Mineno said the company may need to export components from elsewhere in Asia if the trade war escalates.
For a graphic on Daikin sales, click https://reut.rs/2Lbf09G 
REGIONAL STRATEGY
In 2006, Daikin took over Malaysian contract manufacturer OYL Industries for $2.1 billion. The deal boosted its purchasing power, and provided access to cheaper global suppliers and nimble product development.
Two years later, it shocked the industry by agreeing to a partnership with major Chinese rival Gree Electric Appliances (SZ:000651). The deal gave Daikin mass-market production capabilities in return for access to its advanced inverter technology, which saves electricity by efficiently regulating temperatures. 
Critics said the move amounted to self-sabotage because of the potential for such valuable components to be copied. 
The technology did end up in air conditioners from other Chinese companies. But Daikin expanded production so quickly with Gree's help that it drove smaller rivals out of the market. 
""We effectively created a market for inverter air conditioners with Gree,"" Mineno said.
Gree is still a partner in producing low-end models and components for Daikin, although they compete in most other segments.
""Being the No. 1 player in inverter machines gave us access to government officials and allowed us to influence regulations,"" Mineno said, adding that stricter energy consumption rules, for instance, made Daikin inverters more attractive.
Daikin's sales have tripled since the OYL acquisition, with overseas markets now accounting for 80 percent of its $20 billion annual revenue. 
By contrast, other Japanese manufacturers have struggled to maintain their edge in products that include televisions, smartphone screens and semiconductors.
Experts say most failed to innovate enough to continue charging more than their Chinese and Korean rivals, eventually giving up both market share and margins. 
INDIA TO AFRICA
Executives said Daikin's biggest growth driver is India, where it has established itself as a top player despite competition from LG, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and local manufacturers.
It appointed Indian industry veteran Kanwal Jeet Jawa to lead operations there, built a sales network and localized production with low-cost know-how from OYL.
Daikin's market share in room air conditioners in India jumped from less than 2 percent in 2010 to 17 percent over eight years, lifting the company to the top total sales spot of air conditioners for commercial buildings and industrial use.
Jawa will lead the expansion in Africa as well, the company said. It plans to set up a regional office in east Africa in a few months. 
Jawa said Daikin would continue to aim for the volume zone.
""It's a very price-sensitive market,"" he said of Africa. ""We want to use our leverage of Indian operations and we want to replicate what we have done in India.""
Daikin is adding production capacity for further global expansion. It opened an assembly plant in Vietnam in May and plans another in Malaysia this year.
It is also considering a new Indian plant to help produce products for Africa, Jawa said.
Daikin has set a 2020 sales target of 90 billion yen ($812.71 million) for Africa and the Middle East, an increase of 11 percent from last year, but Mineno said it may need to revise that upward.
""Globally, I still see a lot of growth potential that can be unleashed by our volume-zone strategy,"" he said.

47,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Sanctions Bring Stress to Already Battered Emerging Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the U.S. is using sanctions against its adversaries -- and even some friends -- like never before. The latest batch against Russia and Turkey sank emerging markets, with stocks poised for their worst month since January 2016.
Here’s a refresher of the most recent restrictions imposed by the U.S., the outlook for further sanctions and how markets have reacted.
Turkey
The U.S. imposed sanctions on two Turkish ministers on Aug. 1 in an extraordinary move for a NATO ally after negotiations failed to achieve the release of an American pastor arrested on charges of espionage and aiding terrorists. While largely symbolic, the sanctions were enough to send investors fleeing the lira.
Then Trump upped the ante. On Aug. 10, he ordered the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs against Turkey. Trump announced the measure in an early morning tweet and by the end of the day the lira had completed its biggest weekly decline since 2008. On Aug. 16, the U.S. stepped up the rhetoric again, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying additional sanctions were ready if Turkey refused to release the pastor.
Turkey is closely knitted to western credit markets. With an external debt volume similar to Russia’s, the slump in the currency threatens to push the country’s economy into recession.
Investors had already been exiting Turkey due to accelerating inflation, a high current-account deficit and unpredictable monetary policy. The lira has now slumped 38 percent this year, the worst performance after Argentina.
Russia
The U.S. State Department announced this month new restrictions to punish Vladimir Putin’s government for the nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal. The measures, which take effect Aug. 22, will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds. More sweeping measures may follow 90 days later.
At the same time, the U.S. Congress is weighing draft legislation proposing more sanctions that target Russia’s sovereign debt and its largest banks, in response to alleged election meddling.
Russia has been a target of U.S. sanctions since Barack Obama’s administration. Starting in 2014, the U.S. government has imposed restrictions to protest Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its support for a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. More were added after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election, won by Trump.
In April, another round of measures in response to Russia’s “malign activity around the globe” hit hardest Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal, limiting its access to the $140 billion global aluminum industry.
Almost 700 Russian people and companies are now under U.S. sanctions.
The ruble is down around 7 percent in August, heading toward its worst month since November 2016.
Iran
Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal on May 8 despite opposition from China, Russia and NATO allies, reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
The U.S. plans to hit Iran’s lifeline by targeting oil exports as it demands the Islamic Republic stops supporting terrorism and halts its ballistic missile program. Faced by a choice between doing business with Iran or the U.S., European companies including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) quickly halted activity or backtracked on investment plans in the Persian Gulf nation.
Iranian hardliners increased pressure on President Hassan Rouhani -- a relative moderate -- after the sanctions resumed, while the rial went into free fall on Tehran’s unregulated market. A 50 percent rise in the price of some food items sparked street protests and led the central bank to impose capital controls.
Rouhani has called for other partners in the nuclear agreement to stand by the accord and on Aug. 6 he indicated the U.S. needs to ease sanctions before he’d agree to any talks. Trump said he would meet with Rouhani without preconditions.
Still, he also tweeted: “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!.”
The rial has lost about 80 percent of its value since late April, and is currently trading at about 102,200 to the dollar.
Venezuela
The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Venezuela for human-rights abuses, political repression and graft, culminating in Aug. 2017, when the Trump administration barred trading of new debt issued by the Venezuelan government and its state oil company PDVSA in U.S. markets and blocked dealing in some existing bonds owned by the country’s public sector.
The sanctions forced the government to announce a restructuring of all its debt in November. American investors were prohibited by U.S. authorities from engaging in that restructuring.
Venezuela’s international bonds due in 2027 lost more than half of their value in 2017, reaching an all time low of 21.785 cents on the dollar in December. They currently trade around 28 cents.
This year, Trump also prohibited the sale, transfer or pledging of collateral of any equity interest in which the Venezuelan government has a 50 percent or greater stake, further choking off funding to President Nicolas Maduro’s government.
The sanctions, rampant inflation and lower oil prices have almost wiped out the value of Venezuela’s bolivar since Maduro was elected in 2013.
This weekend, the government carried out one of the greatest currency devaluations in history -- a 95 percent plunge that will test the capacity of an already beleaguered population to stomach even more pain. The devaluation comes at the same time the government is redenominating the currency by lopping off five zeros and introducing new bills and a name change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foreign-brand automakers with U.S. plants do not support Trump administration rules to raise the amount of local content in North American-made vehicles, a group representing companies including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) has told key U.S. lawmakers.
Talks between Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are due to resume on Tuesday in Washington to try to resolve remaining bilateral issues so that Canada, which has been sidelined for weeks from the negotiations, can return to the bargaining table.
The automakers' position was in a previously unreported Aug. 16 letter from their ""Here for America"" group to top trade-focused members of Congress. The letter could raise resistance to a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement from lawmakers in southern states, where foreign manufacturers have built auto plants.
""We remain concerned that, without further clarifications, assurances and modifications, many of those companies producing vehicles in multiple states will not be in a position to support legislation implementing a NAFTA 2.0,"" the group said in the letter, signed by John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers.
Automotive experts have said that some foreign brand automakers with smaller North American manufacturing footprints and fewer U.S. research and development staff may have difficulty meeting the more stringent content requirements for years.
The group said its members, which also include Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) Kia Motors (KS:000270), Subaru Corp (T:7270), and Volvo, a unit of China's Geely Automobile Holdings (HK:0175), account for nearly 50 percent of U.S. vehicle production.
DETROIT SUPPORTIVE
At the same time, the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit's Big Three automakers is ""encouraged by the direction of the discussions,"" said Matt Blunt, who heads the trade group.
""We share the administration’s overall goals of strengthening U.S. auto manufacturing and creating jobs and given the importance of NAFTA to U.S. industry we urge the negotiators to quickly complete the negotiations,"" added Blunt, whose group represents General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA).
The United States and Mexico are closing in on a bilateral deal on autos that would lift the requirement for North American content in regionally made vehicles to at least 70 percent from the current 62.5 percent.
The deal is expected to require that some 40 percent of the value come from high wage locations paying at least $16 an hour, meaning the United States and Canada, a Mexican source close to the talks told Reuters. 
USTR officials have been meeting in recent days with individual automakers to secure support for potential changes, according to auto industry sources.
A USTR spokeswoman declined comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who launched the renegotiation of the 1994 pact a year ago, has said he wants the reworked deal to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, particularly in autos and auto parts.
Other key unresolved issues include the phase-in time for the new automotive rules to take effect and whether the U.S. demand for a ""sunset"" clause that forces a renegotiation every five years is adopted, making long-term investment decisions more difficult.

The letter from the ad-hoc ""Here for America"" group also raised concerns that national security tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum would undermine the benefit of a NAFTA agreement.

The world’s top miner raised its annual dividend 42 percent to $1.18 a share, which included a record final payment, though didn’t confirm details of plans to hand back a windfall from the $10.8 billion of deals agreed last month to sell U.S. shale assets.
Full-year underlying earnings jumped 33 percent to $8.9 billion in the 12 months through June, Melbourne-based BHP said Tuesday in a statement. That compared with a $9.2 billion average estimate among analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
The record final dividend “reflects strong operating performance, prices and capital discipline,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said in the statement. Net proceeds from the sale of U.S. onshore oil and gas assets will be returned once the agreements are completed, he said.
BHP’s cash pile is being boosted after it struck the deals last month to sell U.S. shale assets. BHP follows  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group and Vale SA in lifting payouts, as investors press for greater rewards and demand producers show restraint over spending on major projects or deals.
BHP booked $5.2 billion of after-tax billion of impairments, including a previously flagged $2.8 billion writedown on the value of the shale assets. The company also took a $650 million charge related to the Samarco dam failure.
Commodities have been roiled in recent months by concerns over potential weaker demand as global trade tensions stoke worries over slower growth in China, the top consumer of raw materials. The Bloomberg Commodity Index has lost about 9 percent from a recent peak in May.
BHP forecasts China’s growth to slow modestly in 2018, while “downside risks have increased due to rising trade protectionism,” the producer said in the statement.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's biggest listed state-owned lenders are expected to post modestly higher profits and steady margins for the six months ended June, as government efforts to boost spending and liquidity underpins loan growth.
Beijing has been pumping funds into the banking system and rolling out support measures for local businesses to cushion the impact from an escalating trade war with the United States. The two countries implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others' goods in July.
But analysts fear an unrestrained, credit-fueled growth, could worsen a build-up in bad loans, already at nine-year highs, as the world's No.2 economy cools, undermining Beijing's push to reduce riskier lending and a mountain of debt.
Indications on future trends are expected to emerge over the coming weeks as the country's top banks - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398), China Construction Bank Corp (SS:601939), Agricultural Bank of China (SS:601288), Bank of China (SS:601988) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) - unveil their January-June results.
Profits for China's top five banks are expected to have risen by 4.7-7 percent, said analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. In 2017, the banks saw profits rise 2.8-4.9 percent. 
Due to better loan margins, ""I expect no major changes either up or down, so stable earnings situation"", said Nicholas Zhu, a Moody's banks analyst, referring to the top-tier banks.
Their results will also be underpinned by the diversity ""in their asset base source of income"", he added.
For smaller lenders, however, the story is different as they are being hit harder by Beijing's crackdown on risk in the broader financial system.
(Graphic: China's big five banks performance interactive: https://tmsnrt.rs/2L8phnc)
BAD LOANS SPIKE
By the end of the June quarter, the non-performing loan ratio for the banking sector reached 1.86 percent, data from the China Insurance and Banking Regulatory Commission shows.
This was the highest since 2009.
Bad loans spiked 183 billion yuan ($26.62 billion), the biggest quarterly jump since the regulator began publishing data in 2003.
""The market expects a deterioration in quality of assets in the banking sector because of the slowing down of the economy,"" said Steven Leung, Hong Kong-based sales director, UOB Kay Hian.
The weaker yuan , which has fallen for 10 weeks, is also likely to drag on lenders' offshore loan portfolios, said Leung, who has a ""buy"" rating on the top banks because of low valuations and high dividend yield. 
Small banks, hurt by Beijing's move to cut excess industrial capacity and curb pollution, are seeing a spike in bad loans, with some reporting zero or negative capital adequacy ratios. 
New asset management rules due to come into play in the middle of next year have already squeezed smaller banks, which depend to a greater extent on income from the sales of wealth management products, analysts said.
SILVER LINING 
The situation could get more complicated in the event of an economic slowdown and a surge in corporate defaults.
So far, official data shows limited impact from the U.S-China trade spat, but some economists are trimming China growth estimates saying tougher tariffs will bite. 
China's Politburo, the Communist Party's top decision-making body, said last month it would achieve this year's GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent, despite mounting risks. The economy expanded 6.9 percent in 2017.
Beijing's recent easing, ranging from encouraging banks to raise investment in bonds of corporates and other entities to allowing greater access to Medium Term Loan Facilities, should be a silver lining for smaller lenders.

""Since the main source of debt for the four major banks is deposits, the relative benefit (of Beijing's easing) is less than for small and medium-sized banks,"" said Duan Taotao, a banks analyst at Industrial Securities.

The regulator said Interactive neither admitted nor denied the charges while settling the matter.
Interactive Brokers was not immediately available for comment.

55,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P 500 Closes Shy of Record High as Energy Stocks Steam Ahead,"Investing.com - The S&P closed just shy of all-time highs Monday, powered by rising energy stocks and easing fears over a full-blown trade war ahead of U.S.-China trade talks later this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.35%. The S&P 500 rose 0.23%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.06%.
Low-level talks between China and U.S. slated for this week have eased investor concerns the current tit-for-tat trade fight could evolve into full-blown trade war, denting both global growth and demand for riskier investments like stocks.
While many are not expecting significant progress to made on the trade war front at this week's talks, it is hoped the dialogue would pave the way for more meaningful talks that could lead to the end of the dispute as early as November, when President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet.
Signs of optimism on trade helped support shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), which have significant international exposure, making them vulnerable to rising trade tensions.
But gains on a more upbeat outlook for trade were limited by expectations for a further volley of trade tariffs from both the U.S. and China. The U.S. is expected on Thursday to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese imports. And Beijing has threatened to retaliate with 25% tariffs as well.
Energy, meanwhile, rose sharply, pushing the broader market higher, as oil prices made a bullish start to the week on hopes for improved U.S.-China relations and expectations U.S. sanctions against Iran would exacerbate the shortage of global supplies.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 52 cents settle at $66.43 a barrel
Industrials also supported the broader averages as investors piled into battered airline stocks, encouraged by expectations for easing trade tensions and recent forecasts from airline operators for more moderate capacity growth.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was one of the best performers in the S&P 500, rising 5.8%.
Dealmaking also came to the fore, supporting sentiment for U.S. stocks after PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) said it would buy SodaStream (NASDAQ:SODA) for $3.2 billion. And  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) revealed it would buy Keystone Foods for $2.16 billion in cash.
In other corporate news, (NASDAQ:Tesla) managed to finish higher despite doubts over the legitimacy of CEO Elon Musk's claim in a tweet last week that he had secured funding to take the company private.
The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, which was said to be considering a stake in Tesla to help fund the company's go-private deal, reportedly invested in Lucid Motors, a rival electric automaker in China.
On the political front, Trump over the weekend reportedly said he expected Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to be a cheap-money Fed chief, but two increases in interest rates seen at the Fed so far this year -- with a third pencilled in for as early as September -- have proven otherwise.

59,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 04:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. A Day for Individual Stocks
Tomorrow could be the toughest day for Wall Street to find direction in what is usually a quiet time for stocks.
While trade concerns remain at the forefront, meetings with China and the U.S. don’t start until Wednesday. And the economic calendar is empty apart from the Redbook numbers on same-store sales.
Instead, individual stocks may generate the most interest. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bounced back and forth Monday. And CEO Elon Musk still hasn’t given up tweeting, which has become a key thing to trade the stock on. In fact, there was chatter of Tesla getting some buying support after Musk simply unfollowed his girlfriend Grimes.
And Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares were strong after being down more than $100 from their all-time highs. The market will be interested to see if the move is more about short-covering or whether the stock is regaining some momentum.
2. Retail and Homebuilder Earnings Scheduled
Despite the late-August market doldrums there should be enough earnings reports to keep investors busy before the bell.
There will be more numbers from the retail sector. Department store chain Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) reports ahead of trading, as does discount retailer TJX (NYSE:TJX). Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) releases earnings after the market closes.
Investors will also get more insight into the U.S. housing market when  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) reports quarterly numbers.
Housing has been a weaker spot in the otherwise very strong U.S. economy. Last week July housing starts fell shy of economists’ forecasts, although building permits were stronger.
Shares of Toll Bros. have been on a downward trend since the company missed profit expectations when it reported on its previous quarter in May.
3. Watch for Dollar Volatility
While stocks may not have big catalysts and the economic calendar might be light, there will still be plenty of things to keep the dollar active.
Traders will be positioning their currency portfolios ahead of the aforementioned China and U.S. trade talks. There will also be minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting out Wednesday. And Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak from Jackson Hole, Wyo. on Friday.
There will also be continued reverberations from the Turkish lira USD/TRY crisis, which shows no signs of abating.
Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s cut Turkey’s sovereign debt rating further into junk territory on Monday.
And there is also the possibility of jawboning (or jawtweeting?) from President Donald Trump. Trump on Friday complained to wealthy donors in the Hamptons that he expected Powell to be a cheap-money Fed chief, Bloomberg reported."
60,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Trump's pitch to end quarterly reports would follow EU, Australia","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into letting public companies file financial reports every six months instead of every quarter, as is the case in the European Union and some other countries.
Some supporters of the proposal have argued that a move to fewer financial statements could benefit investors by encouraging companies to focus on long-term goals, while others say having to wait longer for financial information would mean less transparency and increase market volatility.
An SEC move to reduce reporting frequency to twice a year would add the United States to a slate of others that do likewise.
In 2013, a European Union directive made quarterly reporting optional for companies in the bloc's 28 member countries. 
Still, many large companies in EU countries provide quarterly reports in line with U.S. counterparts while smaller companies offer less detailed trading statements instead of quarterly reports.
Here is a list of selected countries that allow for semiannual financial reporting from publicly traded companies, as well as a list of countries that require quarterly financial reports.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials rose on Monday on optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, while the Nasdaq edged upward as technology stocks pared losses. 
The planned talks between the United States and China later this week provided a boost to the trade-sensitive industrial sector (SPLRCI), which rose 0.7 percent. Industrials added the most gains to the S&P 500 among the index's major sectors.
Easing concerns over a potential trade war also helped lift prices of oil and metal. The S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) rose 0.8 percent, and the materials sector (SPLRCM) was up 0.7 percent. [O/R] [MET/L]
""It doesn't necessarily guarantee that there will be an immediate resolution,"" said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors in Torrance, California, of the trade talks. ""But it's certainly a positive development, and it's certainly something investors are focusing on.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 100.59 points, or 0.39 percent, to 25,769.91, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 7.52 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,857.65 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 6.95 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,823.28.
The Nasdaq moved into positive territory as technology stocks pared losses. The S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) was last down 0.1 percent after having dipped as much as 0.63 percent earlier in the session.
This week, investors are turning their attention to central bank policies as the earnings season winds down.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's August policy meeting will be released on Wednesday. The minutes are expected to indicate the Fed's confidence in U.S. economic growth and commitment to further interest rate increases.
Later this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers will meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. On their agenda is a discussion of the root causes of stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and weak productivity gains in the U.S. economy.
Shares of  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) hit a record high of $82.42 after Piper Jaffray and Susquehanna raised their ratings on the stock. Nike shares were last up 2.8 percent at $82.00.
 Intel Corp  (O:INTC) shares dropped 1.2 percent after brokerage Cowen & Co said the chipmaker's disclosure of new security bugs in some of its microprocessors may push cloud companies to seek other suppliers.
 Estee Lauder  (N:EL) rose 2.7 percent after topping quarterly profit and sales estimates as customers bought more of its high-margin Clinique and La Mer skin care products.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 61 new lows.

Members of staff were put on a 45-day consultation period from Friday, the union said. 
The union criticized tycoon Mike Ashley for putting jobs at risk at the British department store group.
Ashley controls British sportswear retailer  Sports Direct  International Plc (L:SPD), which had snapped up House of Fraser from the department store group's administrators for 90 million pounds ($115 million) earlier in August.
Media reports had suggested earlier that the step from XPO Logistics, a supply chain partner of House of Fraser, was the result of its dispute with Sports Direct.
XPO Logistics declined to comment.
Earlier on Monday, British luxury bag maker  Mulberry Group  Plc (L:MUL) said it would take a 3 million pound hit from the collapse of House of Fraser, adding that its full-year profit would be materially reduced.

The UK pay-television group will spend as much as 61.5 million pounds on financial and broking advice and up to 20 million pounds on lawyers for their work on the Fox bid, according to a circular published by Sky. Other costs include fees for accountancy and public relations advice.

Fox, which already owns 39 percent of Sky, is battling U.S. cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA) for control of the broadcaster. Comcast is currently in the lead after Sky's independent directors last month recommended its 14.75 pound a share offer, which trumped Fox's 14 pound a share bid.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Altos Hornos de Mexico, one of Mexico's largest steelmakers, paid $3.7 million to a shell company allegedly set up by Brazilian builder Odebrecht to pay bribes, investigative news site Quinto Elemento Lab reported on Monday.
AHMSA  made three wire transfers to the account weeks after it announced a controversial 2014 sale of a fertilizer plant to Mexican state oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL], Quinto Elemento reported, citing documents from Brazil's Supreme Court. 
It is unclear what links may have existed among Odebrecht, AHMSA and Pemex. Mexican authorities have been probing business between the oil company and the Brazilian conglomerate, which in recent years has admitted to paying over $3 billion in bribes across Latin America, including $10 million in Mexico.
The account paid into by AHMSA, according to the documents cited by the report, was registered in Antigua by Odebrecht[ODBES.UL] operatives in the name of Grangemouth Trading Company, which is registered in Scotland.
Grangemouth appears on a list of offshore firms set up by Olivio Rodrigues Junior, who worked for Odebrecht and who in testimony to prosecutors said he helped his employer pay bribes, Quinto Elemento reported.
AHMSA spokesman Francisco Orduna confirmed to Reuters that the payments were made, but said they were for Grangemouth to advise AHMSA on equipment, systems, logistics and suppliers for a steelworks expansion in Monclova, Mexico. 
Odebrecht did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Grangemouth, registered with Britain's business registry in March 2013, in documents online says it sources heavy equipment and represents manufacturers and used equipment dealers. It lists as its general partner Stichting Tilbourg Crossing, a Netherlands-based entity that the documents say was also part of the Odebrecht bribes structure.
Reuters was unable to reach anyone representing Grangemouth or Stichting Tilbourg Crossing. 
According to the report, the payments began shortly after AHMSA completed a $273 million sale of a fertilizer plant to Pemex, a transaction later criticized by Mexican auditors as expensive and poorly analyzed.
The report did not prove a direct link between the Grangemouth payments and the Pemex contract or show where the money AHMSA paid to Grangemouth went.
Pemex's chief executive at the time, Emilio Lozoya, has been questioned by Mexican prosecutors about Odebrecht bribes. Last year, Quinto Elemento published videos of testimony by Odebrecht executives to Brazilian prosecutors in which they said they paid Lozoya millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for contracts.
Javier Coello Trejo, Lozoya's attorney, told Reuters that his client did not receive bribes from Odebrecht or AHMSA and that none of his work at Pemex has been proven to have involved corruption.
AHMSA's Grangemouth payments were made to an account with Meinl Bank Antigua, Quinto Elemento reported. The account is the same one Odebrecht executives in testimony said they used to pay Lozoya.
Once a close advisor of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto, Lozoya ran Pemex from 2012 until 2016, when he stepped down to make way for a new chief executive tasked with cutting costs in a global oil market rout.
Pemex declined to comment on issues related to Odebrecht, citing the ongoing investigation. It said the fertilizer plant it bought from AHMSA, which had not operated for 18 years before the purchase, has been renovated and is now running.
Mexico's Congressional auditor, ASF, has criticized various transactions Lozoya led at Pemex, including contracts with Odebrecht and the fertilizer plant purchase. 
In one report, ASF analyzed trips taken by Lozoya and Pemex aides in a helicopter he purchased as chief executive. They found the helicopter took 54 trips in 2015 to the Mexico City offices of Grupo Acerero del Norte (GAN), the holding company that owns AHMSA.
Orduna, the AHMSA spokesman, said that Lozoya used the heliport, but did not necessarily visit the company itself.

Lozoya's lawyer said that not all the trips were taken by his client. Other Pemex officials used the helicopter, he added, explaining that GAN's heliport is close to Pemex offices and was sometimes used for logistical purposes.

89,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Trump Complains to Donors in the Hamptons About Powell’s Rate Hikes,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he expected Jerome Powell to be a cheap-money Fed chairman and lamented to wealthy Republican donors at a Hamptons fundraiser on Friday that his nominee instead raised interest rates, according to three people present.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times since Trump took office, including twice this year under Powell. The president nominates the Fed’s chairman and other governors in Washington, but the agency is independent and has historically frustrated presidents by raising interest rates without regard for politics.
Trump has publicly lamented the central bank’s recent rate increases, but his private remarks to donors are the most personal criticism of Powell’s performance to emerge so far. The people who described the comments asked not to be identified because the fundraiser was closed to the public.
His jabs built on an attack he leveled at Powell’s Fed in July, when he pronounced himself “not thrilled” with the rate increases. That broadside, in an interview with CNBC, broke with a more than two-decade-old norm of presidents avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the Fed’s independence.
The dollar, as measured by the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, reached its weakest level of the day following the report on Trump’s comments at the fundraiser.
Even as Trump complains, the Fed is moving more slowly to raise interest rates than it has in previous economic expansions. Interest rates are low by historical standards given an unemployment rate below 4 percent and, in recent months, accelerating economic growth.
Powell and his colleagues have justified a cautious approach toward increasing rates by pointing to sluggish inflation, which has shown no sign of jumping significantly past the Fed’s 2 percent target.
The Fed last raised rates in June, to a target range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. That’s seen by most economists as below the so-called neutral rate of interest by about 1 percentage point, meaning the Fed is still adding fuel to U.S. growth rather than restraining the economy.
The Fed has penciled in two more interest rate increases this year, according to projections it updated in June. Investors see a 90 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its September meeting.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley and Federal Reserve spokesman David Skidmore declined to comment.
About 60 people attended Trump’s fundraiser at the Southampton home of Howard Lorber, the chairman of hot dog company Nathan’s Famous. Guests included Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts; John Catsimatidis Jr., the son of Red Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Group Chairman John Catsimatidis; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel; Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; White House Chief of Staff John Kelly; and senior White House aides Jared Kushner and Dan Scavino.
Trump held a discussion with a small group and then made remarks to a larger group over a dinner of salad with chicken in a tent in Lorber’s yard. It was a humid night and Trump joked that Lorber could have afforded better air conditioning, according to one of the people.
An RNC spokeswoman said the event raised about $3 million for the Trump Victory Committee, which benefits both the president’s campaign and the party."

Competition to capture online shoppers has picked up among premium brands in recent years, pitting conglomerates such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH against independent operators as some scramble to make up for a slow move into e-commerce. 
Farfetch runs an online marketplace for luxury wares offered by nearly 1,000 brands and boutiques worldwide rather than hold stock itself.
Online sales made up 9 percent of global luxury revenue in 2017 and are forecast by consultancy Bain to reach a quarter of all sales by 2025. 
""This industry is still in its infancy,"" Farfetch founder Jose Neves said in the company's regulatory filing. 
The 10-year-old business, which has yet to turn a profit, did not disclose the number of shares it would sell or the offer price per share. Existing shareholders include China's JD.com, which invested $397 million in 2017, expanding Farfetch's foothold in the world's biggest market for luxury consumers.  JD.com has agreed to buy more shares to maintain its stake after the listing, Farfetch said without disclosing the size of the holding.  Other investors include publisher Conde Nast and DST Global, run by Silicon Valley-based billionaire Yuri Milner, who had once backed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and online home rental company Airbnb.  Farfetch, which competes with platforms including MyTheresa and MatchesFashion, has also expanded into technology, working with France's Chanel to link its stores to digital services such as chatrooms. It has also paired up with Britain's Burberry to help the fashion brand make its inventory more widely available online. Other companies have been investing in their own e-commerce ventures, including Cartier parent Richemont, which took control of Farfetch rival Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter this year.  Farfetch's revenue grew by 59 percent to $386 million in 2017, its filing showed. However, losses deepened to $68 million in the first half of this year, from $29 million in the same period of 2017, as investments and costs increased.  Proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) will be used for working capital, including possible acquisitions, the company said. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Allen & Co, UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Cowen and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) are the underwriters for the planned IPO.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Standard Chartered sells principal finance business to Actis and ICG,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) is in talks to sell its private equity business to  Intermediate Capital Group  (L:ICP) (ICG), a source with direct knowledge of the deal said on Monday, as part of a broader disposal of its 'principal finance' investment business.
StanChart has separately completed the sale of the other half of its principal finance unit, comprising its real estate investment business in Asia, to private equity firm Actis, the bank said on Monday.
The UK-based bank, whose business is focused on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, did not disclose the size of that deal.
Reuters reported in November the real estate principal finance business has around $700 million in investments across Asia and Africa.
A spokesman for the bank confirmed the completion of the Actis deal. 
StanChart and ICG declined to comment on the prospective ICG deal.
The disposals follow StanChart's decision in late 2016 to exit the principal finance business, which invests the bank's and its clients' money, as part of a broader strategic shift under Chief Executive Bill Winters to focus more on serving the bank's corporate and individual customers.
The business had been a drag on StanChart's performance, reporting an operating loss of $217 million in 2016. From 2017, the gains and losses from the business were excluded from the bank’s financial performance.
The 20-strong StanChart team in Asia, led by Brian Chinappi, will join Actis, Actis said in a statement.
The deal will add two new offices for Actis in Shanghai and Seoul as part of the acquisition, Actis said.
Reuters reported in March the two parties had reached a provisional agreement on the deal, as StanChart looked to offload the principal finance business to focus on its core corporate and retail banking businesses.
The deal to offload to ICG the private equity business which comprises the rest of the principal finance business has yet to be confirmed, the source said. 

London-based alternative asset manager ICG had 32.9 billion euros ($37.63 billion) in assets under management at the end of June across a number of private equity, credit and debt strategies.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>","Linde, Praxair get EU approval for $82 billion deal, await U.S. decision","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German industrial gases group  Linde  (DE:LING) and U.S. rival Praxair (N:PX) secured conditional EU antitrust approval on Monday for their $82 billion merger but still have to clear a major hurdle with U.S. enforcers.
The deal, announced in June last year, would put the merged entity ahead of French competitor  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) in gas distribution. The companies' industrial gases such as oxygen and helium are used in hospitals, MRI scanners and steel production.
The European Commission said the companies' pledge to sell assets to reinforce a Japanese rival in Europe and other concessions addressed its concerns that the deal may lead to price hikes and hurt competition, confirming a Reuters story on July 12.
""With this decision, we make sure that the merger of Praxair and Linde will not result in further concentration in Europe and that customers will continue to benefit from competition in these markets,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The EU watchdog said Praxair will sell its entire gas business in the 28-country bloc, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. It will also transfer its stake in an Italian joint venture in central and eastern Europe to partner Flow Fin. 
The companies will also sell additional helium sourcing contracts to one or more buyers.
Praxair has already done a deal to sell its industrial gases businesses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain to  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091) for 5 billion euros.
The companies however are facing more onerous demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which wants more asset sales, possibly exceeding the companies' agreed threshold, and wants the buyers to meet certain requirements.

Last month, Linde said it was in advanced talks to sell a majority of its gases business in North America and certain Linde and Praxair assets in South America to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC.

124,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 10:39AM ET</span>",Here's the latest hint that Apple will launch new Apple Watch models next month,"A new government filing from the Eurasian Economic Commission suggests that Apple is preparing six new Apple Watch models for launch in the near future.
The filings are required for encrypted devices sold in several Eastern European countries, including Russia.
The filings, via  MacRumors and  Consomac, don't reveal many details aside from new model numbers: A1977, A1978, A1975, A1976, A2007, and A2008.
 Rumors suggest that Apple is working on new Apple Watch models with larger screens, better health sensors, and longer battery life.
Apple has not changed the physical design of the Apple Watch since the device first went on sale in 2015. This seems likely to be the year in which Apple launches an updated design if the Apple Watch models end up having a larger screen as rumored.
Apple has revealed new iPhones in September every year since 2012. The past two years it has also launched new Apple Watch models at its annual event.
Apple observers are speculating that Apple will hold an iPhone launch event early in September, possibly September 12, though a date has not yet been publicly announced.
The Eurasian filings basically confirm that Apple is planning to launch new Apple Watch models next month. Similar filings from the same regulatory commission have surfaced in the weeks before new iPads and iPhones have launched."
125,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",Tesla tumbles as Saudi Arabia looks to invest in an electric competitor,"News of the talks comes almost two full weeks after the Financial Times reported  the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund had bought a 3-5% stake in Tesla. That report was followed by a tweet from CEO Elon Musk stating that funding had been secured to take the electric-car maker private at $420 per share.
In response, Tesla shares skyrocketed to a near record highs, hitting of $387.46 apiece, on August 7. But they had slumped more than 20% from that level through Friday, and Monday's selling, which has wiped away all of Tesla's post-earnings gains, is adding to those loses. The sell-off has been a windfall for Tesla short sellers, who have made more than  $1.3 billion in the process.
The big profits seen by the short sellers come much to the chagrin of Musk, who told the New York Times in an interview published Friday that he’s  gearing up for ""months of extreme torture"" from those betting against his stock.
Also weighing on Tesla’s stock price in early-trading Monday was a price-target cut from JPMorgan. The bank's analyst, Ryan Brinkman slashed his target by more than 35% to $195 a share, citing the fact that funding was not actually secured at the time Musk claimed it had been.
""The revelation the Saudi fund is subsequently asking Tesla for details of how the company would be taken private suggests to us that any deal is potentially far from even being formally proposed,"" Ryan Brinkman told clients in a note Monday,  Bloomberg reported. 
Wall Street now has an average target of $331 for Tesla, according to Bloomberg, 26% below Musk's $420 target for taking the company private."
126,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Tesla Keeps Dropping on Doubts Musk Has the Money to Go Private,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. slid further on Elon Musk’s acknowledgment of the hurdles standing in the way of his effort to take the company private and the emergence of another electric-car company that could be attracting interest from a key investor.
The stock tumbled as much as 5.7 percent at the open of trading Monday, as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) scrapped any modeling in its price target for the possibility that Musk will buy out some investors at $420 a share. Analyst Ryan Brinkman, who rates Tesla the equivalent of a sell, said such a deal is “potentially far from even being formally proposed.”
The bearish analysis followed a report Sunday that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund -- the very investor that Musk has described as a linchpin of his plan to take Tesla private -- was considering buying a stake in another U.S. electric-car company. The Saudis’ Public Investment Fund, which recently purchased almost 5 percent of Tesla, is in talks for a separate $1 billion investment in Lucid Motors Inc. that would give the fund control of that fledgling automaker, Reuters reported.
The news combined to extend the trauma of last week, when Tesla shares plummeted 14 percent, the steepest drop since February 2016. Musk, 47, gave an alarming interview to the New York Times in which he said no one reviewed his tweet about taking the company private before he posted it. His description of using a prescription drug to sleep and of the toll that leading Tesla has taken on his personal life also raised questions about the well-being of the larger-than-life chief executive officer.
Tesla shares pared early declines and were down 3 percent to $296.33 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York. Last week’s rout wiped out the stock’s year-to-date gain.
Brinkman, who had hiked his price target on Tesla to $308 after Musk’s initial take-private tweet on Aug. 7, dropped it back to the earlier level of $195. He cited the CEO’s Aug. 13 blog post in which he said the Saudi PIF had asked for more information about how the transaction could be pulled off.
“We now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed,” Brinkman wrote in a note to clients. Taking Tesla private may be “more along the lines of high level intention” than a firm plan, the analyst said, so formally incorporating it into valuation analysis “seems premature at this time.”

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday as a $113 cut in JPMorgan Chase's (N:JPM) price target for the electric carmaker added to growing doubts among market players about a plan to take the company private. 
Slashing its price target for Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) from $308 to $195, the brokerage said it did not believe Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had funds for a plan announced by a tweet that said ""funding secured"" two weeks ago.
Analysts from the U.S. bank had upped its forecast from $198 to $308 after a roughly $100 surge in Tesla stock following Musk's tweets on Aug. 7 and the note on Monday was the latest evidence of scepticism about the deal on Wall Street. 
People familiar with the matter said on Sunday that PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Musk says had been pressing to help fund the buyout, is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc.
""Our interpretation of subsequent events leads us to believe that funding was not secured for a going private transaction, nor was there any formal proposal,"" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.
""Tesla does appear to be exploring a going private transaction, but we now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed, suggesting formal incorporation into our valuation analysis seems premature at this time,"" Brinkman said.
JPM now targets the stock, which it continues to value at underweight, back at $195, versus Friday's close of $305.50. The median price target of the Wall Street analysts covering Tesla is $336. 
Tesla shares touched a three-month low of $285 in premarket trading before recovering to trade around $290, reducing its market value back below that of General Motors (N:GM) as the biggest U.S. carmaker.
An interview with the New York Times, in which Musk said he was under major emotional stress in the ""most difficult year"" of his life, on Friday added to investors' concerns over his leadership after a series of social media spats.
A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week that the SEC has opened an inquiry related to Musk's tweets on the buyout and the billionaire is also facing a class action suite from investors who lost money in the share moves. 

""The lack of process to (Musk's) announcement has now caused governance and competency concerns which are starting to snowball,"" said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth.

The dispute heated up in May https://www.reuters.com/article/us-conocophillips-pdvsa/conoco-has-seized-venezuela-pdvsa-products-from-isla-refinery-curacao-idUSKCN1IE0Y8?il=0 when Conoco moved to seize the Caribbean assets of PDVSA, after the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ruled that the Venezuelan state oil driller violated several contracts.
PDVSA has agreed to make an initial payment of around $500 million within a period of 90 days from the time of signing the agreement, ConocoPhillips said in a statement.
The remaining amount is to be paid quarterly over a period of 4-1/2 years.
ConocoPhillips declined to say if the PDVSA payments would be made in cash or crude oil, saying details of the agreement are confidential.
Venezuela's economy, almost completely dependent on oil exports, is in deep recession with hyperinflation and severe shortages of basic needs like medicine and food. The country's ability to pay has also been hurt by U.S. sanctions.
Houston-based Conoco said it made sure that the settlement met all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including any applicable sanctions against Venezuela.
Conoco left Venezuela after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] as part of the nationalization of the country's oil industry under late President Hugo Chavez. Its assets were expropriated in 2007.

The company said on Monday it has also agreed to suspend its legal enforcement of the arbitration award following its settlement with PDVSA.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Nissan to boost China production capacity by 40 percent, source says","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) plans to invest about $900 million to boost vehicle-making capacity in China by 40 percent by 2021 - part of a 60 billion yuan ($8.73 billion) strategy to become a top three player in the world’s largest auto market.
Nissan and its Chinese joint-venture partner Dongfeng Group (HK:0489) intend to invest roughly $900 million for the envisioned manufacturing capacity expansion over the next few years, according to a person close to the plan. That would boost Nissan's vehicle production capacity in China to as many as 2.1 million vehicles a year. 
The investment is part of a previously disclosed multiyear plan to expand Nissan's sales in China.
China's auto market has been dominated by General Motors Co (N:GM) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) for nearly two decades, with each selling 4 million vehicles last year.
Nissan, along with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), and Honda Motor Co (T:7267), lag far behind, each selling 1 million-plus vehicles a year. Nissan wants to break out of this second tier to become a top-3 China automaker, Nissan China leaders have said.
Nissan sold 1.5 million vehicles last year. Its goal is to sell up to 2.6 million vehicles a year by 2022, said the source, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to reporters about the expansion.  
Nissan in February outlined a five-year plan, dubbed “Triple One,” to increase its market share in China by focusing on electric cars and the Venucia, a no-frills local Nissan brand in China - two market segments expected to see a surge in demand. It also aims to boost sales of light commercial vans and trucks.
Nissan and Dongfeng would use two existing assembly plants to produce Nissan brand passenger cars and construct a new plant in Wuhan where state-owned Dongfeng is headquartered. 
Nissan, part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, plans to use the added capacity to produce both electric vehicles and gasoline-fueled cars for the Nissan brand and its China-only Venucia brand. 
As part of its expansion, Nissan and Dongfeng are seeking approval from China’s regulators for a new assembly plant in Wuhan. If approved, the facility would have capacity to be able to produce about 300,000 vehicles a year.

Rival Toyota plans to boost its China capacity over the next few years by 240,000 vehicles a year, or by about 20 percent, from its current capacity of 1.16 million vehicles a year.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>","With record in view, aging U.S. bull market may still be frisky","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Why settle for nine-and-a-half years when you can do an even 10 or better? That’s the thinking of a lot of investors measuring whether a historically long run in U.S. stocks still has legs.
This Wednesday, the S&P 500's bull-market run will turn 3,453 days old, which in some market watchers' eyes will make it the longest such streak in history. 
The bull was born in the ashes of the financial crisis and carried along through much of its rise by $3.5 trillion of asset purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The debate now is over when, not if, its run will come to an end.
""Bull markets are like incandescent light bulbs. They tend to glow brightest just before they go out,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA.
The record is of some question because Wall Street experts define bull and bear markets differently.
The S&P 500 also would need to hit an all-time high after Wednesday to confirm the milestone. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was 0.8 percent shy of its record high, set on Jan. 26.
If the S&P fails to eclipse that high and drops 20 percent below it, that would signify instead that stocks have been in a bear market since the January peak.
But many investors are optimistic that the stock market in the near term will avoid a plunge that would end the bull run, in large part because of the U.S. economy's health. 
""True bear markets are associated with recessions,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""I have to ask myself, 'When do I see a recession?' I don’t see one around the corner.""
To extend its run, as it has throughout the long march higher, the market would need to shrug off a range of geopolitical concerns, including trade tensions between the United States and its partners, an emerging market rout set off by Turkey's sliding currency, uncertainty over China's economy and upcoming midterm elections. 
In the United States, while economists see strong growth for at least the next year, investors did point to some concerning signs, including rising corporate debt and shaky housing activity.
""The reality is the economy's going strong but there is an increasing amount of yellow to orange flashing warning signs out there,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Brothers in New York. 
The market is not far removed from brutal declines stemming from the 1999-2000 Internet bubble and 2007-2009 financial crisis, and investors are wary of the timing and extent of the next downturn. For example, while the U.S. corporate tax cuts fueled equity returns in the past year, some investors worry they eventually could result in a harder landing for stocks.
""Putting in a late-cycle fiscal stimulus ... that really sets up the potential for a boom-bust type of scenario,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. 
The U.S. government has less firepower in a downturn after already cutting taxes significantly, CFRA's Stovall said.
Meanwhile, the Fed's extraordinary efforts to foster an economic recovery from the financial crisis through asset purchases and rock-bottom interest rates have provided essential support for the market during its bull run. So the central bank's slow removal of those planks is now bringing uncertainty for stocks.
Of the 12 bear markets charted by CFRA since 1946, the average drop has been 32.7 percent. But the past two, stemming from the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis, have been more severe: declines of 49.1 percent and 56.8 percent, respectively.
Still, there is skepticism that such an extreme move will be repeated.
""The last two bear markets have been two of the most extreme bear markets we have ever seen. They can’t all be extreme,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. 
CLEANSING THE BULL
The current bull market is commonly thought to have started on March 9, 2009, when the S&P 500 closed at 676.53 as the United States grappled with the global financial crisis.
Since then, the benchmark U.S. stock index has more than quadrupled, closing Friday at 2850.13.
That makes it the third most-rewarding bull run, trailing only 1932-1937 and 1990-2000, the latter of which the current streak is poised to match in length on Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
There have been bumps along the way.
During this bull run, the S&P has had 16 pullbacks of at least 5 percent, including four of at least 10 percent, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. 
Since 2009, Yardeni Research has counted about 60 ""panic attacks"" - news-driven declines of at least 1 percent for the S&P 500 when the market had been near recent peaks.
The latest correction was the S&P's 10-percent swoon in February from the Jan. 26 record high, which Lerner called a ""healthy reset of an over-stretched market.""
""Bear markets typically cleanse excesses in the market,"" Lerner said. ""During this bull market, we have had some pretty good draw-downs.""
For a graphic on bull markets, see: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/bull-run
Declines of 20 percent for the S&P 500, the standard definition of a bear market, have predominantly occurred around a recession. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) tallied 12 pullbacks of at least 10 percent since 1976 that did not occur around a recession, including the correction earlier this year. Only one of those, in 1987, turned into a 20-percent bear market decline.
While a recession - a period of significant decline in economic activity - is not determined until after it occurs, the United States economy is expected to grow by 2.9 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, according to a Reuters poll of economists. S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 23.3 percent this year and another 10.1 percent in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

""The stock market attempts to discount the future outlook for the economy,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ""So what the stock market is telling me is there is no recession in sight.""

133,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>",The magic of enough: author Brian Portnoy on wealth,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you are like many investors, you obsess over stock fundamentals like earnings, debt or sales growth.
Here is a much better investment tip: Look in the mirror.
So says author Brian Portnoy, director of education at Virtus Investment Partners, in his new book “The Geometry of Wealth: How to shape a life of money and meaning.” 
Portnoy's point is that while investment selection is important, a much bigger factor in your future success is keeping yourself from making the wrong money choices at the wrong time.
Portnoy spoke with Reuters about how understanding our own irrational money impulses can set the table for a life that is healthier, happier and wealthier.
Q: One of your main points is that being wealthy does not equal being rich?
A: “Rich” is just a quest for getting more and more, while “wealthy” means being able to afford a meaningful life. So I describe true wealth as “funded contentment,” aligning your money life to your deeper sources of happiness. And that is different for each person.
Q: Why did you choose shapes as your key metaphor for describing money journeys?
A: Simplicity is extremely important for people, and pictures are easier to follow than words. So I came up with a simplified three-step path to true wealth that involves three shapes: A circle, a square and a triangle. These represent thinking about purpose, setting priorities and making good decisions.
Q: You pose the question “Is a meaningful life affordable?” – so what is your answer to that?
A: The answer is yes, and more so than people think. But you have to focus on experiences over material things, on expressing gratitude and being generous, and truly appreciating the value of time. People usually just think about money, but time is a fantastic source of flexibility and leverage in terms of getting the things you want out of life.
Q: Why do you say that people’s self-awareness is more important to investment results than their understanding of the markets?
A: Most people start with figuring out the right place to invest – and that is important, but it is actually the end of the process. First, you have to understand your own behavior. For instance, most people tend to buy high and sell low. They find it hard to focus on the long-term and dislike diversified portfolios. So behavior matters much more than people realize, and portfolio construction pales in comparison to simply controlling your own negative behaviors.
Q: What is some actionable advice you want people to implement?
A: I would say have a plan, which comes before any actual investments. And second, you need to have the two pillars of diversification and risk management. In other words, be diversified across broad ranges of the markets – stocks, bonds, cash – in a way that is aligned with your risk tolerance. Don’t just go chasing the hot parts of the market to create excess returns, because that is extremely hard to do. Target-date funds are a constructive way to ensure diversification, and auto-enrollment programs are key to enforcing self-discipline for retirement savers.
Q: What do you want readers to come away with?

A: People need to really think about what it means to have enough. We all have a natural push to be better, smarter, faster. We treat money like a scorecard, and every day we fight for more. But if you can align your money with your purpose, you might find that “enough” is a pretty pleasant place to be.

Anthem said the program will provide OTC drugs and health-related items, such as first aid supplies, support braces, and pain relievers at reduced costs.
The Medicare Advantage plan, which competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program, provides healthcare coverage to about 17 million Americans and is offered by insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH), and  Aetna Inc  (N:AET). 
Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said the collaboration emphasizes Anthem's increasing focus and success on Medicare Advantage growth post the margin turnaround, adding the tie-up modestly dampens the likelihood of a near-term Humana deal or JV with Walmart. 
Earlier this month, insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), which has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Walmart, said it was looking to expand its tie-up with the retailer.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) will likely have to wait until the autumn at the earliest for approval from German and European banking regulators to turn its Frankfurt branch into its European Union subsidiary, a spokeswoman for the bank said on Monday.
Standard Chartered may also have to move ""a few"" more jobs than originally envisaged to Frankfurt, the spokeswoman said, as the bank seeks to satisfy the European Central Bank and German authorities about its plans for the hub to conduct its business in Europe after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The bank began interviewing candidates in March this year for about 20 jobs it is moving to Frankfurt, Reuters reported on March 7, after it submitted its license application to German and European authorities in November 2017.
Nine months later StanChart is still waiting for approval, a sign of how European regulators are pushing banks to transfer more staff and submit more detailed plans for their European hubs to avoid them becoming little more than empty shells.
Standard Chartered was among the first of about 20 banks to formally apply for licenses to open bases or expand existing ones in the euro zone by March 2019.
The delay in the finalization of the move comes amid deepening scrutiny by the main European banking regulator to ensure lenders have a long-term plan to staff and structure their post-Brexit hubs.
The ECB, which supervises the main lenders in the euro zone and is a central player in setting conditions for the new bases, said last month it will prevent banks from creating token offices.
Banks will be particularly scrutinized as to whether work that is outsourced from European hubs to countries outside Europe still complies with local regulations within the trading bloc.
Standard Chartered has to that end created a dedicated ""outsourcing oversight officer"" role in Frankfurt, the spokeswoman said, whose duties will be to ensure that such overseas business activities are compliant with German and European rules.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) is asking smaller wireless operators that piggyback off its network to issue public statements or even write newspaper editorials to help persuade antitrust regulators to approve its proposed $26 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp (N:S). 
The merger, under review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice, would shrink the wireless market to three big players from four.
The FCC is collecting public comments and formal petitions to oppose the deal until Aug. 27. Reuters previously reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was soliciting opinions of the deal from so-called mobile virtual network operators.
Opponents of the merger argue it could raise prices for the wireless companies whose customers use T-Mobile and Sprint's networks.
One wireless operator that works with T-Mobile said it received an email with suggestions on how to support the deal. The company declined to be named because it has concerns about how it would be affected in the merger. 
The email from T-Mobile, seen by Reuters, suggested the company write an op-ed supportive of the deal or submit a letter of support to regulators. The email also offered talking points the company could use during media interviews, such as how the merger between the No. 3 and 4 U.S. carriers would help the build-out of a 5G network. 
John Marick, chief executive of Consumer Cellular, a wireless company that sells inexpensive phone plans and devices to people over the age of 50, said he received an email from T-Mobile asking if he was willing to submit a comment to the FCC. Consumer Cellular operates off of T-Mobile and AT&T's network.
Marick said he has not yet submitted a comment and is not opposed to doing so, adding he did not view the email as pressure to issue a comment.
While it is not unheard of for companies pursuing mergers to ask vendors or customers for support, there could be a small amount of coercion going on, given that some of the smaller wireless companies have direct relationships with T-Mobile, said James Cox, a Duke Law School professor who specializes in corporate and securities law.
T-Mobile, which is majority-owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), and Sprint, majority-owned by Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), declined to comment. Both companies have previously said they expect the deal to win regulatory approval.
Consumer Cellular and other smaller wireless companies operate by purchasing access to the four major U.S. carriers' networks at wholesale rates, and often market their phone plans to specific users, such as low-income groups or minorities. 
Earlier this month, a source told Reuters that U.S. antitrust enforcers are in the early stages of reviewing the merger and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs.
The Obama administration had previously taken actions to keep four wireless carriers in the United States to ensure enough competition.

T-Mobile and Sprint have argued, however, they need to combine to more quickly build a 5G network, as countries like China and South Korea are currently ahead of the United States in 5G investment.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 07:34AM ET</span>",PepsiCo puts fizz into healthy drinks with $3.2 billion SodaStream deal,"By Steven Scheer and Martinne Geller
JERUSALEM/LONDON (Reuters) - PepsiCo (O:PEP) will buy carbonated drink-machine maker SodaStream (TA:SODA) (O:SODA) for $3.2 billion as it battles Coca-Cola (N:KO) for an edge in the health-conscious beverage market. 
Founded in Britain in 1903, SodaStream was a coveted device in British kitchens in the 1970s and 80s, allowing people to create fizzy drinks by adding flavored syrups to carbonated tap water, but its popularity faded as bottled sodas became cheaper. 
The Israel-based company now markets itself as a sparkling water maker to appeal to younger and more health- and environmentally-conscious consumers, who do not drink much soda.
""With sugary carbonates and juices struggling and no turnaround in sight, mitigating the losses through newer and healthier products will be essential for PepsiCo,"" said Euromonitor International analyst Matthew Barry. 
Euromonitor says bottled water sales saw 6.2 percent compound annual growth in the five years to 2017, while carbonated soft drinks sales were flat. 
The deal announced on Monday may be the last for PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, who hands over to Ramon Laguarta later this year.
In 12 years as CEO, Nooyi sought to expand the company's offering of healthier food and drinks. It agreed to buy Bare Foods in May and KeVita drinks in late 2016.
PepsiCo will pay $144 per SodaStream share in cash, representing a 10.9 percent premium to Friday's closing price of SodaStream's U.S.-listed stock and a 32 percent premium to its 30-day average. The New York-based group will fund the deal with cash on hand.
SodaStream's U.S.-listed shares were up 10.5 percent in pre-market trading. 
PepsiCo said SodaStream complements its water business, which includes Aquafina and smaller brands Bubly and Lifewtr. The company is also experimenting with other non-bottled drinks, including Drinkfinity, which is sold in pods.
PepsiCo said the transaction, unanimously approved by the boards of both firms, was expected to close by January 2019. It said the purchase was another step in its bid to ""promoting health and wellness through environmentally friendly, cost-effective and fun-to-use beverage solutions.""
THREAT OR OPPORTUNITY? 
Speculation about PepsiCo or Coca-Cola buying Sodastream has bubbled for years. The company had marketed itself as a more environmentally friendly alternative to mainstream bottled drinks and therefore a threat to the giant producers. But the notion of creating soft drinks at home has had limited success. Over the years, many users have used Sodastream only for making fizzy water, without the flavored syrups it sells.
Coca-Cola and Keurig Green Mountain forged a partnership in 2015 to market a counter-top cold-drinks machine, but pulled the plug the following year after it failed to take off.
It remains to be seen what Keurig Dr Pepper (N:KDP) will do in the space. The company was created last month by the merger of Keurig Green Mountain, now owned by private investment firm JAB Holding, and  Dr Pepper Snapple . 
Adam Epstein, co-founder of Teleios Capital, a top-10 SodaStream shareholder, said the company's focus on its core product and disciplined approach had started to pay off in recent quarters with ""a rapidly growing installed base of loyal users and transformational improvement in operating performance"".
He said the deal ""represents an excellent outcome for all shareholders"". 
SodaStream's shares have jumped 85 percent this year after a 78 percent increase in 2017 and have moved to $130 from $16.31 at the end of 2015.
In second-quarter results issued earlier in August, SodaStream's revenue grew 31 percent, driven by growth in Germany, France, Canada and the United States, while net profit rose nearly 82 percent.
PepsiCo said its global distribution network would help SodaStream expand further.
The company was acquired by Israel's Soda-Club in 1998 before private equity group Fortissimo Capital bought a controlling stake in 2007. The company went public in 2010. 
SodaStream faced calls for a boycott several years ago over a factory it had in the West Bank, despite employing many Palestinians. It has since closed that factory and relocated to a much larger facility in southern Israel.

PepsiCo was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Centerview, while SodaStream was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Monday amid optimism over planned trade talks between the United States and China, while Turkey's lira fell after its credit ratings were downgraded and shots were fired outside the U.S. embassy in Ankara.
European shares opened higher, as investors hoped the U.S. and China might find a compromise to resolve their trade dispute. The pan-European STOXX was up 0.7 percent, with most markets across the continent gaining. 
The gains in Europe helped lift the MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, by 0.3 percent. The gauge has nearly recouped the losses from last week caused by the plunge in Turkey's currency.
China and the United States will hold lower-level trade talks this month, the two governments said last week. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that the talks would take place on Aug. 22 and 23. That's just before new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods take effect, along with retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on an equal amount of U.S. goods.
Asian stock markets seemed to welcome the news, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing nearly 1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 1.4 percent.
Shanghai blue chips rose over 1 percent and Japan's Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower. EMini futures for the S&P500 were up 0.2 percent.
Analysts gave a more lukewarm reception.
""Trade talks between the US and China are to be resumed this month, and traders are cautiously optimistic, but just because the meeting has been lined up doesn't mean anything will come of it,"" said David Madden, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
""Some traders view the (recent) weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency as a sign that Beijing will be more accommodating when it comes to negotiations.""
Turkey's lirafell nearly 1.8 percent, beyond 6 lira per dollar. 
Turkish sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Monday and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after Moody's and S&P Global lowered their sovereign credit ratings on Friday.
In addition, shots were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, compounding tensions between Turkey and the United States as a dispute over Turkey's detention of an American pastor simmered .
CENTRAL BANKS IN SPOTLIGHT
In a week without much economic data, investors turning their attention to central banks.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's August policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should show policy makers are upbeat on the economy and committed to further interest rate increases.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers meet at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Friday to discuss stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and lethargic productivity gains.
""The question is not only whether the Fed acknowledges the EM market volatility, but also the fact that its own policy signals are playing a part in the broader deterioration in global risk appetite,"" wrote ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in a note to clients.
The prospect of rising U.S. rates had been underpinning the dollar, though the currency took a knock on Friday as risk appetite improved a little.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Chinese investors protest in Shanghai's financial district over P2P woes,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors in Chinese online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform PPMiao protested at the offices of one of the company's shareholders in Shanghai's financial district on Monday, in the latest manifestation of problems facing the industry.
At least 243 P2P companies have collapsed in China since June, precipitating the withdrawal of funds from many firms in the industry and sparking protests by investors across the country.
About 300 investors in PPMiao crammed into the lobby of Shanghai's International Finance Centre (IFC) shopping mall, which also houses the office of HuaAn Future Asset that was registered as a shareholder in PPMiao's former operator, Hangzhou Fuqian Network Technology. 
PPMiao, which on its website says it has 4.9 billion yuan ($713 million) in funds and about 360,000 users, said in an Aug. 6 statement that it was unable to continue operating because investors were withdrawing funds and some firms it had lent money to had suspended payments.
It said it would return funds to investors over a 36-month period.
However, investors protesting at the IFC, some of whom were carrying small national flags, told Reuters they were worried they would not get their money back.
Many tried to enter HuaAn's offices but police told them to leave. Protesters said they then sent representatives to speak to the firm. 
Police for Lujiazui district, where IFC is located, declined to comment. 
One of the protesters, Cai Dandan, a 28-year-old hotel worker, told Reuters she had traveled to Shanghai from nearby Hangzhou in the hope of contacting HuaAn over her investment over about 450,000 yuan that she put in PPMiao.
""I was going to use the money to buy my marital home so it's as if my home is in the (PPMiao) platform. It's not just my money but my life,"" she said. 
HuaAn, whose shareholders include government-owned companies like Shanghai Electric Group and Shanghai Trust, said in a statement on Monday that it had registered as a stakeholder in Hangzhou Fuqian on behalf of a client and had never profited from the platform. 
However, it added that the relationship had ended in July and HuaAn was now cooperating with Hangzhou police.
A spokesman for HuaAn told Reuters the company was communicating with investors but declined to provide further details. 
PPMiao and Hangzhou Fuqian did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
P2P platforms gather funds from retail investors and lend to small corporate and individual borrowers, promising high returns. 
They started flourishing nearly unregulated in China in 2011. At a peak in 2015, there were about 3,500 such businesses.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 03:56AM ET</span>",Foreign casino operators go all in as they vie for Osaka license,"By Thomas Wilson and Mari Saito
OSAKA (Reuters) - In late July, a lavish fireworks display lit up Osaka's skies in the finale to one of Japan's most famous festivals, courtesy of a first-time sponsor: Macau casino operator Melco Resorts and Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO). 
The company's chief executive, 41-year-old billionaire Lawrence Ho, had only hours earlier met Osaka's governor after a donation for natural disaster preparation. 
Also in town was MGM Resorts International's (N:MGM) chief executive, Jim Murren. He didn't bring a donation - just the Blue Man Group to entertain around 100 guests on a chartered boat. 
The partying and pageantry were part of a concerted effort to convince Osaka who should operate one of Japan's first casino resorts. Just days before, the country authorized the initial three licenses.
Thanks to strong local political support, an available site and a supportive business community, the western Japanese metropolis of 2.7 million is widely expected to become the first major city to host a casino.
""Tokyo has not raised its hand, Yokohama has not raised its hand - Osaka has raised its hand,"" said Ed Bowers, MGM's executive vice president of global development. 
A huge new revenue stream is on the line for the casino operators, which also include Galaxy Entertainment Corp (BO:GALE),  Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR), Genting Singapore Ltd (SI:GENS) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS). An Osaka casino could generate $4 billion a year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says. 
For Osaka, which has seen its wealth and power fade in relation to Tokyo, gambling could boost tourism and bring in much-needed money. It hopes to open a resort by 2024, but even after it picks an operator it must win government approval. 
""I want to properly nurture the tourism industry in Osaka as one of its pillars,"" Osaka Governor Ichiro Matsui told Reuters in an interview. 
Interviews with dozens of casino executives, lobbyists and politicians depict sophisticated campaigns aimed at winning over a skeptical public, wooing local businesses and persuading officials.
And Osaka, eager to avoid even the appearance of corruption, has become more cautious in dealing with casino operators.
In July, the city reiterated a ban on officials' attending parties, sharing meals or receiving gifts. It also prohibits officials from meeting casino representatives alone. 
All told, at least eight major operators are courting Osaka. MGM, Sands and Melco have in recent years pledged to sink $10 billion into a resort. 
DREAM ISLAND
Osaka wants to build a casino on a man-made site called Yumeshima, or ""Dream Island."" 
Yumeshima was built during Osaka's 1970s boom times. Its bayside area was once a blue-collar district crowded with chemical factories and shipyards. But those companies moved production abroad.
The city was hit hard when Japan's bubble economy popped, and politicians have for two decades tried with little success to revive both the waterfront and Osaka.
Still, with a four-fold surge in foreign tourists over the last five years - more than 11 million people visited Osaka in 2017, attracted by its rich culinary culture and wealth of nearby sights - casino operators see a fertile market. 
""This is the greatest opportunity of my lifetime,"" Melco's Ho told Reuters by phone. 
Executives from 11 casino companies have met Governor Matsui for ""courtesy calls"" 25 times between 2012 and May 2018, prefectural records show. Operators and other related companies have met Osaka officials 119 times since May 2017. Osaka declined to provide breakdowns of meetings by company. 
HEARTS AND MINDS
Melco's most recent donation to Osaka, reported by local media to total about 50 million yen ($450,000), wasn't its first. Melco also gave money for victims of a June earthquake that killed four in Osaka, and for parts of western Japan devastated by flooding a month later.
The company declined to say how big those donations were; its fireworks sponsorship was worth about $9,000.
Ako Shiraogawa, Melco's Japan president, told Reuters she reassured local officials the donations were not meant to curry favor. It was a coincidence that Ho met Osaka's Matsui before the fireworks display, she said.
""It looks like we are doing too much,"" Shiraogawa said. ""But it just happened to be the same day as the festival."" 
Like its Macau rival, MGM is building a bigger presence in Osaka, including an office. It says it is trying to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the city's public and businesses.
Before the festival, for instance, it gave shoppers at a local arcade the chance to win tickets to its boat party. 
Behind the scenes, MGM has worked to connect with Osaka companies, said Kanji Hori, who runs the Hyakusha Kai association of small businesses, which is hoping for a stake in an operating consortium.
Tokyo-based GR Japan lobbies on behalf of MGM, Bowers told Reuters. GR Japan opened an Osaka office in February, hiring as associate director a former national lawmaker from Matsui's Ishin-no-Kai party. 
For its part, Las Vegas Sands says it has focused on engaging with local officials, businesses and community groups. Its chief executive, Sheldon Adelson, met Matsui in September.
Officials from Sands declined to be interviewed. 
SENSITIVE SUBJECT
In Osaka, 42 percent of residents are opposed to a casino over fears of gambling addiction and less than a fifth are in favor, a poll by public broadcaster NHK in March showed.
The city's government is trying to swing public opinion with seminars on dependency and a message of prosperity. A resort would create more than 80,000 jobs a year in the region, officials say.
But Teruo Sakurada, a professor at Osaka's Hannan University who heads an anti-casino group, said those positions would most likely be part-time and lower paid.
""They want tourism and foreign demand to drive the local economy, but this isn't a sustainable model,"" he said. 
Despite casino operators' enthusiasm in courting Osaka, there have so far been no major accusations of impropriety. 
The only incident approaching scandal: a PwC Consulting employee on a 377 million-yen contract to advise the city on casinos attended MGM's boat party, breaking no laws but earning a scolding from a local official. A PwC Japan spokeswoman said the incident did not violate its agreement.

""It's natural that we need to be fully open, and make sure that citizens have no doubts about unfairness or corruption,"" Matsui said. ""There's no doubt a lot of money will be involved and that it's going to be a big business.""

SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Larry Sloven arrived in southern China three decades ago, just as the region was taking off as the low-cost manufacturing center of the world. Since then, he has exported millions of dollars of goods, ranging from power tools to LED lights, to some of America's biggest retailers.
That era may now be coming to an end.
For years, Sloven has seen profits whittled away by rising costs, tighter regulations and Chinese government policies aimed at building a more sustainable and services-oriented economy that have squeezed lower-end manufacturers.
But the final straw may be the prospect of tariffs stemming from a trade war between the United States and China, and a world of more protectionism.
""It's been step, by step, by step. And it's been getting more and more expensive to produce products in China,"" said Sloven, president of Capstone International HK Ltd, a division of Capstone Companies, from Deerfield Beach, Florida, a maker of consumer electronics goods.
Manufacturers have been feeling the squeeze as China shifts its priorities from lower-end manufacturing to high technology industries as part of a broader bid to upgrade its economy.
But with tariffs looming, ""everybody finally woke up to the extent that 'maybe I should face reality',"" he said. Manufacturers were increasingly worried that ""the next group of tariffs would be the killer"".
Sloven is now stepping up efforts to trim his exposure to China, diversifying into growing manufacturing centers like Thailand.
""Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia are countries that have potential opportunities,"" he said. ""However, it's not going to be as easy as many may think. And you don't know what's coming next in China.""
Interviews with over a dozen manufacturers from medical device makers to agricultural equipment firms illustrate how companies exporting to the United States are now rethinking their calculations about making goods in China.
""Before the tariffs came on board, we were looking to move about 30 percent of our production from China to the United States,"" said Charles M. Hubbs, European director at Premier Guard, a medical products manufacturer, citing reasons such as rising wages, a shrinking workforce and soaring costs. 
""With the latest tariff development, assuming those tariffs will go into effect, we'll probably be moving about 60 percent of our manufacturing out of China to the United States.""
Other companies are closely reviewing their options. 
""In the current tariff environment, it's only natural for companies like ours and others to be internally reassessing the impact and taking steps to mitigate that,"" said a senior China-based executive with a major U.S. manufacturer. 
Moves could include ""limiting additional sourcing from China, shifting sourcing to other countries, or bringing work back to the United States"".
Mid-level officials from the two countries are set to hold trade talks this week in Washington, although the gap between the two sides over U.S. demands for greater market access remains wide.
SUPPLY CHAIN THREAT
The escalating tit-for-tat trade war between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese-made goods, could have huge implications for heavily integrated and globalized supply chains.
For some, the impact has been obvious and direct.
Georgia-based AGCO Corp (N:AGCO) told the United States Trade Representative that tariffs would make the farm equipment it makes in Changzhou, a city in China's Jiangsu province, ""price uncompetitive"" in the United States.
Maroon Group, a chemical maker from North America, said it would be ""priced out of the market"", a concern echoed by Goodman Global, a unit of Japan's Daikin Industries (T:6367) that assembles air conditioners in Houston from Chinese-made parts.
Some firms have already made their moves. The furniture makers  At Home Group Inc  (N:HOME) and RH (N:RH) have said they will cut back production in China.
Others are trying to adjust supply chains. DSM China Ltd, part of the Dutch nutrition firm Royal DSM, is looking to replace U.S. soybeans with new ingredients such as pea powder it can source locally to avoid Beijing's retaliatory import duties.
Rising risk from the trade tensions ""gave us good impetus to check out how we look at the whole business"", said Bernard Cheung, director of global strategic marketing at DSM China.
For some, the response has been dictated by where they sit in the supply chain.
U.S.-based GMM Nonstick Coatings has moved some production to India after a 30-40 percent drop-off in China orders for advanced chemicals used to coat American household kitchenware brands such as George Foreman and Baker's Secret as those clients move some production out of China.
""This tariff thing is adding extra friction to being in China and it's making the decision"" to shift production ""quite easy for U.S. sourcing departments,"" said Ravin Gandhi, GMM's chief executive.
$2 TRILLION QUESTION
There are still plenty of manufacturers staying in China for now, especially those targeting the huge domestic or regional market, Gandhi said.
China still has the best infrastructure, supply chain networks and engineering talent, a major hurdle for potential rivals seeking to lure firms away with lower costs, according executives interviewed by Reuters.
In terms of scale, China cannot be easily replaced: it has a manufacturing output of around $2 trillion, according to a Brookings Institution report in July, the world's largest. 
Bird, a Santa Monica, California-based scooter start-up, wrote in a submission to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in June that it was ""unaware of any U.S. producer of electric scooters that can manufacture to Bird's scale and needs"".
Keith Siilats, the head of Bytelogics, another U.S.-based scooter start-up that manufactures in China, said it was hard to shift production from China. Instead, he expects to absorb the higher costs for the moment and plans to develop European operations less vulnerable to tariff pressure.
China's manufacturing sector will not vanish overnight, but a shift is inevitable, said Dan Krassenstein, Shanghai-based director of Asia operations at ProconPacific, which makes around 3 million specialized industrial shipment bags.
He said manufacturing was moving to South Asia and Southeast Asia in search of cheaper labor costs and as Beijing discourages polluting, lower-margin sectors.
The tariff escalation ""is just going to accelerate it"", he said.
Five years ago his company made all its products in China. Now, a quarter are made in India and 5-10 percent in Vietnam.
DOING THE SUMS
In Southern China's Pearl River Delta, the cost of renting industrial and commercial space has surged around 80 percent in the past eight years, while companies have complained of soaring labor costs.
""Production costs are cheaper in the U.S. than in China,"" said Yuan Juyou, deputy head of marketing at Wonderful Group, a ceramics maker. ""Even though labor costs are more expensive, we have automated a lot of processes. Plus electricity, land, these kinds of costs are cheaper than China.""
Wonderful, a unit of the Chinese manufacturer Marco Polo, began shipping products from its new factory in Tennessee in June.
Regional rivals are also starting to sense an opportunity to step up and into China's competitive space. Thailand is actively promoting itself as a regional manufacturing hub, offering incentives such as an exemption of up to eight years on corporate income tax for certain industries and exemptions on import duties for some raw materials. 
The country's corporate income tax rate of 20 percent also ranks it as the second-lowest among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to Thailand's Board of Investment. 
Thailand is already a major center for some electronics and components, and the government plans a series of industrial zones to push development of target industries. 
A China-ASEAN free trade deal also helps mitigate the trade-war risk for companies trading with both the United States and China. 
""The Thai government is making it very easy now to move down there,"" said Sloven. 
""The Chinese government embraced manufacturing back in the day. But now, they're not looking for growth in the product business. They're looking for high-tech,"" he said. 

""It's a bit like when a wife comes to a husband and says, 'I don't love you anymore'.""

178,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. energy group Hess Corp's SE Asia assets attract bid interest - sources,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets of U.S. oil and gas producer  Hess Corp  (N:HES), estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion, have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand's PTTEP PCL (BK:PTTEP) and Austrian energy group OMV AG (VI:OMVV), people familiar with the matter said.
Hess, which has a collection of gas fields in North Malay Basin in offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) with 50 percent equal partner Petronas, has not yet decided whether to sell the assets, according to financial and industry sources.
Their estimated market value would be about $4 billion to $5 billion, the sources said. They declined to be identified because the takeover interest had not previously been made public.
The interest in Hess' assets, among the few long-term and sizeable projects in the region, comes as cashed-up firms such as PTTEP are buying overseas assets, while the likes of OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company have been scouring for acquisitions in Asia..
Hess, which hasn't reported a profit since 2014, has been under pressure from investors to make money. It posted a smaller-than-expected loss in April-June, but many of its peers have turned profitable after the oil price crash two years ago, fuelling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit.
The firm is developing large offshore oil projects in South America and U.S. shale oil. In 2014, it sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for $1 billion and also sold its Indonesian assets.
""We don't comment on rumours but we continue to believe that our Malaysia assets are an important part of our portfolio and our value creation strategy,"" Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker said in a statement.
""JDA and North Malay Basin are significant long-term, low-cost cash generators, producing stable production and free cash flows, which provide funding for our compelling, long-term opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken (in the United States).""
'TEAMS WORKING ON THIS'
""A number of parties have looked (at the Hess assets) and have teams working on this,"" said one financial source. ""Increasing numbers of companies believe a sale is probable,"" said the person, adding that Hess' project would also appeal to private-equity backed players and mid-sized energy firms.
He said PTTEP was working with a financial advisor for its interest in the assets.
Another source said some parties had done preliminary work on the assets and were waiting to see if Hess would start a sale process.
OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company declined to comment.
This month, OMV won regulatory approval to buy Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) upstream assets in New Zealand for $578 million. OMV said in March that the acquisition was a key step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with its new strategy.
Petronas declined comment while PTTEP said it was focused on expanding in Southeast Asia.
""PTTEP is interested in M&A deals with particular focus on assets located in PTTEP's region of experience such as South East Asia, which is PTTEP's areas of expertise and the operating risk is moderately low,"" the Thai company told Reuters, declining to comment specifically on Hess assets.
IMPROVING INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
The industry's prospects have brightened as oil (LCOc1) and natural gas prices have more than doubled since early 2016, with demand for oil in Asia - the world's biggest consumer - also growing strongly even as production is falling faster than anywhere else.
Hess' nine gas fields in the North Malay Basin have an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 20 million barrels of condensate. Production started in July 2017.
The company has a 50 percent working interest in the Southeast Asian blocks with Petronas Carigali, a fully-owned subsidiary of Petronas.
Hess signed a production-sharing contract with Petronas in 2012 and has a contract with the oil major till 2029.
""Hess is pursuing divestments globally, high grading its portfolio centered around its Guyana and U.S. Bakken (shale) interests,"" said Saul Kavonic, director of Asia/Pacific markets and head of energy research in Australia at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

179,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed as Markets Await Developments on Proposed Trump-Xi Traded Talks,"Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Monday as traders awaited developments on proposed trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.1% by 12:30AM ET (04:30 GMT) while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.0%.
Reports over the weekend said Trump and Xi may meet in November as trade tensions escalated in recent weeks. The reports came after the two governments announced on Thursday that lower-level trade talks would be held later this month to resolve intensifying trade disputes. A nine-member delegation from Beijing will hold meetings with U.S. officials later in the month, according to officials from both countries.
""This has given markets some reason for optimism that a de-escalation of Sino-US trade tensions is possible one side or other of November's US mid-term elections,"" Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at the National Australia Bank, said in a morning note.
Soren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller-Maersk, said the U.S. would get hit many times harder than other countries if a full-blown global trader war were to happen.
Skou said the fallout of the current protectionist wave “could easily end up being bigger in the U.S.”
“The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam, in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia,” Skou said at Maersk’s headquarters on Friday.
“Big U.S. consumer brands like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) produce in all of Asia, not just in one country, so there will be a substitution effect.”
The Trump administration imposed duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods in July as they accused China of unfair trade practices, adding that they will impose tariffs on a further $16 billion on Aug. 23.
Trump warned earlier that the U.S. may eventually target the entire $500 billion in Chinese exports to the U.S.
“The other factor is that there’s a lot of stuff that’s now imported into the U.S. that just isn’t produced anywhere within the U.S.,” Skou said. “You can’t get Nike sneakers or iPhones that are produced in the U.S. So it will end up being pushed on to the consumer.”
Meanwhile, Australa’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia is set to release minutes on Tuesday. Index heavyweight BHP Billiton Ltd (AX:BHP) is due to report earnings this week.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%, while South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.1% higher.
Looking ahead, Markets are likely to focus on the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium, while analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at its next meeting."
180,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2018 12:01AM ET</span>",Noble Group founder declines executive director role in restructured firm,"SINGAPORE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Embattled commodity trader Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG) said on Monday that its founder, Richard Elman, will not take up a previously announced position as an executive director in the restructured company, citing ""personal reasons"".
Once Asia's largest commodity trader, Noble has shrunk its business after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs. Its restructuring plan - crucial to its survival - gained ground last month when it won over a key shareholder with a sweetened equity offer.
The announcement of Elman's decision not to join the board was made in a statement to the Singapore Exchange. 
Elman is Noble's former chairman and controls nearly 18 percent of the equity in the current company. In April, he backed a proposed $3.5 billion debt-to-equity swap that would restructure the company after it improved the terms and announced a board seat for him in the new firm.
Elman's backing occurred less than a month after he resigned from Noble's board, citing ""amicable differences"" with the board and a group of senior creditors negotiating the restructuring.
The make-or-break vote on restructuring will take place on Aug. 27.

The company said it has already won support from 86 percent of its senior creditors and about 30 percent of its shareholders, including Elman, have committed to back the proposed restructuring.

181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Musk Defends Relentless Work Hours as Tesla Enters Fateful Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk sees no option but to keep working in his own personal Ludicrous mode, no matter the deepening concerns of board members and investors about his health and stability as he propels Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. toward a possible rebirth as a private company.
Only a few hours before sunrise in California on Sunday, Musk said he’d just gotten home from the electric-car factory where he has toiled -- and often slept -- for months to ramp up Model 3 sedan production. The chief executive officer rebutted a post from digital-media mogul Arianna Huffington, who had urged him to take time off lest he fall short of his ambitions to change the world. Sorry, said Musk: “It is not” an option.
Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 19, 2018
The exchange underscores Musk’s determination to lead Tesla through the turmoil that accelerated after his Aug. 7 tweet suggesting he’d secured funding to take the firm private at $420 a share. Rather than soaring toward that value, the stock has since plummeted 20 percent as parts of Musk’s story unravel and pressure mounts on Tesla’s board for its handling of the iconic CEO. Nothing will get easier this week as he and Tesla’s board align with their separate sets of legal and financial advisers, all amid inquiries from U.S. securities regulators.
On Sunday, the picture became even murkier. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund -- the very investor that Musk described as a linchpin of his plan to take Tesla private -- was reported by Reuters to consider buying a stake in another U.S. electric-car company. The Saudis’ Public Investment Fund, which recently bought an almost 5 percent stake in Tesla, was reported to be in talks for a separate $1 billion investment in Lucid Motors Inc. that would give the fund control of that fledgling automaker.
Representatives for Lucid and the Saudi fund couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on the Reuters report, which cited people familiar with the talks without identifying them.
While Tesla and Lucid aren’t at all one the same level -- Lucid has only shown electric-car prototypes, whereas Tesla produces thousands of cars a month -- the prospect of controlling Lucid may have appeal to the Saudis. Part of their goal is to diversify away from the oil industry.
Stock’s Gyrations
Tesla has marketed its top-of-the-line models that boast head-snapping acceleration as having “Insane” and “Ludicrous” modes. But features some consumers may want in an automobile aren’t necessarily sustainable in an automobile executive.
Tesla shares plummeted Friday by the most in two years, closing at $305.50, after the New York Times published an interview in which Musk described the past 12 months as “the most difficult and painful year of my career.” References to Ambien use and driving while tweeting are fueling calls for Tesla’s board to step up its oversight of the CEO, chairman and largest shareholder.
An open letter from Huffington, a board member at Uber Technologies Inc., to Musk accused him of “demonstrating a wildly outdated, anti-scientific and horribly inefficient way of using human energy.” She added in a tweet that the Tesla founder should change the way he works. In his interview with the Times, Musk said he sacrificed family milestones in the race to meet Tesla production targets.
Still, the Tesla CEO tweeted that Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Tesla are the only two American car companies to have avoided bankruptcy, and dismissed the idea that he was able to cut his workload.
Musk’s already chaotic world blew up again when he tweeted this month that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private.
He later said that meetings with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had given him confidence to announce the news. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent the company a subpoena regarding the statement.
Huffington’s attempted intervention comes at a time when she’s been campaigning in support of the benefits of sleep. Her description accompanying the open letter describes her as a “flat shoe advocate and sleep evangelist.”
Lucid Motors
It’s unlikely Musk has lost much sleep over concerns about Newark, California-based Lucid Motors, whose predecessor Atieva Inc. was founded in 2007 by Bernard Tse, a former Tesla executive and board member.
While its prototype Lucid Air sedan has been well-received, it’s unclear whether the company has the funding to get production going. Lucid’s website is taking refundable $2,500 deposits for the vehicles it plans to eventually sell.
Lucid first announced in November 2016 that it chose Arizona as the home for a $700 million manufacturing facility. But in April 2017, Chief Technology Officer Peter Rawlinson said the company didn’t have the money in place to start construction and needed to complete a fourth round of fundraising, known as Series D. In July 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Lucid had hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to raise more money and was considering an outright sale after exploring early-stage takeover talks with  Ford Motor Co  . Ford ultimately moved on."
182,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Global luxury brands again chase China's young, rich and spendthrift","By Farah Master and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada (HK:1913) to LVMH (PA:LVMH) are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows.
Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster.
The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said.
""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said on a call with analysts.
""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands.""
Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewelry and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say.
Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialization and urbanization. 
""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.
Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. 
TRADE WAR JITTERS
Chinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. 
Brands including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy.
The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said.
Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. 
Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC) has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. 
""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here.""
SMALLER CITY PUSH
To capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth.
Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's.
LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewelry brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September.
Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates.
""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus,  Kering  group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs.
""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said.
Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers.
Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year.
Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country.
Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 05:04PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi PIF in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid - sources,"By Dasha Afanasieva and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has said could help him fund a $72 billion deal to take his electric car maker private, is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The talks between privately-held Lucid Motors and PIF underscore the latter's appetite to invest in electric car makers to diversify the oil-rich Middle Eastern kingdom's investment portfolio. 
A deal with Lucid Motors would also be more in line with PIF's limited resources, given that, despite its $250 billion in assets, PIF has already made substantial commitments to other technology companies or investments, including a $45-billion agreement to invest in a giant technology fund led by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984). 
PIF and Lucid Motors have drawn up a term sheet under which PIF could invest more than $1 billion in Lucid Motors and obtain majority ownership, the sources said. PIF's first investment in Lucid Motors, however, would be for $500 million, and subsequent cash injections would come in two stages that are contingent on Lucid Motors hitting certain production milestones, one of the sources added.
The talks between PIF and Lucid Motors may not result in a deal, the sources cautioned. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. PIF and Lucid Motors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Musk, a 47-year-old investor and engineer, stunned financial markets earlier this month, when he revealed on Twitter he was considering a $420 per share take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan car. 
He added that funding was ""secured,"" and elaborated last Monday that he believed Saudi Arabia's PIF could provide the necessary funding, although sources close to the sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect. Earlier this year, PIF built a stake of just under 5 percent in Tesla by snapping up shares in the open market, rather than acquiring newly issued shares. 
Musk has also said he believes two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, rather than cash out, and that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for a deal.
Getting access to cheap capital is a constant challenge for automakers, which can spend $1 billion or more engineering a single new model and bringing it to mass production, only to have the vehicle flop because of a cyclical sales slump or a shift in market tastes.
Based on the edges of Silicon Valley in Newark, California, Lucid Motors was founded in 2007 as Atieva by Bernard Tse, a former Tesla vice president and board member, and Sam Weng, a former exec at  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Redback Networks. It received backing from Chinese investors, including tech entrepreneur Jia Yueting and state-owned automaker BAIC. Other venture capital backers have included Venrock, Mitsui & Co and Tsing Capital.
Lucid Motors is not yet selling any cars. In 2016, it unveiled a prototype of its Lucid Air model, a $100,000 luxury sedan it had hoped to begin building in Arizona in late 2018. It is not clear when this car will become available, though the company is accepting refundable deposits of $2,500 from consumers on its website.
Tesla is much more advanced as an electric car manufacturer, though investors are questioning how long can it go before turning a profit. It has been burning through cash as it has aggressively ramped up Model 3 production, a process Musk has called “production hell.” 

Analysts at UBS last week questioned the profitability of the Model 3, in a report that said Tesla could lose $6,000 on every base model.

190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Chinese Investors Can Help Cut Trade Deficit, Malaysia’s PM Says","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors can help reduce the country’s trade deficit with Malaysia, the Southeast Asian nation’s prime minister said in Beijing on Sunday at an event alongside  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Chairman Jack Ma.
During a question and answer session with Chinese executives who expressed concerns about investing in Malaysia given its recent change in power, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad insisted it still welcomed companies willing to do deals that help employ the country’s workers and improve its efficiency without harming local manufacturers in industries like steel production.
Malaysia wants to learn from Chinese manufacturers, Prime Minister Mahathir said, as he encouraged Chinese businesses to invest in his country. He welcomed investment in the paper industry, citing rising opposition to the use of plastics. Mahathir recently revived the Look East Policy from the 1980s, which sought to take Japan’s industrialization as a road map for the country’s development.
Mahathir said Malaysia borrowed money from China it could not repay and used it on unnecessary infrastructure. He has suspended billion-dollar infrastructure projects backed by Chinese state companies, and sought to renegotiate terms of the contracts if he can’t cancel them entirely for being too costly.
Following this, Ma was asked a question about Chinese counterfeiting by a Malaysian businesswoman who said her products had been affected. He responded by calling for ""harsh and firm"" measures to protect intellectual property by China’s government and companies, saying that Chinese innovation will never appear without this.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automaker Geely has agreed to extend its existing partnership with Proton Holdings Berhad (KL:DRBM) to upgrade the Malaysia carmaker's line-up of cars and power Proton go beyond Malaysia, part of an ongoing effort to help Proton establish a presence in China and other international markets.
In order to take Proton beyond Malaysia, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] said in a statement on Saturday it will allow Proton to tap its green-car technology, as well as basic vehicle platform technologies which Geely has developed jointly with its wholly owned unit Volvo Cars of Sweden. 
Using Geely's technology, the Malaysian firm wants to make and sell upgraded Proton cars in international markets, starting with China but also in other markets such as Indonesia, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak with reporters on details of the agreement.
""The signing of the agreement today will expand our relationship and take our cooperation to the next stage,"" Geely's founder and chief executive Li Shufu said in a speech on Saturday during a signing ceremony in Hangzhou, where Geely is headquartered.
Visiting Malaysian prime minister Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad also attended, in the middle of a five-day visit to China. He is slated to meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing as well as President Xi Jinping during his trip. 
ENTIRE SPECTRUM
As part of the next stage of cooperation, Proton will soon begin a feasibility study to enter the Chinese market. That would help Geely cover the entire spectrum of the world's biggest auto market, with Volvo as a premium brand, the Geely brand mid-market and Proton as a lower-cost entry brand, said the person with knowledge of the matter.
As Geely continues to upgrade its lineup of cars it is moving upmarket, he said.
The new agreement follows Geely's investment in Proton, sealed last year, which gave Geely a 49.9-percent stake in the Malaysia automaker owned by DRB-Hicom (KL:DRBM). Proton also controls British sports car maker Lotus.
Besides China and Indonesia, the person with knowledge of the matter said Proton is also looking at the possibility of entering other southeast Asian countries, as well as global markets with a similar line-up of new upgraded cars.

Geely's investment is intended to help Proton grow its sales overseas and recover some of the global presence it has lost in recent years. By offering some of its own technology, Geely has hopes it can also lift Proton sales in right hand-drive markets including Britain, India and Australia.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 11:13AM ET</span>",VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion exhaust emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.
Der Spiegel's story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor's office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors in a timely manner about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.
The Braunschweig prosecutor's office was not reachable for comment on Saturday.
Volkswagen's senior management, which has denied wrongdoing, is being investigated by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, to see whether the company violated disclosure rules.
U.S. regulators exposed VW’s cheating on Sept. 18, 2015.
Responding to the magazine report, the carmaker reiterated on Saturday that the management board had not violated its disclosure duties, and had decided to not inform investors earlier because they had failed to grasp the scope of the potential fines and penalties. 
Citing documents unsealed by the Braunschweig prosecutor's office, Der Spiegel said Diess was present at a meeting on July 27, 2015 when senior engineers and executives discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators, who were threatening to ban VW cars because of excessive pollution levels.
Diess, who was VW's brand chief at the time, became chief executive of Volkswagen Group in April this year. Volkswagen also owns the Scania, Skoda, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Ducati brands.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had found unusually high pollution levels in VW's vehicles and was threatening to withhold road certification for new cars until VW explained why pollution levels were too high.
Diess, who had defected from BMW to become head of the VW brand on July 1, 2015, joined the July 27 meeting with Volkswagen's then Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn to discuss how to convince regulators that VW's cars could be sold, a VW defense document filed with a court in Braunschweig in February, shows. 
Volkswagen on Saturday said both Winterkorn and Diess declined to comment given the ongoing proceedings. A spokesman for Martin Winterkorn declined to comment on Saturday. Winterkorn's lawyer Felix Doerr, could not be reached for comment.
Following this meeting, Winterkorn asked Diess whether BMW too had installed “defeat devices” in its cars, Der Spiegel said.
In the United States, legal engine management software is described as an ""auxiliary emissions device"" while the term “defeat device” is used to describe only illegal software.
Diess is said to have answered that BMW had not made use of such software, Der Spiegel said.
EVALUATE
Volkswagen said on Saturday: ""The contents of the discussion, where Martin Winterkorn and Herbert Diess were present, cannot be fully reconstructed, because the recollections of the people who were present partially deviate."" 
Volkswagen further said it was the task of authorities and courts to evaluate the conflicting statements and to assess whether individual witnesses were credible. 
Diess and Winterkorn left the July 27 meeting taking a presentation with them, Der Spiegel further said. 
A VW employee intervened and cautioned the managers that it would be better if they were not in possession of the presentation, Der Spiegel said. 
Volkswagen said on Saturday the purpose of the July 27 meeting was not to discuss whether Volkswagen had broken U.S. law, but how to resolve the issue of whether new models would be given regulatory clearance. 
Volkswagen argued that it had struggled to understand whether its software was in fact illegal, the defense document filed with the Braunschweig court shows.
On July 31, 2015 Volkswagen hired a law firm to help the company understand its regulatory troubles, and lawyers were unsure whether the software would be deemed an illegal “defeat device” in the United States, VW said in the court filing.
The court filing further said that Hans Dieter Poetsch, Volkswagen's finance chief at the time, on Sept. 14, 2015 believed the potential financial risk from regulatory penalties tied to emissions would be around 150 million euros ($172 million).
Hans Dieter Poetsch is now Volkswagen's chairman.
Volkswagen on Saturday reiterated that it had not violated disclosure rules and had informed investors in a timely manner about the financial scope of the scandal when it published an ""ad hoc"" disclosure notice on Sept. 22, 2015.
Volkswagen said that although it had admitted to using defeat devices to regulators on Sept. 3, 2015 it had assumed that penalties would not exceed 200 million euros, based on the size of fines imposed against rival carmakers who had committed similar regulatory breaches.

Because the company had already accrued sufficient provisions for vehicle recalls to cover this amount, there was no need to inform investors that profits could take a further hit before September 2015, Volkswagen's court filing said.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2018 03:02AM ET</span>",Chinese internet stock sell-off may shake faith in FANGs,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A steep downturn in heavyweight Chinese internet stocks and recent weakness in half of the so-called FANG group have some investors worried that a key component of Wall Street's near-decade long rally may be low on fuel.
Outstanding gains in Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) have underpinned much of the U.S. stock market's rally in recent years, along with the broader tech sector, but the group is widely viewed as overbought and valuations remain expensive.
Backed up by strong earnings growth and investor confidence in Silicon Valley's innovation track record, the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) is up 16 percent in 2018, making tech Wall Street's top performer.
But a recent slump in China's own superstar technology stocks, brought into sharper focus after Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) reported its first profit drop in almost 13 years on Wednesday, has increased worries about Wall Street dependence on a handful top-shelf growth companies.
Shares of Tencent, China's largest social media and gaming company, have fallen over 6 percent in the past two days and are down by nearly a third from their record high close in January.
""Tencent is a good proxy for global growth and risk. Nowadays, with everything being so momentum driven in the market, if one thing goes, everything can go,"" said Wedbush Securities senior trader Joel Kulina.
Also unnerving tech investors: Netflix and Facebook, which along with Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet make up the FANG stocks, have fallen sharply since their June-quarter reports. 
With Netflix down 22 percent from its record high close in early July, and Facebook down 19 percent since July 25 due to fallout from privacy scandals, some investors are questioning whether ""FANG"" may be turning into ""AG"". Even with those worries, investors continue to make the group a centerpiece of their portfolios.
Amazon has surged over 60 percent in 2018 and on Tuesday closed at a record high. Alphabet is up 17 percent year to date.
""FANG will continue to play a huge role over the next two to three years,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""They're expensive, but you have to hold your nose and buy them.""
The S&P 500 in recent days has struggled just short of its January record high and is up 6 percent year to date. 
Even after recovering from a steep sell-off in February, the S&P 500 is trading at a relatively inexpensive 16.5 times expected earnings, compared to 18.6 times earnings in January, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 500 technology index is trading at 18.7 times earnings, compared to its high-point of 19.6 in late January. 
The FANG stocks, plus Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Chinese stocks Baidu,  Alibaba  and Tencent, in August were the most crowded trade on Wall Street for the seventh straight month, according to survey of fund managers by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). 
In crowded trades, most investors share the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile sell-off if sentiment changes.
Shares of U.S.-listed Chinese technology companies in recent years have been caught up Wall Street's tech rally, but changes in their prices can also reflect the outlook for China's economy and government regulation.
With China investors also worried about potential fallout from a trade war between Beijing and Washington, Chinese internet heavyweights Baidu (O:BIDU) and Alibaba (N:BABA) have fallen 11 percent and 7 percent since the end of June, respectively. U.S.-listed shares of Baidu and Alibaba both rose more than 1 percent on Thursday following selling earlier in the week. 
Facing losses on China tech trades, global investment funds that own those stocks may be tempted to sell some of their U.S. tech stocks to lock in profits. 
""Over time, the breadth of the market tends to narrow, you have smaller leadership groups and once they begin to roll over, which perhaps Tencent is telling us is about to happen, then the broader markets have more of a reason to sell off,"" said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.

Amazon recently traded at 87 times expected earnings, its lowest in over a year. But many investors focus on the Internet retailer and cloud infrastructure company's explosive revenue growth. By that measure, Amazon appears expensive, at 3.5 times expected revenue, its highest level ever, according to Thomson Reuters data.

In an email sent to some beauty suppliers on Aug. 7, seen by Reuters, the retailer asks if they have facilities outside China, and if not, whether they would consider investing in them, to broaden their sourcing ability.
Many cosmetics products like shampoos, lipsticks and makeup fall under the most recent list of proposed levies on Chinese goods. 
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove did not comment on the letter. He directed Reuters to Chief Financial Officer Brett Bigg's statement on the trade tariff issue when Walmart announced quarterly results on Thursday.
Biggs told Reuters the potential impact of tariffs is difficult to quantify. He also said that one of the mitigation strategies for the retailer is understanding what suppliers' plans and alternatives are for sourcing. 
""We are closely monitoring the tariff discussions and are actively working on mitigation strategies, particularly in light of potentially escalating duties,"" he said. 

Bloomberg reported Walmart's request earlier on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund's board of trustees voted on Friday to phase out investments in companies that run private prisons or immigrant detention centers, saying the businesses have an outsized negative impact on minorities and the poor.
The $10.8 billion public pension fund's investment managers have been directed to liquidate holdings of the companies ""as soon as reasonably practical,"" the statement said.
The fund did not identify the prison and detention center companies whose stock they own. 
""We know these institutions disproportionately incarcerate people of color and those who live below the poverty line, house immigrant children and perpetuate the separation of immigrant families,"" Fund President Jay C. Rehak said. 
The companies also ""take advantage of and put at risk unprotected, low-wage employees, while lacking fiscal and operational transparency,"" Rehak said. 
The Chicago public school teachers pension fund follows in the footsteps of New York City pension funds, which last year became the first to divest fully from the private prison industry. The California State Teachers Retirement System is also evaluating its holdings of private correctional facilities.
The vote comes days after the American Federation of Teachers, which is among the nation's largest teachers unions, urged pension funds to cut their exposure to investment firms that have funneled millions of dollars into private prisons. 

The group criticized the firms and said they were getting rich on the U.S. government's practice of separating migrant families.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York lawyer was sentenced to 18 months prison on Friday for helping Martin Shkreli, currently serving a seven year prison sentence after being convicted of related charges, defraud a drug company that Shkreli had founded.
Evan Greebel, who was outside counsel to Shkreli's former company Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX), was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn. His lawyers had asked that he be given no jail time, while prosecutors had asked for five years.
The judge also ordered Greebel to pay about $10.4 million in restitution to Retrophin.
Matsumoto said she had considered that the sentence would be a hardship for Greebel's three children and for his wife, who recently lost her brother. However, she said a prison sentence was necessary to punish Greebel's ""extremely serious"" conduct and deter other lawyers from aiding clients in committing crimes.
Before being sentenced, Greebel apologized to his family and said he felt ""shame and sense of loss"" since his arrest in December 2015.
""I will regret, every day of my life, the day I met Martin Shkreli,"" Greebel said.
Reed Brodsky, Greebel's lawyer, said he planned to appeal.
Greebel was found guilty by a jury in December. A different jury in August 2017 found Shkreli guilty of defrauding hedge fund investors, but not guilty of conspiring with Greebel to steal from Retrophin.
Greebel, 45, was a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman when he was working for Retrophin. He later joined the firm Kaye Scholer, but resigned after his arrest.
Shkreli, 35, became notorious in 2015 when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The price hike is unrelated to the criminal case.
The charges he and Greebel faced related to Shkreli's management of his previous drug company, Retrophin, and of two hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, from 2009 to 2014.
Prosecutors said Shkreli lied about the funds' finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses. They said he paid investors back with money and shares stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.
Prosecutors said Greebel assisted Shkreli in defrauding Retrophin through a series of settlement and sham consulting agreements.

Greebel was also convicted of conspiring with Shkreli to exercise secret control over Retrophin shares belonging to several other shareholders. Shkreli was found guilty of that charge during his trial.

Thyssenkrupp's conglomerate structure has been heavily criticized by some shareholders who argue that a more focused set-up would unlock value, stoking fears among workers that the company could be broken up.
""Of course we are prepared to help shape changes. For us no organizational structure is sacrosanct,"" Grolms told Focus magazine in an interview. ""Over the past seven years, the group - with the approval of the labor side - has sold a dozen enterprises with about 70,000 employees.""
""What matters to me is whether something like that makes economic sense and can be realized in a way that is fair to employees,"" said Grolms. ""We are opposed to the logic of exploitation, which implies the sale of valuable parts to fund a special dividend for shareholders.""
Grolms, of trade union IG Metall, is heading Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board until a permanent successor can be found for former Chairman Ulrich Lehner, who resigned in July over what he said was insufficient backing from the committee.
Grolms, who Focus said moved into Lehner's office at the start of August, said there was a high level of uncertainty among workers in light of the current crisis, which also included the resignation of CEO Heinrich Hiesinger and a profit warning.
Shareholders Cevian and Elliott have been impatient for change and want more radical restructuring of the elevators-to-submarines group.
The nomination committee of the company's supervisory board is currently working on finding a successor to Lehner.
Grolms is not a member of the committee but he said the issue was still keeping him occupied around the clock: ""We are preparing ourselves for a debate about the company's strategy.""
Grolms said any candidate should be able to live with the fact that Thyssenkrupp is a company whose different owners have their own ideas about its future and whose employees, too, have justified claims.

""If I could make a wish I would appoint a person who can skillfully draw these threads together,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average extending gains and the Nasdaq turning positive on reports of progress in tariff disputes between the United States and its trading partners China and Mexico.
Chinese and U.S. negotiators are planning talks to resolve their trade row ahead of meetings in November, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Additionally, Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said he hopes to wrap up outstanding bilateral issues on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by the middle of next week.
""The threat of a trade war threatens economic activity,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""The fact that the administration might resolve (trade disputes) sooner rather than later, without a sustained time frame of slower economic actively due to tariffs, that bodes well for the market."" 
Trade-vulnerable industrial stocks led advances by the S&P 500 and the Dow, with the S&P 500 industrial sector gaining 0.6 percent. The sector was led higher by a 2.3 percent rise in  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) shares.
For the week, the S&P and the Dow posted weekly gains, but the Nasdaq showed a loss for the same period. 
Following bleak forecasts, shares of  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) and Applied Materials Inc (O:AMAT) fell 4.9 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, pushing the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) 0.7 percent lower.

214,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 04:32PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Walmart Leads on Retail Earnings; Chips See Weakness
The earnings calendar began to lighten up this week, but there were still enough major reports to move the market, especially in the retail sector.
The broader market tends to perform well if retail is humming along, as consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported quarterly earnings that topped consensus and raised its full-year earnings guidance.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) lifted its full-year guidance for both revenue and same-store sales. But Macy’s (NYSE:M) shares struggled on margin concerns.
Chip stocks were hit by a double dose of weak guidance after the bell Thursday. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) issued softer-than-expected guidance. And Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) forecast weaker-than-expected earnings per share.
On the positive side in tech, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) beat on both the top and bottom lines and the company forecast better-than-expected numbers for its fiscal first quarter.
2. U.S. and China Going Back to the Table on Trade
Talks of trade rapprochement between the U.S. and China helped ease the nagging tariff tensions in stocks.
China said it will hold a fresh round of trade talks with the U.S. in Washington later this month, offering a glimmer of hope for progress in resolving a conflict that has set world markets on edge.
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet with U.S. representatives led by Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website.
The upcoming meeting, which is lower-level compared with four previous rounds of talks, comes at the invitation of the U.S., according to the statement.
3. Turkish Lira Roller Coaster Continues
The Turkish lira took currency traders on another wild ride this week, keeping bank stocks, especially in Europe, on the back foot.
The struggling currency sank to an all-time low of 7.2393 on Monday amid growing concern over a deepening diplomatic rift with the United States over Ankara's detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in 2016.
It found its footing Tuesday, after the country's central bank pledged to provide liquidity in response to the meltdown.
On Friday, Turkey remained in the spotlight as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s announced that the U.S. is prepared to slap Turkey with more sanctions if its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses the quick release of Brunson.
The Turkish lira has lost almost 50% of its value this year, largely over worries about Erdogan's growing influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates in the face of high inflation and worsening ties with the U.S.
4. Economic Numbers Lack Clear Direction
Wall Street dealt with mixed economic data over the week.
On Friday, the University of Michigan reported a drop in its preliminary measure of August consumer sentiment, which surprised the market. The measure of 95.3 was down from July. Economists were looking for a rise to 98.1.
But July retail sales, and core retail sales, which exclude autos, came in above expectations.
Housing data was mixed. Housing starts for July rose less than economists anticipated. But building permits, an indicator of future demand, were stronger than forecasts for the month.
And the Philadelphia Fed index fell sharply to the lowest reading since November 2016.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its manufacturing index fell by 14 points to 11.9 from 25.7 in July. The consensus forecast had been for a reading of 21.9.
5. Gold Falls Sharply for the Week; Copper in a Bear Market
Gold prices were on track for their biggest weekly loss since April 2017, as worries about demand from China and contagion from Turkey’s currency crisis. And copper fell into bear-market territory during the week.
Gold was also hit by strength in the dollar, as a stronger greenback makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
In China, data showed fixed-asset investment rose less than anticipated, as did factory output.
Copper prices sank on indications of China weakness and were hit by easing supply concerns. BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) and the union at the world’s biggest mine in Chile agreed to put a new wage offer to a vote by workers, potentially saving the industry from a strike that threatened to disrupt supply at a time of shrinking stockpiles."

219,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Musk's tunnel-boring firm seeks U.S. tariff exemption for Chinese parts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A company owned by Elon Musk that is trying to lower the cost of building high-speed transit tunnels has asked the Trump administration to exempt it from tariffs for some Chinese-made tunnel boring machine components, warning the tariffs could significantly delay a planned tunnel between New York and Washington.
In a July 31 letter posted last week on a government website, the Boring Co asked the U.S. Trade Representative to exempt parts like cutterheads, screw conveyors and related machinery. Boring seeks ""limited parts from China in the near-term for use in a small number of tunnel boring machines."" The letter added those parts are ""readily available only from China.""
Privately held Boring added that it is ""working to develop and manufacture our own tunnel boring machines"" and wants to ""restore the now-dormant American tunnel boring machine industry.""
The company said for planned tunnels, including a project between Washington and Baltimore, it will ""use machines that are majority-composed of U.S. content.""
The tariffs could cause ""severe economic harm"" to the company and U.S. interests and could result in a delay of one to two years in the construction of a proposed Washington-to-Baltimore tunnel that it plans to eventually extend to New York.
Exempting the parts will not harm U.S. industry, the company said, and noted that tunneling is not one of 10 sectors identified in China's ""Made in 2025"" plan. The company said its business model is ""predicated upon substantially reducing the cost of tunneling.""
Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), in June proposed building a $1 billion underground transit system in Chicago. The plan would send people from Chicago’s downtown Loop district to O’Hare International Airport at 150 miles (241 km) per hour.
The Boring Co has been promoting its plans for tunnels that would allow high-speed travel between cities. The company initially plans to ferry passengers between Washington and Baltimore on autonomous electric vehicles carrying 8 to 16 passengers at 125-150 miles per hour, but would not use tracks or railway equipment.
On Wednesday, the company proposed to build a 3.6-mile tunnel between Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and the city's subway system.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office and Boring did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Boring said in an earlier letter it was converting from diesel-powered to electric-powered construction equipment and had innovated in ""concrete mixing, segment production, excavation and hauling practices.""

Other companies including General Motors Co (N:GM) have sought exemptions from new U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Tesla stock sinks after Musk gives tearful NYT interview,"By Noel Randewich and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) shares slumped 9 percent on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told the New York Times he was under major emotional stress and was preparing for ""extreme torture"" from short sellers.
Tesla stock was on track for its biggest daily slump in two years as Wall Street questioned Musk's ability to lead the electric car maker. Investors also were worried about reports that regulators were pressuring Tesla's directors for details about how much information he shared with them.
Musk stunned markets last week with a tweet that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share and that he had secured funding. The SEC has opened an inquiry related to his tweets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The Times reported that efforts were underway to find a No. 2 executive to take pressure off Musk, who has struggled with production issues for Tesla's key Model 3 sedan and has been criticized for behaving erratically on Twitter.
""This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career. It was excruciating,"" Musk said in the hour-long interview, in which he reportedly choked up more than once.
Musk also said he had no plans to relinquish his dual role as chairman and CEO. He said he was girding for ""at least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla’s destruction.”
With $11 billion worth of shares sold short, Tesla is the most shorted U.S. company, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. On Twitter, Musk has frequently complained about short sellers and taunted them.
""If your plan is to take this company private, out of the public eye and the regulatory eye of the SEC, then people who have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors have to feel comfortable about the situation, and the New York Times article makes that harder,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
The day's drop in Tesla's stock shaved $5 billion off its market capitalization, but still left it about $1 billion above General Motors' (N:GM) $51 billion stock market value.
Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash as it has aggressively ramped up Model 3 production, a process Musk has called ""production hell"". Tesla bulls are counting on Musk to exponentially raise production, leading to long-term profits.
“Everyone is reacting to the interview that Musk gave, where it seemed like he was an exhausted, frustrated individual,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, which does not own Tesla shares. “There is concern about the long-term strength of the company, perhaps even its viability if he’s not able to be a strong leader.”
Analysts at UBS this week questioned the profitability the Model 3, in a report that said Tesla could lose $6,000 on every base model.

The brokerage said the carmaker's premium Model 3 sedan will also not produce better profit margins than a conventional BMW (DE:BMWG).

222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: ValueAct invests $800 million in financial stocks in second quarter - letter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management boosted investments in financial stocks by more than $800 million during the second quarter, citing attractive risk-adjusted values of big banks, according to a client letter viewed by Reuters.
Financial companies, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), now make up 35 percent of ValueAct's portfolio and additional investment could follow, the firm said. 
""The large money center banks are safer investments than they have ever been in our lifetimes,"" the letter said, calling bank stocks ""irrationally cheap.""
If bank stocks fall during a correction in the near term, it would be a ""golden opportunity"" to invest more, ValueAct said.
A ValueAct spokeswoman declined to comment.
Since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, big U.S. banks have padded their balance sheets with increased capital and reduced leverage. They also have had to comply with a sweeping set of rules intended to make the system sounder. 
The top 35 U.S. banks alone have added about $800 billion in common equity capital since the start of 2009, according to the Federal Reserve.
ValueAct announced in May that it had made a roughly $1.2 billion bet on Citigroup, citing the bank's low risk and reliable revenue as attractive.
The San Francisco-based firm also has investments in card services provider  Alliance Data Systems  Corp (N:ADS), student loan company SLM Corp (O:SLM) and Morgan Stanley, in which it disclosed a roughly $1.1 billion stake exactly two years ago. 
ValueAct raised its stake in Citigroup by 55 percent and owned 25.2 million common shares at the end of June, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. The firm also bought 30.2 million shares of SLM, the parent company of Sallie Mae, the regulatory filing shows.
ValueAct generated a 7.6 percent return in the first six months of the year, according to its letter, handily beating the average hedge fund's 0.79 percent return.
ValueAct, which manages $16 billion in client funds, tries to distinguish itself from other activist investors by staying behind the scenes at companies whose shares it owns. 
It can take years for its investments to work out, though they often do: ValueAct has returned a net 14.8 percent, on average, per year over its 18-year lifetime.
Its second-quarter gains of 6 percent were fueled by media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA), British engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) and private equity giant KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR).
ValueAct also wrote in greater detail about two foreign investments: U.K. company Merlin Entertainment (L:MERL) , which owns Legoland, and Japanese medical equipment and camera maker Olympus Corp (T:7733).
Olympus is far less expensive than peers like  Medtronic  PLC (N:MDT), Boston Scientific Corp (N:BSX) and  Stryker  Corp (N:SYK), ValueAct said, noting that it is still recognized as a camera-maker rather than a producer a range of products, including medical devices.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3) has agreed to sell its U.S. subsidiary, a key McDonald's supplier, to  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) for $2.5 billion, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Marfrig shares rose as much as 8 percent but reversed gains and were down 7.3 percent at 6.38 reais as investors reassessed the price of the deal. Tyson rose 1.2 percent to $61.71.
In a note to clients, Itaú BBA's equities team said the news is ""negative for the stock,"" as the market hoped for a higher valuation of up to $3 billion, for chicken processor Keystone Foods. The bank kept its ""underperform"" rating on Marfrig.
Marfrig's controlling shareholder Chairman Marcos Molina, who owns around 35 percent of the meatpacker, agreed on Thursday to sell Keystone, a major chicken products supplier to McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) for $2.5 billion, according to the sources. 
They asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 
One of the sources said Marfrig may announce the deal as soon as Friday after the market closes. Some small details related to the deal, such as potential spin off of some small assets from Keystone, is delaying a final agreement. 
Newspaper Valor Economico reported the deal on its website earlier Friday.
Tyson and Marfrig declined to comment.
Marfrig Chief Financial Officer Eduardo Miron told journalists on Thursday that the company ""can close the deal any moment.""

Tyson entered exclusive talks to acquire Keystone in late July.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:21PM ET</span>",Kill quarterly reporting? Some investors ring alarm bells,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less reporting by U.S. corporations could put shareholders in the dark, allow companies to drift off course and even make U.S. stocks less attractive and create less public company investment, some investors and analysts argue.
U.S. President Donald Trump's move to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to study allowing companies to file reports every six months instead of every three alarmed financial professionals who are used to getting detailed reports from companies every 90 days.
""Cut reporting frequency in half and you invite mischief and remove an established discipline,"" said David Kotok, Chairman & Chief Investment Officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. 
Half-yearly reporting would mark a huge change in U.S. disclosure requirements and put it in line with European Union and United Kingdom rules. That could be damaging and a step backwards, inviting bad behavior, said some investors.
Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd in London, said it would be a ""recipe to create the biggest loophole in the financial system."" 
It could mean that companies' bad decisions take longer to be detected. 
""If the ocean liner starts to veers off course, you can get ahead of that earlier on and see that,"" said Michael Purves, Chief Global Strategist at Weeden & Co. ""An ocean liner can move more in 6 months, and less in three months."" 
The loss of transparency would be a blow to investors, some said, and have a knock-on impact on investment in public markets. 
""I am very confident that less reporting will lead to less public company investment,"" said David Tawil, who runs hedge fund Maglan Capital. ""More capital will be channeled to private equity and less-liquid investments. The retail investor will suffer.""
Short-seller Carson Block, founder of research firm Muddy Waters LLC, who exposed accounting problems and wrongdoing at a slew of Chinese companies, said, ""Investors - whether short or long - are always better off having more data, rather than less."" 
Securities analysts also said reducing the number of times companies file financial reports would frustrate them. 
""Reporting on a semi-annual basis would reduce transparency for analysts and more importantly for investors,"" said longtime analyst Richard Repetto, who covers exchanges. 
However, in the absence of information provided by companies, the meetings analysts set up with management teams and the reports they produce could fill the void. 
Investors argue that one reason U.S. stocks trade at a premium to equities elsewhere is due to greater financial reporting requirements. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) is trading at 16.7 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared to 14 times for Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX), according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
""Reducing the frequency of reporting might produce better-run companies, but companies that trade at lower multiples,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin.
To be sure, some investors said the standards could help companies operate better because management could avoid overly focusing on the near-term.
“There’s long been a push for less 'short-termism' in running publicly-traded companies,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR in New York. ""Do you run a company in a more efficient manner if you’re not thinking about having to talk about your results every 90 days?""
Less reporting could also result in lower market volatility, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), because the most volatile times of the year are around quarterly earnings periods.
But that comes with its own drawback.

""You're more likely to surprise investors when you're reporting just twice a year,"" said Stan Shipley, market strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.

225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Tesla Heads for Worst Week Since 2016 as Musk Sows Fresh Doubts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. plunged Friday, heading for their worst week since 2016, after Elon Musk told the New York Times that no one saw or reviewed his tweet about the plan to take the company private before he posted it.
Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and chairman, told the Times that he typed the take-private tweet as he drove himself to the airport on Aug. 7. The tweet said: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” The billionaire frequently teared up in an interview and discussed the personal strain of leading the electric-car maker, the newspaper said.
The stock was nowhere near that price on Friday as it tumbled as much as 9.2 percent, the most since March in intraday trading, pushing the shares close to $300. The fourth straight day of declines has wiped out Tesla’s year-to-date gains and pushed the shares down 14 percent this week alone.
In an hourlong sit-down with the newspaper, Musk also detailed his frequent use of the sleep-aid Ambien -- a drug he’s discussed using before, and whose well-known side effects include sleepwalking. “It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,” he told the newspaper.
Rather than put him to sleep, the drug has sometimes led Musk to spend his nights on Twitter, worrying some board members, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the board’s thinking.
Mounting Scrutiny
The going-private tweet has set off a firestorm, causing the stock to jump but also prompting mounting scrutiny, including a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
Almost a week later, the CEO said the basis for that statement were conversations with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which first expressed interest in helping take the company private in early 2017. Tesla’s board has since clarified that it hasn’t received a formal proposal from Musk, nor has it concluded whether going private would be advisable or feasible. This week, Musk was said to have received a subpoena for more information, according to a person familiar with the matter.
One funding possibility being considered for the potential privatization is for Musk’s rocket company SpaceX to help bankroll the deal and take a stake in Tesla, the New York Times said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Efforts are also under way to recruit an executive to take some pressure off Musk, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the search. A couple of years ago, Tesla approached  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). executive Sheryl Sandberg about the job, Musk told the newspaper, but added that no active search is taking place currently “to the best of my knowledge.”
“If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know,” Musk told the Times. “They can have the job.”
Factory Progress
Despite the frenzy over Tesla’s future, production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan -- which has frequently kept Musk at the Fremont factory overnight -- is defying the odds and going well, according to Evercore ISI analysts. Output is well on track for weekly production goals, and set for a significant boost, the analysts wrote Thursday after touring the plant. Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker also shows significant improvement this month.Click here to see how many Model 3s Tesla is making at its Fremont plant
Musk told the newspaper that he didn’t recall communications from the board at all and that he “definitely did not get calls from irate directors.” He later amended the comment through a spokeswoman, saying lead independent director Antonio Gracias had contacted him about the Aug. 7 tweet. Musk agreed not to tweet again on the possible privatization without discussing it with the board, the spokeswoman said.

The order was obtained by London law firm Withers, which applied for the freezing order on behalf of investors who say they lost money on their investments when Promsvyazbank, formerly owned by the Ananyev brothers, was nationalized by Russia in 2017.
""The investor group agreed to exchange around $11m (in) deposits in Promsvyazbank for fixed-rate notes which were claimed to be 'safe investments' and offer a higher rate of return,"" Withers said in a statement, adding that nationalization made the notes worthless.
Dmitry Ananyev and Vozrozhdenie could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. 
Russia's second-largest lender VTB (MM:VTBR) said this week that it had agreed to buy a controlling stake in Vozrozhdenie..
VTB said on Friday it was ready to purchase Vozrozhdenie only if the sale was free of legal consequences, the Interfax news agency reported.
Vozrozhdenie, one of Russia's top 40 largest banks by assets, was put up for sale by the Ananyev brothers at the central bank's request after their main asset, Promsvyazbank, was bailed out.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Investors query funding costs at a private Tesla,"By Carl O'Donnell and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Several Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shareholders have told Reuters they are concerned that the electric car maker will have to pay more to fund its growth if it becomes a private company and loses the ability to sell new shares to stock market investors. 
The issue has come to the fore as a special Tesla board committee considers Chief Executive Elon Musk's idea of taking the loss-making company private in a deal that could be worth as much as $72 billion. 
Tesla, whose bonds are rated ""junk"" by credit rating agencies due to its $11 billion debt pile and its negative cash flow, has tapped the stock market six times in the last eight years through share sales, raising nearly $4.3 billion, according to data from Dealogic. 
Without that ready access to capital, Tesla investors who would consider keeping their stake in a private Tesla - as Musk has suggested - wonder how Tesla would fund itself as a private company.
""It ultimately comes down to if you can afford to be private and if you can get funding, and what the cost of that funding is,"" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer for Personal Capital Advisors Corp, a Tesla shareholder which owned about 97,000 shares as of June 30.
Musk shocked investors last week with a tweet that he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share and that funding was ""secured.""
He elaborated on Monday that he believed Saudi Arabia's PIF, a new shareholder in Tesla, could provide the necessary funding, although sources close to the sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect. 
The 47-year-old entrepreneur and engineer said this week he believes two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, rather than cash out, and that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for a deal. It remains unclear how any deal would be financed.
LACK OF LIQUIDITY 
Musk has cited his long-running vendetta with short-sellers, who are betting that Tesla's stock will go down, as well as Wall Street's short-term focus on quarterly earnings, as reasons to take the company private. The implications for the company's funding, however, show that exiting the stock market will likely come with costs for Tesla.
Musk said on Monday he did not want to saddle Tesla with more debt, meaning it would then have to rely on private fundraising rounds like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and other venture-backed companies, likely incurring a much higher cost of capital. 
Estimates on how expensive private equity fundraising is compared with secondary share sales in the stock market vary. Venky Ganesan, investing partner at Menlo Ventures, said in an interview that the cost of capital - the rate of return required by an investor to persuade them to make a given investment - averages 17 percent to 18 percent for private companies compared with 6 percent to 7 percent for public companies.
""The primary downside of going private is the higher cost of capital that investors demand for the lack of liquidity, being able to buy and sell at a fair price at short notice,"" Jacobs Thomas, professor of accounting and finance at Yale School of Management, wrote on the university's website earlier this month in a post on Tesla.
The issue of funding is not merely academic. Tesla burnt through $3.4 billion of cash last year and has said it expects to invest another $2.5 billion this year. 
Musk has said repeatedly since April that Tesla has no need to raise new capital. But analysts expect Tesla will require billions of dollars more over the next several years to fund its expansion plans and to develop new electric premium vehicles to take on German rivals.
On top of that, the company's battery Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada is still only partially complete, and Musk has said that an announcement about a European plant will likely come by the end of this year.
Another big-ticket item for Tesla is its recently announced China factory in Shanghai, although Musk has said funding for the roughly $2 billion cost would come from local debt.
NEW CARS IN DEVELOPMENT
Getting access to cheap capital is a constant challenge for automakers, which can spend $1 billion or more engineering a single new model and bringing it to mass production, only to have the vehicle flop because of a cyclical sales slump or a shift in market tastes. 
Mainstream automakers have historically failed to earn their cost of capital of about 9 percent because investments in new models, new technology and production equipment do not generate sufficient profits, the late  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) chief executive Sergio Marchionne said in an April 2015 investor presentation.
Three new vehicles are in development at Tesla, the Model Y compact SUV, a new $200,000 Roadster and an electric heavy-duty truck that Musk unveiled last November, with production start dates in 2019 and 2020.
    Analysts say that a lot will depend on the forecasts that investors make on the company's profitability for the next few years. The quicker Tesla can turn a sizeable profit, the easier it will be able to fund itself.

""Tesla is clearly capital-intensive... but it's also a disruptor that's growing like crazy, perhaps making it more akin to high-growth tech companies,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a research note on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of the world's largest energy-focused hedge funds, Andurand Capital and BBL Commodities, suffered double-digit percentage losses in July as oil prices plunged by the most in two years, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
BBL Commodities Value Fund, run by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) oil trader Jonathan Goldberg, lost 14.2 percent in July, a person close to the firm said, speaking on condition of anonymity since the information is not public. 
Andurand Capital's Commodities Fund lost 15.2 percent in July, bringing the fund's performance to a 5 percent loss for the year through July 31, according to data compiled by HSBC.
Pierre Andurand, who runs the $1.2-billion Andurand Commodities Fund, predicted the rise and subsequent crash in the oil price in 2008 and is known as one of the biggest oil bulls in the market.
Both funds were very bullish heading into July, market sources said, leaving them caught on the wrong side during the oil price slide. 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) last month fell more than 7 percent while global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) dropped by 6.5 percent, the biggest monthly declines since July 2016.
Prices dropped after OPEC members boosted output in July by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.64 million bpd, a high for the year, and pledged to offset any loss of supply from Iran, the group's No. 3 producer, due to looming U.S. sanctions.
Prominent hedge funds such as Andurand Capital and Westbeck Capital Management were betting oil could skyrocket to $150 a barrel thanks in part to the potential loss of Iranian supply. However, physical markets are showing signs of strain as crude builds on ships and weighs on prices for spot cargoes. 
""The weak oil physical market is not only due to more OPEC oil on the water. It is mainly due to China destocking. Their low imports are not sustainable. They have been very low for 3 months. Their imports could go back up 2mbd any time now,"" Andurand said in a tweet late in July.
A spokesman for Andurand declined to comment on July's performance. BBL executives were not immediately available to comment. 
Will Smith, Westbeck's chief investment officer, said, ""July was indeed a tough month, but we did manage a small positive.""
Overall, commodity-focused macro hedge funds are down 1 percent on average in the first seven months of 2018, according to data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. 
The year to date has been rough for many firms across the industry.
Trading desks of oil major  BP  (L:BP) and merchants Vitol, Gunvor, and Trafigura have recorded losses in the tens of millions of dollars each as a result of the 'whipsaw' move when U.S. crude's discount to Brent plummeted to more than $11.50 a barrel in June, insiders familiar with their performance told Reuters.
Energy hedge fund Velite Capital, once among the most profitable natural gas trading shops in the United States, is winding down operations, Reuters reported on Thursday.

Sierentz Global Merchants, a commodities trading firm controlled by members of the Louis-Dreyfus family, recently exited its physical energy business, and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens' BP Capital shut earlier this year. Last year, trader Andy Hall's Astenbeck Capital Management also began shutting its main hedge fund.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","U.S. value stocks capitalize on 'FANG' stumbles, with room to run","By James Thorne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The summer roller-coaster in two of the four big-cap 'FANG' names -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc - has led to a shift, albeit slight, into value stocks.
In the last four weeks, the Russell 1000 Value Index has outperformed its growth counterpart by the largest monthly margin since September 2017, thanks in part to stumbles in Facebook and Netflix shares that stemmed from slowing user growth. Moreover, disappointing second-quarter results have reignited fears the tech giants, which have been responsible for much of the equity market's gains this year, are becoming vulnerable.
Funds that follow a value investing strategy attracted $791 million in July and August, reversing a trend in the first half of the year, when investors withdrew $4.9 billion from such funds, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.
""The (economic) outlook is significantly better than it was six months ago, and yet stock prices haven't gone up very much. As a result, there are more value opportunities,"" said Charlie Bobrinskoy, vice chairman at Ariel Investments in Chicago.
Value stocks are even more attractive on a relative basis, fund managers said. The gap between forward price-to-earnings ratios for the two categories has swelled to the widest level in the past 15 years, Reuters data showed.
""You're starting to see the market differentiate,"" said Drew Wilson, investment research analyst at Fenimore Asset Management in Cobleskill, New York.
The growing difference in earnings multiples gives buyers of value stocks an added margin of safety, which was rare when they were tighter, Wilson said.
Value investors also say undervalued companies can be found in sectors such as energy, healthcare and financials.
“If you're trying to find companies that are trading for less than 15 times earnings or less than two times book value, you end up with a lot of banks and a fair number of insurance companies as well,” said Bobrinskoy.
Fenimore’s Wilson has been taking advantage of value stocks that have come under selling pressure in the wake of threats from disruptive companies like Amazon.com.
“Any time Amazon even looks the way of an industry, it sells off,” he said. Wilson said he has found buying opportunities in companies pressured by the online retail giant, such as  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) and AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO), which have shown resilience to such competition.
Strategists said macroeconomic trends have also lined up to give value a boost.
Higher levels of gross domestic product growth and more widely shared earnings growth among companies should help value stocks, said Steven DeSanctis, SMID-cap strategist at Jefferies in New York.
DeSanctis said he expects value to outperform growth in the second half of 2018.
Rising interest rates likewise aid many value stocks that languished in the slow-growth, low-yield environment of years past that favored growth-oriented companies, said Charlie McElligott, head of cross asset macro strategy at Nomura.
Mutual fund managers who adhere to a value strategy said they were cautiously hopeful that a rotation was in its early stages.
Investors have pulled cash from value-oriented mutual funds for seven of the past 10 years, chasing gains by growth stocks and shifting to lower-cost exchange traded funds, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.
More than twice as many value funds have closed than have launched during that period, Lipper said.
Value stocks, however, tend to outperform growth over the long term, prompting many to wonder how long the current rout can last.
""These style cycles tend to come and go,"" said Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments in Woodside, California.

""Eventually you get to some extreme where people have written off value entirely, and that's probably where you get a reversal.""

242,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Lower recovery rates to haunt U.S. leveraged loans,"By Yun Li and Jonathan Schwarzberg
NEW YORK (LPC) - Overwhelming demand for floating-rate leveraged loans has eroded credit quality and will lead to more defaults and lower recovery rates in an economic downturn, according to ratings agency Moody’s.
Leveraged loans have become the go-to instrument of choice to finance private equity buyouts, due to their flexibility and lack of repayment penalties, but the ratings agency is warning that investors are sacrificing credit protection as more lower-rated companies tap the markets. 
Average first-lien term loan recoveries are expected to tumble to 61 percent from an average of 77 percent historically and average recoveries for second-lien loans will fall to 14 percent from 43 percent historically, bringing heavier losses for investors, according to Moody’s. 
The prevalence of senior loan-only structures, which lack a cushion of junior debt, is expected to be a major factor in lower recovery rates and could produce an extended default cycle, according to the ratings agency. 
""The result is more defaults than the last downturn as well as lower recoveries, undercutting a foundational premise for investing in loans,"" said Christina Padgett, a senior vice president at Moody’s. 
The move to bond-style covenant-lite structures with little investor protection has further boosted the appeal of loans. More than 70 percent of syndicated US leveraged loans are now covenant-lite, compared with 25 percent during 2006-2007, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.
“Loans are becoming more bond-like with these convergence trends causing investors to lose more control over debt terms and credit protections,” Moody’s said in a note published August 16.
Around $891 billion of US leveraged loans have been issued as of August 14, which is already 6.9 percent higher than last year’s record of $833.7 billion in the same period. High-yield bond issuance, on the other hand, has slumped 28 percent to $116 billion compared to $161 billion in the same period in 2017.
“Wall Street has met the demand with increased supply of loans versus high yield bonds, but we are concerned about the erosion of traditional lender protection,” said Brian Juliano, head of US bank loans at PGIM Fixed Income. “I do think that some of the covenants are merging towards traditional high yield bond covenants.”
The loan market added $73.5 billion in July as the US summer doldrums approached and business has been unseasonably brisk in the August holiday period. 
This week specialty materials company Boyd Corp wrapped up a $1.3 billion first-lien loan and a $315 million second-lien loan to finance its acquisition by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Merchant Banking and last week healthcare data analytics company Verscend Technologies lined up a $3.165 billion term loan to finance its purchase of analytics provider Cotiviti Holdings. 
LOWER RATED 
Loans are traditionally rated higher than bonds due to seniority in the capital structure, but lower quality loans are rising. CCC-rated loans now total 5.4 percent of leveraged loans as opposed to 3.5 percent just before the credit crisis in 2008, according to an August 15 report from UBS.   
B- rated loan volume totaled $39.1 billion through August 16, up 90.7 percent over the same period in 2017 when volume totaled $20.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, and CCC rated loan volume added up to $3.2 billion over the same time period, up 23.1 percent over $2.6 billion in 2017.
The share of first-time debt issuers rated B3 reached a record 43 percent in the first half of 2018, and about 64 percent of US speculative-grade companies have a corporate family rating of B2 or lower, according to Moody’s. 
Ethics and compliance management services provider NAVEX Global wrapped up pricing last week on a $639 million covenant-lite credit facility to support an investment by BC Partners. Although the $154 million second-lien portion of the deal is rated only CCC, the issuer still managed to drop pricing to 700 over Libor from guidance in the 750bp-775bp over Libor range. 
“Part of the reason for lower ratings is driven by the rise in loan-only capital structures,” UBS said in the report. 
UBS estimates that 40 percent of the leveraged loan index is composed of loan-only capital structures now with 60 percent of B and CCC-rated companies supported solely by loans. NAVEX Global’s loan has no bonds, for example. 
“We believe the prevalence of loan-only and cov-lite loans will make rating migration risks from B to CCC elevated as limited debt cushions and greater collateral uncertainty elevate potential credit losses,” UBS wrote.
A portfolio manager said that they are now investing on the assumption that there will be no junior debt cushion below the senior loans. This is fostering a more cautious approach.   
“It’s a concern, especially without covenants,” the manager said. “It has led us to stay away from some cyclical companies.”

Low Taek Jho has been identified by investigators in Malaysia and the United States as a key figure in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) case.
Authorities in Malaysia and the United States are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB. The U.S. Department of Justice says over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund, with some of the money used to buy a private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewelry and real estate.
Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Low, whose whereabouts are unknown. The financier, whose Malaysian passport has been revoked, has denied any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for Low, through his attorneys, said he ""believes there is no jurisdiction where he can get a fair hearing in this matter"".
""Low will not submit to any jurisdiction where guilt has been predetermined by politics and self-interest overrules legal process,"" he said via email on Friday.
Low was responding to a Wall Street Journal story on Friday that cited unnamed Malaysian officials saying they believed Low was being harbored in mainland China.
It also said a request to extradite Low would be high on the agenda of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad during a five-day trip to China which began on Friday.
Reuters could not verify the Journal story. 
A spokesman for the prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
China's foreign ministry, asked whether Low was in the country, said it had ""no grasp"" of the situation.
Last month, Malaysian police said they believed Low had left Macau for an unknown destination, evading arrest in Hong Kong. 

Malaysia has applied for an Interpol red notice to seek assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, China and Hong Kong to detain Low.

252,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Tesla Tumbles After Tearful Musk Tells NYT Nobody Reviewed Tweet,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s stock price plunged on Friday after Elon Musk told the New York Times that no one saw or reviewed his tweet about the plan to take the company private before he posted it. The billionaire frequently teared up in an interview and discussed the personal strain of leading the electric-car maker, the newspaper said.
The shares swooned as much 8.6 percent Friday, the biggest intraday drop since May. The stock was down 8.5 percent to $306.83 at 10:44 a.m. New York time. The fourth straight day of decline has wiped out Tesla’s year-to-date gains.
Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and chairman, typed the take-private tweet as he drove himself to the airport on Aug. 7, the newspaper reported, citing Musk. The tweet said: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.”
In an hourlong sit-down with the newspaper, Musk also detailed his frequent use of the sleep-aid Ambien -- a drug he’s discussed using before, and whose well-known side effects include sleepwalking. “It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,” he told the newspaper.
Rather than put him to sleep, the drug has sometimes led Musk to spend his nights on Twitter, worrying some board members, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the board’s thinking.
Mounting Scrutiny
The going-private tweet has set off a firestorm, causing the stock to jump but also prompting mounting scrutiny, including a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
Almost a week later, the CEO said the basis for that statement were conversations with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which first expressed interest in helping take the company private in early 2017. Tesla’s board has since clarified that it hasn’t received a formal proposal from Musk, nor has it concluded whether going private would be advisable or feasible. This week, Musk was said to have received a subpoena for more information, according to a person familiar with the matter.
One funding possibility being considered for the potential privatization is for Musk’s rocket company SpaceX to help bankroll the deal and take a stake in Tesla, the New York Times said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Efforts are also under way to recruit an executive to take some pressure off Musk, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the search. A couple of years ago, Tesla approached  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). executive Sheryl Sandberg about the job, Musk told the newspaper, but added that no active search is taking place currently “to the best of my knowledge.”
“If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know,” Musk told the Times. “They can have the job.”
Despite the frenzy over Tesla’s future, production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan -- which has frequently kept Musk at the Fremont factory overnight -- is defying the odds and going well, according to Evercore ISI analysts. Output is well on track for weekly production goals, and set for a significant boost, the analysts wrote Thursday after touring the plant.
Musk told the newspaper that he didn’t recall communications from the board at all and that he “definitely did not get calls from irate directors.” He later amended the comment through a spokeswoman, saying lead independent director Antonio Gracias had contacted him about the Aug. 7 tweet. Musk agreed not to tweet again on the possible privatization without discussing it with the board, the spokeswoman said.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>",M&A lending to U.S. blue-chip firms on summer hiatus,"By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lending to high-quality US companies to fund acquisitions has slowed due to concern over government policies amid the summer doldrums, but is expected to pick up after the Labor Day holiday, bankers said. 
No bridge loans were recorded by Thomson Reuters LPC in July, for the first time in any month since March 2017, as a more cautious tone set in over the summer after several acquisitions fell apart and US trade wars escalated.
Overall investment-grade lending in the third quarter is running at a slower pace than last year. Volume of about US$44bn in the third quarter so far has been vastly skewed toward refinancing rather than mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and is currently around 24% of the US$181bn seen in the full third quarter of 2017. 
“On the acquisition finance side, there are vagaries coming out of Washington and some one-off deals that have fallen away, but none of this is moving people to the sidelines to such a degree that they aren’t going to do deals,” said Robert Danziger, MUFG managing director in U.S. investment grade loans.
“I do not believe that we are in a frenzied or frothy environment, but rather, in a more focused, methodical environment,” said Danziger.
Investment-grade lending is still 14.5% higher in 2018 so far at around US$574bn compared to a year earlier, but M&A activity has slowed after national security concerns sank deals over the summer and fears of trade wars intensified.  
“Washington-related uncertainty, including issues relating to tariffs, anti-trust and CFIUS, combined with continuing high valuations, might be having a dampening effect on dealflow currently,” said Jason Kyrwood, partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 
CFIUS refers to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews proposals to determine if they threaten national security. 
Last month, chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc dropped its US$44bn bid to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure approval from China, with the deal embroiled in a trade standoff between China and the U.S.
Then in other scuttled tie-ups, Tribune Media ended its US$3.9bn deal to be bought by Sinclair Broadcast Group in early August after regulators objected to the combination, while drug store chain Rite Aid and US grocer Albertsons also agreed to end their US$24bn merger after opposition from advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.
In the background, AT&T’s already-closed US$85bn deal to buy Time Warner is being appealed by the Department of Justice. While this is unlikely to be reversed, it has sounded a note of caution for M&A dealmakers, bankers said. 
STILL OPEN 
The loan market remains open although political volatility and growing concerns in the late cycle market along with the effect of further interest rate rises curb the corporate sector’s enthusiasm for growth by acquisition. 
“Financing markets continue to be strong, even as interest rates are rising, and the economy seems to be humming along,” Kyrwood said. 
Bankers still expect M&A to resume momentum in the final months of the year, as financing is plentiful and companies push ahead with buy and build strategies. 

“I know a lot of syndicators who are taking some well-deserved time off,” said one banker, who sees a regrouping over the summer before the next deal push. “Arrangers are looking to make up for lost fees from canceled M&A deals.”

254,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Britain's 'Aramco' listing category attracts interest from a single firm,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog has so far been contacted by only one company interested in taking advantage of a rule it introduced to attract state-owned firms like Saudi Aramco  to London, the regulator told Reuters without naming the firm. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) drew criticism from major institutional investors and British lawmakers when it outlined plans in July last year for a premium stock market category that would exempt businesses controlled by sovereigns from meeting certain requirements.
Aramco's initial public offering (IPO), which could value the oil company at an estimated $2 trillion, would be the biggest ever if it goes ahead and financial centers including London and New York have been vying to host the international tranche of the share sale. 
Some British lawmakers had questioned whether the FCA's proposed listing changes were influenced by the British government with the aim of luring Aramco to list in London. 
But the regulator rejected suggestions it had been swayed by politicians, with its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, telling lawmakers last October that the new policy ""is not about one company.""
The new category was introduced at the start of last month after the FCA tweaked its plan to address some of the corporate governance concerns raised by investors.
Since the policy was first proposed in 2017, the FCA has been contacted by one company expressing preliminary interest in using the new listing category, the regulator told Reuters in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. 
The watchdog declined to say whether the company was Aramco. An FCA spokesman did not comment further. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Evan after making modifications earlier this year, the FCA still met resistance from some business groups, including the Institute of Directors (IoD), who were unhappy with the plan. In the new category, shareholders will not be required to give prior approval for related party transactions between the state-controlled company and sovereign. 
Edwin Morgan, the IoD's director of policy, said the FCA's response to the FOI request suggested there might not be ""massive demand"" for the new listing category.
""It doesn't mean potentially that others might not be interested but it doesn't sound like there is such a demand for this that the economic gain would be so massive that it would justify the watering down of the rules,"" he said.
CONTACT WITH ARAMCO
Bailey disclosed in a letter to parliament's Treasury and Business Committees last year that the FCA had held talks with Aramco and its advisers and that the regulator had ""emphasized during those conversations that we were reviewing the listing regime.""
He later told the Treasury Committee that he met with Aramco's chief financial officer in January 2017 when asked by lawmakers about the discussions.
In response to a separate FOI request submitted by Reuters, the FCA disclosed that in total it had held eight meetings and calls with either Aramco or the oil company's advisers last year, including the January meeting. 
Two of the calls took place on the days before and after the FCA proposed its listing changes on July 13.
Aramco had originally planned to IPO by the end of 2018 in a share sale seen as the centerpiece of efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy beyond oil.
But that target has looked increasingly out of reach in recent months, with the country yet to announce a venue for an international float.
Last month, sources told Reuters that a separate deal that Aramco is pursuing to buy a stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010) from the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund, would enable the kingdom to delay the IPO until 2020 or later.
Britain's FCA estimated in its original proposal for the listing change that the new category might not appeal to many businesses.
""Although the group of sovereign controlled commercial companies is not likely to be large numerically, their likely market value, for example arising from major privatization transactions, is large enough to justify creating a new regime category,"" the FCA said in its July 2017 consultation paper.

Prince Mohammed predicted the listing would value Aramco as whole at $2 trillion or more when he first announced the plan to sell about 5 percent of the oil company in 2016.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>",Slovenia's parliament confirms Sarec as PM designate,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament approved Marjan Sarec, a comedian turned politician, as prime minister designate on Friday, setting him on track to form a minority government and end the country's longest political stalemate since an election.
Sarec, 40, became the country's youngest prime minister, with support from 55 lawmakers in the 90-seat body, sidelining the anti-immigrant SDS of ex-Prime Minister Janez Jansa which had won most votes in June 3 inconclusive ballot but was unable to cobble together a ruling majority.
Analysts were already forecasting a tricky ride for the new administration, given the conflicting platforms of the parties.
Sarec, a former mayor in northern Slovenia, has 15 days to pick his cabinet out of from a five-party center-left coalition led by his LMS party which will depend on the backing of the leftist Levica party.
Levica supported Sarec but said it would not participate in his cabinet. The five parties together hold 43 seats, and with Levica's nine seats, they will hold a slim majority in the parliament. 
Analysts however say the minority government will likely prove unstable, constraining any attempts of radical reforms.
""The difficulty, with which this cabinet is taking shape suggest that it will be unstable and the risk of early elections in this parliamentary term will be high,"" according to a note by Teneo Intelligence.
The opposition also cast doubt into the future of the fragile government. ""The legitimacy of such a mandate will be low ... We can reasonably wonder how long this government will endure,"" said Danijel Krivec, an MP of SDS.
Sarec told parliament he was not afraid to take responsibility. ""Deeds, not words, will be counted,"" he said.
One of the first tasks of the new government will be to start the sale of Slovenia's largest bank, state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB).
Slovenia has committed to sell a 75 percent stake in NLB in exchange for European Commission approval of state aid to the bank in 2013 but this might be a problem as the Levica opposes the sale while most other parties believe Slovenia should sell majority of the bank.
The government will also have to improve the inefficient national health system and reform the pension system to reduce the burden of the rapidly ageing population on the budget and elect new central bank governor.
Political analyst Tanja Staric said the 13th Slovenian government will be novelty in the tiny Alpine nation whose previous governments have been based around a similar political spectrum.

""It remains to be seen whether such a government will be capable of tackling difficult tasks in the ever challenging EU environment. But on the other side Sarec comes from a new generation of politicians and deserves a chance,"" she told Reuters.

On Thursday, Nordstrom reported its best quarterly same-store sales growth in three years, boosted by strong online sales of 23 percent. It also raised its forecast for full year profit.
""Believe JWN has a best-in-class digital platform and is well ahead of department store peers in terms of leveraging innovative technology,"" Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note.
At least 6 brokerages raised their price targets on the Nordstrom stock after the company posted strong quarterly results across the board. Telsey Advisory Group's Dana Telsey was the most bullish, raising the target price on the stock by $8 to $65.
The company has been investing in top locations and expanding its discount shopping chain, Nordstrom Rack to woo shoppers back that have increasingly defected to online channels and more fast-fashion brands, which offer the trendiest styles.
Nordstrom also has a Local concept store, where shoppers have personal stylists to them help pick out clothing and accessories, dressing rooms to try them on, online ordering, and services.
""Nordstrom's initiatives are beginning to bear fruit and have positioned it as a leader in the industry,"" Telsey said in note titled ""Nordstrom firing on all cylinders.""
Analysts also cheered the company's inventory management and product assortment, which Nordstrom said was a ""competitive advantage"" for them. 
The Seattle-based retailer's upscale products gives it an edge over online competition from players such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN) as shoppers typically steer away from making expensive buys online.
In stark contrast, J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) said it had made fashion missteps that led to heavy discounting of its inventories, sending its shares down 27 percent on Thursday.
Cowen's Chen said that the company could report better comparable sales in the future on the strength of its digital growth and strong inventory management that is keeping their line fresh.

""The best is yet to come as the company opens its New York store, strengthens its supply chain, and continues to benefit from the shift in consumer spending online,"" Telsey said.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Currency shocks knock platinum to 10-year lows,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - Platinum prices tumbled to 10-year lows as the collapse of Turkey's lira rippled through markets and weakened the currency of top producer South Africa, underlining persistent oversupply of the autocatalyst metal. 
Platinum has been caught in a broad sell-off as investors rush to the safety of the dollar, pushing it higher and making dollar-priced metals more expensive for buyers using other currencies.
But platinum, used mainly in emissions-reducing catalytic converters for vehicles and in jewelry, has fallen further than its precious metal peers.
Once much more valuable than gold and palladium, platinum  has tumbled 25 percent from January highs to below $780 an ounce. This week it hit its lowest since October 2008 and a new record low relative to gold .
(Platinum demand: https://reut.rs/2L7m87R)
""It (platinum's outlook) has changed and the reason is the weakness of the rand,"" said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. 
The rand has fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar in a week, boosting the local earnings of South African companies who produce around 70 percent of the world's mined platinum and relieving pressure on them to cut output.
These cuts are needed to tackle stubborn oversupply as demand continues to flatline. 
Analysts at Metals Focus expect a surplus of 40,000 ounces in 2018 in the roughly 8 million ounce a year platinum market.  Johnson Matthey  (L:JMAT) predicts for this year a larger oversupply of 316,000 ounces, the biggest since 2011.
The average production cash cost in South Africa - a measure of direct expenses such as labor, fuel and electricity - was $834 an ounce last year, according to Metals Focus. 
""If the rand is weaker it gives producers more breathing space. The longer it stays weaker, the longer we have a stay of execution for some of these higher cost operations,"" said Jonathan Butler at Mitsubishi.
(Platinum price technicals: https://reut.rs/2Pe3qhD)
Platinum had already been falling this year as the rising dollar and fears that trade disputes will damage economic growth and curtail demand turned investors against the metal.
Speculative bets on lower prices outnumber bets on higher prices on NYMEX for the first time since 2001. Positioning has swung from a net long in March of more than 40,000 contracts equivalent to over 2 million ounces to a net short of 407,150 ounces. <1076651NNET>
(Platinum positioning: https://reut.rs/2vP1qEk)
Underlying platinum's poor performance are also weaker sales of diesel cars since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was found in 2015 to have cheated in emissions tests. Autocatalysts use both platinum and palladium, but diesel engines use more platinum.
But most analysts still expect prices to recover.
""The fundamental story has not really changed. If these levels are maintained, producers will be under pressure to close operations,"" said Mitsubishi's Butler, adding that demand was solid and low prices were attracting jewelers and industrial buyers. 
(Platinum vs gold and palladium: https://reut.rs/2vNvwYM) 
Twenty-nine analysts polled by Reuters in July said they expected platinum to average $922 an ounce this year and $979 in 2019.
On the technical side, platinum has broken below key support at $800, its 2016 low and two long term uptrend lines. 
(Platinum vs dollar and rand: https://reut.rs/2PhLu5x)
""It (is) getting ever closer to the 2004 low at $761,"" said analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""Around (this level) we could see the precious metal stabilize. If not, the 2008 trough at 732.50 could perhaps be reached as well.""
But any uptick in prices could force speculative investors to rebalance their bets, creating upward momentum, said ICBC Standard analyst Marcus Garvey.

""Getting back into high $800s or $900 is plausible on a positioning move,"" he said. ""Any sort of alleviation of dollar strength and it could happen.""

261,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 06:47AM ET</span>","Air France-KLM shares fall, Dutch pilots threaten to strike","By Bart H. Meijer and Sudip Kar-Gupta
AMSTERDAM/PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) shares fell on Friday in response to the hostile reception from unions to the company's new boss Benjamin Smith, while the airline's Dutch pilots threatened to strike over working conditions.
Unions representing workers at the French company were openly hostile to the appointment of Smith, chief operating officer at  Air Canada  (TO:AC), accusing the group of handing control to a foreigner and not protecting Air France's interests. 
Air France-KLM shares fell 4 percent and were among the worst-performing stocks on Paris' SBF-120 (SBF120) index.
""Driving the share price is essentially the discontent of the unions,"" Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Paris-based Roche-Brune Asset Management, said.
Smith, who will take up his post before the end of September, will have to deal with labor troubles at Air France that have already cost the airline 335 million euros ($381.73 million) this year, forced the resignation of his predecessor, and seen the group's shares slump 36 percent in 2018.
French unions are due to discuss another round of strike action on Aug. 27.
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the Dutch pilots union VNV said it would strike unless the airline's management comes up with improved offers to ease their workload.
The union said work stoppages could begin in four weeks time, after it rejected a last minute offer made by KLM late on Thursday.
The union wants the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM to start hiring new flight personnel as soon as possible, to give pilots more time in between flights. KLM said it is already recruiting new staff, but that it is impossible to meet all the union's demands.
CUTTING COSTS
Air France took over KLM in 2003 when the Dutch airline was struggling, but the two have continued to operate independently.
Air France-KLM in May said it expected profits to fall this year due to the effect of strikes at its French business. 
The French government has a stake of about 14 percent in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.
In a research note titled ""New CEO - New solutions to old problems"",  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) welcomed Smith's appointment but maintained its ""sell"" recommendation on Air France-KLM shares.
""(Smith) played a key role in Air Canada's (AC) growth and modernization strategy in recent years, redefined AC's hub strategy and was also a driving force behind AC's successful low-cost brand Rouge,"" SocGen wrote.
SocGen noted that Smith's predecessor, Jean-Marc Janaillac, met stiff union resistance when he began the job. In the end, Janaillac lasted two years before quitting after Air France staff rejected his final salary increase offer.
""We hope that history won't repeat itself – otherwise having a non-French CEO will be the least of the group's and the (French) employees' worries,"" SocGen wrote.
KLM has had more success in cutting costs than its French counterpart. The Dutch airline managed to agree several cost cutting deals with its staff in recent years, which improved its profitability and put it in a stronger position than French partner Air France.

""Our pilots have given up a lot in recent years, making KLM profitable"", VNV spokesman Joost van Doesburg said. ""Now it's time for KLM to deal with its exhausted staff.""

266,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Turkish firms and government face $3.8 billion bond crunch in October: Societe General,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey and its firms face repayments of nearly $3.8 billion on foreign currency bonds in October as the country struggles with a plunging lira that has lost more than a third of its value since the start of the year.
Emerging market (EM) investors have been worried about Turkey's external debt burden and the ability of its firms and banks to repay after a boom in hard currency issuance to help finance a rapidly growing economy.
For companies, the cost of servicing foreign debt has risen by a quarter in lira terms in the past two months alone.
""Turkey's external financing requirements are large,"" Jason Daw at Societe General wrote in a note to clients. ""It has the highest FX-denominated debt in EM and short-term external debt of $180 billion and total external debt of $460 billion.""
Calculations by Societe General show that Turkish firms will face $1.8 billion of hard-currency denominated bonds maturing by the year-end while $1.25 billion of government bonds will come due. Additionally, a total of $2.3 billion in interest must be paid.
The heaviest month for repayments is October, when $3 billion in principal and $762 million interest are due.
""Principal and interest payments should be closely watched to year end – it is 25 percent more costly for the corporate sector to repay their obligations compared to June given FX depreciation,"" Daw wrote. 
One mitigating factor may be that much of the short-term external debt was in instruments such as bank loans and trade credits, which could be smoother to restructure or roll over than attempting to do so on bond markets, Daw added. 
Data from LPC showed that about $7 billion of loans are due to mature until the end of the year, with more than 90 percent of those being bank loans.
A number of lenders such as  Akbank  (IS:AKBNK), Turk Ekonomi Bankasi and Turk Eximbank are in the market attempting to refinance loans. However, international banks are unlikely to make any decisions before ratings agencies react, with many predicting the lending boom would grind to a sudden halt. 
""Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects,"" said Jurgen Odenius, economic counselor at PGIM Fixed Income. 
""Western European banks from Spain and France are particularly exposed, with over half of the debt owed to them.""
Shares in some of Europe's major banks have been hammered over the last week as markets fret over their exposure to Turkey.
Odenius also points to the fallout from Turkey's financial system and the corporate sector being effectively short dollars, calculating that net foreign exchange liabilities (NFL) of the central bank and commercial banks combined amounted to $27 billion at the end of June. 
""While that is undoubtedly a manageable figure, these liabilities only pertain to foreign lenders,"" Odenius wrote in a note to clients. ""Including the $147 billion in dollar deposits by resident households and firms, the 'adjusted' NFL spirals up to nearly $175 billion — an undoubtedly less manageable figure.""
With President Tayyip Erdogan's administration shunning orthodox monetary policy and highly reluctant to raise interest rates to contain inflation at over 15 percent, markets are also closely watching how the Turkish state goes about refinancing its debts. 
Erdogan's government has adamantly rejected speculation that it may have to seek support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Qatar has pledged about $15 billion but details have been scant.
""Rather than sticking with the approach taken by numerous other countries – including Argentina earlier this year – by raising interest rates and seeking some form of IMF support, Turkey has shunned both in a very public manner,"" wrote Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG). 

""Unless it changes course, the government risks much wider damage – and not just in Turkey.""

It did not specify what circumstances it was referring to though a Granges spokeswoman later said they were related to the feasibility of the project and did not have to do with U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports.
U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on imported aluminum and steel as well as on a long list of imports from China, which include many machinery parts or products needed by manufacturers, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing.
The venture aimed to combine Granges' and Mitsubishi Aluminum's expertise in aluminum rolling and establish a new U.S. production facility to manufacture advanced aluminum materials for brazed automotive heat exchangers for the North American and Mexican markets.
""Granges has decided to halt the plans for a joint venture in North America, as the project isn't sufficiently attractive for Granges from a risk-reward perspective given the current circumstances,"" the company said in its statement on Friday. 
""It doesn't have to do with the market conditions...It's more about the project itself,"" said Pernilla Grennfelt, senior vice president for communications and investor relations, declining to be more specific.
Yet, she said U.S. tariffs were impacting Granges in different ways.
The company is seeking exemptions to continue importing from Europe certain aluminum coil and aluminum sheet products that it needs to make products in the United States needed by U.S. automotive clients, she said.
Granges last year had already begun to gradually shift production of foil products for U.S. customers from Shanghai, China to Finspang, Sweden after the U.S. imposed countervailing and anti-dumping duties on imports of such products from China.
The company said on Friday it remained ""strongly committed"" to the North American market, adding that it was on track with its plans to invest $110 million to expand capacity at its Tennessee operations in the United States.
Granges is also exploring business opportunities for advanced aluminum materials for brazed automotive heat exchangers in North America, it said.​

Musk startled Wall Street last week when he said in a tweet he was considering taking the auto company private for $420 per share and that funding was ""secured."" He has since said he is searching for funds for the effort.
Musk said on Monday that the manager of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had voiced support for the company going private several times, including as recently as two weeks ago, but also said that talks continue with the fund and other investors.
The New York Times report said another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.
Musk is the CEO and controlling shareholder of the rocket company.
Tesla and SpaceX did not respond when Reuters requested comment on the matter. 
In a wide-ranging and emotional interview with the New York Times published late on Thursday, Musk, Tesla's chief executive, described the difficulties over the last year for him as the company has tried to overcome manufacturing issues with the Model 3 sedan. https://nyti.ms/2vOkgeM
""This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" he said. ""It was excruciating.""
The loss-making company has been trying to hit production targets, but the tweet by Musk opened up a slew of new problems including government scrutiny and lawsuits.
The New York Times report said efforts are underway to find a No. 2 executive to help take some of the pressure off Musk, people briefed on the search said.
Musk has no plans to relinquish his dual role as chairman and chief executive officer, he said in the interview.
Musk said he wrote the tweet regarding taking Tesla private as he drove himself on the way to the airport in his Tesla Model S. He told the New York Times that no one reviewed the tweet before he posted it.
He said that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 - a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore, the report said.
“It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,” he said in the interview. ""But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned.' You just sit there like a stone on weed,"" he said.
Some board members recently told Musk to lay off Twitter and rather focus on operations at his companies, according to people familiar with the matter, the newspaper report said. 
During the interview, Musk emotionally described the intensity of running his businesses. He told the newspaper that he works 120 hours a week, sometimes at the expense of not celebrating his own birthday or spending only a few hours at his brother's wedding. 
""There were times when I didn't leave the factory for three or four days — days when I didn't go outside,"" he said during the interview. ""This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.""
To help sleep, Musk sometimes takes Ambien, which concerns some board members, since he has a tendency to conduct late-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar with the board the New York Times reported. 

""It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,"" he said.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2018 03:56AM ET</span>",Toyota to increase production capacity in China by 20 percent: source,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) will build additional capacity at its auto plant in China's Guangzhou, a company source said, in addition to beefing up production at a factory in Tianjin city by 120,000 vehicles a year.
A person close to the company said Toyota will build capacity at the production hub in the south China city of Guangzhou to also produce an additional 120,000 vehicles a year, an increase of 24 percent over current capacity. 
All together, between the eastern port city of Tianjin and Guangzhou, Toyota will boost its overall manufacturing capacity by 240,000 vehicles a year, or by about 20 percent. 
Toyota's production capacity in China is 1.16 million vehicles a year.
Reuters reported earlier this week that Toyota plans to build additional capacity in Tianjin to produce 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars a year.
China has said it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and the wider car market by 2022. Beijing also has been pushing automakers to produce and sell more electric vehicles through purchase subsidies and production quotas for such green cars. 
Toyota's planned additional capacity in Guangzhou is also for electrified vehicles, said the company source, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the matter.
The source did not say how much the additional capacity would cost. The Tianjin expansion is likely to cost $257 million, according to a government website.
The planned capacity expansions in Guangzhou and Tianjin are part of a medium-term strategy of the Japanese automaker that aims to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, by the early 2020s, according to four company insiders with knowledge of the matter.
The plans signal Toyota’s willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world’s biggest auto market, the sources said. 
Car imports could also increase, they said.

In addition to boosting manufacturing capacity, Toyota also plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.

Rusal, which was hit with U.S. sanctions in April that seriously disrupted aluminum supplies, said the relocation was still subject to shareholder approval.
The announcement comes a day after En+ Group , which is also subject to U.S. sanctions on the two companies' tycoon co-owner Oleg Deripaska, said it was considering re-domiciling to one of Russia's new offshore zones.
Russia has created two special administrative regions where companies enjoy benefits such as a zero tax on profits received by way of dividends - an arrangement similar to foreign offshore tax havens.
Rusal said its board had decided that a change of domicile might be ""in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole"" and entrusted the management with developing a detailed action plan.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer outside China, are down 54 percent since the sanctions were imposed on April 6.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Jin Air  (KS:272450) escaped the worst of regulatory wrath on Friday when it was allowed to keep its business license in the wake of public outrage over the behavior of members of its founding family.
The country's No.2 budget carrier's license was put under review after it was found that family member Emily Cho - in the spotlight after reports of an angry tantrum earlier this year - held U.S. citizenship while serving as board director in violation of South Korean law.
Although Jin Air kept its license, it will be restricted from registering new aircraft and routes for a ""certain period of time"", the transport ministry said in a decision that pared initial sky-high gains for its stock.
Cho, a member of the family which controls Jin Air and parent  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490), provoked a storm of anger after she allegedly threw water at an advertising agency manager. The incident came four years after an infamous ""nut rage' scandal in which her sister Heather delayed a flight because she objected to the way nuts were served.
Emily Cho later issued an apology but did not specify her actions.
The family's latest misconduct came amid widespread public anger over the behavior of South Korea's business and political elite, and prompted government agencies and prosecutors to launch probes into the Cho family and its businesses.
""Although the current administration would like to present their action as a measure to alleviate public anger, I do not think that should be the government's role - creating avenues for public catharsis,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score.
The ministry said it will keep its restrictions in place, until Jin Air implements measures to prevent violations of aviation laws and to improve its corporate culture.
The carrier has proposed ""cracking down on its top-down, authoritarian culture"", increasing the number of its outside board directors, and creating a system that will protect whistleblowers, the ministry said.
Jin Air said in a statement that it welcomed the ministry's decision.
The scandal has seen Emily Cho resign from her position at the airline and her father, Cho Yang-ho, resign as co-chief executive although he remains chairman of Korean Air. 
Jin Air's employees have also been vocal about their outrage and the damage to airline's reputation and on Friday, the carrier's union lambasted the founding family for ""not speaking a word about the current situation.""
Shares in Jin Air initially soared as much as 24 percent after news broke that its business license was intact but later pared gains to stand 9 percent higher, giving it a market value of about $620 million.
The stock is still down 28 percent from levels before the scandal broke.
""The ministry's somewhat punitive measurement will inevitably have consequences for Jin Air's business expansion but it will be for a limited time only,"" said Kim Ik-sang, chief analyst at BNK Securities. 
""But at the same time, it will give other budget carriers the opportunity to seek business advantages,"" he added. 
Plans to lease four Boeing (NYSE:BA) B737-800 aircraft from Korean Air this year have been put on hold, pending the government's decision on its restrictions, a Jin Air spokesman.

SYDNEY/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  said on Friday no customer data was compromised after Australian media reported a teenager had pleaded guilty to hacking into its main computer network, downloading internal files and accessing customer accounts.
The boy, 16, from the southern city of Melbourne, broke into the U.S. computer giant's mainframe from his suburban home many times over a year, The Age newspaper reported, citing statements by the teenager's lawyer in court.
The teen downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files and accessed customer accounts without exposing his identity, the paper said.
Apple contacted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation when it became aware of the intrusion, The Age said, quoting statements made in court. The FBI then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
The report said an AFP raid on the boy's family home produced two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported by Apple.
The sensitive documents were saved in a folder called ""hacky hack hack"", the report said.
It said the boy had boasted about his activities on the mobile messaging service WhatsApp.
An Apple spokesman said the company's information security personnel ""discovered the unauthorized access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement"" without commenting further on the specifics of the case.
""We ... want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised,"" the spokesman said.
The AFP declined to comment because the matter was before the court. A court spokeswoman also declined to comment other than to say the teenager would be sentenced on Sept. 20.

The boy's name could not be made public because he was a juvenile offender.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares won a modest reprieve on Friday after China and the United States agreed to hold their first trade talks since June next week and as the Turkish lira extended gains from its record low earlier this week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.4 percent, a day after it hit its lowest level in a year. Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.5 percent.
In U.S. markets on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.58 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.79 percent.
MSCI's index of world stocks rose 0.63 percent on Thursday, the biggest gain in a month.
News that a Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives helped to improve the mood.
But the impact could be short-lived as such lower-level talks alone are unlikely to resolve the trade dispute. White House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned Beijing not to underestimate President Donald Trump's resolve in pushing for changes in China's economic policies.
Indeed, Chinese share markets were hardly impressed by the news.
The Shanghai composite index rose 0.16 percent in early Friday trade after ending down 0.66 percent at 2,705.19 on Thursday, just 0.03 point above a 2-1/2 year closing low set on Aug. 6.
That also weighed on MSCI emerging markets index, which closed at 13-month low on Thursday.
Their weakness stemmed also from falls in their currencies after the Turkish lira plunged this month on concerns about diplomatic rifts between Ankara and Washington.
""Because of the currency crisis in Turkey, investors are shifting funds from emerging markets to developed markets,"" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC Securities in Tokyo.
""But if you look at longer-term prospects, the U.S. could be affected if the trade disputes linger. Given a U.S. president tends to do badly in his first mid-term election, he might do more on trade issues after the election,"" he added.
In the currency market, the lira bounced back to 5.815 per dollar, up almost 25 percent from its record low of 7.2400 hit early on Monday, despite threats of more sanctions from Washington.
It gained some support from the announcement late on Wednesday of a Qatari pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
The offshore Chinese yuan weakened slightly after a 1.2 percent climb on Thursday, the biggest daily gain since January 2017 following the trade talks news. The yuan last stood at 6.8794 per dollar, down 0.25 percent on the day but still off Wednesday's 19-month low of 6.9587. 
The euro, which has been affected by concerns about European banks' exposure to Turkey, traded at $1.1375, almost flat on the day and off 13-1/2-month low of $1.1301 on Wednesday.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is not close to launching a search engine app in China, its chief executive said at a companywide meeting on Thursday, according to a transcript seen by Reuters, as employees of the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit called for more transparency and oversight of the project.
Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told staff that though development is in an early stage, providing more services in the world's most populous country fits with Google's global mission.
Hoping to gain approval from the Chinese government to provide a mobile search service, the company plans to block some websites and search terms, Reuters reported this month, citing unnamed sources.
Whether the company could or would launch search in China ""is all very unclear,"" Pichai said, according to the transcript. ""The team has been in an exploration stage for quite a while now, and I think they are exploring many options.""
Disclosure of the secretive effort has disturbed some Google employees and human rights advocacy organizations. They are concerned that by agreeing to censorship demands, Google would validate China's prohibitions on free expression and violate the ""don't be evil"" clause in the company's code of conduct.
Hundreds of employees have called on the company to provide more ""transparency, oversight and accountability,"" according to an internal petition seen by Reuters on Thursday.
After a separate petition this year, Google announced it would not renew a project to help the U.S. military develop artificial intelligence technology for drones.
The China petition says employees are concerned the project, code named Dragonfly, ""makes clear"" that ethics principles Google issued during the drone debate ""are not enough."" 
""We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building,"" states the document seen by Reuters.
The New York Times first reported the petition on Thursday. Google declined to comment. 
Company executives have not commented publicly on Dragonfly, and their remarks at the company-wide meeting marked their first about the project since details about it were leaked. 
Employees have asked Google to create an ethics review group with rank-and-file workers, appoint ombudspeople to provide independent review and internally publish assessments of projects that raise substantial ethical questions.
Pichai told employees: ""We'll definitely be transparent as we get closer to actually having a plan of record here"" on Dragonfly, according to the transcript. He noted the company guards information on some projects where sharing too early can ""cause issues.""
Three former employees involved with Google's past efforts in China told Reuters current leadership may see offering limited search results in China as better than providing no information at all. 
The same rationale led Google to enter China in 2006. It left in 2010 over an escalating dispute with regulators that was capped by what security researchers identified as state-sponsored cyberattacks against Google and other large U.S. firms.

The former employees said they doubt the Chinese government will welcome back Google. A Chinese official, who declined to be named, told Reuters this month that it is “very unlikely” Dragonfly would be available this year.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>","As Nvidia expands in artificial intelligence, Intel defends turf","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) dominates chips for training computers to think like humans, but it faces an entrenched competitor in a major avenue for expansion in the artificial intelligence chip market:  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
Nvidia chips dominate the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms ""learn"" a task such how to recognize a human voice, but one of the biggest growth areas in the field will be deploying computers that implement the ""learned"" tasks. Intel dominates data centers where such tasks are likely to be carried out.
""For the next 18 to 24 months, it's very hard to envision anyone challenging Nvidia on training,"" said Jon Bathgate, analyst and tech sector co-lead at Janus Henderson Investors. 
But Intel processors already are widely used for taking a trained artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests, what is called ""inference.""
Intel's chips can still work just fine there, especially when paired with huge amounts of memory, said Bruno Fernandez-Ruiz, chief technology officer of Nexar Inc, an Israeli startup using smartphone cameras to try to prevent car collisions.
That market could be bigger than the training market, said Abhinav Davuluri, an analyst at Morningstar, who sees an inference market of $11.8 billion by 2021, versus $8.2 billion for training. Intel estimates that the current market for AI chips is about $2.5 billion, evenly split between inference and training.
Nvidia, which posted an 89 percent rise in profit Thursday, hasn't given a specific estimate for the inference chip market but CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that believes it ""is going to be a very large market for us.""
Nvidia sales of inference chips are rising. In May, the company said it had doubled its shipments of them year-over-year to big data center customers, though it didn't give a baseline. Earlier this month, Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Cloud unit said it had adopted Nvidia's inference chips and would rent them out to customers.
But Nvidia faces a headwind selling inference chips because the data center market is blanketed with the CPUs Intel has been selling for 20 years. Intel is working to persuade customers that for both technical and business reasons, they should stick with what they have.
Take Taboola, a New York-based company that helps web publishers recommend related content to readers and that Intel has touted as an example of how its chips remain competitive. 
The company uses Nvidia's training chips to teach its algorithm to learn what to recommend and considered Nvidia's inference chips to make the recommendations. Speed matters because users leave slow-loading pages.
But Taboola ended up sticking with Intel for reasons of speed and cost, said Ariel Pisetzky, the company's vice president of information technology.
Nvidia's chip was far faster, but time spent shuffling data back and forth to the chip negated the gains, Pisetzky said. Second, Intel dispatched engineers to help Taboola tweak its computer code so that the same servers could handle more than twice as many requests.
""My options were, you already have the servers. They're in the racks,"" he said. ""Working with Intel, I can now cut back my new server purchases by a factor of two because I can use my existing servers two times better.""
Nvidia has been working to solve those challenges. The company has rolled out software this year to make its inference chips far faster to help overcome the issue of moving data back and forth. And it announced a new family of chips based on a technology called Turing earlier this week that it says will be 10 times faster still, Huang said on the analyst call Thursday.

""We are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack,"" Huang said. He gave the example that ""voice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that.""

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP has tapped law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP for financial restructuring advice, as its potential liabilities swell with a wave of lawsuits over the opioid addiction epidemic sweeping the United States, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Purdue and other opioid manufacturers, including Endo International Plc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), have been fighting hundreds of lawsuits filed by U.S. states, counties and cities accusing the drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would like to bring a federal lawsuit against the companies over the opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 49,000 deaths in the United States last year.
The sources that disclosed the appointment of Davis Polk asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
""Purdue is preparing for a bright future that includes diversification into non-opioid products,"" Purdue told Reuters in a statement.
The privately held company said that it retains firms with a variety of expertise but declines to discuss publicly who those firms are and the reasons for which they are retained
Davis Polk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Purdue has been participating in settlement talks with lawyers for the plaintiffs, who have often compared the cases to the litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.
The lawsuits have accused Purdue of deceiving doctors and patients and of misrepresenting the risks of addiction and death associated with the prolonged use of its prescription opioids. The company has denied the allegations.
At least 27 states and Puerto Rico have sued Purdue. New York became the latest state to sue Purdue, in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday alleging that the company sought to boost profits at the cost of lives.
The drugmaker, which is owned by the Sackler family, announced in June that it had laid off 350 employees including the remainder of its sales force, which had been reduced in February when Purdue said it would stop sending representatives to doctors' offices to discuss the pain medications.
The company currently has 550 employees and has focused its efforts on developing medications for sleep disorders and cancer. 

In July, Steve Miller, a restructuring veteran who recently retired as chief executive of automotive supplier International Automotive Components Group and is the author of ""The Turnaround Kid,"" joined Purdue's board as the chairman.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Encouraged by online sales, Nordstrom raises full-year profit forecast","By Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Upscale department store  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) saw its shares soar as much as 14 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly same-store sales growth, as more people shopped at its online stores.
For 2018, the Seattle, Washington-based company expects an adjusted profit of $3.50 to $3.65 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $3.35 to $3.55.
Nordstrom managed to report upbeat results despite the problems in the broader retail sector, which has suffered from fast-changing fashion trends and discount-hungry shoppers who favor buying online. 
In large part, analysts said, the results showed Nordstrom successfully boosted online traffic and transactions by promoting blowout sales on social media and making the in-store and online purchasing processes more frictionless for shoppers.
Earlier on Thursday, J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) shares sank below $2 for the first time after it said it had alienated core middle-aged customers while chasing millennial buyers, and the venerable brand forecast an unexpectedly large loss.
At Nordstrom, online sales, helped by online promotions, rose 23 percent and accounted for 34 percent of total sales.
""We feel like their inventory doesn't have a huge overlap with Amazon's,"" Director of Capital Markets at asset management firm Exponential ETFs Josh Blechman said. ""Because it is a little bit higher-end, that sort of lets their online offerings to shine more.""
On a conference call with investors, Nordstrom's Co-President Blake Nordstrom also highlighted the competitive advantage Nordstrom has because of its inventory and product assortment.
""The strength of our inventory position allowed us to be fluid and respond quickly. We took swift action to accelerate inventory turns, strengthen our core assortment and improve our execution in stores.""
Nordstrom's discount Rack stores, Co-President Nordstrom said, saw the biggest inventory change. 
Same-stores sales rose 4 percent in the second quarter ended Aug. 4 across both full-price and off-price, beating the average analyst estimate of a rise of 0.81 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding items, the company earned 95 cents per share, beating estimates of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net sales rose about 7 percent to $3.98 billion, higher than the $3.72 billion analysts had expected, and boosted by the timing of its Anniversary Sale.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>",White House counsel asked FCC chair about Sinclair Tribune merger status,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House counsel Don McGahn called the head of Federal Communications Commission in July to ask about the status of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc’s (O:SBGI) now abandoned $3.9 billion acquisition of  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO).
FCC chairman Ajit Pai disclosed the call in testimony on Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel. Pai said the call from McGahn came around the same time he issued a July 16 statement that said he had ""serious concerns"" about the proposed takeover and proposed referring the matter to an administrative law judge.
The call suggested unusual interest by the White House in the status of a planned acquisition by a company that President Donald Trump has publicly supported. Pai said that McGahn did not express a view on the merger. He said that the counsel had seen a news report ""and wanted to know what ... the action was."" 
The collapse of the deal, hatched 15 months ago, potentially ended Sinclair’s hopes of building a national conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (O:FOXA) Fox News.
Pai said on July 16 that evidence uncovered by the FCC suggested some proposed divestitures of stations by Sinclair would allow the company to control them ""in practice, even if not in name, in violation of the law."" He recommended the merger be referred for an administrative hearing. The FCC said later that Sinclair ""did not fully disclose facts"" about the merger.
The following week, Trump tweeted: ""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People."" Trump also tweeted support for Sinclair in April.
Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August 2017 that Sinclair forces its TV stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.” Sinclair has previously denied the charge that it is biased in favor of Republicans, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
The White House did not immediately comment on the McGahn call.
Pai agreed to turn over a written summary of the conversation to Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.
Last week, Tribune terminated the deal and sued Sinclair for breach of contract, claiming the rival TV-station owner mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.

Sinclair, the largest U.S. broadcast station owner with 192 stations, said last week it would no longer pursue the Tribune merger and denied Tribune’s allegations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock exchange operator IEX Group has withdrawn a stalled proposal with U.S. regulators for a new corporate listings program in partnership with a Silicon Valley-based startup aimed at promoting long-term growth ahead of short-term profits.
IEX, which in March asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to let the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) run an independent listings program on IEX's Investors' Exchange, withdrew the proposal in a letter to the SEC dated Aug. 15.
SEC staff initially approved the LTSE plan on June 29. But in a setback to both IEX and LTSE, the regulator stayed the approval indefinitely on the same day, pending further review.
""After consulting with LTSE and other stakeholders, IEX decided to withdraw the filing, and we are now discussing next steps,"" IEX spokeswoman Sara Forster said in an email on Thursday. ""IEX continues to support LTSE's mission.""
IEX, or the Investors Exchange, still intends to list companies under its own program, which was approved by the SEC in October.
The LTSE plan was announced in December and would have bound participating companies to strict standards of corporate governance around things like executive compensation, disclosure, shareholder voting and board and stakeholder policies.
For example, more director compensation would be stock-based and tied to long periods, and shareholders who hold stock for longer periods of time would accrue more voting rights.
LTSE was started by Eric Ries, who wrote the book ""The Lean Startup,"" and has advised hundreds of companies on growth plans. 
LTSE has made progress on building its own stock exchange, but the timeline for a launch is uncertain due to regulatory and other factors, Ries said in a telephone interview.
""It's always been our plan to build an exchange and nothing has changed from that goal,"" he said. 
IEX, which went live as a stock exchange in 2016, has yet to poach any companies for its listing program from Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) or Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange, which hold a near duopoly on listings. 
Casino magnate Steve Wynn, an early investor in IEX, had said he would consider moving Wynn Resorts Ltd's (O:WYNN) stock to the Investors Exchange. But Wynn has since resigned from Wynn Resorts amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
Company shares can trade on any of the 13 U.S. exchanges, regardless of where they are listed, but listings fees and corporate services offer a steady stream of revenue to host exchanges.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's No.1 retirement and wealth management company AMP Ltd paid hundreds of millions of dollars from customers' retirement accounts to its subsidiaries without proper documentation, an inquiry heard on Thursday.
The disclosures are the latest blow to the once-venerable firm which could face criminal charges over misconduct earlier uncovered by the inquiry. AMP has lost almost 30 percent of its market value since the inquiry began in February.
Richard Allert, chairman of AMP Super, which by law must manage retirement savings in the best interests of customers, said under questioning that he was surprised to see internal company documents tabled at the inquiry saying the transfers were not legally documented.
Michael Hodge, a barrister assisting the commission, asked Allert whether as chairman of the trustee it ""seems strange"" that such payments would have been made ""without any documented arrangement"". 
""I understood that those arrangements were documented,"" Allert replied. 
""Did you ask any questions?"" Hodge asked. 
""I can't remember,"" Allert said.
The inquiry heard AMP Super had a small oversight team and Allert was not always involved in reviewing the performance of related funds.
He explained how AMP's pension fund business subcontracted four other companies - AMP Life, NMMT Ltd, AMP Services and AMP Capital - in a way that resulted in payments for services which were not fully disclosed to fund members.
Lawyer Suzanne Mackenzie, the former chair of the Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia, told Reuters the hearing raised questions about whether the firm was meeting its legal obligations to act in the interests of members.
""They basically outsourced to other entities within AMP who don’t have the same duty to members as the trustee has,"" she told Reuters.
""Assurance that the best interests duty is fulfilled therefore largely relies on adequate supervision of the other AMP entities and then being in a position to hold them to account.”
AMP spokeswoman Audrey Blackburn said the firm rejected any suggestion it had breached laws surrounding the management of pension trusts.
""There has been no such suggestion in the commission that AMP has contravened trust laws,"" she told Reuters. 
While members' funds were being used to pay fees to AMP subsidiaries, members with AMP cash accounts were being charged fees that in some cases wiped out their returns, the commission heard.
Pressed by Hodge about why that would be the case, Allert responded: ""They left the cash there knowing the return they're getting"".
A confidential internal analysis showed the performance of several of AMP's pension products ranked near the bottom of the industry once fees and charges were included.
CASH INVESTMENTS
Documents presented at the inquiry showed AMP also had misrepresented as cash what were in fact investments in risky credit instruments rated as low as 'BBB-' by credit agencies, only one notch away from being called ""junk"" investments. The superannuation regulator is investigating this issue.
The year-long inquiry is currently examining the A$2.6 trillion ($1.89 trillion) retirement sector, having already exposed widespread wrongdoing in the banking and wealth management industries.
AMP posted its worst first-half net profit in 15 years on Aug. 8 as it set aside cash to compensate customers it had sold bad advice. While it has admitted wrongdoing on a large scale, it has denied criminal behaviour.
In previous hearings, the inquiry heard century-old AMP had charged clients for advice without providing it and had plotted at board level to conceal the practice from regulators.
In other developments on Thursday, the inquiry heard Australia and New Zealand Banking Group sold over A$3 billion worth of complex pension products without proper advice to customers.
In July, the corporate regulator intervened to stop the practice.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Information about Elon Musk's efforts to take Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) private is scarce. But some small investors wonder if top funds have an edge.
In a blog post on Monday https:// the Tesla chief executive said he would sound out some of his largest shareholders on the idea. The list could include T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) and Fidelity Investments, which each have had a good run with the stock. 
Some stockholders worry the meetings could yield details not available to smaller investors, a tension that is emerging more often as big funds own larger stakes in companies and stress their frequent talks with U.S. corporations.
Some small investors say they do not expect a level informational playing field when it comes to Tesla, whose shares have been whipsawed by Musk's unpredictable tweets.
Adam Grossman, principal of Mayport Wealth Management in Newton, Massachusetts said he has avoided owning Tesla for clients except through indexes, partly to limit the risk of missing out on color Musk could share with a small circle. 
""If you're a big portfolio manager and able to sit in a room with Elon Musk, you'll pick up information"" not available to others, Grossman said in an interview on Thursday.
Practically, small investors are going to be left out of the loop by Musk's outreach, said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of investment manager KraneShares, with an estimated several thousand Tesla shares.
Big funds speaking with Musk ""are going to be getting the proverbial keys to the kingdom, and others are on the outside,"" Ahern said. 
A Tesla spokesman did not comment for this article.
Musk said in his blog he needed to be forthcoming with top shareholders about his plans to take Tesla private at $420 per share. ""However, it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,"" he wrote, leading to his public announcement of his intentions. 
A plan would also need regulatory and shareholder approval, Musk wrote.
Harvard Law School professor John Coates said U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules on fair disclosure allow the selective sharing of some details if recipients agree not to trade until what they are told becomes public. But it is hard to know how those limits might play out for Musk's outreach.
""With Tesla however nothing normal is normal. So who knows,"" Coates said via email.
This month is not the first time Musk has lifted the curtain on his talks with top holders. In June 2016 Musk mentioned talking with institutions about combining Tesla and SolarCity Corp, [SCTY.N] a deal that came together later that year. https://reut.rs/2nGAFgN
Representatives for Fidelity and T. Rowe Price declined to comment. Neither firm has shared its thinking about Musk's take-private idea or said much to explain their second-quarter share sales. Collectively T Rowe funds cut their Tesla stakes by 24 percent to 11.9 million shares at June 30, while Fidelity funds cut their stakes 21 percent to 11.2 million at the same point, filings show.
Unlike index funds that would likely have to sell a privatized Tesla, both big firms run funds with big stakes in closely held companies.
To be sure, not all of Tesla's smaller investors are concerned about Musk sharing details selectively. Louis Albanese, managing partner of Catamount Wealth Management, with about 8,000 Tesla shares, said the key is that all shareholders eventually receive the same buyout offer, as he expects. 

""It's not like these guys are going to get $420 (per share), and everybody else gets $350,"" Albanese said.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 05:12PM ET</span>","Italy opens probe into operator of collapsed bridge, investors dump shares","By Ilaria Polleschi
GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's government opened an investigation on Thursday into the country's biggest toll-road operator, hours after saying it could face a heavy fine or lose its concession over a bridge collapse that killed at least 38 people.
A section of the bridge gave way on Tuesday in busy lunchtime traffic, plunging dozens of vehicles 50m (160 feet) below and engulfing Autostrade per l'Italia into a political fire storm.
Shares in the operator's parent, Milan-listed international  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), fell by as much as 25 percent at one point as investors spooked by threats of government retaliation dumped the stock. They closed down around 22 percent at 18.3 euros.
Shares in other toll-road firms such as SIAS (MI:SIS) and ASTM (MI:ATMI) also fell, after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the state would have to take over the country's motorways if concession-holders could not do the job properly.
Launching its investigation late on Thursday, the Transport Ministry said it had given Autostrade 15 days to show it had met all its contractual obligations, adding it wanted the company to rebuild the bridge at its own expense.
If the justifications provided by the company were judged inadequate Rome would consider it a breach of the concession terms.
Earlier Deputy Transport Minister Edoardo said Autostrade, owned by Italy's Benetton family, could lose its concession as it had failed to ensure the viaduct's safety. 
""The options we're looking at are the full revocation, the revocation of just the A10 section or a penalty, but a 150 million euro ($170 million) penalty is too low,"" Rixi told Reuters.
Under the terms of the concession Autostrade can be fined up to 150 million euros.
A government source separately suggested Italy may impose a fine rather than withdraw Autostrade's concession as the latter could involve a long legal fight and risk the government being ordered to pay compensation to the company.
Autostrade says it made regular, thorough safety checks on the 1.2 km-long viaduct, part of a motorway linking the port city of Genoa with southern France, and had used world-leading experts when conducting the tests and inspections.
Autostrade will hold an extraordinary board meeting on the crisis next week a source close to the matter said.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the reasons behind the bridge collapse, but have yet to publicly identify the cause.

STATE FUNERAL
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has declared a state of emergency for Genoa, one of Italy's busiest ports, whose main land corridor with France has effectively been severed.
In the valley below the shattered structure, cranes moved away chunks of debris on Thursday as rescue teams searched for survivors under the rubble of a bridge completed in 1967 and overhauled just two years ago.
Genoa's chief prosecutor, Francesco Cozzi, said 10-20 people were still missing. 
A state funeral for the victims will take place in Genoa on Saturday, officials said, as the coffins of some of the dead were laid out in a hospital chapel.
One man stood in silence with his hands on the coffin in front of him. Other relatives were comforted by family members as they wiped away their tears.
Italy's ruling coalition has threatened to break EU budget rules if needs be to repair infrastructure and ensure there's not repeat of the disaster.
A spokesman for the executive European Commission rebuffed any suggestion EU spending rules were crimping action by Italy, saying Rome was getting 2.5 billion euros from EU coffers for investments in network infrastructure in 2014-2020.
""Even without this tragedy the likelihood of the Italian government testing the EU's patience with respect to its budget rules was always likely to be there,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.
""And we've seen that in the way that the investors are reacting around the bond markets. What this has done I think is act as a bit of a lightning rod for investors.""
Bonds issued by Atlantia and its Autostrade per l'Italia unit have fallen sharply since Tuesday and now trade at record lows. A document detailing the terms for 3.2 billion euros worth of bonds guaranteed by Autostrade show that an early termination of the motorway concession would give bondholders a right to demand an early repayment.
Bankers and analysts said Atlantia was less likely to bid for major projects abroad given the threat of punitive government measures against its Autostrade unit. Autostrade is 88 percent owned by Atlantia and accounts for around 66 pct of its revenues.
""Atlantia is 100 percent focused on handling the Genoa crisis,"" a source familiar with the matter said. ""I can't see them investing any resources into a new bidding process.""

298,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 04:48PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Nvidia Shares Fall on Weak Guidance
Chip stocks could face weakness tomorrow after Nvidia issued softer-than-expected guidance when it released quarterly results after the bell.
The company said it expected revenue in the current quarter to be $3.25 billion, lower than Wall Street expectations of $3.34 billion. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock fell more than 5% after hours.
Nvidia noted significant weakness in its cryptocurrency mining business.
“Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward,” the company said in a statement.
Deere (NYSE:DE) is the lone major company reporting earnings before the bell tomorrow. Analysts are looking for a profit of $2.73 per share on revenue of about $9.2 billion.
But more of interest to the broader market would be any insight into how the trade battle with China is affecting demand for the company’s equipment and costs.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed Thursday that Washington and Beijing will resume trade talks by the end of August, leading to hopes that the world’s two largest economies will begin to tone down tit-for-tat tariffs and avoid a global economic meltdown.
2. Consumer Confidence in the Crosshairs
Consumer sentiment will be the highlight of the economic calendar tomorrow.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of August consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that the index rose to 98.1 from 97.9 in July.
Fed heads will likely be looking at the report’s inflation expectations component, which was at 2.9% last month.
The consumer is showing strength if the latest batch of retail earnings are anything to go by. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) was the latest to post very strong numbers, sending its stock soaring today.
3. Crude Set for Another Losing Week
Oil trading has been active this week and crude oil prices are on track for third-straight weekly drop, despite rising today. Expectations for steeper losses of Iran crude has struggled to stem the slide in prices.
Crude futures recouped some of their losses from a day earlier on hopes about U.S.-China trade talks. China is the world's largest oil importer.
But prices fell to a two-month low on Wednesday as inventories unexpectedly rose and a U.S.-Turkey feud fueled fears of contagion in emerging markets dimming the outlook for oil demand.
At 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT) tomorrow, Baker Hughes will report its weekly rig numbers. The numbers of U.S. oil rigs in operation was at 869 last week."
299,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Walmex to enter newly opened Mexican retail fuel market,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Wal Mart de Mexico (MX:WALMEX), Mexico's biggest retailer, said on Thursday that it will open gas stations alongside its domestic stores, joining other private companies that are now competing with Pemex, the country's former monopoly fuel seller.
Retail and convenience store chains are especially well positioned to tap into Mexico's retail gasoline market, given their existing networks of stores where motorists can buy snacks and sodas while filling up their tanks.
Wal-Mart de Mexico, known as Walmex, said its ""first phase"" includes six sites in the states of Tabasco, Nuevo Leon, Veracruz and Mexico, installed in shopping centers or parking lots of its Walmart, Sam's Club and Bodega Aurrera stores. 
Private companies began jumping into Mexico's retail fuel market after a 2013-14 energy sector overhaul ended state-owned oil company Pemex's monopoly, which ranged from crude oil production to retail fuel sales and lasted for decades.
Mexico, the second-biggest economy in Latin America, is one of the world's biggest gasoline consumers and the top foreign importer of U.S. gasoline. The country boasts some 11,400 gas stations, the vast majority of which remain Pemex franchises and continue to buy Pemex wholesale fuel.
Foreign oil companies including Spain's Repsol (MC:REP), France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) operate hundreds of gas stations, while Mexican retailer Femsa (MX:FMSAUBD) runs 500 under its Oxxo convenience store brand.
Walmex, with 2,395 stores across Mexico, did not say how many fueling stations it ultimately plans to open, or over what time period. Its U.S. parent company, Walmart (N:WMT), has long partnered with fuel retailer Murphy USA (K:MUSA) on gas stations near its stores, which participate in a Walmart discount program. 
Walmex fuel sales are intended to complement the company's existing businesses by offering gas at competitive prices and enticing motorists into stores, spokeswoman Gabriela Buenrostro said.
""In a single stop, they will be able to come to our stores and clubs to buy the merchandise they want as well as refuel gas in a safe and trustworthy way,"" she said in a statement. 

Other new players in the retail fuel market, such as Britain's  BP  (L:BP), have emphasized customer service to compete against Pemex, whose gas stations have long been criticized and sanctioned for not selling complete liters of fuel.

Emerging-market sovereign dollar-denominated debt is trading at a wider premium than speculative-grade U.S. companies -- a break from historic norms -- underscoring economic and political stresses around the world, while America Inc. powers ahead.
The asset class typically trades at a lower spread than American high-yield bonds, helped by higher credit ratings on average.
Trade angst, dollar strength and contagion from Turkey have taken the shine off developing-economy assets, including those denominated in dollars. Meanwhile, robust earnings growth and a tax package that encourages deleveraging among indebted firms have combined to bolster American balance sheets.
For example, dollar debt issued by Argentina due 2028 now yields about 2.4 percentage points more than similar-duration notes sold by junk-rated Sprint Corp., a U.S. telecom company, after trading at a lower level as recently as May.
Another sign of diverging risk appetites: the extreme gap between implied currency volatility in the emerging world and that of the Group of Seven nations, rarely seen over the past 18 years.
There are takeaways in all this for bulls and bears. Either the global rout will hit U.S. assets soon enough, or the notable underpeformance of emerging markets relative to developed counterparts looks poised to end."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's second-largest e-commerce firm, JD.com Inc, said it is shifting management of its warehousing assets to a separate unit, in a move it hopes will revive profits after it swung back to a loss in April-June.
JD.com, which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google as investors, has been in and out of the red for the past year and on Thursday reported a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million.
That was nearly double forecasts for a $177 million loss in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 18 analysts and reflected increased investments and slower sales.
In a call with analysts on Thursday, executives said that they expect the new unit, which will oversee warehouse sales and warehouse management services, to help offset hefty technology investments as the company battles  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd for market share.
JD.com currently owns roughly 2.5 million square meters of warehouse space, part of it acquired in recent years on beneficial terms with local governments that are looking to boost job creation and which will soon start to yield returns.
""(These) initiatives are yet to provide meaningful financial results but we believe we've made good traction since doubling down on technology last year,"" JD.com's Chief Financial Officer Sidney Huang said. 
""We expect the monetization of our logistic properties, when realized, will compensate part or all of the additional investments,"" Huang said. 
Huang said that some, but not all, of the revenue from the new unit would become visible in the company's financials within six to 12 months.
JD.com's shares were up nearly 1 percent on New York's Nasdaq on Thursday but are down more than 20 percent since the start of the year.
The drop echoes extended slides by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com investor Tencent Holdings Ltd, amid analyst concerns over the health of Chinese tech stocks. 
SOFT SALES
JD.com's sales volumes are historically higher in the second quarter due to the company's mid-year shopping festival '618', an 18-day event, but profits took a hit this year when sales dropped unexpectedly toward the end of the festival, executives said.
JD.com reported sales of 159 billion yuan during 618, up 33 percent from a year earlier but lower than analysts expected due to crossovers with national holidays. 
""In the last 10 days of June we started to observe a softness in our sales growth, but we've seen recovery in August,"" said Huang. 
Executives have blamed unfair competitive tactics by market leader Alibaba for harming JD.com's clothing sales and creating a ""ripple effect"" that negatively affects other categories. Alibaba has previously denied its strategies are unfair. 
JD.com forecast revenue growth for the third quarter of between 25-30 percent, skewing lower than an average estimate of 29.8 percent in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll. 
The company reported a 31.2 percent rise in revenue to 122.3 billion yuan for the quarter ended June 30, marginally below an average estimate of 122.7 billion yuan from 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 02:49PM ET</span>","Angry, yes. But anti-business? Italy likely to contain its bridge rage","By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government has unnerved investors with its angry reaction to this week's deadly bridge collapse, threatening to renationalize toll roads and accusing its predecessors of being in thrall to big business.
But as the new anti-establishment government barks at the private sector, and at motorway operator Autostrade per l'Italia in particular, sources close to the government said it would not bite, at least not so hard as to frighten off investment.
Even delivering on the prime minister's threat to revoke Autostrade's nationwide concession could be unaffordable for the heavily indebted state. It may settle for a heavy fine instead, two government sources said.
Assuming Rome emerged victorious from appeals Autostrade could lodge in the courts, it would have to pay between 15 and 20 billion euros ($17-$23 billion) to compensate the company for investments in the motorway network, sector experts told Reuters.
""The government will certainly take action against the concession holder,"" Deputy Transport Minister Edoardo Rixi told Reuters. ""We don't need to wait for investigations because it has objective responsibility for underestimating the risk."" 
However Rixi, from the right-wing League party, added that the action will not necessarily be revoking the concession. It could be a fine, or only withdrawing the concession for the single motorway that collapsed, he said.
The government has kept investors on edge since it took office in June, seeking to rewrite a contract to sell a major steel plant and sometimes speaking out against large infrastructure projects already under way.
A government source from the 5-Star Movement, the League's coalition partner, confirmed it was ""possible"" that Rome's attack on Autostrade would end in no more than a fine. 
The message was different earlier in the day from Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of 5-Star.
""We have to end the contract. If these people are incapable of running our motorways ... it means the state will do it itself,"" he told reporters. He denied the government would have to pay any penalty if it could prove Autostrade was at fault.
SHARE DIVE
Shares in Autostrade's parent company  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) closed down 22 percent on Thursday after falling as much as 25 percent in early trading.
Some commentators say the clash with Autostrade may increase suspicions in the business community that the government has a punitive approach to private enterprise. 
""It is worth thinking about whether this further fuels the populist feeling across Italy and elsewhere,"" said a fund manager at a large London-based investor.
""The government has been quick to blame others - the EU, the company itself. It will certainly raise some issues with many other companies in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Rome has already said it could pull out of other multi-billion-euro business commitments it inherited from previous governments. These include a high-speed rail link between Turin and Lyon, a pipeline transporting gas to Europe from Azerbaijan and a commitment to sell Europe's largest steel plant to the multinational AcelorMittal (AS:MT).
However, coalition officials deny the government is hostile to companies. They point out that the electoral base of the League is among the small-and-medium-sized enterprises in Italy's richest northern regions.
""This is actually a very pro-business government,"" said Carla Ruocco, a prominent 5-Star Movement lawmaker and president of the lower-house finance committee.
She told Reuters the coalition wants to eliminate the cronyism by which previous Italian governments had offered concessions to its business friends on favorable terms, and this would help competition and free up resources for infrastructure, especially in the poor south.
""I think investors have an interest in a more healthy state and a level playing field,"" she said, adding that government plans to cut taxes, simplify bureaucracy and give income support to the poor should also be welcomed by business.

""We want to redistribute wealth, help domestic demand and recreate a middle class that can play a constructive role in society like it used to,"" she said. ""Isn't that a pro-business agenda?""

310,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. energy chief applauds Mexico's plan to end fuel imports,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the goal set out by Mexico's incoming president to end massive gasoline and diesel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, as a measure that will boost prosperity in its southern neighbor.
During a visit on Wednesday to the Mexican capital in which he met with both current officials as well as key advisers to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Perry brushed off concerns that U.S. refiners stand to lose their biggest foreign market.
""It's a good goal for Mexico. I tip my hat to the president-elect for having that as a goal,"" said Perry, a former governor of Texas, the most prominent energy producing and refining U.S. state. ""I hope they're successful with that transition.""
So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of 1.19 million barrels per day (bpd) of fuel including gasoline and diesel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Fuel imports now represent 60 percent of the country's total consumption, as crude processing at Mexico's domestic refineries has steadily declined.
Lopez Obrador won a landslide victory last month and in December will take office as Mexico's first leftist president in decades. 
He has repeatedly promised to end foreign gasoline imports within three years and grow domestic production of value-added fuels at home, pledging to revive the six existing state-owned refineries operated by national oil company Pemex, as well as build a new one.
""That's not going to happen overnight. He knows that, we know that,"" Perry told a group of reporters on Wednesday afternoon after meeting with Lopez Obrador's designated chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, and his future energy minister Rocio Nahle.
He said Romo also met with David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury Department's under secretary for international affairs.
""What I heard today was a bit of realism from both Nahle and Romo,"" he added, without going into further detail.
The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which represents U.S. refiners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Perry's statement.
Perry pointed to growing South American markets as potential new buyers of U.S. refined products, noting that Venezuela's oil output has plummeted amid a major economic crisis.

""We're going to have more markets, most likely, than we're going to have product,"" he said.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. seed sellers push for limits on Monsanto, BASF weed killer","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - America's two biggest independent seed sellers, Beck's Hybrids and Stine Seed, told Reuters they are pushing U.S. environmental regulators to bar farmers from spraying dicamba weed killer during upcoming summers in a potential blow to Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co. 
Limiting spraying of the chemical to the spring season, before crops are planted, would prevent farmers from using the herbicide on dicamba-resistant soybeans that Monsanto engineered. The seeds are sold by companies including Beck's and Stine. 
Last summer, after farmers planted Monsanto's dicamba-resistant soy seeds en masse, the herbicide drifted onto nearby farms and damaged an estimated 3.6 million acres of non-resistant soybeans, or 4 percent of all U.S. plantings.
Problems have not gone away. As of July 15, the University of Missouri estimated that more than a million acres of non-resistant soybeans were hurt by dicamba. Homeowners who live near farms have also complained of damage to their trees and flowers. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is now weighing such complaints as part of a high-stakes decision on the herbicide's future. 
Bayer bought Monsanto and its portfolio of dicamba-resistant Xtend brand soy seeds for $63 billion this year in a deal that created the world's largest seed and pesticides maker.
St. Louis-based Monsanto sells dicamba herbicide, along with rivals BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and DowDuPont Inc. Monsanto and BASF said farmers need dicamba to kill tough weeds and that the chemical can be used safely. DowDuPont declined to comment.
Monsanto is banking on Xtend soybean seeds to dominate soy production in the United States, the world's biggest producer. They are seen as a replacement for the company's Roundup Ready line of seeds, engineered to tolerate the weed killer glyphosate, which has lost effectiveness as weeds develop their own tolerance to the chemical.
EPA approval for dicamba to be sprayed on resistant crops expires this autumn. The agency could extend its approval, with or without new restrictions on use, or take dicamba off the market. Seed companies expect a decision in the coming weeks. 
Most complaints about dicamba drifting would stop if the EPA restricted its use to killing weeds in fields before crops are planted, Beck's Hybrids told the agency in a July 27 letter seen by Reuters. 
""Anybody that sprays it, you have issues with the volatilization,"" CEO Sonny Beck said in an interview on Wednesday, referring to the chemical vaporizing and drifting. 
Though his company profited from selling more than a million bags of Xtend soybean seeds this year, Beck said he worried that continued problems with the chemical could give the agriculture sector a bad reputation among consumers.
Restricting use would also help prevent weeds from developing resistance to dicamba, he said.
New limits would be another headache for Bayer, following its acquisition of Monsanto. 
Last week a California jury ruled Monsanto must pay $289 million in damages in the first U.S. lawsuit over alleged links between glyphosate and cancer. Monsanto denies glyphosate causes cancer. 
Earlier this month, a Brazilian judge suspended the use of products containing glyphosate. 
MONSANTO EXPECTS EPA NOD
Monsanto has blamed U.S. field damage from dicamba largely on improper applications by farmers and says mandatory training helped this year.
Inquiries to the company about dicamba problems dropped to about nine per million acres of dicamba-resistant crops planted, down from about 40 inquiries per million acres last year, said Ryan Rubischko, who heads the company's dicamba portfolio. He said Monsanto expects the EPA to extend its approval for dicamba.
In a sign the company is concerned, however, Monsanto has asked seed sellers to contact the agency to express support for the product, according to an email the company sent this week that was seen by Reuters. The email noted others had encouraged the EPA to add restrictions on dicamba or prevent sales.
Monsanto likened those efforts to an ""uninformed vocal minority"" in the email. Rubischko confirmed the company had asked dicamba users to give positive feedback to regulators. 
The EPA did not respond to requests for comment.
The agency has held weekly phone calls with agriculture officials in farm states this summer to assess dicamba damage. Agency officials also visited farms in Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas to see damaged crops first-hand, according to tour participants.
Farther north, Monsanto funded a study by University of Wisconsin researchers that showed dicamba hurt non-resistant soybeans that were covered with plastic when the chemical was sprayed on nearby Xtend soybeans after planting. 
Stine Seed has told the EPA in writing and conversations that dicamba should not be sprayed on top of growing soybeans to control weeds, CEO Harry Stine said in an interview on Tuesday. The herbicide has damaged fields of Stine soy seeds by drifting, he said.
Stine Seed is preparing to launch products that will compete with Xtend soy and also works with Monsanto on seed technology.

""I've been doing this for 50 years and we've never had anything be as damaging as this dicamba situation,"" Harry Stine said. ""In this case, Monsanto made an error.""

312,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 01:57PM ET</span>",Illness at Ohio Chipotle caused by food-borne bacteria: local officials,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - A type of bacteria found in meat and pre-cooked food left at unsafe temperatures was responsible for sickening hundreds of people who ate at a Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) restaurant in Ohio, local health officials said on Thursday.
The outbreak last month was the latest in a series of food safety lapses at the burrito chain, and health officials said it was caused by the clostridium perfringens bacterium, which often infects food that is prepared in large quantities and kept warm for a long time.
The resulting illnesses are fairly common and affect nearly 1 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People usually recover in a day or two and the infection cannot spread from person to person.
Customers had last month complained of food poisoning and diarrhea after eating tacos and burrito bowls at the Powell, Ohio Chipotle restaurant.
Health officials said 647 people had self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms after eating there between July 26 and July 30. A specific food has not been identified as the source of the illness, and the CDC is conducting further tests, they added.
Though not as severe as Chipotle's food safety lapses in 2015 that sickened customers with E. coli and salmonella, the outbreak in Ohio is a headache for CEO Brian Niccol, who has been trying to repair Chipotle's reputation.
""With all of Brian Niccol's turnaround efforts, you really have to have food safety as a foundation of what you do,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said.
Chipotle's leadership will retrain restaurant employees nationwide about food safety and wellness protocols during working hours starting next week, company spokeswoman Laurie Schalow via email.
The burrito chain will not close any restaurants and will add a recurring online employee assessment for food safety standards. In 2016, Chipotle shut all its stores for a few hours for food safety training.

Chipotle shares reversed course to fall 3.8 percent on Thursday afternoon after hitting a two-year high earlier.

Lighthizer made the remarks at White House meeting of President Trump's Cabinet. Trump told Lighthizer he was in no rush for a resolution over the pact and to walk away from talks if need be.
""We’re either going to do a fair NAFTA for us or we're not going to do NAFTA at all,"" Trump said. ""If you can’t make the right deal, don’t make it.""
U.S. negotiations with Mexico are set to continue Thursday afternoon.
U.S-Mexico talks resumed in July, without Canada, after negotiations involving all three members of the $1.2 trillion trade bloc stalled in June.

Mexican officials on Wednesday said that Mexico and the United States may not meet their goal to finish talks by the end of August.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>","Walmart posts biggest U.S. sales rise in a decade, shares soar","By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) posted its best quarterly U.S. sales growth in a decade and upped full-year sales and profit outlooks on Thursday, sending shares surging as a jump in online and grocery purchases showed it can hold its own against Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
The world's largest retailer is known for its sprawling stores, a factor that could have worked against it as shoppers migrate online. But Walmart is also the top U.S. grocer, providing a lure for customers to visit stores, where they may also make other impulse buys. 
Walmart has also overhauled its website and worked to use physical locations as distribution points for online orders of groceries and other goods, helping retain buyers who increasingly expect quick, cheap shipping. 
Consumers spent more on categories like grocery, apparel and seasonal merchandise in the second quarter, helping sales rebound after a slow start in April. Walmart has recorded four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer.
""We saw strong performance in fresh food,"" U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said on an earnings conference call, praising sales in produce, meat and bakery. Grocery sales rose the most in nine years.
Walmart benefited from improved weather in May, the first month of the quarter, seeing the biggest quarterly gain in customer traffic in more than six years, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters.
Rising wages, lower unemployment and tax cuts that have put more money in U.S. consumers' pockets this year also helped.
""(This) is a reflection of Walmart's various in-store and online initiatives, and likely an indication of solid market share gains, and an overall healthy consumer backdrop,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note.
Walmart's U.S. e-commerce growth ticked higher than previous quarters, driven by a website redesign and continued expansion of online grocery offerings.
Sales growth has come at some cost, however, with the company citing continued margin pressures driven by cutting prices, higher freight costs due to a shortage of truck drivers and e-commerce investments.
Walmart's shares were up 10 percent at $99.08. The company's stock had fallen around 9 percent since the start of the year.
STRONG ONLINE SALES
Walmart raised its sales and earnings outlook for the full year, excluding any impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce company Flipkart, which it is still in the process of closing. 
E-commerce sales grew 40 percent in the quarter, up from 33 percent growth in the previous period, and the retailer said U.S. online sales are on track to rise 40 percent for the full year.
Walmart now offers curbside pickup of online grocery orders in 1,800 U.S. stores, and the service is bringing in new customers, Biggs said. 
A sharp online sales slowdown during the crucial holiday months had spooked investors, who worried the retailer would not be able to keep pace with Amazon.
Cowen & Co estimates that 86 percent of Walmart shoppers also shop on Amazon. 
Still, e-commerce losses could be higher this year than last year as it continues to invest in the business, Walmart's e-commerce chief Marc Lore said on the call.
Gross margins fell for the fifth consecutive quarter and were down 17 basis points, the company said.
OVERSEAS SALES JUMP
International sales were up 3.1 percent at $29.2 billion on a constant currency basis, helped by strong comparable sales in Mexico, Britain, Canada and China.
Separately, Asda, Walmart's British supermarket arm, reported a 2.6 percent rise in quarterly sales on Thursday, ahead of an expected takeover by bigger rival Sainsbury's (L:SBRY). 
Walmart sold a majority stake in ASDA to Sainbury's in April.
In June, Walmart sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. It paid $16 billion for a majority stake in Flipkart.
The retailer also reached agreements to sell its banking operations in Walmart Canada and Walmart Chile.
Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 4.5 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, higher than analyst forecasts of 2.38 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Excluding one-time items such as a loss related to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, Walmart earned $1.29 per share, ahead of analysts' expectations of $1.22 per share.
Total revenue increased 3.8 percent to $128 billion, beating estimates of $125.97 billion.

For the full year, Walmart expects to earn between $4.90 and $5.05 per share, up from a range of $4.75 to $5 a share. The retailer said same-store sales in the United States should rise about 3 percent in fiscal 2019, up from a prior target of at least 2 percent.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>","Wall Street gains on Walmart and Cisco earnings, trade optimism","By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose about 1 percent on Thursday, helped by upbeat earnings from Walmart and Cisco and easing trade worries after the United States and China said they would hold talks later this month.
Walmart shares (N:WMT) surged 10.2 percent, the most on the S&P 500, after the retailer said U.S. comparable sales grew the most in a decade and posted strong e-commerce sales.
The S&P retailers index <.SPXRT> gained 0.81 percent. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology stocks (SPLRCT) up 0.92 percent.
Cisco (O:CSCO) rose 3.7 percent after posting quarterly results and first-quarter sales forecast that topped Wall Street expectations.
Symantec (O:SYMC) jumped 7.1 percent after hedge fund Starboard Value disclosed a stake in the cyber-security firm and nominated five directors to its board.
""When you have a solid earnings backdrop it makes it easier for investors to digest some of the bad news as it comes up,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
""The news of China coming back to the negotiating table is providing relief and you are starting to see markets stabilize a little bit.""
Industrials (SPLRCI) rose 1.4 percent on hopes that Beijing and Washington may resolve a conflict that has roiled financial markets since early March. 
Boeing (N:BA) rose 4.2 percent, also gaining on a bullish outlook by brokerage firm UBS.
Also helping was a dip in the dollar as well as a rally in the lira  after Turkey's finance minister said the country would emerge from the current volatility stronger.
That eased concerns about U.S. lenders' exposure to Turkey and sent the KBW bank index (BKX) up 1.72 percent.
At 12:18 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 426.99 points, or 1.70 percent, at 25,589.40, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 31.81 points, or 1.13 percent, at 2,850.18 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 74.70 points, or 0.96 percent, at 7,848.82.
Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected, with 79.3 percent of the 463 S&P 500 that have reported so far beating analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Department store chains were largely sitting out the rally, stung by Macy's (N:M) warning on margins on Wednesday and JC Penney's weak results and lowered forecast.
Penney (N:JCP), not on the S&P 500, slumped 24.5 percent. Nordstrom (N:JWN), which is due to report after the bell, was trading marginally higher.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.15-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 46 new lows.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>","J.C. Penney sinks 27 percent on forecast cut, fashion falls flat","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) shares sank below $2 for the first time on Thursday after it said it had alienated core middle-aged customers while chasing millennial buyers, and the venerable brand forecast an unexpectedly large loss.
The company's shares fell more than 27 percent to $1.75 in morning trading, the lowest since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange a week before the launch of the Great Depression in 1929.
One of the big names in U.S. retailing, Penney has gone through three chief executives in five years as it struggles to figure out what shoppers want in an industry buffeted by fast-fashion chains and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Davis said the chain might have undermined its traditional customer base of women over the age of 45 by revamping fashion lines to chase younger, trendier shoppers. 
""We were no longer necessarily having the broad array of merchandise silhouettes that is most important for her (our core customer),"" Davis said on a post earnings call.
To clear excess inventory, the company had to heavily discount not only seasonal merchandise but also its newer, trendier fashions, it said. 
The discounting drove a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter, while both revenue and same-stores sales also fell short of estimates. 
""This flailing around is a symptom of a wider problem in that J.C. Penney no longer has a sense of what it wants to be and who it wants to serve,"" GlobalData Retail's Neil Saunders said.
The company's problems have been exacerbated by a lack of clarity on its leadership after CEO Marvin Ellison left abruptly in May to join home improvement chain Lowe's Cos (N:LOW). 
Penney's said on Thursday it has met highly qualified candidates to replace Ellison, but has not made a decision yet.
It now expected its losses per share for the year to be between 80 cents and $1, much worse than a previous forecast which ran from a loss of 7 cents to a profit of 13 cents. 
That will reflect further efforts to right-size its inventory and fix its apparel offerings in the months ahead. 
According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected a profit of 4 cents for the full year.

""It is critical for us to better manage our inventory levels, and focus on ... our core customers,"" Davis said.

Tesla produced 5,031 Model 3 electric cars in the last seven days of the second quarter, the company said in early July, meeting its long-elusive production target after several hiccups.
""Tesla seems well on the way to achieving a steady weekly production rate of 5 to 6k units per week,"" Evercore analysts said after a two-day visit to the Tesla facility.
""In addition, the capex required and constraints that need to be overcome to reach 7 to 8k units per week seem well within reach.""
The company is under pressure to prove it can increase the production of Model 3, its lowest-priced car, amid production challenges and cash burn, as it seeks to become a mass-market automaker.
Evercore had earlier forecast production of 123,000 Model 3s during the second half of the year, but the analysts said they may need to boost that by as much as 7 percent after the tour.

346,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>","Crossover Health, a little-known startup that got a big boost when Apple picked it to run medical clinics for staff, is ramping up big time","From in-house chefs to cold brew to bikes on campus, tech companies have always been looking for perks to give them a competitive edge. One perk Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) landed on back in 2011: on-site health clinics.
The world's biggest tech company chose to work with a little-known startup called Crossover Health to operate its medical clinics in its Cupertino headquarters which would give employees access to healthcare without having to leave the Apple campus. 
Fast forward eight years later and Southern California-based Crossover has grown to operate 13 on-site clinics and five near-sight clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and Texas. The company now works with other large companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Universal, and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
 While Apple decided earlier this year to build its own clinic in Cupertino, Crossover still works with other Apple employees in locations outside headquarters. 
Crossover has been gaining traction. In July, the company had its 1 millionth patient visit, with plans for another 500,000 visits over the 12 months for its 175,000 employee members. It's also picked up $113.5 million from investors including Gurnet Point Capital and Norwest Venture Partners. 
For many Americans, their employers are the ones picking up the tab for their healthcare. More than half of the non-elderly population is covered by an employer-sponsored healthcare plan, and almost 80%  of large companies are self-insured. As healthcare costs go up, employers are the ones feeling the pressure.  Some are starting to get fed up and looking for new ideas. That's where Crossover comes in. 
The hope with on-site or near-site clinics is to make healthcare more convenient for employees, and along the way ideally cheaper by cutting down on visits. Crossover says it can save as much as $970 per member compared to what employers would be paying if that employee went through the traditional healthcare system. That savings can add up for a company with thousands of employees.
It makes Crossover CEO Scott Shreeve's pitch simple. 
""Employers, you're already paying for this,"" Shreeve told Business Insider. ""You're paying a big check, but you don't really know what you're getting. What we advocate for is, learn how you're spending your money."" 
On-site clinics aren't anything new. Their history dates back to the 1800s, and they rose again to prominence between 1930-1960,  around the time employers started covering healthcare as a way to convince people to work for factories that were ramping up production during the war economy.
After that, the popularity of on-site clinics waned, though there's now a renewed interest as employers look for new ways to tackle rising healthcare costs. Besides Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also considering operating its own clinics for employees. Independent doctors  practicing under a model known as direct primary care have been setting up on or near-site clinics paid based on a per-member, per-month model as well.
Here's how it works: Employers opt into the program and pay on a per-member-per-month basis. Those who opt in still use their insurance, with co-pays set by the employer. The employer and Crossover work to recruit employees to join. From there, the members have access to primary care appointments, as well as physical therapy, behavioral health visits, eye doctors, and health coaching sessions. 
By paying on a per-member basis, Crossover doesn't have as much of motivation to pack in as many visits as possible. Instead of interacting with patients only when they're sick, Shreeve said, the hope is to reach members in other ways. 
""We just think that's wrong we think healthcare should have other touchpoints that help keep you healthy,"" Shreeve said. 
Because they're all part of the same clinic, the primary care doctors are able to chat about their patients with the on-staff therapists and other physicians who are interacting with that same patient. That provides for a more holistic healthcare experience. 
For employers looking for ways to cut down on their healthcare costs as well as come up with a benefit employees want, Crossover's model can be a good fit. 
Cyber security company Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) chose to work with Crossover as it looked for ways to mitigate the trend of increased healthcare costs. 
""It’s an ongoing battle for us to stay ahead of the game and try to come up with innovative ways where employees feel like they’re getting a best in class benefit,"" Jennifer Lepird, Senior Director of Rewards & HRIM at Symantec told Business Insider.
Symantec and the other clients Crossover works with aren't alone in looking for new ways to get a more direct grip on the healthcare their employees consume. In 2019, General Motors (NYSE:GM) will offer its salaried employees in Southeast Michigan a plan that  works directly with Henry Ford Health System, covering about 24,000 employees and their families, lessening the company's use of its health insurance company. And in January,  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) formed an independent venture aimed at lowering healthcare costs for their employees.
""Healthcare's waiting for its 'Uber' moment and employers have realized that they can't sit on the sidelines,"" Renya Spak, a partner at health benefits firm Mercer and head of the company's Healthcare Innovation Center  told Business Insider in May. ""They need to drive and shape the direction of that change in order to have greater influence and better business results."""

For the second quarter ended June 30, Walmart said it earned $1.29 per share where analysts had expected $1.22. Revenue also topped the expected $126 billion to come in at 128 billion.
The beat was fueled by a 4.5% uptick in same-store sales, a closely watched metric for retailers, which nearly doubled the forecasted 2.4%.
Walmart has also been aggressively pushing into the digital realm with expensive investments in companies like Jet.com, ModCloth, Bonobos and more. After  taking a hit on its most recent fourth quarter earnings to pay for the acquisitions, they seem to be paying off. E-commerce sales were up 40% over the same period a year ago.
""We’re pleased with how customers are responding to the way we’re leveraging stores and e-commerce to make shopping faster and more convenient,"" Doug McMillan, Walmart's chief executive, said in a press release. ""We’re continuing to aggressively roll out grocery pickup and delivery in the U.S., and we recently announced expanded omni-channel initiatives in China and Mexico.""
Shares of Walmart are now up about 1% since the beginning of the year, but still well off their $109 high set in January.

348,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Bayer Vows Stronger Roundup Defense as It Absorbs Monsanto,"(Bloomberg) --  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) vowed to step up its defense against a wave of U.S. lawsuits over the herbicide Roundup as it began the formal integration of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co., acquired for $66 billion in June.
The German drug and chemical giant said it will formally absorb the U.S. company after selling some crop-science businesses to competitor BASF SE (DE:BASFN) to resolve regulatory concerns. Because U.S. authorities insisted that the businesses operate separately until that sale was complete, Bayer said it previously had been barred from steering Monsanto’s legal strategy.
That will now change as the stakes mount in the U.S. battle over Roundup. Bayer is facing $289 million in damages after Monsanto lost the first court case stemming from claims that the weed killer causes cancer. Even if a judge overturns or reduces the award, the trial will probably be the first of many: More than 5,000 U.S. residents have joined similar suits.
“Bayer did not have access to detailed internal information at Monsanto,” the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said in a statement. “Today, however, Bayer also gains the ability to become actively involved in defense efforts.”
The move to integrate the companies came as Bayer shares continued their slide in the wake of the court ruling, falling as much as 6.6 percent on Thursday. The company has lost about 16 billion euros ($18 billion) in market value this week, since the jury’s award in the Roundup case.
Bayer said it believes U.S. courts ultimately will find that glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup, wasn’t responsible for the cancer of the California school groundskeeper who was the plaintiff in last week’s case. It’s planning an appeal. Monsanto has insisted for decades that glyphosate is safe.
The latest fall in the shares came after Monsanto failed to block California’s move to list Roundup as a known carcinogen. The state’s Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to hear the U.S. company’s arguments as to why Roundup, the world’s most widely used weed killer, doesn’t belong on the state’s list of chemicals known to cause cancer. An appeals court had rejected the company’s arguments in April.
Bayer is also facing lawsuits in the U.S. over dicamba, another herbicide in Monsanto’s portfolio. The German company said it will also take an active role in any claims for damages over dicamba.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Britain sends mixed messages post-Brexit with greater scrutiny of foreign deals,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Jon Moulton, the founder of private equity house Better Capital (L:BCAP), was ""absolutely staggered"" when he learned that his firm's 44 million-pound sale of British company Northern Aerospace was being investigated by the UK government.
Better Capital had announced on June 8 that it had agreed to sell the aircraft components supplier to a subsidiary of Chinese company Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources. Nine days later, Britain's business secretary Greg Clark unexpectedly intervened on the grounds of national security, plunging the deal into jeopardy.
""We truly, truly didn't think there was any kind of issue,"" Moulton told Reuters. ""I was beginning to think my CEO was working for MI6 or something on the side.""
Moulton's frustrations may soon be shared by other dealmakers.
On July 24, Clark outlined far-reaching measures to boost the government's ability to review and block deals because of national security concerns in what will be the biggest overhaul to the country's takeover rules since 2002.
The new rules, if they come into force, will make it more complicated for foreign buyers to strike deals in Britain, which was the world's second biggest mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market during the first half of 2018, bankers and lawyers said.
The overhaul comes just as Britain is exiting the European Union and seeking to encourage trade and investment with the rest of the world. Any major government intervention into M&A may deter foreign investment and raise questions over prime minister Theresa May's motto that Britain is open for business.
The government is carrying out a consultation on the proposed changes that closes on Oct. 16.
Britain wants to align its takeover rules with other countries which have beefed-up their powers recently to stop sensitive assets from being snapped up by rivals such as China. Countries including Germany, France and Italy have been taking steps to tighten M&A rules. 
""These proposals will ensure we have the appropriate safeguards to protect our national security whilst ensuring our economy remains unashamedly pro-business,"" Clark said.
It comes amid an M&A boom in the UK, where the value of offers involving British targets jumped to $277.3 billion during the first six months of 2018, up from $92.6 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
""Historically we'd always worked on the basis the UK government is pretty open, as long as you're not buying BAE (L:BAES),"" said an investment banker who declined to be identified, referring to the defense company in which Britain holds a golden share enabling it to restrict an ownership change.
The London-based banker said that since the UK unveiled its proposals, he had included a ""big caveat"" when discussing deal ideas with Chinese colleagues warning that ""it feels like the atmosphere here is changing.""
WIDER SCOPE
Under the proposals, the government will be able to review a much wider scope of transactions than before, including the purchase of assets such as intellectual property or land, and the acquisition of more than 25 percent of a company's shares.
It would have the power to unwind completed deals and for the first time would be able to impose criminal sanctions if government conditions on transactions are breached.
""The number of deals that we're looking at that are going to be caught by the proposed legislation will vary at any one time but it's not going to be an immaterial number,"" said Marc Israel, a partner at law firm White & Case.
Last year only one takeover, involving a Chinese buyer of a supplier of radios to the emergency services, was subject to a UK national security review, while the Northern Aerospace sale has been the only case so far in 2018. 
The new rules will encourage companies to voluntarily notify the UK of transactions that could arouse concerns, as well as allowing the government to ""call-in"" deals that have not been flagged up. The government forecasts it will receive about 200 notifications each year, of which 50 will result in conditions being imposed. 
""Clearly this has the potential to create quite a significant burden on businesses not just doing mergers but also making acquisitions of assets,"" said Dominic Long, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.
A government spokesman said the UK already discusses potential deals with businesses. 
""The new regime will create a formal structure for this to happen across a wider range of issues,"" the spokesman said.
OPEN FOR BUSINESS?
Since Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016, the UK has taken a progressively tougher line on foreign investment. 
One of her first actions was to pause the Hinkley Point nuclear reactor project, which China is financing and France's EDF (PA:EDF) is building, to introduce measures allowing Britain to block a change of control.
There was also a tightening of the UK's M&A rules in June this year, when the government lowered the revenue threshold at which it could intervene in takeovers of companies in the technology and military sectors on security grounds, giving Britain the power to investigate Northern Aerospace. 
Moulton, whose Northern Aerospace deal was cleared in July after a month-long review, believes the latest rule changes could affect foreign buyers' perception of the UK.

""The integration of Monsanto into the Bayer Group can begin following the completion on Thursday of the divestment by Bayer to BASF (DE:BASFn) of certain Crop Science businesses with a total sales volume of around 2.2 billion euros,"" it said in a statement.
Bayer already closed the deal, becoming the sole owner of Monsanto, on June 7 but had to hold off on the integration.
In the statement, Bayer reiterated that last week's jury verdict for Monsanto to pay damages in a U.S. lawsuits over alleged links between weed-killer Roundup and cancer was unwarranted.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 08:41AM ET</span>","Shares, emerging market currencies steady after mauling","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Bruised world shares and emerging market currencies fought to regain their footing on Thursday, after China said it will hold trade talks with the United States later this month and Turkey’s lira continued its recovery run.
Asian equities had hit one-year lows overnight as they tracked Wednesday's global falls and Tencent results disappointed, but a fresh high for London's FTSE and modest gains elsewhere pulled Europe and Wall Street futures up. 
At the same time a dip in the dollar (DXY), the sight of the lira moving back to 5.8 per dollar  and a higher Chinese yuan also steadied emerging market currencies such as South Africa's rand, Russia's rouble and Mexico's peso. 
Emerging market stocks did nudge lower again, though, after they had crossed the 20 percent peak-to-trough threshold that defines a 'bear' market. Metals markets also clawed higher, however, after copper had also entered 'bear' territory.
""The Chinese are heading to Washington and yuan bounced, the Qataris are heading to Ankara and the lira bounced and that has left everything else floating around really,"" said Societe Generale's global head of currency strategy Kit Juckes.
He added that it was still too early to sound the all clear around Turkey - its new finance minister and son-in-law of President Tayyip Erdogan was about to hold a global conference call - and that the broader worries were still around the extent of China's economic slowdown.
China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks in late August at the invitation of Washington.
Hopes that it could ease trade tensions helped Chinese stocks pare losses, with both Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) each down 0.8 percent. Earlier in the day, Shanghai was down as much as 1.9 percent while Hong Kong was off 1.7 percent. [.SS][.T]
Japan's Nikkei average (N225) closed 0.1 percent lower in choppy trade, with the benchmark falling as much as 1.5 percent before a brief swing into positive territory on China news.
The euro (EUR=) rose 0.2 percent from a 13-1/2 month low and the offshore Chinese yuan  gained 0.8 percent following the Sino-U.S. trade talk news. U.S. stock futures (ESc1) jumped 0.5-0.8 percent.
""The news (of the China-U.S. trade talks) triggered short-covering but I think fundamentally it is of limited significance,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments.
He said Turkey's market swings reflect the fact that it is one of the more vulnerable parts of the global economy at this stage in the interest rate cycle, as the Federal Reserve seeks to normalise U.S. monetary policy.
Emerging market shares savaged by bears: https://reut.rs/2KPYGv7
VIDEO GAME NASTY
However, Sakuma noted there were arguably larger risks for investors, such as the weak earnings from Tencent Holdings. (HK:0700).
The Chinese tech giant reported its first quarterly profit fall in nearly 13 years on weak gaming revenue. It holds a 40 percent stake in the U.S. firm that makes cult game Fortnite. While that may be booming, China's regulator this week has signalled it is clamping down on some of these types of games.
That had knocked other Asian tech firms with South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), Asia's third largest firm by market capitalisation, down to a one-year low.
Back in Europe, Italy's stock market (FTMIB) sank 1.6 percent to its lowest level since April 2017 as motorway operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) fell 20 percent. The Italian government said it could be heavily fined or stripped of its contracts following the deadly collapse of a bridge in Genoa. 
Though metals strengthened, oil prices were also left flat after data showed a surprise weekly increase in U.S. crude stockpiles, compounding worries about a weaker global economic growth. 
Brent was at just over $71 a barrel and U.S. crude oil (CLc1) last stood at $65.17, having fallen to two-month lows of $64.42, following Wednesday's 3.2 percent fall.
On the bond market, the tentative recovery in risk appetite also saw yields on German Bunds and U.S. Treasury, regarded as safe investments in times of trouble, nudge up. 

""The overnight news that the Chinese are sending a delegation to the U.S. is helping support risk sentiment,"" said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.

354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",JD.com's Losses Surge Alongside Soaring Spending on Expansion,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. posted a blowout loss on higher spending and forecast sales below estimates, as rising competition in China’s e-commerce market slow efforts to attract new revenue.
The net loss from continuing operations surged to 2.2 billion yuan ($319 million) in the June quarter, about 8 times larger than analysts expected. The Beijing-based company expects sales in the September quarter of between 104.5 billion yuan and 109 billion yuan, with the top of the range slightly below estimates. The stock slumped more than 6 percent in pre-market trade.
JD’s disappointing showing comes a day after top shareholder Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported its first profit drop in 13 years, souring sentiment on Chinese tech companies. The online retailer is facing challenging times as it pushes ahead with an ambitious expansion in foreign and domestic markets. The e-commerce giant is squaring off against Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). in Southeast Asia and the West, while facing rising pressure from rivals including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc. at home. Its stock has fallen by about a third since reaching a record in January.
The traditional e-commerce model “may be close to saturation following the stellar growth in the past years,” Nomura analysts led by Jialong Shi wrote in a report to clients before the earning release. “That explains why e-commerce operators are turning to new marketing or business models – such as new retail, group-buy and social commerce – for new growth drivers.”
Sales for the June quarter rose 31 percent to 122.3 billion yuan. One factor that likely weighed on growth was a slowdown during JD’s June sales event. Ostensibly started to celebrate the company’s founding, it has become a smaller rival to Alibaba’s Singles’ Day promotion in November, with total transactions for this year’s event rising by 33 percent to hit 159.2 billion yuan.
But this was down compared with the 50 percent growth of last year, in part because the attention of shoppers was diverted by a public holiday and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

355,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 08:14AM ET</span>","Stocks - U.S. Futures Bounce on U.S.-China Trade Developments, Earnings in Focus","Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Thursday, as investors reacted positively to developments in trade talks between China and the U.S. and positive earnings reports from blue-chip companies, while keeping an eye on blue-chip earnings and waiting for a slew of data to be released before the open.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 200 points, or 0.79%, by 7:10 AM ET (11:10 GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 15 points, or 0.54%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 54 points, or 0.73%.
After the S&P 500 posted its biggest percentage drop since late June on Thursday, U.S. equities looked set for a rebound as China said it will hold a fresh round of trade talks with the U.S. in Washington later this month, offering a glimmer of hope for progress in resolving a conflict that has set world markets on edge.
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet with U.S. representatives led by Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website.
The upcoming meeting, which is lower-level compared with four previous rounds of talks, comes at the invitation of the U.S., according to the statement.
The world's two largest economies have implemented several rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s goods since the start of the year and have threatened further tariffs on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
On the company front, investors will concentrate on the last major wave of earnings. Through Wednesday’s close, 462 of the S&P 500 companies had reported earnings. 81% beat profit estimates with growth of 26.46%, while 75% topped consensus on sales with growth of 10.74%, according to The Earnings Scout.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) soared nearly 7% in pre-market trade on Thursday after the Dow component’s quarterly results beat on both the top and bottom line and the company forecast better-than-expected numbers for its fiscal first quarter.
Also among blue-chips, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) saw shares jump around 7% in pre-market trade after quarterly earnings topped consensus and the retail giant lifted its full-year earnings guidance.
Outside the Dow, other companies reporting results ahead of the open include JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), and Madison Square Garden (NYSE:MSG).
After the close, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) are on deck.
On the economic front, traders will focus on weekly initial jobless claims as well as data on manufacturing activity from the Philly Fed and a report on housing starts and building permits for the month of the July, all due for release at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT).
While waiting for the data, the dollar backed off from 13-month highs against major rivals as the developments between the U.S. and China eased risk aversion. At 7:11 AM ET (11:11 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.09% 96.50.
Meanwhile, commodities underwent a rebound on Thursday, celebrating renewed negotiation plans between Washington and Beijing after a sharp decline in the prior session.
At 7:12 AM ET (11:12 GMT), copper futures jumped 1.91% to $2.609 a pound, the biggest increase in more than three weeks. The red metal slumped to a 14-month low of $2.552 a day earlier.
Gold was also higher at $1,186.70 an ounce, having dropped to an overnight low of $1,167.10, a level not seen since January 2017.
Oil prices were showing mixed trade, however, with U.S. crude near the unchanged mark, as worries over a slowdown in global demand capped gains.
Elsewhere, European equities were trading higher as appetite for riskier assets improved on hopes of a trade war thaw. Italy's FTSE MIB was the major exception as shares in motorway operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) plunged 17% following the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa earlier this week.
Earlier, Asian shares closed mostly lower, but pared some of the steeper losses seen earlier amid easing fears of a trade war. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down around 0.7%, having earlier fallen by as much as 1.9%."

TCS Group Holding Plc became Russia’s fifth-biggest brokerage by active clients in the space of just a few months by offering mostly foreign stocks. Its most popular investments include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., according to Alexander Emeshev, vice president of Tinkoff Bank, which opened the trading unit in May.
Finam Investment, the top firm by active clients, meanwhile has about 15 percent of its funds in overseas equities, up from about 5 percent a year ago.
“On Western exchanges in general, there are more fast-growing and highly-liquid companies than in Russia,” Emeshev said in an interview. “Plus, the U.S. market has grown.”
About half of the 13 billion rubles ($194 million) invested by TCS clients is in foreign companies, Emeshev said. It has accumulated more than 16,000 active clients, and about 80 percent of the stocks it offers are foreign, he said.
The demand for foreign shares runs counter to the Russian government’s party line, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning this week that the abuse of sanctions by the U.S. will ultimately hurt the dollar’s credibility. Yet with Russian deposit rates declining, markets in turmoil with each new round of trade restrictions and the ruble sinking to a more than two-year low, more money is being sent overseas.

357,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Goldman Frets a Huge Shift in Italian Debt Market Is Looming,"(Bloomberg) -- The dreaded sovereign-bank “doom loop” in Europe may have weakened. Now comes the bad news.
Thanks to political risks and regulatory changes, Italian lenders may be reluctant to snap up domestic government bonds during market stresses -- a potentially huge structural shift in demand in the euro area’s second-most indebted nation.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). casts doubt on whether such institutions can go on serving as dutiful marginal buyers, a bid that’s historically stabilized a market seen as Europe’s Achilles’ heel.
“Whether domestic financial institutions will continue to act as a steady (and potentially increasing) source of demand for sovereign duration remains a fundamental question”, Goldman’s Matteo Crimella wrote in a note published Wednesday.
It’s a pressing issue. As Turkey contagion swept global assets this week and a tech sell-off compounded the risk-off mood, Italian 10-year yields have risen close to four-year highs.
Problems at Home
Since the crisis, policy makers and markets have grappled with the doom loop -- the risk weak banks that fund their over-indebted governments destabilize sovereign debt markets, and vice-versa.
The prospect home lenders will have the government’s back no longer presents a fresh threat. What happens when those buyers go AWOL is now the key question.
The doubts stem from two issues. First, Italian banks are regulated by supranational authorities that are subjecting sovereign exposures to stress tests. That’s a signal supervisors “could be slowly leaning towards opposing the ‘home bias’ and making banks’ portfolios more diversified,” notes Goldman.
Second, Italy, as ever, faces domestic challenges. Populist politicians appear determined to pursue an expansionary budget, fueling concern about debt sustainability.
That helped drive the yield spread between 10-year Italian and German obligations to 286 basis points on Wednesday, approaching the widest since May.
Doom Loop
At the peak of the country’s struggles to forge a coalition in May, banks increased their exposure to government notes by 11 billion euros ($12.5 billion).
In a stark reminder that the feedback loop is not yet fully vanquished, the capital hit due to Italian sovereign debt swings was higher than expected in the last quarter for at least two of the country’s banks.
All of which may make lenders more reluctant when it comes to jumping into home obligations in the future, reckons Goldman. And it comes at an importune time, as the European Central Bank -- the ultimate buyer-of-last-resort -- brings its unprecedented stimulus program to a close.
“The need for a ‘marginal buyer’ of Italian BTPs could increase, especially should the government pursue a bulky fiscal expansion,” wrote Crimella. “Any reluctance of domestic banks to fulfill that role could lead to a shortfall in demand.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in China's Tencent Holdings lost more ground on Thursday after it logged its first quarterly profit decline in nearly 13 years and said it did not know when it would get Chinese approval to make money off its most popular game.
The disappointing earnings results have highlighted the impact of a freeze on new China approvals for the gaming industry since March due to the restructuring of related regulatory agencies in the world's biggest gaming market.
Reporting a 2 percent decline in second-quarter net profit as well as its slowest revenue growth in three years, Tencent said the biggest hurdle to a return to rapid revenue growth was that it could not yet charge for its PlayerUnknowns' Battlegrounds (PUBG) video game in China.
Shares in China's largest social media and gaming company fell 3 percent, adding to a painful slide earlier this week after its blockbuster title ""Monster Hunter: World"" was pulled in the country due to regulatory complaints.
Procedures for games approvals in China were already complicated enough with watchdogs for media publication, cyberspace and copyright as well as ministries for culture and information technology all being part of the process.
The situation has become more complex with the government's decision in March to split the overarching media regulator into two units while transferring some power to the Communist Party publicity department, in a step aimed at strengthening its grip over content and ideology.
While PUBG can be played as a free game, Tencent has yet to receive the nod to monetize it. PUBG is a popular battle game with more than 400 million players worldwide developed by Tencent's South Korean partner and investee company, Bluehole. 
The company did secure a license to launch and monetize the Monster Hunter game, its president, Martin Lau, told an earnings call on Wednesday. But it was pulled because its content was ""not fully compliant"", he said without elaborating. 
This is not the first time Tencent's games have come under scrutiny from regulators. In July last year, China's communist party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, criticized Tencent, describing its ""Honour of Kings"" game as poison and called for tighter regulatory controls of online games.
TARGET PRICES CUT 
Fifteen analysts have lowered their target price on Tencent since Wednesday. The average price of 41 analysts fell to HK$487.59, or down 6 percent over a month, according to Reuters data.
But that remains far above Tencent's closing share price of HK$325.8 on Thursday and analysts were broadly upbeat about the firm's longer-term outlook.
""We consider the disruption to the game business to be temporary and primarily due to licensing suspension amid regulatory uncertainties; the business remains structurally intact, in our view,"" Daiwa Capital markets analyst John Choi said.
Tencent was founded in 1998 and while its core business is in gaming, which accounts for about 40 percent of revenue, it also operates China's dominant social network, WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users.
Its shares have declined 12 percent so far this week and have lost a third of their value since hitting a record high in January as investors fret about growth momentum. Even so, it remains the biggest listed firm in Asia with a market capitalization of nearly $400 billion. 
Other gaming shares were hit in the wake of Tencent's downbeat results, including Chinese rival NetEase which lost 4 percent while Japan's Capcom, which developed ""Monster Hunter:World"" tumbled 5 percent. 

South Africa's Naspers, which owns a 31 percent stake in Tencent, saw its stock lose 8 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered after Beijing said it would hold trade talks with the U.S. this month, spurring a risk appetite recovery, although Italian shares fell sharply as  Atlantia  sank.
Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.2 percent by 0840 GMT on Thursday, clawing back some of Wednesday's losses which had taken it to a six-week low as emerging markets entered bear territory.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) sank 1.6 percent to its lowest level since April 2017 as shares in motorway operator Atlantia (MI:ATL) fell 25 percent. 
Italy's government said it plans to strip the group's Autostrade unit of its motorway concession and seek heavy fines following the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa.
Atlantia said shareholders and bondholders could be hurt and the stock had its biggest fall ever when it opened after a 50-minute delay. 
The Italian market was closed on Wednesday so was also catching up with the previous session's falls and political news.
""The market is quite resilient today given the falls we had yesterday with the equity market closed, and quite violent moves in bond markets,"" said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management. 
""The fear is that the Italian coalition put forward a fiscal program that's looser than the European Commission would like and dig their heels in, which is what Conte has threatened to do.""
Overall, mining stocks (SXPP) were the top gainers, rising 1.2 percent after suffering their worst day since the Brexit vote on Wednesday when metals prices sank.
Investors were calculating the magnitude of the risk from Turkey and a broader emerging markets crisis.
""I think to an isolated Turkish crisis Europe is reasonably resilient,"" said Psigma's McPherson. 
""European banks have felt the most pain but their exposure is actually quite low. The wider risks investors are worried about is a loss of confidence and tightening dollar liquidity.""
Broader markets aside, corporate results drove some sharp moves with electronic payments firm Wirecard leading the pack.
Wirecard (DE:WDIG) shares jumped 9 percent after the electronic payments firm raised its 2018 profits guidance, making it more likely it will replace Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in the next reshuffle of the DAX index.
Earnings disappointments weighed on others. 
German consumer goods firm Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) fell 3.2 percent after cutting its profit outlook, blaming falling EM currencies and higher prices for raw materials.
Swedish retailer ICA (ST:ICAA) dropped 6.9 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings which missed expectations and warning a drought could hurt meat supply.
Shares in Dutch marine and engineering company Boskalis (AS:BOSN) fell 7 percent after it reported first-half earnings that missed estimates due to loss-making transport activities at its offshore energy division.
French outdoor advertising firm JCDecaux (PA:JCDX) rose 6.8 percent thanks to analysts at Berenberg upgrading the stock to ""buy"", saying they thought Google's possible entry into the outdoor ad market in Europe could be good news.
German pharmaceuticals group Bayer (DE:BAYGn) lost another 5.3 percent, the top DAX faller, taking losses this week to more than 17 percent after a ruling against subsidiary  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) over alleged links between a weedkiller and cancer. 

The fresh blow to the stock came from a report in WirtschaftsWoche saying farmers in Arkansas and South Dakota have filed class action lawsuits against Monsanto.

The stock dropped as much as 24 percent Thursday in Milan, the most on record, erasing about 4.6 billion euros ($5.2 billion) in value. Some of the bonds of Atlantia and the highways unit that operated the Genoa bridge, Autostrade per l’Italia, fell to their lowest levels on record.
The disaster has provoked political finger-pointing and sparked a move by the populist government to revoke the lucrative toll-road concession. That’s thrown Atlantia and its largest shareholder, Italy’s powerful Benetton family, into a fight to salvage its investment and protect its fortune amid rising anger over the tragedy that killed at least 39 people.
Atlantia said Thursday that government officials’ decision to start the revocation process came prematurely, “without any verification of the material causes of the accident.”
The company said its contract requires Atlantia to be reimbursed if the concession is withdrawn, and said it will continue to support Autostrade “with the aim of protecting the interests of its shareholders and bondholders.”
Atlantia shares were down 24 percent to 17.87 euros at 10:13 a.m. in Milan, falling as much as 26 percent after a delayed opening. Markets were closed in Italy on Wednesday for the Ferragosto holiday.
Atlantia’s 1 billion euros of bonds due in July 2027 plunged below 89 cents on the euro on Thursday, the lowest since they were issued, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 700 million euros of notes due September 2029 issued by Autostrade fell below 92 cents on the euro, also a record. The cost of insuring Atlantia’s debt with credit-default swaps soared 126 basis points on Thursday to 300, the highest in almost six years, according to CMA.
Concession Revocation
Late Wednesday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters that the government will “start the procedure to revoke Autostrade’s license.” He said officials won’t wait for the outcome of a probe or a trial to take action.
The government may limit the license-withdrawal to the A10 highway that includes the bridge, not the entire toll-road network run by Autostrade, according to a Transport Ministry official who asked not to be named in line with internal policy.
If the highway-operating license is revoked, the division’s creditors may have the option to accelerate repayment, Creditsights analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday, quoting the firm’s EMTN prospectus. The analysts changed their recommendation on the debt to “underperform.”
Morandi bridge, built in the 1960s, was part of a major artery connecting the Italian Riviera to the southern coast of France. It collapsed in a heavy rain on Tuesday, causing more than two dozen vehicles to drop to the railroad tracks about 150 feet below.
The disaster occurred during the height of Italy’s summer travel season. Most companies, including Atlantia, are shut down during the Ferragosto week. The bridge’s failure and accompanying loss of life has shocked Italians and led to questions about the safety of hundreds of aging bridges and tunnels.
Giovanni Castellucci, the chief executive officer of both Atlantia and Autostrade, has become a focus of anger over the tragedy, as politicians called for his removal. The Autostrade unit will hold an emergency board meeting early next week to evaluate the impact of the tragedy on its business and respond to government’s request, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News late Wednesday. The CEO has the support of the Benetton family and has no current plan to resign, one of the people said.
Edidizione Srl, family’s holding company, said it will do “everything in its power to discover the truth and the responsibilities” for the Genoa disaster, while extending condolences to the families of the victims.
Edizione said Autostrade has invested over 10 billion euros in the last 10 years to widen and modernize the Italian highway network.

""Concerning the choice of new chief executive...the trade unions would like to state that it's inconceivable that the company Air France - which has been French since 1933 - would fall into the hands of a foreign director,"" the unions said in the statement.
French newspapers reported on Thursday that Air France-KLM's board would meet on Aug. 16 to approve the nomination of Smith - currently the chief operating officer at Air Canada - as CEO.
A spokesman for Air France KLM said the company had no comment on the matter, besides repeating its earlier position that the ""process remains under way and no decision has been made yet"".
Smith's appointment would fill a management void after former CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac quit in May when staff rejected his offer of a pay deal aimed at ending a wave of strikes that have so far cost the company 335 million euros ($381 million).
Known to speak French, Smith has a track record in dealing with unions, and was the main negotiator in talks with pilot and cabin crew staff at Air Canada that resulted in a 10-year agreement in 2015.
The French state has a 14 percent stake in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.

Disney would only be forced to make such an offer if it completes a deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's TV and film assets, which include a 39 percent stake in Sky, before either Fox or rival suitor Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) succeed in taking control of the British broadcaster.
The price is designed to reflect the level of the offer Disney is making for Fox, and its holding in Sky. 

The regulator had set the level of a possible mandatory Disney offer for Sky at 14 pounds a share on July 13. But it has had to hold a series of hearings since then to review the level after a number of groups appealed the decision.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Judge orders Keystone XL pipeline review in setback for Trump,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Montana on Wednesday ordered the U.S. State Department to do a full environmental review of a revised route for the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, a move that could delay the project and prove a setback for the Trump administration.
For more than a decade, environmentalists, tribal groups, and ranchers have fought the $8-billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline to carry heavy crude to Steele City in Nebraska from Canada's oilsands in Alberta. 
U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled for the Indigenous Environmental Network and other plaintiffs, ordering the review of a revised pipeline route through Nebraska to supplement one the department did on the original path in 2014.
In his ruling, Morris said the State Department was obligated to ""analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision"" to issue a permit for the pipeline last year. 
Supporting the project are Canadian oil producers, who face price discounts over transport bottlenecks, and U.S. oil interests and pipeline builders.
TransCanada Corp, which wants to build Keystone XL, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. It hopes to start preliminary work in Montana in coming months and begin construction in the second quarter of 2019. 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the State Department. 
The ruling was ""a rejection of the Trump administration’s attempt to flout the law and force Keystone XL on the American people,"" said Jackie Prange, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. 
In 2015, then President Barack Obama, a Democrat, rejected the pipeline, saying it would add to emissions that cause climate change and would mostly benefit Canadians. 
President Donald Trump, a Republican, pushed to approve the pipeline soon after he took office. A State Department official signed a so-called presidential permit in 2017 allowing the line to move forward.
However, Morris declined the plaintiff's request to vacate that permit, which was based on the 2014 review. 
Last year, Nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the pipeline which will cost TransCanada millions of dollars more than the original path. 

In a draft environmental assessment last month, the State Department said Keystone XL would cause no major harm to water supplies or wildlife. That review is less wide-ranging than the full environmental impact statement Morris ordered.

384,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",China-U.S. to Resume Low-Level Talks in Bid to Resolve Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- China will dispatch Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen to the U.S. for low-level trade talks in late August, the first official exchanges since earlier negotiations broke down two months ago.
The Chinese delegation led by Wang will meet with an American group led by David Malpass, under secretary for international affairs at the Department of the Treasury, at the invitation of the U.S., China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website on Thursday.
The news buoyed risk sentiment in Asian trading, with futures on the S&P 500 Index rallying as much as 0.4 percent. The offshore yuan gained against the dollar for the first time in seven days.
“This will be ‘talks about trade talks,’” said Gai Xinzhe, an analyst at the Bank of China’s Institute of International Finance in Beijing. “Lower-level officials will meet and haggle and see if there is a possibility for higher-level talks.”
China’s equity market has suffered declines and the yuan has been on a losing streak for more than a month. Chinese authorities, bracing for an economic fallout, have introduced measures to support growth ranging from shifting toward a more accommodative monetary policy to boosting fiscal spending.
The two nations had appeared to have reached a deal in May after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He -- President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser -- led a group of officials to Washington. But Trump backed away from the agreement soon afterward, and ever since the two sides have been locked in a trade standoff as they slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods.
The commerce ministry reiterated in the statement that China is against trade protectionism and won’t accept any unilateral trade restrictions. “China welcomes communications and dialogue on the basis of reciprocity, equality and integrity,” it said.
The Trump administration imposed duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, a move that also prompted immediate retaliation from Beijing. Another $16 billion in levies will be effective later in August. Earlier this month, China announced a list of $60 billion worth of U.S. imports it plans to apply tariffs on, after Trump ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate.
Wang, who is the key official leading China’s trade talks worldwide, led an advance team to Washington in May. In a July interview, he told Bloomberg that he didn’t understand why the U.S. quickly reversed its course.
“Good faith negotiation is required,” Wang said then. “For any talk to be successful, no party should point a gun at the other party.”
Economists weren’t expecting much from the planned talks.
“Malpass has no trade authority,” said Derek Scissors, chief economist at the China Beige Book. “But nice for Chinese stocks.”

Net profit came in at $77 million for the three months ended in June, compared with a loss of $72.3 million in the same period a year earlier when it was hit by higher costs amid a shortage of components. 
That was ahead of an average estimate of $59.37 million from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 19 percent from a year earlier to $11.91 billion, its second straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
""The group remains confident in its core PC business, and aims to grow at a premium to the market in revenue without compromising on profitability,"" Chairman Yang Yuanqing said in the statement.

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is looking at whether Apple interfered in Yahoo Japan's operations by pressuring it to cut back on developing its Game Plus web-based service which enables users to stream games without downloading apps, the Nikkei newspaper reported. 
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman at Yahoo Japan, one of the country's most successful internet companies, declined to comment on the report, but said that the site continued to add game titles.
Shares in Yahoo Japan fell around 2.5 percent in early trade, while the broader market slipped 0.5 percent.
Last month, the FTC said Apple could have breached antitrust rules by forcing Japanese mobile service providers to sell its iPhones cheaply and charge higher monthly fees, denying consumers a fair choice.
Game Plus offers free and fee-based games developed by Square (NYSE:SQ) Enix Holdings Co and other game publishers, some of which are also available on the App Store for Japan-registered users. Yahoo Japan's gaming site has more than 60 million monthly users, which the company and game publishers can tap for usage history and other data.
According to the Nikkei, Yahoo slashed its budget for the platform last year, and has largely stopped promoting the service. Meanwhile, game publisher Square Enix in April removed a game that had been developed exclusively for the site, the newspaper added. 
Yahoo Japan's biggest shareholder is SoftBank Group Corp.

Tencent’s earnings report was in focus after the company surprised traders with its first decline in profit in almost 13 years.
China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.4% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.1% by 9:50PM ET (01:50 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.3%.
Tencent’s net income fell 2% to 17.9 million yuan ($2.6 billion) in the three months ended June, compared to the general consensus of 19.3 billion yuan, according to a statement. Mobile gaming revenue dropped 19% from the first quarter.
“From a revenue growth perspective, gaming is a key area of weakness, our biggest game is not monetizable,” President Martin Lau said. “This is something that’s a little out of our control, but over time we’ll solve it.”
The report came after regulators banned the sale of its blockbuster video game Monster Hunter: World just days after its launch on Aug. 8, as regulators received a large number of complaints about the game that was sold over 8 million copies worldwide.
“The fact that Monster Hunter got taken down shows that even Tencent isn’t immune from regulatory crackdowns,” said Benjamin Wu, a Shanghai-based analyst with consultancy Pacific Epoch.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1% after data showed the country’s exports rose 3.9% year-on-year in July, well short of a 6.3% increase expected by analysts and a 6.7% year-on-year gain in June.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",Why Americans are more cautious about the cost of college,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - Since he was in fourth grade, Dennis Nolte’s stepson Jacob has been tacking Massachusetts Institute of Technology posters to his bedroom wall and dreaming of attending some day.
But now that Jacob is 18 and applying to colleges, Nolte has delivered an uncomfortable message: “If manna comes from heaven, and you get enough scholarships, you can go to MIT,” Nolte told him. “Otherwise, getting a good education that’s cheap and affordable in-state makes more sense.”
Nolte, who is a financial planner in Winter Park, Florida, compares the high cost of a private university such as MIT to Florida state schools, where the total cost of tuition, room and board and fees comes in at less than a third of such elite schools.
MIT estimates total costs for its upcoming academic year at $70,240, while state schools in Florida come in at less than $20,000.
With massive media attention on the high cost of college along with lessons of the Great Recession, even people who can afford to pay “are much more circumspect about the cost of college,” Nolte said. 
His impressions are borne out in a survey by student lender Sallie Mae released this week. Despite a strong economy, parents and students are far more cautious about paying for college now than they were in the throes of the last recession, according to How America Values College, the Sallie Mae survey of 1,907 parents and students. 
About 90 percent of respondents consider college a good investment, but that does not mean attending at any cost. 
Some 78 percent of families said they are focusing on the price of a college education. Even before applying for the 2017 school year, 70 percent of students said they discarded colleges because they were too expensive. That is a huge change from 2008, when only 42 percent of students limited pricier choices immediately. 
Parents are also taking a tougher line, with 46 percent eliminating expensive colleges at the outset, compared with only 39 percent in 2008.
After the initial cut, the scrutiny continues as financial aid offers arrive. When scholarships and grants did not make a school cheap enough in 2017, 69 percent of students rejected the college. In 2008, just 38 percent of students used such rigor.
Parents, too, have become more discriminating, with 49 percent saying “no” to colleges after perusing financial aid offers. In 2008, only 30 percent did so.
Parents are still reluctant to say “no” to expensive schools, said financial planner Sean Moore, president of Smart College Funding in Boca Raton, Florida. “Parents say: My child worked so hard. How could we not send them?” 
But increasingly parents are speaking up and “asking what is the return,” he said. 
That change in mindset comes amid a time of declining enrollments and the closure of small liberal arts colleges - trends that reflect changing demographics and other factors as well as concerns over the cost and value of a college education. Some schools are cutting liberal arts programs while adding engineering and business programs for increasingly career-focused students.
CATERING TO COST
Colleges are responding to cost sensitivities by decreasing sticker prices or offering free tuition.
Elissa Schimmel, 17, is beginning community college this fall at Harper College near Chicago, in a new program that will give her free tuition for two years, before she transfers to a public university for a bachelor’s degree.
“My friends went away to college and then ended up moving back home and stressed about their college debts,” she said. “My mother told me this would be a good option because I wouldn’t have to worry about money.”
Often, community college appeals to first-generation or older independent students. Schimmel, both of whose parents have college educations, is a motivated student focused on a business career.
Financial planners frequently urge strapped parents to have their children start at a community college. Brenda Knox of Rolling Meadows, Illinois is one: “Even the mass affluent can only hope to save a third of college costs.” 
Still, financial planners warn about the need to be careful consumers. A recent report by the American Association of Community Colleges said that too many community colleges lack rigor and credits often do not transfer to four-year schools – creating more expenses and eating up a student’s time. 
In the Sallie Mae survey, half of the families said they are getting the experience they anticipated, while half are not. The latter face shocks over quality, fees, travel costs, housing and living expenses. And after the first year, there are often unanticipated tuition increases and cuts in scholarships.

Later this fall Sallie Mae will release its more detailed annual report, How America Pays for College.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 09:28PM ET</span>","Be humble, be frugal: Life lessons from Big Sick's Showalter","By Burt Helm
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Showalter’s path to success in Hollywood has as many plot twists as the movies he directs, which include the hit romantic comedy ""The Big Sick."" 
At 26 his hit MTV show ""The State"" was canceled, and soon he was living paycheck to paycheck. By his thirties he was sharing an inexpensive loft in Brooklyn with two roommates, but it was a downsizing that was a first step in reclaiming his finances, his self-esteem and ultimately his career. 
Now, the writer, former professor, and director of the acclaimed film ""The Big Sick"" shares the lessons he learned. 
Q: What was your first paycheck? 
A: When I was younger I did some caddying, but my first real job was working at historical Morven, the old governor’s mansion in New Jersey, on an archaeological dig. 
For two summers in high school, I was on my hands and knees with a trowel, digging through the dirt, finding bits of ceramic and glass and old buckshot and cataloging it all. I didn’t love it, but I was on my own a lot. I would listen to music and get lost in thought. 
Q: Both your parents were Princeton University professors. Did they care whether you worked? 
A: They were never really adamant, like “you need to get a job.” They were always encouraging me to find things I loved to do. 
Q: That’s easy for tenured professors to say, isn’t it? 
A: They had tenure, but, they were always working. They taught all day long. After dinner we’d migrate to the living room, and they’d continue grading papers. Life and work were kind of the same thing in my family because it was their passion. 
Q: Soon after you graduated from New York University, your college sketch comedy troupe got an MTV show — ""The State."" What happens when you’re making good money that young?
A: We weren’t actually making good money, first of all. There were 11 of us. We were making a thousand bucks a week each — $600 after commission and taxes. 
And at that time in my life I had no clue about what money was. I took it for granted. After all, I was writing and acting in my own successful TV show. 
Q: What happened when ""The State"" went off the air? 
A: I was 26 and suddenly I was just another guy trying to get a job. There was a five-year period where I was floundering — I was always running out of money, living paycheck to paycheck, in debt to my parents. Finally I decided that for my own sanity, for my own self-esteem, I had to live within my means. 
Q: What did you change?
A: I downsized. In my thirties, I moved out of my beautiful apartment and took a room in a Brooklyn loft with two roommates — my rent went from $1,400 a month to like $500. 
I got better at paying bills instead of being afraid of them. And I started teaching screenwriting at NYU, which I loved. It was the start of making me a normal worker guy — I was showing up, teaching, grading papers, holding office hours. 
When I realized I wanted to be a writer and director, I moved out to Los Angeles with no greater ambition than to get hired as a staff writer on a show and not get fired. 
Q: With such a workaday goal, how did you end up directing feature films?
A: Well, I was constantly working. In 2011, I got to be a writer on a TV show called ""Super Fun Night"" on ABC, but concurrently I was writing a movie called ""Hello My Name is Doris"" with Laura Terruso, whom I’d met at NYU. 
Doris was a tiny budget movie, but Sally Field read the script and said she’d do the movie, and I was signed on to direct. That was really a turning point for me. 
Q: You adopted your parents’ round-the-clock work ethic, and it paid off.
A: I’ll be 48 in June. If I have any sort of wisdom to offer as someone whose career has taken many twists and turns, it’s that hard work is rewarded. Discipline is rewarded. Teachability is rewarded. Humility is rewarded. And be nice. Be humble. Be a worker among workers. 
Q: Do you save more now?

A: I’m still not good with money. But a few years back I decided to hire a business manager. It’s the best commission I pay.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: In Chinese port city, Japan's Toyota lays foundation to ramp up sales","By Norihiko Shirouzu and Yilei Sun
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to make 120,000 more cars a year in the Chinese port city of Tianjin as part of a medium-term strategy that's gathering pace as China-Japan ties improve, said four company insiders with knowledge of the matter. 
The Japanese auto maker's plan to boost annual production capacity by about a quarter in the port city will lay the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, the four sources said.
The Tianjin expansion signals Toyota's willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world's biggest auto market, the sources said. Car imports could also increase, they said. 
The move comes at a time when China's trade outlook with the United States appears fraught and uncertain. 
Toyota plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. 
Toyota sold 1.29 million vehicles in China last year and while sales are projected at 1.4 million this year, ""capacity constraints"" have restricted stronger growth, the sources said. 
Toyota's manufacturing hub in Tianjin currently has the capacity to produce 510,000 vehicles a year, while Toyota as a whole, between two joint ventures, has overall capacity to churn out 1.16 million vehicles a year.
(GRAPHIC: Auto sales in China: https://tmsnrt.rs/2vHLtzS)
Manufacturing capacity numbers provided by automakers are called straight-time capacity without overtime. With overtime, a given assembly plant can produce 20 to 30 percent more than its capacity. 
According to two Tianjin government websites last week, Toyota has been given regulatory approval by the municipal government's Development and Reform Commission to pursue its expansion. 
The two websites - including the official website for the Tianjin development district where Toyota's production hub is based - said the Japanese automaker plans to expand its Tianjin base to be able to manufacture 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 so-called plug-in electric hybrids annually.
It wasn't immediately clear when Toyota will be able to start producing those additional cars. 
A Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment.
The Tianjin facilities, which produces cars such as the Toyota Corolla and Vios cars, are owned and operated by one of Toyota's joint ventures in China. 
The venture with FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] in Tianjin plans to invest 1.76 billion yuan ($257 million) for the expansion, according to the two Tianjin websites.
HISTORICAL BACKLASH
China is sometimes a market difficult to operate for Japanese companies because of historical reasons. 
In 2012, cars sold by Toyota and other Japanese automakers were battered when protests erupted across China after diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. 
Since then, Toyota has emphasized steady growth rather than taking on risky expansion projects. 
According to the four sources, Toyota's attitude toward China began changing markedly after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May. 
During the visit, Li toured Toyota's facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, and was escorted by Toyota's family scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda.
Toyoda has since sought to boost his company's presence in China, a vision that had culminated in an active effort to identify specific ways to do just that, according to the four sources.
They said aside from boosting capacity, Toyota is also looking at the possibility to significantly expand its distribution networks for the mainstream Toyota and premium Lexus brands. 
It wasn't immediately clear how significant a distribution network expansion Toyota is planning for both brands. 
Currently, Toyota has more than 1,300 stores for the Toyota brand and nearly 190 for its Lexus luxury cars.
The timing for the China expansion couldn't be better.
Earlier this year, Toyota was able to finally launch a couple of much anticipated, potentially high-volume subcompact sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) - two China-market versions of the Toyota C-HR crossover SUV which hit showrooms in the United States last year.
The C-HR variants are relatively small crossover SUVs that other manufacturers, most notably Japan's Honda Motor Co, have leveraged to grow sales rapidly and sell more cars in China than its much bigger rival Toyota. Honda sold 1.44 million vehicles in China last year.
Lexus is also deemed likely to benefit from a windfall from growing trade tensions between China and the United States. 
In retaliation for U.S. trade actions, China raised tariffs on automobiles imported from the United States in early July to 40 percent, which, among other things, has forced Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, BMW, as well as Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz to raise prices on certain U.S.-built vehicles, such as the hot-selling BMW X5 and X6 crossover sport-utility vehicles. 
One likely consequence for those brands is a sales fall, a profit squeeze, or both.

By contrast, all Lexus cars Toyota sells in China are brought in from Japan and benefit from a much lower tariff rate of 15 percent levied on non-U.S. produced car imports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sent subpoenas to Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) regarding Chief Executive Elon Musk's plan to take the company private and his statement that funding was ""secured,"" Fox Business Network reported on Wednesday, citing sources.
The electric carmaker's shares fell as much as 4 percent but cut their losses after  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said it was dropping equity coverage of Tesla because it is acting as a financial adviser on a matter related to the automaker.
Investors viewed the Goldman statement as confirming a tweet from Elon Musk on Monday about working with Goldman, even as the reported subpoenas indicated the SEC has opened a formal investigation into a matter. 
The latest news extended the roller-coaster ride for Tesla investors in recent days, adding to uncertainty about the future course of the company and whether a deal can be done amid growing regulatory complications. 
Tesla and the SEC declined to comment. 
Musk stunned investors and sent Tesla's shares soaring 11 percent when he tweeted early last week that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and that he had secured funding for the potential deal.
The shares fell 2.6 percent to $338.69 on Wednesday, below $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private. 
The Tesla CEO provided no details of his funding until Monday, when he said in a blog on Tesla's website that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down. 
Musk also tweeted late Monday night he was working with Goldman Sachs and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The 47-year old billionaire's tweet about secured funding may have violated U.S. securities law if he misled investors. On Monday, lawyers told Reuters Musk's statement indicated he had good reason to believe he had funding but seemed to have overstated its status by saying it was secured.
The SEC has opened an inquiry into Musk’s tweets, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter. Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain if this had escalated into a full-blown investigation on Wednesday. 
This source said Tesla's independent board members had hired law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to help handle the SEC inquiry and other fiduciary duties with respect to a potential deal.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 07:42PM ET</span>","Senate to consider massive spending bill, faces Trump objections","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators agreed on Wednesday to debate and vote in the next few days on more than $850 billion in spending on defense, labor and healthcare programs, as the Trump administration announced its objections to some parts of the bill.
The so-called ""minibus"" appropriations bill includes nearly $675 billion in spending for the Department of Defense, as well as about $182 billion for an array of domestic programs under the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and related agencies.
Congressional aides said the Senate combined the two bills in the hope that President Donald Trump would not veto the domestic spending measure.
Trump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress, which is controlled by his fellow Republicans, does not adhere to his spending priorities, especially his desire to spend billions of dollars to build a wall on the border with Mexico.
On Wednesday, his administration announced its position on the bill. While not threatening a veto, the ""Statement of Administration Policy"" noted that the bill does not include administration proposals to reduce spending in areas such as education and healthcare research.
It also balks at some defense spending reductions, including a $532 million reduction in Afghanistan security funding and a $406 million cut to a fund to train and equip U.S. partner forces in Iraq and Syria for the fight against Islamic State.
Trump has threatened a government shutdown several times since taking office in 2017 in a bid to get his immigration priorities in congressional spending bills, especially funding for a wall along the southern U.S. border. Trump has asked for $25 billion to build the wall.
Congress must agree on a spending measure to fund the government by a Sept. 30 deadline, or the federal government will be forced to suspend all but the most essential operations.

Shares rose 6.1 percent to $46.53 in extended trading as the company also highlighted improving subscription-based revenue.
Cisco, like other legacy technology companies, has been launching new products focused on high-growth areas such as cyber security and Internet of Things to cushion sluggish demand in its traditional routers and switches business.
""We're seeing the returns on the investments we are making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told analysts on a post-earnings call.
The company forecast first-quarter revenue growth of between 5 percent and 7 percent, implying $12.86 billion at the mid-point, and adjusted profit of between 70 cents and 72 cents per share. 
Analysts were expecting a profit of 69 cents and revenue of $12.61 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Subscriptions, which provide a more steady revenue stream, represented 56 percent of total software revenue in the reported quarter, the company said.
Revenue in the security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 12 percent to $627 million, beating estimates of $615.8 million. Deferred revenue in the business jumped 23 percent.
Cisco said in August it would buy cyber security provider Duo Security for $2.35 billion, the latest in a series of acquisitions by Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins as he builds out the company's newer businesses.
CFO Kramer told Reuters Cisco is looking at more acquisitions in the security space.
Revenue in its infrastructure platform division, which houses the company's traditional business of supplying switches and routers, rose 7 percent to $7.44 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.32 billion. 
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 70 cents per share, beating analysts expectation by 1 cent. 

Total revenue rose 6 percent to $12.84 billion, topping average estimate of $12.77 billion.

NEW YORK/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela faces payments of $1.1 billion in interest and principal on two bonds maturing on Wednesday, but investors expect the cash-strapped nation to continue its pattern of no payments.
The government of President Nicolas Maduro has halted almost all foreign debt payments, leaving Venezuela, which has a debt load of around $60 billion in direct and subsidiary foreign bonds, in default.
""We assume no funds allocated to make the sovereign amortization today as the first sovereign default and headline confirmation of cash flow stress,"" Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities International, wrote in a note to clients.
""It still looks like a countdown with economic crisis morphing into political crisis for the Maduro administration.""
Maduro’s government began quietly halting debt interest payments last year in an effort to save hard currency for the collapsing economy, which is suffering from hyperinflation.
Failure to make payments on Wednesday would mark Venezuela's first sovereign default since Maduro announced in November a plan to restructure the country's debt.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CAN'T GET MUCH WORSE
The maturing bonds are a fixed-coupon issued in 1998 with $752 million in principal and $51.2 million in interest , and one issued in 2001 with $300 million in principal and $20.4 million in interest .
The two bonds maturing on Wednesday traded at 28 cents on the dollar earlier this week, according to Reuters data.
""Prices are so on the floor right now that you could see a huge recovery,"" said Ray Zucaro, chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management in Miami.
Zucaro, who said he has a small exposure to a bond from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, does not expect Caracas to pay Wednesday's maturing bonds.
""The news flow is so negative I don’t know how much worse it can get,"" he said. ""I think we’re closer to a (breaking) point than we’ve ever been, but does that mean Maduro is gonna go in six months, six weeks, six days or six years? That’s hard to say.""

Venezuela’s benchmark 2027 U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bond  was last bid at 26.625 cents on the dollar.

The tariff-sensitive industrial sector (SPLRCI) slipped 0.5 percent, with  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) weighing on the Dow.
""A combination of fears of contagion from Turkey and a possibility of a China slowdown has upset markets worldwide,"" Kinahan added.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 04:28PM ET</span>",Uber narrows loss but is a long way from finding profit,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Wednesday it narrowed its quarterly losses from a year earlier, although the ride-hailing company is still a long way from proving it can be profitable as it gears up to go public in 2019. 
Under the leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi, who became chief executive in September, Uber has juggled investing in new markets while retreating from others where it was losing millions of dollars. It is building up services like food delivery and freight hauling as it seeks new revenue, and possibly a path to profitability, outside its core business. 
Uber's net loss narrowed to $891 million in its second quarter ending June 30 from $1.1 billion a year earlier. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $614 million, down from $773 million a year earlier. 
Net revenue rose more quickly than gross bookings in the second quarter from the prior period as the company dialed back on promotional subsidies of rides.
But its growth faces risks from decisions like that by New York City this month to cap licenses for ride-hailing services for one year. Uber has also had to grapple with corporate scandals and has lingering and costly legal battles, including over its classification of drivers as independent contractors, and federal probes to resolve. 
""I remain unimpressed,"" said Brent Goldfarb, associate professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland. Improving losses by cutting ""the lowest hanging fruit doesn't mean the underlying model is profitable."" 
The company's most recent valuation was pegged earlier this year at $72 billion. But that was based on Uber becoming the global winner in ride-hailing and logistics, a vision it has retrenched from, and public investors may see a smaller company worth less.
Uber can expect a valuation haircut in an IPO if it does not show more progress toward becoming profitable, said David Brophy, professor of finance at the University of Michigan. 
Adjusted losses in the first quarter were $312 million, excluding gains from Uber selling some overseas businesses to local competitors. The sale of its Russia and Southeast Asia operations resulted in a one-time $2.5 billion gain in the first quarter and lowered second-quarter costs.
Under pressure from its board, Uber has endeavored to find more savings after years of a growth-at-all-cost mentality under prior CEO Travis Kalanick, enabled by billions of dollars in private investment.
The company had $12 billion in quarterly gross bookings, which includes rides and Uber Eats, up 6 percent from the previous quarter and about 40 percent from a year before. 
Net revenue, which strips out what gets paid to drivers as well as promotions and refunds, was $2.8 billion, up 8 percent over the first quarter and more than 60 percent from last year. 
""We had another great quarter, continuing to grow at an impressive rate for a business of our scale,"" Khosrowshahi said in a statement. 
STICKING WITH INDIA, MIDDLE EAST
Uber is a private company and not required to publicly disclose financials, but recently boosted transparency by starting to release selected figures as it eyes an initial public offering.
Faced with criticism about flooding cities with cars, Uber is spending on bike and scooter rentals, including its acquisition of JUMP electric bikes in April.
While Uber has retreated from China, Southeast Asia and Russia, it says it is sticking with India and the Middle East, tough markets with strong local competitors.
""We are cementing our leadership position,"" in India and the Middle East, Khosrowshahi said.
Several Uber investors have told Reuters they want Uber to leave these costly markets too and focus on North America, where U.S.-based Lyft continues to pose a threat, and pull back on ancillary businesses like Uber Freight.

Uber has $7.3 billion in cash on hand, up a billion dollars from the end of the first quarter. The company listed an inflow of $1.5 billion from term loan issuance, net of costs.

1. Walmart Needs Digital Earnings Strength
Retail earnings continue with Walmart Inc(NYSE:WMT) issuing numbers before the bell.
Analysts, on average, expect a profit of $1.22 per share, on sales of about $126 billion.
In a nutshell, it’s all about e-commerce. That's a key battleground where market leader Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major threat to brick-and-mortar operations. Walmart is spending billions of dollars to acquire digital properties, reorganize its stores and train its workers.
In its biggest-ever deal, announced this year, Walmart bought a controlling stake in India’s largest online seller, Flipkart Group, for $16 billion. That follows an acquisition of e-commerce startup Jet.com two years ago.
The stiff competition in the grocery space and the shift to e-commerce are the headwinds that will continue to pressure profitability. That won’t go away anytime soon.
2. Housing Numbers on Tap
Numbers giving the market insight into the housing market arrive before the bell tomorrow.
Data on housing starts and building permits arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that month-on-month housing starts were up 7.4% in July. Building permits are expected to be up 1.4%.
At the same time, the Philly Fed manufacturing index arrives. Economists are expecting a reading of 21.9.
3. Energy Stocks Hit
Oil prices are in the spotlight again, keeping energy stocks active on Wall Street.
Energy stocks fell sharply today. The S&P Energy Sector index tumbled 3.5%, with  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), its weakest component, down about 7%
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery fell 3% to settle at $65.01 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 2.10% to trade at $70.94 barrel.Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 6.805 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 10, missing expectations for a draw of 2.449 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

419,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Musk's Saudi Gambit Invites the Kind of Leverage He Doesn't Want,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk has painted an idyllic picture of a private Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. operating away from investor scrutiny and short-seller attacks. But in casting Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund as a key player to allow him freer reign, he’s given them leverage to exert significant influence.
The Tesla chief executive officer has said the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s interest alone justified his claim last week that he had the funding secured to buy out some investors. The outsize role Musk described the fund playing in going public with his proposal could even give the Saudi fund a stake on par with his.
The Saudi PIF is unlikely to operate like famous activists Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman, who’ve built their reputations by taking on boards and management, but they do have an agenda to bring more technology to the kingdom. Acquiring a big stake may embolden the fund to urge Musk to share solar or battery tech and even rein in Musk’s boisterous public persona.
“If the PIF increases their stake, they will probably have a lot of say in how the company is run,” said Michael Maduell, president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. “Their vision is to create job opportunities in the kingdom. I wouldn’t be surprised that they would want a gigafactory built in the kingdom.”
Representatives for the PIF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Leverage
Failing to secure major buy-in by the Saudi fund would complicate Musk’s defense of his initial tweets from investor lawsuits and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s scrutiny. Fox Business reported Wednesday that the agency had sent Tesla a subpoena, citing unidentified sources.
It also would mean having to come up with alternative sources of funding to help buy out those investors who would rather take the $420 a share that the CEO has promised them than have their holdings rolled over into an illiquid stock in a less-transparent company.
Musk, 47, has bristled at having to answer to Wall Street analysts on a quarterly basis and at dealing with investors who’ve built up immense short-sale positions against Tesla, betting the stock will drop.
New Master
A major Saudi fund stake would likely mean Musk would have to please masters of a different sort. Saudi Arabia has been arranging big investments by high-profile American companies including  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. and Raytheon as part of roughly $400 billion in deals signed between the two countries.
GE has $15 billion in projects and joint ventures planned in Saudi Arabia to create technology centers and jobs in oil and gas, mining, manufacturing and health care. The company just started producing gas turbine engines in the kingdom last year and plans to double its employee count there to 4,000 by 2020.
The PIF also invested $3.5 billion in Uber Technologies Inc. in 2016. Since then, the ride-hailing giant has opened a “female partner support center” to help women learn to drive and work for the ride-hailing app.
Sizable Stake?
The Saudi fund already has close to a 5 percent holding in Tesla. Musk wrote in a blog post that their interest in taking the company private dates back to early 2017. A spokesman declined to comment beyond the post, in which Musk said that he would like for Tesla to “continue to have a broad investor base.”
Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, believes Musk would prefer to limit investors to the roughly 20 percent equity stake that he owns as the company’s largest shareholder.
But the CEO may accept being surpassed if he’s unable to secure a big enough syndicate to complete the transaction, Munster wrote in a report this week. The Tesla bull estimates a greater than 50 percent likelihood that the company is private in less than a year.
Other Options
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson isn’t so sure. He acknowledges that oil-rich sovereign wealth funds including those for Saudi Arabia and Norway have plenty of cash to contribute as a hedge against the commodity Musk is trying to wean the world from. But they have plenty other investments to choose from, including Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, battery technology and raw materials such as lithium and cobalt.
“As glamorous as Tesla seems to be as a holding, we’re not sure if it’s the best much less the only way to diversify away from oil,” Johnson wrote in a report Tuesday. The analyst, who rates Tesla the equivalent of sell with a $210 price target, said sovereign wealth funds will have to consider the likelihood that Musk will need additional funding to keep expanding the company. Plus, their positions will be less liquid if the carmaker is taken private.
As state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco set its sights on going public, the government touted plans to make PIF the world’s largest sovereign-wealth fund, controlling $2 trillion. But Aramco’s initial public offering has run into snags, and the company signaled another potential delay by starting talks last month to buy a stake in a local petrochemical company.
The good news for Musk and Tesla is that the PIF isn’t just interested in quick returns.
“If you have public scrutiny and all of the short-term pressures that come with it and wanted to swap that out, partnering with someone who has a long-term investment focus might not be a bad trade,” said Patrick Schena, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School who studies sovereign wealth funds.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","U.S. says EU stalling on Airbus, blocks request for WTO compliance panel","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday the European Union and four of its planemaker states have failed to bring subsidies for Airbus (PA:AIR) into line with a WTO ruling of last May, an accusation refuted by the EU.
The EU asked the WTO last week to certify that it has complied with WTO rulings that found its Airbus subsidies illegal, attempting to forestall billions of dollars of U.S. retaliatory sanctions. 
However, at Wednesday's meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, the EU's request to set up a fresh panel to rule on its ""full compliance"" was blocked by the U.S. delegation. The next meeting is on Aug. 27 where the row is expected to surface again.
""As we sit here today, the EU and these four member states still have not provided even the most basic information about alleged amendments made to certain launch aid contracts,"" the U.S. delegation said, referring to Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
The WTO appeals body ruled on May 15 that the EU had failed to remove subsidized government development loans for the world's largest airliner, the A380, and Europe's newest long-haul jet, the A350, causing losses for Boeing and U.S. aerospace workers. 
The two trading powers have been locked in a 14-year dispute over funding to Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA). 

The EU has complained to the WTO against prohibited support it says Washington has given Boeing and a parallel panel ruling on that complaint is expected later this year.

423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Argentina Is Playing a Dangerous Game in the Bond Market ,"(Bloomberg) -- Desperate to staunch a run on the peso that has helped drive the economy to the brink of recession, Argentina is aggressively pushing investors out of some of the local debt notes they hold.
It is a risky gambit -- the opposite of the kind of measure a country would typically take at a moment of great financial duress. And yet Argentina finds itself pursuing the tack as part of a complex scheme aimed at shoring up investor confidence in its beleaguered central bank -- a step that policy makers believe is crucial to ushering in economic stability in a place long associated with default and runaway inflation.
If the gamble is to work, many of the investors who are being driven out of the notes they now hold -- popular short-term securities that were issued by the central bank at interest rates that reached 47 percent -- will have to be persuaded to plow their money into newer debt instruments being dangled by the government. 
The catch: the new securities have maturities of as long as a year, more than 10 times longer than those on most of the old notes. And it isn’t clear who would want to tie their money up in peso for longer periods of time in the middle of a full-blown crisis. The concern is that investors will opt to buy dollars with the cash instead, which would only add to the peso’s 38 percent plunge this year.
“It is highly risky,” says Walter Stoeppelwerth, the chief investment officer at Buenos Aires-based Balanz Capital. While the push to strengthen the central bank’s balance sheet makes sense, “they waited too long to undertake the process.”
The first major indication of whether this strategy will work out will be revealed later today when the government announces results of an auction of peso-denominated notes known as Letes that mature in 105 or 224 days. (One initial troubling sign came in last night when the central bank failed to sell another longer-term security, with investors opting for short-term notes.)
Macri’s Arrival
At the core of the problem are short-term central bank notes known as Lebacs, which became popular investment instruments when the central bank jacked up rates in December 2015 just as President Mauricio Macri lifted currency controls imposed by his predecessors.
The notes mopped up excess cash in the economy and helped damp inflation but became a growing concern for investors as the amount in circulation swelled to 976 billion pesos ($32.5 billion). They were structured in such a way that more than 500 billion pesos of the securities would come due some months, creating market volatility as investors nervously eyed the rollover risk.
The situation was worrying enough that the International Monetary Fund demanded Argentina address it as part of a $50 billion credit line that largely had managed to calm local markets until the crisis in Turkey sparked a new wave of selling across the developing world.
So the central bank, led since June by former Finance Minister Luis Caputo, unveiled a plan Monday to phase out all of its remaining Lebacs by the end of the year and largely replace them with debt issued by the Treasury. The central bank will offer fewer of the Lebac notes for rollover in each sale until December, when the aim is to have eliminated them entirely.
Concern about runaway consumer prices and a rapidly depreciating currency has already prompted the central bank to jack up interest rates. Policy makers set the benchmark rate at a record 45 percent on Monday -- the fourth surprise increase this year -- and pledged to keep it at that level at least until October.
While a surge in dollar demand poses a risk of undermining the peso, the IMF credit line gives policy makers a big chunk of dollars they could use to meet demand and limit volatility. Argentina has $56 billion in reserves, more than double the level when Macri came into office. The speculation among investors is that authorities won’t mind some percentage of the proceeds from expiring Lebacs going into the foreign-exchange market, but the key is getting the right balance.
In its first auction since the announcement, the central bank rolled over 201 billion pesos in Lebacs on Tuesday, less than the 330 billion pesos worth of maturing securities eligible to rollover.
“It’s not a bad plan if they coordinate well between the central bank and Treasury, but it’s not risk-free,” said Carlos de Sousa, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in London.
For policy makers to claim success, they’ll need to sell the equivalent of $11 billion of securities to absorb liquidity over the next few weeks -- or about two-thirds of the amount of Lebacs maturing -- De Sousa said.
“If it’s less, it would be worrisome because there would be substantial excess liquidity,” De Sousa said.

U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas ruled on Tuesday the plaintiffs could go ahead with their suit against Exxon, former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and several financial executives.
The civil suit alleges Exxon and the executives failed to properly account for climate impact to its business and made public statements and financial disclosures that caused its share price to fall. 
The decision to proceed ""is an important first step in holding one of the world's most powerful corporations accountable,"" said Darren Robbins, an attorney for the plaintiffs, which include the Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters Pension Fund. 
Exxon had sought to dismiss the suit, arguing plaintiffs failed to state a claim for the civil action. 
""We continue to believe the complaint is meritless and will vigorously defend ourselves from these baseless claims,"" said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. 
The case is one of several, including shareholder and employee lawsuits, centered on whether Exxon has for decades lied about climate change, including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves, and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew.
New York and Massachusetts attorneys general are investigating whether the company misled the public and investors on its statements on climate change, releasing documents showing that Tillerson while at the company had used an email account under a different name to discuss climate-related issues.
Exxon has called those investigations politically motivated. 

The case is Pedro Ramirez Jr v. Exxon Mobil et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 16-03111.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Corona owner invests another $4 billion in cannabis producer Canopy,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Nichola Saminather
(Reuters) - Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (N:STZ) will infuse another $4 billion into Canada's top cannabis producer Canopy Growth (TO:WEED), the biggest investment in the industry, to capitalize on booming demand for marijuana.
Constellation, among the first big alcohol makers to invest in the marijuana industry, pumped almost $200 million in Canopy last year in a deal to produce a non-alcoholic cannabis-based beverage. 
With the new investment it will support Canopy's full suite of products and assist as it develops new offerings, Constellation Chief Executive Rob Sands said on a conference call. 
Toronto-listed Canopy shares rose as much as 35 percent and were up 28 percent at C$41.17 at 10:18 am ET (1418 GMT), the highest level since June, and lifted shares of its peers. Constellation shares slid 8 percent to $203.73 in New York.
Canopy said it will use the proceeds to expand and gain exposure to the nearly 30 countries likely to approve medical marijuana. It is targeting C$1 billion in overseas acquisitions over the next six to 12 months, Canopy Chief Executive Bruce Linton said on the call.
""This (deal) marks the end of the warm-up in our sector ... It's fully go-time,"" Linton said.
Canada, where 4.4 million people reported using marijuana in the first half of the year, approved medical marijuana in 2001 and will fully legalize the recreational use of cannabis in October. 
As some countries start opening up to legalizing medicinal marijuana, Constellation peers  Molson Coors  (N:TAP) and Anheuser-Busch (BR:ABI) have also pursued cannabis deals. Molson Coors said this month its Canadian arm would make cannabis-infused drinks with Hydropothecary Corp (TO:HEXO).
With its new deal, Constellation is paying a 38 percent premium to Canopy's five-day average price, taking its ownership in the company to 38 percent. 
""While STZ (Constellation) is paying a rich premium ... we believe this was the right move and further solidifies STZ's first-mover advantage ...,"" Bonnie Herzog, a senior analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), said in a note. 
Constellation's shares had gained 11.7 percent over the past year before the announcement, underperforming the S&P 500 index. Canopy's share price has almost tripled.
Canopy is Canada's biggest cannabis firm, with a market capitalization of C$8.9 billion ($6.76 billion). 
Five of the biggest Canadian producers are now worth a total of over C$18 billion, despite low sales and almost non-existent profits, as they pour capital into increasing capacity.
Recreational use is allowed in nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and sales in U.S. legal markets should nearly triple to $16 billion by 2020 from $5.4 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor International.
Constellation said neither company plans to sell cannabis products in the United States until it is allowed to do so at all government levels.
Canopy's revenue rose 63 percent to C$25.9 million in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier. Cannabis sales volumes climbed 47 percent, while the average sale price was up 12 percent, driven by increased sales of medical marijuana in Germany, Linton said.
Constellation expects the investment in Canopy to add to earnings in 2021. The deal is expected to close in October. [nCNWc3x7ka]
The deal lifted shares of  Aurora Cannabis  (TO:ACB) and  Aphria Inc  (TO:APH), which rose 21 percent and 17 percent respectively. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which includes U.S.- and Canadian-listed marijuana producers, rose 6.4 percent.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","Trump advisor touts Sprint, T-Mobile deal while denying lobbying","By Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, touted on Wednesday benefits he sees in federal government approval of T-Mobile US Inc's bid to acquire Sprint Corp, while also denying that he has worked directly for the company. 
Lewandowski said he remains in regular contact with the president and has daily contact with Trump's new campaign manager Brad Parscale. He has said he does not lobby on behalf of companies, but said he does consult with some corporations about navigating the federal government.
""If the T-Mobile deal is going to move forward because it's going to create better 5G coverage in rural areas and create more jobs in the marketplace and help grow and compete with a competitive China, then without any hesitation I say we should have more jobs, we should be more competitive,"" Lewandowski said on Wednesday at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. ""I have no idea what the Justice Department does on it. I haven't spoken to anyone at the Justice Department on it.""
U.S. antitrust enforcers have started reviewing T-Mobile's plan to buy Sprint for $26 billion, and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs. The two companies compete against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon to provide U.S. wireless service. 
Lewandowski is among those advising the No. 3 wireless company on its deal as it prepares for what should be a tough regulatory review process, the mobile provider said in a statement in May. 
Lobbying by former Trump officials has received increased attention after it was made public that Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney, was paid $1.2 million by Novartis and $600,000 by AT&T to consult about the administration.
It is not uncommon for former political officials to lobby and consult with corporations after leaving the employment of an elected official.
A T-Mobile spokeswoman declined to comment on Lewandowski.
Lewandowski insisted he simply shares office space with a lobbying shop, Turnberry Solutions LLC, which is advising T-Mobile. Lobbying disclosure reports show T-Mobile has paid Turnberry Solutions LLC $170,000 since September 2017. T-Mobile said in May that Lewandowski ""is now affiliated with (Turnberry) and they have offered perspective to T-Mobile on a variety of topics, including the pending transaction."" 

""T-Mobile hired Jason Osborne and Mike Rubino, which is a firm that is also housed at the same office space that I am, and I talk to these guys all the time,"" Lewandowski said when asked why T-Mobile said he was consulting with them. ""I haven't made a phone call. I've never called a government employee or a person and asked them to look at, help, solicit, move forward, pass any transaction, and I would challenge anybody in the room to find someone in the government who said I called and asked for a favor because I've never done it.""

443,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Margin worries send Macy's shares tumbling after profit beat,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) on Wednesday said its gross margins would shrink in the fall season as delivery expenses rise, overshadowing a quarterly sales and profit beat and sending shares down more than 13 percent.
The department store operator reported a surprise rise in quarterly same-store sales and also upped its full-year sales and profit forecasts. Overall quarterly sales were lower, though better than analysts had expected.
Macy's has been closing stores, controlling inventory, building its Backstage off-price business and selling or leasing out prime real estate properties to grapple with falling mall foot traffic and online competition. 
It launched a revamped loyalty program in October 2017, which executives on Wednesday said would result in a bigger hit from delivery expenses to third-quarter margins this year. 
""We expect our gross margin rate as a percent of sales to be slightly up for the year, this means that the gross margin rate is assumed to be slightly below last year in the fall,"" Chief Financial Officer Paula Price said on a post earnings call.
The sharp share move also comes after Macy's stock has surged 66 percent this year, far outperforming the S&P 500 retailing index <.SPXRT>. It has more than doubled since touching a seven-year low of $17.40 in November.
Shares were last down 13.8 percent at $36.02 on Wednesday. 
""Macy's shares may be selling off this morning as result of profit taking, despite healthy second-quarter beat and raised full-year guidance,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick said.
Macy's results also pulled down shares of rival department store operators J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP),  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Kohl's Corp (N:KSS), all down more than 5 percent.
Research firm Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins echoed Tunick's view, while also flagging a dip in second-quarter margins.
Perkins said based on his calculation Macy's gross margins dipped 20 basis points in the quarter even when some full-price selling should have translated into higher margins. 
Macy's operates its namesake stores as well as Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury.
Macy's now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, up from its prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.95 per share, and total sales to range from flat to up 0.7 percent, also above its previous target. 
Macy's executives said they had seen particular strength in men's, kids, furniture and activewear, and that they were encouraged by a good start to the back-to-school season at the end of the second quarter.
Sales at Macy's stores open more than 12 months, including sales in departments licensed to third parties, rose 0.5 percent, compared with the average analyst estimate of a 0.9 percent drop, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The sales and EPS outlook raise, analysts said, suggests expectations for continued momentum in the business through the year despite harder year-over-year comparisons and unfavorable timing shifts. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 70 cents per share, much higher than analysts' expectations of 51 cents.
Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders rose to $166 million in the second quarter ended Aug. 4 from $111 million a year earlier.

Net sales fell 1.1 percent to $5.57 billion, but still topped estimates of $5.55 billion.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>","From blue lipstick to Facebook Live, home shopping networks refine their pitch","By Melissa Fares
WEST CHESTER, Pa. (Reuters) - HSN, once known as the Home Shopping Network, is getting an image makeover.
A U.S. television network where shoppers can buy everything from electronics to kitchen gadgets, HSN is overhauling its lineup to offer more beauty products while adding streamed video content to win over shoppers without cable TV. 
A division of Qurate Retail Group, the network is facing growing competition from Amazon Inc. and Evine Live Inc for consumers like 24-year old Erin Bounds, who regard buying products through TV shows a relic of the past. 
""Someone who is 24 doesn't have the time nor desire to watch an hour-long show about a piece of jewelry or a vacuum when they can get an answer and the product quicker and probably cheaper on Amazon,"" said Bounds, a resident of Ellicott City, Maryland.
For decades, the main difference to shoppers between HSN and Qurate's other shopping network, QVC, typically came down to variations in branding and merchandise, with HSN selling more electronics. Qurate acquired HSN in late 2017 for $2.1 billion so the two shopping networks could join forces to better compete against Amazon and its home-shopping-style online video promotions.
Qurate executives told Reuters they now are culling HSN's core merchandise offerings to eliminate many higher-priced electronics and some home goods, such as vacuum cleaners and blenders.
Instead, they are adding more niche cosmetic and apparel brands to help draw some distinction with QVC. They are also pushing both QVC and HSN to pursue younger shoppers with click-to-buy links on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live for items such as earrings, shoes and Vince Camuto jeans, in a bid to spark a rebound in demand. 
Second-quarter revenue at HSN declined 12 percent to $473 million from $533 million a year later the company announced Wednesday. Stock in the company, which counts media mogul John Malone as one of its largest investors, is down about 8 percent year to date, compared with a 14 percent increase for the Nasdaq index, and 64 percent increase for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) year to date. 
""You're seeing the impact of them digesting a large organization that is clearly not growing if you look at the numbers,"" said Ben Claremon, partner and research analyst at investment firm Cove Street Capital, one of Qurate's shareholders. 
""There's just not the degree of demand for home shopping products, and the desire to spend hours of the day watching them diminishes as you go down in age,"" he said. 
BALANCING BLUE LIPSTICK WITH BRACELETS
The new strategy is aimed at creating more distinction with the two cable channels after the merger, according to Rob Robillard, the new VP of Beauty Integration at Qurate. 
In beauty, for example, one of HSN's top selling products is Too Faced ""Unicorn Tears"" blue lipstick, which sells for roughly $22. One of QVC's best products is the Doll 10 Nude lipstick with a price tag of around $25, noted Robillard.
""We were sort of hoping there would be this real big difference between HSN and QVC,"" he said. ""But the two are actually very similar."" 
Qurate will partner with Robin Burns-McNeill, chairman of Batallure Beauty, a company specializing in brand strategy, product and package development, sourcing and manufacturing in the fragrance, cosmetics and skincare categories, to create a collection of proprietary beauty brands, the company told Reuters exclusively. 
The first manufactured beauty products from this partnership are slated to launch in fall 2019 on QVC.com, and, if all goes well, the company said they would likely tap on Burns-McNeill's shoulder to create proprietary brands for HSN as well.
They have a tall order. Amazon is the top online destination for beauty and the fifth-most-popular retailer for skincare and cosmetics, according to Coresight Research, behind leaders Walmart (NYSE:WMT), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS),  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walgreens. QVC and HSN do not rank on the list.
In March 2016, Amazon launched ""Style Code Live,"" a daily live fashion show which has since gone off-air.
This June, Amazon unveiled Prime Wardrobe in the United States, allowing Prime members to try on clothing, shoes, and accessories before purchase. Customers have up to seven days to try their clothes on at home, and are charged only for those items they choose to keep.
Celebrity-driven shows and videos on QVC still have their upside, according to vendors such as Xcel Brands Inc Chief Executive Robert D'Loren. A QVC apparel vendor for more than six years, D'Loren cites on-air appearances of fashion designer and QVC host Isaac Mizrahi - D'Loren's largest, most successful brand on QVC - as strategic advantage for selling goods on TV. 
D'Loren thinks Qurate, which currently accounts for 60 percent of Xcel's brand volume, is well-positioned to take on competitors Amazon.com and video retailer Evine, and that it's ""only a matter of time"" before millennials like Bounds give Qurate's QVC and HSN a shot. 
""There is something to tuning in, watching, having product fully demonstrated to you that is unique and has great value, and I haven't seen that anywhere else in the market,"" he said.

449,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 10:34AM ET</span>",Elon Musk may only face a minor fee if the SEC investigates his tweet storm about taking Tesla private — here's why," After a week of speculation, the plans of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, to explore the possibility of taking the company private are coming into focus. But the timing of their announcements has raised questions.
 The Wall Street Journal reported last Wednesday that the SEC had made an inquiry into Tesla about whether one of Musk's tweets regarding the possibility of taking the company private was truthful. And on Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the agency was ""intensifying"" its inquiry.
An inquiry from the SEC does not necessarily mean an investigation will follow.
On Tuesday, Tesla said its board of directors had formed a special committee to consider any forthcoming go-private proposals. It was the company's first regulatory filing since Musk indicated on August 7 via Twitter that he had secured the funding for such a move, were it to pass a shareholder vote.
Within 24 hours of making a disclosure to a select group of people that could affect shareholders, companies must make sure that information is ""broadly disseminated,"" Nimish Patel, a partner at the law firm Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp who specializes in corporate and securities laws, told Business Insider. He said a company has multiple options to do so, including by filing an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission or putting out a press release. The rule is designed to ensure that all investors are aware of information that could affect the value of their investments at the same time, Patel said.
But he added that, by first offering details for a potential go-private deal via Twitter, Musk followed the spirit of the SEC's rules about disclosing important information. In 2013, Tesla said it may make material disclosures via Twitter in an SEC filing, and since Musk's Twitter account has a large following and is covered widely by the media, he and Tesla are unlikely to be punished for the timing of Tuesday's 8-K filing, Patel said.
""Can someone really say that they weren't aware of this information?"" he said. 
The SEC is more likely to focus on Musk's use of the phrase ""funding secured,"" in an August 7 tweet. On Monday, Musk said in a statement that he used the phrase ""funding secured"" because he believed there was ""no question"" Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would provide funding for a deal to convert Tesla into a private company after a July 31 meeting with the fund's managing director.
But Musk didn't mention any legally-binding agreements that were in place at the time he sent the ""funding secured"" tweet (""He has expressed support for proceeding subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals,"" Musk said of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund's managing director) and said he was in discussions with the Saudi fund and other investors, which suggested some sources of funding were not be settled before the tweet was sent.
""As a securities lawyer, I would not advise my client to use the word 'secured' at the stage where I believe that they might be at in that conversation,"" Patel said, adding that Musk should have included more context about potential funding sources in his tweet.
While it's difficult to tell if the SEC will launch an investigation and bring an enforcement action against Tesla, Patel said, if it does, it will more likely be a small fine or a stern warning than anything approaching criminal prosecution, unless the agency finds that Musk purchased Tesla shares before his ""funding secured"" tweet increased the price of the company's stock.
""I don't think this is going to be a big issue for the SEC,"" he said.
Gene Munster, a managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures, echoed that point in an interview with  CNBC. He said that while he expects Tesla to receive a small fine from NASDAQ for failing to notify the stock exchange before Musk's ""funding secured"" tweet, neither Musk nor the company will face more extensive punishment.
""I expect a fine will be levied against Tesla,"" he  said. ""It will be a small fine, my guess is probably below $50,000.""

453,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",FT boss to give back part of $3.3 million salary after staff complain,"LONDON (Reuters) - Financial Times Chief Executive John Ridding is to give some of his 2.6 million pound ($3.3 million) salary back to the company after a group of the newspaper's reporters complained about his pay, according to an email to staff seen by Reuters.
Earlier this month Steve Bird, joint head of the paper's National Union of Journalists group, wrote to FT editors and journalists across the world, saying Ridding's pay was absurdly high and that he should give some back to help those on lower salaries.
Ridding said his salary was established by Japanese media group Nikkei, which bought the Financial Times in 2015, and was independently assessed and ""highly performance-related"".
""While our performance has been strong, I recognize that the size of the consequent jump in my own total reward in 2017 feels anomalous and has created concerns,"" he wrote. Ridding said he had decided his remuneration should be restructured.
""For now, I have decided to reinvest into the FT the increase awarded in 2017, which is 510,000 pounds before tax.""
Ridding said ""the first call"" on the money would be a women's development fund to boost the newspaper's efforts to promote women to more senior roles and reduce the gender pay gap.
""The balance of funds will be used to help meet the company's overall financial objectives,"" he said.
Nikkei, which paid $1.3 billion for the Financial Times, said the company was very satisfied with the growth of the newspaper under Ridding and his team, and the success of the FT-Nikkei partnership.

454,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","Now Greek Bonds Are a Better Alternative to Italy, Says SocGen","(Bloomberg) -- Greek bonds as a safer bet? Now that’s something new.
While still ranked non-investment grade by major rating companies, the Mediterranean nation’s debt may prove relatively resilient to simmering Italian political risks because it’s “very hard” to depict scenarios in which Greece could default on its borrowings, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
That could help the securities outperform Italian ones provided potential bouts of risk aversion in the region continue to be centered on Rome, analysts at the bank said.
“There is long-term value in Greece, especially when we get over the threats of risk aversion just now,” Societe Generale strategists Yvan Mamalet and Ciaran O’Hagan wrote in a note to clients. “GGB spreads should narrow relative to BTPs if the origin of the disturbance is in Italy.”
Greece is set to exit its third bailout package this month and may announce this year its program for tapping the markets in 2019. Currently, investors are only able to buy the country’s bonds at a syndication, which makes it challenging to exit the market should an external shock -- such as the recent slide in Turkey’s lira -- jolt global markets.
Bank of Greece data show that turnover on the electronic secondary securities market, or HDAT, totaled 139 million euros ($157 million) this month through Aug. 10. That compares with 561 million euros in the whole of July and a peak of 136 billion euros in September 2004.
Still, the yield premiums on Greek bonds over so-called BTPs have narrowed through the turmoil that rocked Italy’s markets in recent months. The five-year spread is at 100 basis points, the lowest level since the financial crisis.

The reported comments by Alexandre Barreto come just weeks after European antitrust regulators fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($4.91 billion) and ordered it to stop using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals.
According to the report, Barreto said Cade would decide whether to formally probe the U.S. company, whose parent is Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), depending on the results of an evaluation that is already underway. 
""What we are doing now is analyzing the European Union's decision to determine if we have grounds to act here,"" Barreto said in an interview. 
Google declined to comment. But in a blog post following the European Union decision, CEO Sundar Pichai said Android phones compete with iOS phones, adding that the ruling did not take into account how much choice Android provides phone-makers and mobile network operators. 
Google's Android system, which device makers can use for free, runs on about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.
According to the European Union, Google's illegal behavior dates back to 2011 and includes forcing manufacturers to preinstall Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store on their Android devices. It also includes paying them to preinstall only Google Search and blocking them from using rival systems.

Google said it would appeal that ruling.

457,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Barclays Trader Faces $19 Million Loss on Turkey Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- A senior  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc trader has faced losses of about 15 million pounds ($19 million) on Turkish bonds over the past few days, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tolga Kirbay, a London-based credit trader, was caught on the wrong side of a wager over three trading days starting from Thursday, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details aren’t public. Barclays generally makes up to $100 million in revenue each year trading emerging-market corporate bonds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to the people.
While the trade is relatively modest for the British bank overall -- and while the lira has recovered some of its plunge in the past two days -- it does highlight the growing appetite for risk at Barclays’ securities unit. It’s unclear whether the positions have been hedged and whether Kirbay recovered the losses.
“Barclays has an established and diversified credit business with all our trading positions hedged across the business,” the bank said in an emailed statement. The Turkish trading operation “represents a very small part of our overall credit business.”
Kirbay, who joined Barclays earlier in the year from French lender  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, is one of a number of hires the British bank has made for its credit business in the past year and a half as it seeks to take on more risk to chase higher returns. He traded bonds of Turkish corporates and banks at BNP Paribas, as well as sovereign debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Turkish assets have taken a battering after the U.S. sanctioned two ministers in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in a spat over the continued detention of an American pastor in Turkey, pushing the economy toward a full-blown financial meltdown. That caused a plunge in the Turkish lira, raised the prospect of a recession and triggered declines in European banks with exposure to the emerging market, including Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA.
Some Turkish corporate bonds are down about 50 percent this year, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. Six of the 10 worst performing bonds in a Bloomberg Barclays index of emerging-market corporates were issued by Turkish firms.
Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley has redeployed billions of pounds of assets into riskier and more lucrative trading activities in a bid to boost returns at the investment bank division. Credit, the business of buying and selling corporate bonds, derivatives and loans, is among the bank’s five “key target areas,” according to a Sept. 2017 presentation.
Turkish assets have since recovered some value after the meltdown. The lira rose against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday and was up a further 4 percent Wednesday at 12:48 p.m. in London."

459,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>","China's Tencent second-quarter profit falls 2 percent, first decline in nearly 13 years","By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd on Wednesday reported a surprise 2 percent fall in second-quarter net profit, the first decline in nearly 13 years, due to slower than expected gaming growth and weak investment gains.
China's largest social media and gaming firm said April-June profit fell to 17.87 billion yuan ($2.59 billion), lagging the 19.67 billion yuan average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.
The outlook for the most valuable company listed in Asia has been overshadowed by a slowdown in mobile gaming and concerns over regulatory setbacks as the Chinese regulator this week blocked Tencent's sale of the blockbuster game ""Monster Hunter: World"" upon debut.
Tencent said it would try to reinvigorate its mobile game revenue growth by extracting more value from existing popular titles, launching more role-playing games, and publishing more of its China-developed games internationally. 
Mobile gaming revenue rose 19 percent year-on-year in the June quarter to 17.6 billion yuan, representing a quarter-on-quarter decline of 19 percent. The company blamed that on ""non-monetisation of popular tactical tournament games and timing of new game releases"".
Amid an industry-wide freeze on new game approvals in China since March, Tencent has yet to receive the license to sell survival-themed game PlayerUnknowns' Battlegrounds and to introduce Fortnite, a tactical tournament game developed by its portfolio company Epic Games. 
Trading in its shares has been volatile this year. Since the stock peaked in January, Tencent has lost around $170 billion in market value.
Revenue rose 30 percent to 73.68 billion yuan in the latest quarter, lagging 16 analysts' average estimate of 77.5 billion yuan. That represented the slowest quarterly revenue growth since the second quarter of 2015.
Revenue from PC games dropped 5 percent year-on-year and 8 percent quarter-on-quarter.
""We view our internally developed games Arena of Valor and PUBG MOBILE, as highly suitable for expansion to gamers outside China,"" Tencent said in the filing, adding Arena of Valor, a fantasy role-playing battle game, has grossed more than $30 million per month in the first half of the year outside China, while PUBG MOBILE grossed over $20 million in July outside China. 
Users of its popular WeChat app grew incrementally to 1.06 billion.
Tencent said payment and related financial services and its cloud services helped its ""others"" business category record an 81 percent revenue increase to 17.5 billion yuan. 
A Chinese central bank initiative that is expected to raise the centralized deposit ratio requirement for payment service providers to 100 percent in the near future - thus eroding their interest income - continues to adversely affects Tencent's payment business revenue and gross margins, it said.
""We are currently approximately mid-way through this transition, and are seeking to mitigate the impact through various monetization initiatives elsewhere in our payment and related financial services,"" it said. 
Tencent's net other gains decreased by 51 percent in the quarter to 2.5 billion yuan, mainly due to a decline in gains in investment disposals.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) has signed a deal to invest $400 million in Hong Kong-listed YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical Co. (HK:1558) via convertible bonds, HEC said Wednesday.
The H share convertible bonds will bear an interest rate of 3 percent per annum if issued, at an initial conversion price of HK$38 per share, HEC Pharma said in a stock filing on Tuesday night. 
The drugmaker, based in Yichang in central China's Hubei province, is planning to use the funds to acquire drugs and other pharmaceutical products, it said.
Blackstone, as a long-term strategic investor, will also improve HEC Pharma's strategy, operations management and international cooperation, it added.
Shares in HEC Pharma tumbled 7.4 percent to HK$33.60, hitting their lowest since April 18. 
Blackstone's investment comes as Chinese drugmakers are faced with tighter regulatory scrutiny and rebuilding public trust after fresh scandals over faulty vaccines sparked anger on social media in the country last month.
Fitch Ratings said in a report on July 31 such scandals highlighted the risks facing China's pharmaceutical companies, which focus primarily on the bulk production of a small number of products, making them vulnerable to safety incidents.
Seventeen-year-old HEC Pharma develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products used to treat endocrine and metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases, and in the anti-viral field. 
HEC Pharma has recently issued a positive profit alert for its interim results for the first half, expecting that it will record an at least 110 percent increase in profit attributable to equity shareholders compared with the same period last year.

Blackstone raised about $9.4 billion in June for two new funds - $7.1 billion in the largest-ever fund dedicated to real estate investments in Asia, and its first private equity fund for the region.

The cost of hedging against declines in an exchange-traded fund tracking the nation’s stocks has jumped to the highest level since late April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

463,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Nasty Earnings Surprises Dog China’s Tech Darlings,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just a few months ago, optimism was order of the day among Chinese technology investors.
Beijing was going to welcome home U.S.-traded Chinese tech stars by allowing them to dual-list on mainland exchanges, while Hong Kong opened its arms to the hottest unicorns by removing requirements that companies have a track record of profits before going to initial public offerings.
How things have changed. Even before a Bloomberg News report Wednesday of a government shake-up of game licenses sent tech stocks sliding, China’s tech companies have been throwing out nasty curve-balls. That suggests it’s worth asking whether the country’s tech entrepreneurs are as good at running their businesses as they like to boast.
There are many examples. Smartphone lens maker Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd. lost over $4 billion of its market cap on Tuesday after first-half earnings fell more than 20 percent short of analyst estimates. Sentiment was dented by a small decline in camera module profit margin, an issue that’s somewhat beyond management’s control – but a foreign exchange loss that essentially wiped out any profit increase from a year earlier was far less forgivable. 
The 201 million yuan ($29 million) forex loss, according to Sunny Optical, was “mainly caused by” charges against a $600 million U.S. dollar bond it issued in late January. The tech bull market was in full swing at the time and Sunny issued the bonds cheap, even though it didn’t really need the money.
China Literature Ltd. is another head-scratcher. The e-books platform, spun off from Tencent Holdings Ltd. last November, sank below its IPO price Wednesday after it agreed to buy New Classics Media, a TV series and film producer, for up to 15.5 billion yuan. Diluting shareholders with such a large stock-based acquisition so soon after an IPO isn’t a great way of convincing them that you’re on their side.
One also wonders if China Literature could have got New Classics for less. In March, Beijing Enlight Media Co. sold its 27.6 percent stake in the producer to Tencent at a valuation of about 12 billion yuan. Five months on, China Literature is paying 29 percent more, even though New Classics’ long-time shareholders have no viable exit routes. (Because of their volatile earnings, film companies have a hard time going public in China, while venture capital has been drying up as China’s deleveraging campaign bites.)
Then there’s discount e-commerce site Vipshop Holdings Ltd., whose shares are down 36 percent this year. An investor darling in 2015, Vipshop has since suffered from being left off Tencent’s WeChat social media platform, where other e-commerce players have been busy picking up new shoppers. In the June quarter, revenue grew only 18.4 percent from a year ago, toward the low end of management’s forecast. The only upside to the shares (according to CICC Research, which has a polite “hold” rating) is “privatization”.
The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF, which tracks U.S. and Hong Kong-listed stocks, has already lost almost 18 percent from its late July high and fallen to a 13-month low – but don’t be surprised if China’s tech names suffer yet more pain as the trade war with the U.S. escalates and the yuan slides further.
According to the latest fund manager survey by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Inc.’s Merrill Lynch unit, tech stocks such as Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., and Tencent and their U.S. counterparts remain the most crowded trades for the seventh straight month, suggesting there’s a way to go before we hit bottom.
China’s tech entrepreneurs like to talk big. Xiaomi Corp.’s founder Lei Jun promised investors who bought into the handset-maker’s IPO that their returns would double. Baidu’s Robin Li said he would defeat Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) again if the Internet giant returns to China. JD.com Inc.’s Richard Liu plans to take on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). in Europe.
Such grand ambitions are all very well. Without successful implementation, though, they don’t count for much.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",PwC failed to flag BHS risks ahead of retailer's collapse: regulator,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - PwC should have flagged significant doubts over the future of BHS in an audit that was completed just days before the loss-making UK retailer was sold for a token one pound in 2015, ahead of its collapse a year later, a regulator said on Wednesday.
BHS had 163 stores and employed 11,000 people when it collapsed in 2016, triggering a political firestorm.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) watchdog fined PwC in June a record 6.5 million pounds ($8.3 million), and former partner Stephen Denison 325,000 pounds. Denison was also banned from auditing for 15 years.
After pressure from lawmakers, the FRC published documents on Wednesday detailing the eight allegations of misconduct that prompted the penalties.
PwC said on Wednesday it was sorry its work fell well below the professional standards expected. ""This is unacceptable and we agreed the settlement recognizing that it is important to learn the necessary lessons,"" it said in a statement.
PwC is one of the world's top four auditors, along with KPMG, Deloitte and EY, which check the books of most blue-chip companies across the globe.
They are coming under intense scrutiny in Britain over how they failed to spot company collapses and for juggling audits and more lucrative non-audit work for the same clients.
Lawmakers have said they may formally request higher fines once the FRC published the details of its probe into PwC. They called the FRC ""toothless"" over its handling of the BHS audit, and the watchdog's powers are being independently reviewed.
The documents are likely to spark fresh calls for the audit and non-audit operations of the big four audit firms to be split up.
At the core of an audit, accountants are required to say if they think a company is a ""going concern"", meaning it can stay in business for the foreseeable future. The FRC looked at the audit of Taveta Group, which includes BHS, for the year ending Aug. 30, 2014. 
""There were several events or conditions that should have appeared to the respondents (PwC and Denison) to cast significant doubt over BHS’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore to require further investigation,"" the FRC said.
BHS had significant net liabilities, had had to make provision for loss-making stores, and had very significant deficits in its defined-benefit pension schemes.
In a letter dated just before Denison signed off on the accounts, Taveta qualified its support for BHS, saying it would continue as long as it was part of the group.
Taveta had also submitted a draft application to restructure its pension schemes, an indicator of potential insolvency, though this was ""paused"" in September 2014.
""The respondents gave no consideration to how these matters may have impacted BHS' ability to continue as a going concern,"" the FRC said.
""They failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate. Based on the audit evidence obtained, they should have concluded that a material uncertainty existed about BHS Group and BHS’s ability to continue as going concerns.""
The financial statements were misleading as they said a going concern assumption was appropriate because Taveta had given an unqualified undertaking to support BHS, the FRC said.
TWO HOURS
Billionaire retailer Philip Green, who had no comment on Wednesday, sold BHS to a serial bankrupt for a pound.
PwC and Denison became aware of the likely sale of BHS during the audit, and completion of the accounts was brought forward to accommodate it, the FRC said.
Denison signed off on the accounts on March 9, 2015, but backdated them to March 6. He only recorded two hours on the audit, despite being the lead partner, leaving the bulk of the work to juniors, one of which had just a year's post-qualification experience, the FRC said.
The lack of supervision by Denison was striking given that he recorded 31 hours on non-audit services for the same clients in this period, the watchdog said.
PwC said on Wednesday it had taken steps to bolster supervision of audits and had agreed with the FRC to extend these further for an additional period.
""Whilst the failings did not contribute to the collapse of BHS over one year later, they were serious and this is reflected in the Financial Reporting Council settlement,"" PwC said.
Accounting firms are required to ensure there is no conflict of interest when conducting audit and non-audit work for the same customer.
But the FRC said PwC and Denison failed to guard against the ""self-interest threat"" created by the substantial fees they generated in providing non-audit services to the Taveta Group.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Express Scripts staking out million-dollar gene therapies,"By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) built a multi-billion enterprise pressuring drug companies to lower their prices for U.S. patients. Now it is quietly building a side business: getting paid to help drug companies dispense a new generation of high-priced drugs.
Express Scripts is in talks with biotechnology companies Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc (O:BMRN),  Spark Therapeutics Inc  (O:ONCE) and Bluebird Bio Inc (O:BLUE) to have its specialty pharmaceutical business exclusively distribute their new hemophilia therapies when they are expected to become available in 2019 and 2020, Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller told Reuters in an interview. 
Biomarin, Spark and Bluebird confirmed to Reuters that they were speaking to a payers - a group generally defined as pharmacy benefit managers, health plans and government agencies 
- about pricing models for future therapies. Analysts project those drugs could top $1 million to $1.5 million in price.
Rather than rail against the drugs’ expected high prices, Miller echoes the familiar drug company argument that the potentially curative therapies will likely be worth the high cost if they supplant the hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual medical costs to treat ailments such as hemophilia, which affects about 20,000 people in the United States alone.
“Even if they charge $1 million, that's a great deal,"" Miller said. “So there are going to be some gene therapies where it is very clear that everyone who has that disease should get it.” 
By working closely with biotech companies, Miller says it can help their expensive therapies succeed commercially. To manage any potential conflicts of interest, he said Express Scripts separates its benefits management and specialty pharmacy businesses. 
The move into hemophilia builds on exclusive rights Express Scripts already has to distribute Spark's Luxturna - an $850,000 treatment for a rare genetic disorder that, left untreated, causes children to go blind. It has a similar deal with Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) on Spinraza, he told Reuters. The drug costs $750,000 the first year and treats the rare condition spinal muscular atrophy that often kills babies within months of their birth. Spark and Biogen confirmed the agreements. 
The company also helps manage one of the most expensive gene-based cancer treatments on the market: the $475,000  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) gene-based cancer therapy Kymriah - a personalized treatment that requires a long hospital stay. Novartis confirmed the arrangement to Reuters. 
Those deals put Express Scripts in a vastly different role than its traditional business managing prescription drug claims for the employees of its corporate and government clients, a business  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) found so valuable that it agreed in March to acquire Express Scripts for $52 billion.
Patients usually know Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) as the name on the insurance card they present at the pharmacy counter when picking up a prescription. That card activates discounts the benefits managers have negotiated with drug companies to lower prices, usually through rebates. PBMs make money by taking a cut of the rebates, and the rest goes to their clients.
Express Scripts, which negotiates the prescription payments for 80 million people in the United States, competes with UnitedHealth Group Inc’s (N:UNH) Optum and CVS Health Corp (N:CVS). 
These companies are usually among the most vocal critics of the pharmaceutical industry’s pricing practices, publicly calling out companies and specific products for their high cost.
But the pharmacy benefits businesses themselves are facing growing criticism from U.S. regulators, lawmakers, drugmakers, and President Trump, who say they act as unnecessary middlemen and end up helping drive up prices for payers.
Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn mounted a proxy campaign to stop the deal on expectations the Trump Administration would end the rebates it relies on for profits. But he abandoned his efforts after two shareholder advisory groups came out in favor of the deal.
GROWTH vs CONFLICTS 
As the PBM fight plays out publicly, Express Scripts has been expanding its low-profile specialty pharmacy business - which dispenses drugs that usually aren’t sold through drugstores because they require special handling. By using its own pharmacy instead of outsiders, Express Scripts is able to hold onto more of the profits along the drug distribution chain.
Specialty pharmacy is one of Express Script's fastest growing businesses and accounts for about a third of its sales and profits, ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken said. The company earned $4.1 billion last year on total revenue of more than $100 billion - it does not break out financial information for specialty pharmacy.
Many of the newest, most advanced medicines - including gene-based therapies and personalized cancer treatments - will be dispensed through specialty pharmacies, and Express Scripts is pitching biotech companies for exclusive arrangements.
By working as both the manufacturer’s partner who gets paid for each sale, and the pharmacy benefit manager responsible for negotiating the best price for its traditional corporate and government clients, Express Scripts is open to questions about being conflicted, industry sources and experts say.
""One could view this role as being a wonderfully catalytic: that they can help balance the views and interests of all the parties by being in this middle facilitating role. Or one could view that they have created a situation where internally they have multiple conflicts of interest, and can they manage them properly?"" said Mark Trusheim, strategic director of a group of international payers and providers formed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study gene therapy pricing models.
Express Scripts says it saves money for payers on Luxturna by cutting out the hospital pharmacy mark up, which is 6 percent for the government Medicare program and more for commercial business – or at least $60,000 on a $1 million drug.
Miller said the company has a firewall between its specialty pharmacy business, which serves the drugmakers, and its businesses negotiating on behalf of his clients, the payers. 
“Our PBM treats our specialty pharmacy as they treat any other pharmacy in our pharmacy network,"" he said. ""So they are not privy to their acquisition prices or anything else, and the specialty pharmacy is not privy to the contracts that the PBM has with their payer clients or anything else.” 
Beyond potential conflict concerns, there is risk in whether the gene therapies will ever make it to the public. 

Spark on Aug. 7 said two patients in a small trial had an adverse immune response to an experimental hemophilia gene therapy and its shares lost more than a quarter of their value. And last month, U.S. regulators put Biogen’s gene therapy program for spinal muscular atrophy on hold, but no details were disclosed.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Flight rights group takes Ryanair to court over strike compensation,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German passenger rights company Flightright is taking Ryanair (I:RYA) to court over whether it should pay financial compensation to passengers affected by strikes at Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
Ryanair had to cancel around 1 in 6 flights on Friday due to a walk-out by pilots in five European countries, disrupting an estimated 55,000 travelers. 
The worst affected country was Germany, where 250 flights were canceled, affecting around 42,000 passengers. 
EU rules state that passengers can claim monetary compensation of up to 400 euros for flights within the region for canceled or delayed flights, unless the reason is extraordinary circumstances, such as bad weather. 
Strikes have generally fallen under extraordinary circumstances although a ruling by the European Court of Justice in April said that a wildcat strike by staff at German airline TUIfly following a restructuring could not be classed as extraordinary circumstances.
Flightright said it believes Ryanair is therefore obliged to pay monetary compensation to customers and so has filed a complaint with a court in Frankfurt in a bid to clarify the rules around strikes. 
A spokeswoman for the court said she was aware of the Flightright statement, but that she had not yet seen the complaint. 
Ryanair said it fully complies with the European legislation on the matter, known as EU261. 
""Under EU261 legislation, no compensation is payable when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline's control. If this was within our control, there would be no cancellations,"" a spokesman said.
Passenger rights groups such as Flightright help passengers to claim compensation from airlines under EU261 rules but in exchange for a share of the compensation received. 
Many European airlines, including Ryanair, therefore urge passengers to file claims with them directly instead.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 05:49AM ET</span>",Saudi fund may only play minor part in Musk's $72 billion Tesla plan: bankers,"By Andrew Torchia
RIYADH (Reuters) - Elon Musk told investors this week that ""obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed"" to finance taking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private. 
The fund is estimated to have over $250 billion in assets. But it is not that simple. 
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has many claims on its resources, both financial and political. 
More than half of its assets are tied up in large Saudi companies whose stocks could be difficult to sell en masse. 
The PIF has made substantial commitments to other technology companies or investments, including a $45 billion agreement to invest in a giant tech fund led by Japan's Softbank. 
Then there's $3.5 billion invested in U.S. ride-sharing firm Uber, the $1 billion pumped into Virgin Group's space ventures, and another $20 billion tentatively committed to an infrastructure investment fund planned with Blackstone (NYSE:BX).
There is also pressure to spend money at home, where a slumping economy has driven unemployment among Saudi citizens to record highs.
""They could handle part of taking Tesla private, but not necessarily a large part of it and certainly not all of it,"" a banker at a major Gulf firm operating in Saudi Arabia said.
Musk has not put a formal buyout proposal to Tesla's board, the company said on Tuesday.
The Tesla CEO has said he does not believe he would need to raise the full $72 billion value placed on Tesla by his $420-a-share bid because he expects many existing shareholders – including himself with 20 percent of the company – to roll their shares into a private Tesla. 
The Saudi PIF already holds about a 5 percent stake in Tesla. 
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who heads the PIF, is driving to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil exports by developing new industries. Participation in a Tesla deal could bring Saudi Arabia closer to developing a domestic car industry or playing a role in Musk's electric battery manufacturing or space activities.
What Prince Salman, PIF managing director Yasir al-Rumayyan and other officials of the fund decide will be crucial to Musk's take-private effort. 
Musk said on Monday that al-Rumayyan had voiced support for Tesla going private and that talks with the PIF, along with other investors, were continuing. 
Spokesmen for the fund, as well as Saudi government officials, have so far declined any comment on Musk's statements. But bankers familiar with the secretive PIF said on Tuesday they had seen no sign yet of it preparing to commit to a Tesla deal.
ILLIQUID ASSETS
Those bankers added that although the fund is huge, many of its assets are not liquid and readily available cash is limited.
The PIF said last October that it had some $230 billion of assets under management, and analysts think this figure has now probably swelled to more than $250 billion, largely as a result of a rise in the Saudi stock market.
But stock exchange data shows $140 billion or more of the PIF's assets are in big Saudi companies such as Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) and National Commercial Bank. 
These could not be monetized quickly without driving down prices in the local stock market, while selling many of them would conflict with another of the PIF's declared roles, to helps Saudi firms ""grow into regional and global leaders"".
Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia's illiquid market, selling real estate to raise money does not look like a near-term option.
""The PIF is not nearly as liquid as people might like to think,"" an international banker who deals with the fund said.
However, the PIF may get two infusions of cash in the coming months and is seeking to raise between $6 billion and $8 billion in its first commercial loan, sources have told Reuters, adding that there was no mention of any acquisition linked to the debt.
And national oil giant Saudi Aramco said last month it was working on a possible purchase of a strategic stake in SABIC from the PIF. A complete purchase of the PIF's 70 percent holding would give the fund about $70 billion.
Bankers expect the Aramco purchase to take at least several months to negotiate, however, and the PIF has already committed itself to large projects planned to stimulate the Saudi economy.
These include a $500 billion business zone in the northwest of the country, multi-billion dollar real estate developments in Mecca and Medina, and a huge entertainment area outside Riyadh.

""If it spends tens of billions of dollars overseas and the domestic economy is still slumping, it won't look good to some Saudis,"" the Gulf banker said.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>","Stocks, emerging currencies, lick wounds as lira bounces for second day","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Action from Turkey's central bank pushed the lira higher for a second day on Wednesday, helping European stocks and emerging currencies consolidate recent losses though the dollar ensconced at 13-month highs kept up the pressure on world markets.
The lira bounced another 5 percent, sharply extending Tuesday's gains as authorities further tightened the screws on foreigners aiming to short the currency. The lira is now around 6 per dollar, off record lows beyond 7.24 .
However, it started 2018 at 3.75 and the rebound follows a 36 percent drop over the past month. Fear of full-blown crisis and debt defaults in the country of 80 million people is far from over as the central bank's failure to tackle galloping inflation and Ankara's diplomatic tiff with Washington keep investors wary.
""It has calmed down a bit, the reason is that the Turkish lira is appreciating and that is causing people to re-focus on country-specific fundamentals so the contagion effect naturally is less,"" said Koon Chow a strategist at fund manager UBP. 
He said however there had been little fundamental change to celebrate and added: ""It's only a temporary thing for Turkish markets, I'm not sure (volatility) is over.""
The Turkish worries have in recent days driven a capital exodus from across emerging markets, sending currencies from the Argentine peso to the Indian rupee to record lows, while emerging equities (MSCIEF) have tumbled almost 20 percent from January highs.
There are also concerns about China's slowing economy -- reinforced by this week's data on investment and industrial output -- and the yuan's weakening to 15-month lows against the dollar is also pressuring other Asian markets.
Indonesia, acting after the rupiah fell to three-year lows, raised interest rates for the fourth time since May
European shares opened flat, though liquidity was severely thinned by a holiday in many countries (STOXX).
Earlier, Asian shares excluding Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slid more than 1 percent to one-year lows while MSCI's all-country equity benchmark was a quarter percent lower (MIWD00000PUS). But it stayed off one-month lows reached on Monday.
Chinese shares (HSI) (SSEC) lost more than 1 percent, pressured by signs the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum amid a trade conflict with Washington. Japanese shares too dropped one percent (N225).
U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped hefty tariffs on a swathe of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing.
Global trade tensions show little sign of easing, with Beijing now lodging a complaint to the World Trade Organisation to help determine the legality of U.S. tariff and subsidy policies. 
Turkey too has raised tariffs on some U.S. products ""in response to the U.S. administration's deliberate attacks on our economy"", Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has called a boycott on U.S. electronic goods. 
Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM brokerage said the escalation of tensions between the United States and Turkey reminded investors ""it is not just the United States and China that stand at the heart of the global trade war concerns.""
Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday, continuing to draw support from forecast-beating company earnings but New York stocks appear set for a weaker opening, futures show <.ESC1>.
SAFETY
The concerns have driven investors to embrace assets such as German and U.S. government bonds, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, which are considered safer. German and U.S. 10-year yields are down more 10 bps this month (DE10YT=RR) (US10YT=RR).
The other beneficiary has been the dollar. Already resurgent thanks to the high yield it offers, it has surged to 13-month peaks against a basket of currencies (DXY).
""In light of all the turmoil we've seen out of Turkey and the subsequent contagion into other emerging markets, the dollar is pretty much establishing itself as the safe-haven currency,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
""If you are going to park your money somewhere to stay away from the turmoil, the dollar is going to be the currency of choice,"" 
The strong dollar's victims are of course emerging currencies -- many of them remain under pressure despite the lira's recent bounce. But the greenback's rise has also pummelled euro and sterling.
The former has been hit also by jitters around euro zone banks' exposure to Turkey (EUR=EBS). The single currency slipped another 0.2 percent to a new 13-month low versus the dollar and it also extended losses against the Swiss franc (EURCHF=)
Sterling meanwhile tumbled under $1.27 for the first time since June 2017, having lost ground for 11 days in a row, its longest losing streak since 2008 . The currency is being undermined by confusion around what trade deal it will negotiate with the European Union ahead of Britain's planned exit next year from the bloc.
However, gold , the other traditional safe haven, sank to 18-month lows, also hurt by dollar strength.
""The dollar will continue to be the safe-haven asset of preference. As a consequence, gold prices are really going to struggle,"" said Daniel Hynes, an analyst at ANZ Bank.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 04:41AM ET</span>",Long-acting injection a shot in the arm for GSK's HIV business,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - A long-acting injection developed by GlaxoSmithKline and given once a month has proved as effective as standard daily pills for controlling the AIDS virus, lifting prospects for the British drugmaker's key HIV business.
GSK's majority-owned ViiV Healthcare unit said on Wednesday the experimental two-drug injection of cabotegravir and rilpivirine maintained similar rates of viral suppression compared with a standard three-drug oral regimen, after 48 weeks of a clinical trial.
The result from the big Phase III study is a boost for GSK's goal of developing dual therapies that are easier to tolerate than conventional triple ones, and shares in GSK rose more than 1 percent. It follows recent positive data from combining two oral drugs.
GSK hopes its new approach will allow it to compete more effectively against Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), the U.S. drugmaker that dominates the $26 billion-a-year HIV market. 
Gilead currently has a market share of around 52 percent against GSK's 22 percent, but Deborah Waterhouse, who heads the British drugmaker's HIV unit, says she hopes to overtake her U.S. rival by the mid-2020s.
That is a bold ambition, since many analysts have been expecting GSK to lose market share to Gilead's new triple drug Biktarvy, rather than see it gain ground.
Liberum analyst Roger Franklin, who rates GSK a 'buy', believes the company's dual-drug strategy has been under-appreciated by the market.
""Whilst duals will likely be a slow burn as resistance data is collected and the regimen gains credence among physicians, the prospects are much improved now versus a year ago,"" he said. 
GSK is betting that a shift to using two drugs rather than three will boost its sales by offering patients a therapy with greater convenience and fewer toxic side effects. In certain cases, depending on the drugs used, two-drug regimens will also be significantly cheaper.
Still, some doctors worry that using just two drugs to keep the AIDS virus at bay might risk drug resistance because HIV will only have to evade two drugs rather than three. That is certainly the view at Gilead, which is sticking with three.
In the case of the cabotegravir and rilpivirine monthly injection, GSK said drug resistance results in the latest study were consistent with data from earlier smaller trials. It did not go into further details but said full results would be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.
ViiV Chief Scientific and Medical Officer John Pottage argued the novel injection offered an alternative long-term treatment for patients.
""If approved, this regimen would give people living with HIV one month between each dose of antiretroviral therapy, changing HIV treatment from 365 dosing days per year, to just 12,"" he said.

Results from a second trial of cabotegravir and rilpivirine are expected later this year. Rilpivirine was developed by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and GSK is working with the U.S. drugmaker on the new injection regimen.

A review of retail banking in August 2016 by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), ordered lenders to publish bi-annual measurements of how customers rate their services.
An independent survey of banks' customers conducted by GfK UK asked how willing they were to recommend their services to friends and family.
In the first survey published on Wednesday, 85 percent of customers at First Direct, HSBC's telephone banking unit, said they would recommend their lender in terms of overall service quality.
Metro Bank and Nationwide Building Society came second and third with 83 percent and 73 percent, respectively.

RBS was at the bottom of the list in joint 15th place with Clydesdale Bank. Just 49 percent of their customers would recommend the two lenders.
""For the first time, people will now be able to easily compare banks on the quality of the service they provide, and so judge if they're getting the most for their money or could do better elsewhere,"" said Adam Land, senior director at the CMA.
Britain and its regulators are trying to boost competition in banking by making it easier to switch accounts and encouraging new ""challenger"" banks to enter the market, but so far the Big Four continue to dominate. 
""Giving consumers more information about the service personal current account providers offer will help encourage customers to shop around and find the best account to suit their needs,"" said Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance, a banking industry body.
Barclays came joint fifth with Santander (MC:SAN) UK, with 64 percent of its customers recommending the bank. Lloyds was joint ninth with Natwest, an RBS unit, and TSB.
HSBC was joint 13th at 55 percent with the Co-operative bank.
For business banking surveyed by BDRC, Sweden's Handelsbanken came top, followed by Metro Bank and Santander.
The results must be displayed prominently in branches, and for customers to see when they bank online or on smartphones. 
The survey is one of several measures imposed by the CMA to improve available information. Customers were also asked about service quality in online and mobile banking, branches, and overdraft services.
But lawmakers have called such measures a ""dereliction of duty"", saying they rely too much on advances in technology and transparency to boost competition.
They have called for radical measures to prise open the sector, such as ending free in credit banking to stop hefty overdraft fees from subsidizing wealthier customers who can stay in the black.
The Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish initial findings from its own review of retail banking business models later this year.
Banks will have to publish figures on how long it takes to open current accounts and replace debit cards from February next year.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>","Australia's CBA tells inquiry of more fees charged to the dead, weak controls","By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) charged some estates of dead people for superannuation advice and had inadequate compliance controls in its management of retirement funds, the country's inquiry into financial sector misconduct heard.
Among Australia's ""Big Four"" banks, CBA has taken the biggest reputational hit as the inquiry airs allegations of deception of regulators within the industry, as well as of bonuses for sales of inappropriate products and the charging of fees for no service.
Linda Elkins, executive general manager of CBA's funds management unit Colonial First State, told the Royal Commission its superannuation trustee discovered in 2015 that some estates of dead people were being charged fees but the firm had failed to respond adequately. 
""Was a control ever put in place for the fees to stop after three months (after death)?"" asked Michael Hodge, a barrister assisting the inquiry, referring to the bank's self-imposed target to manage the problem.
""No. There - there are - there was a - we can see that there was -that this was - you know there was an attempt if you like or some business rules around this but I don't believe they were effective,"" Elkins said.
The revelation comes after CBA admitted in earlier Royal Commission hearings this year that it had wrongfully withdrawn fees from dead people’s accounts and mistakenly double charged interest to thousands of business customers
Shares in CBA, which also went ex-dividend on Wednesday, fell 2.5 percent. 
Elkins also told the inquiry the bank had rejected advice from the banking and superannuation regulator in 2014 to promptly transfer 60,000 members to low cost retirement funds due to operational risks. 
A day earlier, the inquiry heard the bank failed to transfer 15,000 of those pension customers in breach of a law requiring it to do so.
This month, CBA posted its first profit fall in almost a decade due to mounting regulatory costs, including provisions to cover costs related to the year-long inquiry and penalties for breaches of anti-money laundering rules.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) in May commissioned an inquiry into CBA's governance and culture.

Royal Commission is due to issue an interim report next month and a final report in February. The government will then decide which recommendations to take.

The game was being taken down from Tencent’s download service just days after its launch on Aug. 8 as regulators received a large number of complaints about the game that was sold over 8 million copies worldwide, Tencent said in statement, although it did not provide details of what the complaints entailed.
The company had pre-sold over a million copies at around $43 a unit, Reuters added. WeGame, the platform where the game was launched, said it would refund users “without conditions.”
Citing source close to Wegame, the Financial Times reported that the removal was not due to complaints from user, but because of “bureaucratic infighting”.

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed on Tuesday to boycott iPhones. Erdogan said the nation would stop buying iPhone and other American electronics, condemning the ""explicit economic attack"" against his country.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira rebounded from a record low touched earlier this week after Turkey's Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country would protect the currency, and that he believed it would strengthen.
The ""rebound in the lira gave European banks and other emerging markets some respite. However, it is fair to say that the saga is not over,"" David Plank, head of Australian economics at ANZ, said in a note.
""The root cause of Turkey's problems — a very large external deficit denominated in foreign currency – remains unaddressed by authorities ... Investors will remain wary of possible contagion to the European banking system and will be keeping an eye on other countries with high levels of foreign-currency debt,"" he added.
The Turkish lira lost about 25% of its value since last week after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports.

487,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 09:50PM ET</span>",Battered Tencent Looks for Bottom After $150 Billion Wipeout,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Tencent Holdings Ltd., once the hottest stock in Asia, are trying to figure out where the bottom is.
The Chinese internet giant, best known for its popular games and ubiquitous messaging services, has shed more than $150 billion in market value since a January peak, the biggest wipeout of shareholder wealth worldwide. Some $15 billion evaporated on Tuesday after regulators told the Shenzhen-based company to remove Monster Hunter: World from its PC downloads service just days after the action title’s debut.
The hit comes as game revenue growth slows and trade tensions between the U.S. and China punish wide swaths of the market. But what has investors most concerned is the regulatory setbacks in a country where the government can make -- or break -- fortunes. Besides Monster Hunter, the company hasn’t won approvals to make money from the marquee mobile game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and to introduce the desktop version in China. Investors will be looking for answers when the company reports earnings Wednesday.
“There’s a lot of negativity priced in already,"" Mark Po, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy International Financial Holdings said. ""The only key thing that investors will be looking at is the growth of online games.""
Shares slid another 2.3 percent Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reduced its earnings forecast and cut its price target for Tencent by 7 percent Wednesday, citing slowing gaming growth among other factors.
At least 11 analysts have shaved their targets on the social media giant since June. Revenue is projected to climb 37 percent while operating profit rises 18 percent, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., the Chinese e-commerce giant that reports earnings next week, has held up somewhat better amid the market tumult. Its margins are sliding as it shells out billions to buy and build a nationwide retail and delivery network, but that’s expected to drive revenue growth to its fastest in more than four years. Both internet giants remain vulnerable to trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.
“The trade war between China and the U.S. also affects the market sentiment and weighs on investors’ position in China internet,” said Gregory Zhao, an analyst for  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a research report he co-wrote. “We still see some effects from macro concerns and government regulation.”
Tencent’s projected 37 percent growth in revenue would be its slowest since 2015. Chief among analysts’ concerns is the hold-up in launching PUBG on desktops and still-absent approval to start earning off Chinese players of the mobile version -- the country’s second most popular game in June by time spent. The litany of headaches coincides with Beijing’s harshest internet content crackdown in history.
All that’s hobbling its chief source of income.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts led by Han Joon Kim now forecast a 6 percent drop in mobile gaming revenue in the second quarter from the first, rather than a rise of the same magnitude.
“Tencent’s share price may continue to decline without new drivers as the growth of the mobile gaming industry is expected to slow down,” said Rick Su, a Taipei-based fund manager at Capital Investment Trust Corp. He trimmed his holding to 2.7 percent of his portfolio from 5.2 percent in February, according to Bloomberg data. “If that’s the case, it can’t sustain the high valuations of a growth stock.”
Still, the gaming giant could emerge from the doldrums in the third quarter if it finally gets the green light to unveil PC versions of PUBG and Fortnite, the Battle Royale-meets-Minecraft game that’s taken the world by storm. “We expect online games sales growth to pick up in the second half,” CCB International analyst Ronnie Ho wrote.
Alibaba, in contrast, is expected to post its fastest growth in revenue since December 2013, a 61 percent jump. Heavy investments into traditional retail, video content and new services such as food delivery helped bolster growth. Advertising and commission revenue at the e-commerce giant might have grown 31 percent, according to Barclays’ Zhao.
Those expenditures are eating into margins. In the span of two years, Alibaba has acquired control of its logistics network, video streaming business Youku and now food delivery services Ele.me. It’s pouring money into an array of groceries and department stores such as Hema. Margins on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for Alibaba’s core e-commerce business could’ve dived 17 percentage points from last year to 46 percent, according to Shi Jialong, an analyst with Nomura.
That spending however may be vital for the longer term. “Investment is essential for Alibaba to tap into a much bigger addressable market beyond its current 13 percent China retail market share,” Karen Chan, an analyst with Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd., said in a report.
As for Tencent, investors are looking for any signs of a turnaround. Asked for a prediction on how shares would react after earnings, China Galaxy’s Po struck a pessimistic note.
“It depends on how bad the news is,” he said.

The family office of billionaire George Soros also bought stakes in AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and T-Mobile US Inc and divested stakes in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), Nvidia Corp,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Paypal Holdings Inc.
Soros Fund Management also dramatically boosted its shares in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) - the world's largest asset management firm, overseeing $6 trillion - by nearly 60 percent to 12,983 total shares in the second quarter. 
Other notable adjustments included paring stakes in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, but raising its shares of Pandora Media Inc and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM).
Soros Fund Management took share stakes in Facebook of 159,200 class A shares during the second quarter and 54,500 shares in Apple.
A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their holdings in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly-traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion. 
Einhorn's Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management unloaded 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent. 
Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, only trimmed small amounts in the second quarter. 
Soros also rejigged his energy holdings, raising stakes in  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) and  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI), while dissolving his stake in the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF and cutting exposure to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB).
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying. 
But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.

The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's equities holdings.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 09:15PM ET</span>","Musk bid for Tesla: no formal offer, no firm deals with advisers","By Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's board named a special committee of three directors on Tuesday to decide what to do about Chief Executive Elon Musk's potential offer to take the electric carmaker private, although Musk has yet to make a formal offer and is still negotiating to hire advisers needed to do a deal.
The board announced the move in Tesla's first filing with regulators since Musk tweeted a week ago that he was considering taking the company private and had already secured funding for a $420-per-share offer, valuing Tesla at $72 billion. 
Since that unorthodox announcement on Aug. 7, which has triggered investor lawsuits and an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk and Tesla have scrambled to bring order to the process of negotiating a deal. 
Musk tweeted on Monday he was working with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman Sachs was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Silver Lake was also not signed up officially as a financial adviser, as it is helping Musk explore how to take Tesla private with no compensation, Reuters reported on Monday. 
Goldman Sachs and Silver lake declined to comment.
Musk's effort to associate his potential bid with some of Wall Street’s most venerable institutions, even at the risk of misrepresenting their involvement, comes as pressure has been building on him to justify his pronouncement last week that funding for a deal had been “secured.” 
Musk said on Monday he had held talks with a Saudi sovereign fund on a buyout that would take Tesla off the Nasdaq exchange - an extraordinary move for what is now the United States' most valuable automaker. Tesla has a market value of $60 billion, bigger than Detroit rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) or Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which produce far more cars.
Tesla shares closed down 2.5 percent at $347.64 on Tuesday. They are still above $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private, which pushed the shares up 11 percent to an 11-month high. 
NO FORMAL PROPOSAL 
Tesla said in its statement on Tuesday the special committee had the authority to take any action on behalf of the board to evaluate and negotiate a potential transaction and alternatives to any transaction proposed by Musk. 
That means three members of Tesla's board will now weigh whether it is advisable - or even feasible - to pursue what could be the biggest-ever go-private deal, and they are doing so before receiving a formal proposal from the CEO. 
Musk has yet to persuade Wall Street analysts and investors that he can find the billions needed to complete the deal, or even such a deal is a good idea for a loss-making company. 
""Despite Elon Musk’s frustration with being a public company, I think there are more advantages to remaining public,"" said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy, citing cheaper access to capital and media exposure due to interest in a public company.
Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, said it would be better for Tesla to remain a private company so investors can benefit from an ""earnings inflection"" if Musk fulfills his promise of making the company profitable later this year. 
THREE-MEMBER PANEL
Tesla said the committee consists only of independent directors: Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm and Linda Johnson Rice.
But corporate governance and shareholder voting advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services said they do not consider Buss an independent director, due to his connections to solar panel installer SolarCity, which Tesla bought two years ago.
Denholm, the first woman on Tesla's board, is chief operations officer of telecom firm Telstra and the former chief financial officer of network gear maker Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR). Rice, the first African-American and second woman to join the board, is CEO of Johnson Publishing Company and Chairman Emeritus of EBONY Media Holdings, the parent of EBONY and Jet brands, according to Tesla's website. 
Tesla's other board members include Musk; his brother Kimbal Musk; Twenty-First Century Fox's CEO James Murdoch; Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners; and Ira Ehrenpreis, founder of venture capital firm DBL Partners.
One director, Steve Jurvetson, is currently on leave of absence.
Tesla's board said on Aug. 8 that Musk had held talks with the directors in the previous week on taking the company private.

Latham and Watkins LLP has been retained by the committee as its legal counsel. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati will be legal counsel for Tesla itself.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) shareholders may again pursue class-action claims that the bank concealed conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis.
U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan said shareholders could sue as a group because Goldman had not shown it more likely than not that its alleged misstatements had no impact on its stock price.
Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. Class actions can allow plaintiffs to seek larger recoveries at lower cost than if they sued individually.
The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and other investors from February 2007 to June 2010 claimed to have lost more than $13 billion because Goldman had in regulatory filings and public comments overstated its ability to manage conflicts.
They said Goldman did this while concealing short positions that the Wall Street bank or hedge fund manager John Paulson had made in four subprime mortgage collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
These CDOs included Abacus 2007 AC-1, the centerpiece of a probe that led to Goldman's $550 million settlement of civil claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
Crotty had certified a class action in September 2015, but the federal appeals court in Manhattan overturned him in January, saying he imposed too high a burden on Goldman.
Tuesday's decision came after Goldman offered new testimony from two expert witnesses, Harvard Business School professor Paul Gompers and New York University law professor Stephen Choi.
But Crotty said a damages model offered by the plaintiffs' expert John Finnerty, a managing director at AlixPartners, ""at the very least, establishes a link between the news of Goldman's conflicts and the subsequent stock declines.""
That, he said, ""is sufficient.""
The plaintiffs ""look forward to heading toward trial,"" Spencer Burkholz, one of their lawyers, said in a statement.

The case is In re Goldman Sachs Group Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03461.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) disclosed Tuesday it will spend $740 million on a project to revamp Michigan Central Station, Detroit’s historic but dilapidated former rail station, as well as other neighborhood sites.
Ford aims to turn the building into a campus of offices for up to 5,000 tech workers and software engineers focused on self-driving vehicles and ancillary technologies and services.
The second largest U.S. automaker based in Dearborn, Michigan, about 10 miles from Detroit, announced the project in June, but had not previously disclosed costs until a community meeting on Tuesday.
The company said Tuesday in a statement it is ""working with federal, state and local economic development groups and officials, seeking at least $250 million in tax or other incentives to support the development of the five Corktown sites Ford has purchased.""
Ford said total investment in the development of the train station and developing 45 acres of vacant land will cost approximately $740 million over the next four years.
The figure includes acquiring the buildings and land as well as rehabilitation costs ""which takes into account the requirements of restoring a historic building such as the train station,"" the company said.
The automaker said the project costs do not require additional capital beyond what it previously committed as part of its overall 10-year campus plan in 2016.
The Detroit train station closed in 1988 and fell into disrepair, becoming a symbol of the decline of the ""Motor City.""
In the first half of the 20th century Detroit prospered and became America’s fourth-largest city, its name synonymous with U.S. manufacturing prowess.
But riots in the 1960s and the oil shocks of the 1970s heralded decades of manufacturing decline. By mid-2017, Detroit’s population had fallen to 673,104, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950.

In 2009 the city council voted to tear the railway station building down, but it survived.

Lockheed's Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Satellites will provide improved missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats than the current system, the Air Force said.
""As we develop these new systems, speed matters,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told the Air Force's internal news service. ""We are focused on providing a missile warning capability survivable in a contested environment by the mid-2020s.""
Last year, North Korea conducted a dozen missile tests, including the launch of a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could hit the U.S. mainland, and tested a purported hydrogen bomb.

The Air Force said the ""undefinitized contract"" allows the government to meet urgent needs by authorizing Lockheed Martin to begin work before reaching a final settlement on contract terms.

BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management trimmed its stake in Automatic Data Processing by selling 3.7 million common shares in the second quarter, a regulatory filing on Tuesday showed.
Ackman said in earlier filings and statements that he sold some ADP stock to manage the size of the position, adding that he planned to ""continue to be a large, long-term and engaged shareholder"" in the company.
At the end of June, Pershing Square owned 24 million shares, including common stock and derivatives, or 5.6 percent of the human resources software company.
An earlier filing showed that Pershing Square previously owned 31.8 million shares, including common stock and derivatives, or 7.2 percent of the company.
Less than a year after Ackman lost a bitter proxy contest at ADP, the company is performing better and boasts a rising stock price that has helped Ackman's $8 billion portfolio swing to gains in 2018. Since Ackman made his investments in 2017, ADP's shares have climbed 35 percent.
Tuesday's so-called 13-F filing showed that Ackman still owns 4.2 million common shares. Such filings are backward looking but widely followed for insight into what fund managers are buying and selling.
Scott Ferguson, a former Pershing Square partner who now runs hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management, said in a filing that his firm sold 74 percent of its ADP common stock to own 500,000 shares on June 30.
Ferguson and Ackman had differing ideas on home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies Inc, however. Ackman bought 7.7 million common shares, making it the only new investment listed for the second quarter. Including derivatives, Ackman has taken a roughly $1 billion stake in Lowe's, other filings showed.

Ferguson, who has owned Lowe's since late 2017, sold out of his entire position of common stock, getting rid of 2.5 million shares.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two major Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shareholders cut their stakes in the electric automaker during the second quarter, before Chief Executive Elon Musk announced he would try to take the company private earlier this month.
T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) funds, once the No. 2 Tesla shareholder after Musk, cut their holdings by nearly a quarter to 11.9 million shares in the three months ended June 30, according to a filing on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The disclosure comes days after Fidelity Investments, another top-10 shareholder, said in an earlier filing it cut its Tesla stake by 21 percent during the quarter.
Musk faces investor lawsuits claiming fraud and a probe by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission after sending a tweet on August 7 that there was ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. No investors have confirmed their involvement.
Tesla's board named a special committee on Tuesday to evaluate any plans to go private but said it had not seen a firm offer.
It was not clear why T. Rowe Price and Fidelity reduced their Tesla holdings or whether they support a move by the company to go private. During the second quarter, investors were focused on the company's efforts to turn out new Model 3 sedans without burning cash at a faster pace.
(GRAPHIC-Two leading Tesla shareholders slash holdings in Q2: https://reut.rs/2Pa1DtN)
In addition to stock, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price retained a type of bond issued by Tesla that can convert to stock under certain conditions, their filings showed. On Tuesday billionaire investor George Soros disclosed his firm also retained a stake in Tesla convertible notes during the quarter.
Representatives for Tesla and Soros did not respond to inquiries from Reuters. Fidelity and T. Rowe Price declined to comment.
CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said there could be many reasons why the funds trimmed their positions. Some also may not be allowed to hold the company's stock if it goes private.
""A lot of these mutual funds, who are the large shareholders, they can't necessarily buy and hold private company's stock,"" he said.
Not all investors cut back on Tesla holdings. Jennison Associates LLC, for instance, increased its holdings by a third to 4.3 million shares, a filing showed. Jennison owner Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Fund managers disclose their holdings quarterly in ""13F"" filings with the SEC. But the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions or their full portfolios.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) said Tuesday it will pay bonuses to executives who worked for more than 15 months on its failed merger with Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI).
The bonuses, which were disclosed in a filing on Tuesday, are for the company's chief financial officer, Chandler Bigelow, as well as its president of broadcast media, Larry Wert, and its general counsel and chief strategy officer Edward Lazarus. The bonuses are equal to 16 percent of target annual bonuses, which had been conditioned on completion of the Sinclair merger, the company said.
According the proxy, the bonuses for the three executives are worth between $102,000 and $160,000. Other executives will get bonuses based on a similar percentage of their targeted annual bonuses.
The bonuses ""are being paid to the executives, like other recipients of unpaid retention bonuses, in recognition of the substantial efforts and time that each of them devoted to the company’s anticipated merger with Sinclair and their contributions to maintain and grow the company’s business,"" the company said.
On Thursday, Tribune terminated its $3.9 billion deal to be acquired by Sinclair after regulators objected to the acquisition that was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Tribune filed the lawsuit against Sinclair, the largest U.S. broadcast station owner, alleging material breach of contract over its failure to win over regulators after the merger was first announced in May 2017. 
Tribune sought about $1 billion of lost premium to Tribune’s stockholders and additional damages in an amount to be proven at trial over what it called Sinclair's ""misconduct,"" according to a copy of the lawsuit filed in Delaware. 
Sinclair said last week it would no longer pursue the Tribune merger and denied Tribune's allegations.
Last week, Tribune Media Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern told investors it ""open to all opportunities"" in terms of industry consolidation or remaining independent. He noted on an investor call there was ""tons of activity out there.""

Kern said he would continue to run the company until Tribune reached a ""permanent state.""

The intensifying spat came as Manigault Newman, a former contestant on Trump's reality show ""The Apprentice,"" publicly released more recordings from her time in his orbit as she promoted her tell-all book, ""Unhinged,"" which describes her year at the White House. She was fired last December.
""When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General (John) Kelly for quickly firing that dog!,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his chief of staff.
In her book, Manigault Newman accuses Trump of making derogatory statements about African-Americans, Filipinos and other minorities, as well as exhibiting ""forgetfulness and frustration."" 
""His mental decline could not be denied,"" wrote Manigault Newman, who had been one of the Republican president's most prominent black supporters.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, asked if she was surprised by Manigault Newman's animus toward the president, told reporters she was disappointed by what she called the former aide's self-serving and false claims.
""I think it's really sad what's she's doing,"" Sanders told a White House briefing. 
In recent days, Manigault Newman has released audio of her firing by Kelly and of a call from Trump in which he says he did not know about her dismissal.
On Tuesday, CBS News released another recording it said was unverified but appeared to be Manigault Newman and several Trump campaign aides in October 2016 discussing the potential fallout from a tape of Trump using a racial epithet during the taping of ""The Apprentice.""
CBS News' parent company, CBS Corp (N:CBS), owns Simon and Schuster Inc, which published her book. In it, Manigault Newman describes the recorded conversation as being a conference call held on Oct. 11, 2016. Reuters could not verify any of the recordings.
Trump on Monday denied the existence of any tape from ""The Apprentice"" in which he used the racial epithet.
Asked whether she could guarantee such a recording would never surface, Sanders said: ""I can't guarantee anything, but I can tell you that the president addressed this question directly.""
In a related development, a Trump campaign official said the campaign, which is gearing up for his 2020 re-election run, had filed an arbitration against Manigault Newman for breaching a 2016 confidentiality agreement. Asked about the pact, Manigault Newman told MSNBC she did not believe she had violated it.
Critics condemned Trump's tweet for what they said were racial and sexist undertones. 
""The president of the United States is calling a woman of color a dog? ... How dare he call anyone a dog?"" Democratic U.S. Representative Frederica Wilson, who is also an African-American, told CNN.
U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, called the president's language ""unbecoming"" and, in a tweet quoting the president's post, wrote that fellow Republicans ""should not be okay with it.""

Trump brought on Manigault Newman, previously known for repeatedly being fired on NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) boosted its investments in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) during the second quarter and confirmed it has expanded its already huge bet on iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
The changes were disclosed on Tuesday in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock holdings as of June 30.
Investors closely watch Berkshire's quarterly stock listings for signs about where Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler might see value.
The filings do not say which managers bought which stocks. Berkshire spent $6.08 billion on equities in the quarter.
Berkshire boosted its Goldman stake by 21 percent, owning roughly 13.3 million shares worth $2.92 billion on June 30, up from 11 million shares on March 31.
That stake had its origins in a profitable investment in Goldman preferred stock that Berkshire made during the 2008 financial crisis.
The Teva stake grew 7 percent to 43.25 million American depositary receipts worth about $1.05 billion. Teva's ADRs rose 1.2 percent after market hours.
Berkshire also said its Apple stake swelled to about 252 million shares worth close to $47 billion, up 5 percent from 239.6 million shares three months earlier.
Berkshire owns roughly 5 percent of Apple, whose market value surpassed $1 trillion last week.
Buffett, who turns 88 on Aug. 30, often buys stock when he cannot find whole businesses to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 90 companies in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.
The billionaire has gone 2-1/2 years since completing a major acquisition for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.
Several of the portfolio changes affected bank and airline stocks, reflecting Buffett's usual policy not to own more than 10 percent of a company's shares.
Berkshire said it sometimes exceeds the 10 percent cap when companies whose stock it owns repurchase their own shares, forcing it to sell some of its holdings.
Buffett does make exceptions, including for longtime holdings  American Express  Co (N:AXP) and dialysis company  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA).
In Tuesday's filing, Berkshire reported higher stakes in  Axalta Coating Systems Ltd  (N:AXTA), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), General Motors Co (N:GM), Liberty Global Plc (O:LBTYA), Southwest Airlines Inc (N:LUV) and US Bancorp (N:USB).

It reported lower stakes in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL),  Charter Communications  Inc (O:CHTR), Phillips 66 (N:PSX), United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), and no longer reported a stake in data analytics company  Verisk Analytics Inc  (O:VRSK).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) faces long odds on an appeal blaming an ""inflamed"" jury and ""junk science"" for a verdict of $289 million in damages to a man who said the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, according to some legal experts.
Last week's verdict ended the first trial over whether glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup, causes cancer. Monsanto, which says decades of scientific studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe, is facing about 5,000 similar lawsuits nationwide.
Bayer stock fell sharply on Monday following Friday's verdict in San Francisco Superior Court.
Monsanto said on Monday it planned to challenge the verdict on the grounds that the judge should have barred scientific evidence presented by California school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson's lawyers as insufficient. 
""Plaintiffs are putting forward junk science that is not based upon the 40 years of safe glyphosate use and studies,"" Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy, told Reuters. ""They attempted to color science with very emotional arguments designed to inflame jurors.""
The company also said statements by Johnson's lawyers, designed to paint the company in a malevolent light, inappropriately influenced the jurors. 
Monsanto could have difficulty getting the verdict thrown out on those grounds, according to some legal experts who said the judge carefully considered whether to allow Johnson's scientific evidence under California law and reached a defensible conclusion that the jury should hear it.
""This is one of those difficult questions at the margins of science and the judge found the evidence simply wasn't inadmissible,"" said Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida.
Johnson, 46, said in his lawsuit filed in 2016 that frequent use of Roundup caused him to develop lymphatic cancer.
Expert testimony is highly influential in product liability cases, and evidentiary standards exist to prevent juries from making decisions based on theories unsupported by science.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical not likely carcinogenic to humans. However, the cancer unit of the World Health Organization in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
Monsanto said the plaintiff's experts should have been excluded because although they mainly cited respected, peer-reviewed studies, they inappropriately cherry-picked results and used unreliable methods to support the position that glysophate causes cancer in humans.
But Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said it was common for experts to rely on the same studies and reach different conclusions to present to a jury during trial.
Legal experts said a federal judge overseeing other Roundup cases has allowed the same experts to go forward with testimony, even though the standard in federal courts is generally thought to be higher than in state courts.
The evidence rulings might draw the attention of higher courts, both in California and the U.S. Supreme Court, to use the Roundup cases as a way to clarify expert admissibility standards, other legal experts said.
A major question for appellate courts could be whether it is enough for an expert to simply analyze widely accepted peer-reviewed studies to support his own opinion, or whether the expert's analysis must also be reviewed or otherwise subject to stronger scrutiny, said two California-based defense lawyers, who requested anonymity citing potential conflicts of interest.
Monsanto also took issue with statements by Johnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, and some expert witnesses comparing Roundup to tobacco. Wisner told jurors the company would ""pop champagne corks"" if the verdict was too low.
He also said in court that a Monsanto unit made so-called Agent Orange, a highly toxic herbicide mixture used by the U.S. military 50 years ago in the Vietnam War. The harmful impact included cancers and birth defects.
Wisner on Monday rejected Monsanto's claims that the jury made its decision on emotional grounds.
""This was a considerate, thoughtful and well-educated jury that looked at the science to conclude glyphosate causes cancer,"" Wisner said.
Monsanto's arguments that remarks by witnesses and lawyers inflamed and prejudiced the jury would likely fall flat, some legal experts said.
David Rosenberg, a professor at Harvard Law School, said editorializing by lawyers in a courtroom needed to be truly egregious for a judge to even consider throwing out a verdict.

""Such remarks are part of the game during trials and I can't see a single reason why Monsanto would think an appeal would be helpful on those grounds,"" Rosenberg said.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Canada to consider steel safeguard response to U.S. tariffs,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Tuesday it will consider a safeguard action on seven steel products to protect domestic producers from imports since the United States imposed tariffs against its major trade partner in March.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau said a 15-day consultation period will be used to look at the harm or threat of harm to seven steel categories, including steel plate, rebar, energy tubular product, hot rolled sheet, pre-painted steel, stainless steel wire and wire rod.
""Our government believes the tariffs levied by the United States represent an exceptional circumstance, and that's why provisional safeguards are being considered,"" Morneau told a news conference at steelmaker ArcelorMittal's Dofasco plant in Hamilton, Ontario.
""If evidence gathered during our consultations points to harm or threat of harm to Canadian producers, we will apply provisional safeguards in an expeditious manner and refer the issue to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal for inquiry.""
Safeguards are emergency measures allowed under international trade law to respond to a sudden surge in imports. In some cases tariffs or quotas can be imposed on a temporary basis, before investigations are complete.
The safeguards, limiting steel supplies, are a blow to Canada’s oil sector, which has struggled to compete on costs and profitability with the United States, said Tom Whalen, chief executive of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada.
Higher costs of steel products, used to drill wells and build derricks and pressure pumps, would add to that competition gap, and Ottawa should compensate companies that are hurt by the safeguards, Whalen said.
“If you’re building equipment, you’re going to use bits and pieces of pretty much all"" affected steel categories.
The United States imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on March 23. While Canada was initially exempt, Canadian steel producers warned that U.S. measures would divert cheap steel into Canada. A Reuters analysis found that imports of steel pipe used by the energy industry spiked in the spring.
The European Union announced its own safeguards in July, a combination of quotas and tariffs on 23 steel product categories.
The steel sector employs about 22,000 workers in Canada, including about 10,000 in Hamilton, at Dofasco's plant, Stelco's finishing operations and a number of smaller companies.

Canada, long the top U.S. trade partner, has already imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made steel and other goods.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.45%. The S&P 500 rose 0.64%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.65%.
Risk-on sentiment returned, triggering a wave of buys across the market as a rebound in the lira drew some reprieve for financials, which had sold off a day earlier on concerns about banks' exposure to Turkey's vulnerable economy.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) closed higher for the day.
Analysts warned, however, that economic woes in Turkey are unlikely to go quietly into that good night, as the country is experiencing a ""crisis of confidence.""

514,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>","U.S. hedge funds bet on retail, tech in second-quarter as economy sizzled","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Prominent hedge fund managers appeared to make big second-quarter bets that the U.S. economy would continue to expand despite increasing concerns about a broadening trade dispute between the United States and China, regulatory filings showed Tuesday. 
Third Point added new positions in payment companies  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) and  Visa Inc  (N:V), both of which are up more than 19 percent year to date. Greenlight Capital, run by billionaire investor David Einhorn, added new positions in low-to-middle income retailers including  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR),  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG), Gap Inc (N:GPS), and TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX), the parent company of discount retailers TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. 
Activist fund Jana Partners added shares of broad-based exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 indexes and took new positions in  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and food delivery company GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB). 
The flurry of new positions in cyclical companies came during a quarter in which U.S. gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, nearly double the 2.2 percent rate of the first quarter of the year, according to Commerce Department estimates. 
A rally in cyclical companies would help boost hedge fund industry returns at a time when many fund firms are under pressure from investors to lower their fees or improve their performance. Hedge funds, on average, are up 1.5 percent since the start of January, according to research firm Hedge Fund Research, well behind the 6.2 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same time. 
""Everyone is comparing everything to the S&P 500 and that's a very difficult hurdle for the last few years,"" said Sol Waksman, president of research firm BarclayHedge. 
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.
The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's stock holdings.
TRIMMING THE FAANGS
Large hedge fund managers cut their positions in some of the so-called FAANG stocks - the moniker given to  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - that led the market higher last year. 
Third Point sold all of its stake in Alphabet and divested 1 million shares of Facebook, reducing its position in the company by 25 percent. At the same time, it increased its stake in  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) by nearly 310 percent, buying 1.7 million shares. 
Omega Advisors, meanwhile, sold all of its position in Netflix and added new holdings in biotechnology companies including Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:MDGL) and  Deciphera Pharmaceuticals  Inc (O:DCPH).
A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their stake in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion. 

Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management got rid of 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent. Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, trimmed only small amounts in the second quarter.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 04:13PM ET</span>",Royal Bank of Scotland pays $4.9 billion for crisis-era misconduct,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) will pay $4.9 billion to settle U.S. claims that it misled investors on residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2008, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.
The Justice Department said the penalty is the largest-ever imposed on a bank for misconduct leading up to the financial crisis. The bank announced in May that it had reached the settlement in principle. 
The government alleges RBS misled investors in underwriting and issuing residential mortgage-backed securities, understating the risks behind many of the loans and providing inaccurate data.
""Despite assurances by RBS to its investors, RBS’s deals were backed by mortgage loans with a high risk of default,"" Andrew E. Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said in a statement.
The Justice Department said that RBS disputes the allegations and does not admit wrongdoing, although the bank said in a statement it was happy to move on. 
“There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behavior alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today,"" RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said.
In conjunction with the settlement, the bank also said it would be paying out an interim ordinary dividend of 2 pence per share on Oct. 12 to shareholders. 
The dividend is the bank's first since its near-collapse and 45.5 billion pound ($58 billion) state bailout in 2008. 
The DOJ settlement and the resumption of dividends were two of the last big milestones in RBS’s decade-long journey back to normality. The looming Justice Department fine had weighed on the bank's share price and prevented it from paying out to its shareholders. 
Together with hefty cuts made to its investment bank and international business, a return to dividends could help shift the bank’s profile with investors from a risky bet into a safe, predictable value stock. 
It also expands the market for future government share sales by enabling a broader array of investors to look at buying the bank’s shares. 
Tuesday's announcement marks the latest in a long-running series of massive settlements struck between the U.S. government and large global banks over conduct leading up to the financial crisis. 

On Aug. 1, the Justice Department struck a settlement with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), which agreed to pay $2.09 billion to settle similar claims.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","Nasdaq, FINRA to boost reporting fees for dark pool trades","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and a Wall Street watchdog will raise fees for private stock trading platforms, such as ""dark pools,"" that report trade executions to a Nasdaq-run entity, in response to higher operational costs and off-exchange trading volumes, according to a recent regulatory filing.
The fee increases, which kick in Sept. 1, could amount to more than $3.5 million annually and are aimed at non-retail trades reported to a facility run by Nasdaq and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. (https:// 
The higher fees would affect brokers that run dark pools and other types of private trading venues, but could be passed on to investors. 
Nearly every major bank runs a dark pool, a trading venue that does not have to provide information such as trade sizes or prices to the public prior to trades taking place. 
The trading platforms were originally started with the aim of getting large orders done with minimal price movement, but have also attracted smaller trades because their execution costs are generally cheaper than on exchanges. 
Under SEC rules, every stock transaction must be reported to a consolidated data feed, whether it occurs on an exchange, like the Nasdaq or Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or in a dark pool. Off-exchange trades are reported through Trade Reporting Facilities (TRFs) run by Nasdaq and NYSE in conjunction with FINRA. 
Since 2012, off-exchange trades reported to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF have risen around 47 percent, while Nasdaq's operating costs for the facility have risen around 16 percent, the filing said. 
FINRA said it analyzed data from 545 FINRA/Nasdaq TRF participants in the final quarter of 2017 and found that if their reporting behavior remained the same, 515 participants would rise around $598 a month on average, though 489 of them would only see an increase of $350. Another 13 retail-focused participants would be unaffected by the fee changes, while the remaining 17 participants would see their monthly fees decrease by an average of $722. 
Firms that move more of their trade reporting to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF could hit new higher fee caps and end up paying less. Alternatively, they could choose to move more reporting to the competing NYSE/FINRA TRF, the filing said.

Nasdaq and FINRA also plan to open a new TRF in Chicago on Sept. 10, Nasdaq said in a separate regulatory filing.

519,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Retail Earnings Continue with Macy’s
Retail earnings are off to a relatively good start.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) numbers were strong, although the stock reaction was muted given the recent run on the shares and on some concern over margin guidance. And handbag retailer Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) jumped on strong sales of its Kate Spade bags.
Before the bell tomorrow, department store heavyweight Macy’s will issue fiscal second-quarter numbers.
On average, analysts expect that the company earned 50 cents per share for the period on revenue of about $5.56 billion.
The numbers will have to be strong to justify the recent tear Macy’s shares have been on. The stock is up more than 50% year to date.
So far, the linchpin of Macy’s turnaround strategy has been to improve its digital presence, close its underperforming stores and sell some of its real estate. The company is also investing heavily in its Bluemercury chain of specialty beauty stores and discount outlet Macy's (NYSE:M) Backstage.
Digital performance will be crucial for the company to produce a quarter that still lures in investors with the stock close to a 52-week high.
2. Retail Sales Government Data Also Coming
Along with individual retail earnings, Wall Street will get data on overall retail activity.
The Commerce Department will issue July retail sales numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that retail sales rose 0.2% last month, down from a 0.5% rise in June. They predict core retail sales, which exclude autos, rose 0.4% in July, the same as the month before.
At the same time, the Labor Department will issue its preliminary measure of second-quarter unit labor costs, a gauge of consumer inflation. Economists are looking for a 0.4% rise. That would be up from 0.2% in the year-ago quarter.
3. U.S. Crude Drawdown Expected
Oil prices were lower today, shaking off worries about countries cutting Iranian imports ahead of U.S. sanctions.
But, as usual for a Wednesday, tomorrow’s market direction will be heavily influenced by the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) weekly inventory report.
The numbers arrive at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Energy analysts are expecting a drop in U.S. crude inventories of 2.449 million barrels for last week.
Distillate stocks are expected to have dropped by 964,000 barrels, while analysts are forecasting a drawdown in gasoline stockpiles of 583,000 barrels.
Reports on Tuesday indicated that Saudi Arabia communicated to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that it had reduced output by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July to 10.29 million bdp, despite a June agreement with the cartel to increase production in order to cover shortfalls from outages and sanctions on Iran.
In its monthly report, OPEC, using secondary sources, had calculated Monday that the kingdom’s daily production fell by 52,800 to 10.39 million barrels in July from the prior month."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is pursuing its complaint against Honeywell (N:HON) to EU antitrust regulators, it said on Tuesday, even as the air transport group struck a deal over a similar grievance with engine maker CFM.
IATA filed a complaint with the European Commission in 2016 after some of its member airlines were quizzed by regulators about aviation equipment makers in the aftermarket repairs market and whether they abused their dominance.
One element of the complaint involved the CFM56, the world's best-selling jet engine, and another Honeywell's auxiliary power unit (APUs). Maintenance, repair and overhaul services are a lucrative source of revenues for engine makers.
IATA on July 31 withdrew the CFM complaint after the company, a joint venture between  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), agreed to open up engine maintenance services to rival engine parts and aftersales service market suppliers.
""IATA has not withdrawn the complaint against Honeywell,"" a spokeswoman for the body said.
IATA said it was concerned about certain business practices that its members believe limit competition in the market for APU maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Honeywell is the largest producer of gas turbine APUs found on many aircraft.
Honeywell said it was adhering to the rules.
""Honeywell believes that our practices are fair and in compliance with all relevant laws. We have and will continue to cooperate with the European Commission's preliminary inquiry,"" the company said in an email.

The EU competition enforcer has received the complaint and is assessing it, Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 02:32PM ET</span>","Tinder founders sue parent IAC, saying it owes them billions","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of founders, executives and early employees of Tinder on Tuesday sued IAC/InterActiveCorp (O:IAC), claiming the parent company deliberately undervalued the dating app to avoid paying them billions of dollars and deprived some employees of stock options.
The lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan stated that IAC and its subsidiary  Match Group Inc  (O:MTCH) deliberately prevented the plaintiffs from cashing in stock options they could exercise and sell to IAC. They are seeking damages of not less than $2 billion.
""The defendants made contractual promises to recruit and retain the men and women who built Tinder,"" Orin Snyder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. 
""The evidence is overwhelming that when it came time to pay the Tinder employees what they rightfully earned, the defendants lied, bullied, and violated their contractual duties, stealing billions of dollars,"" he said.
IAC and Match Group said the allegations in the complaint ""are meritless and we intend to vigorously defend against them.""
The plaintiffs, including Tinder founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen and several executives and employees were given stock options in Tinder as part of their compensation in 2014, according to the lawsuit. Because Tinder is a private company, they were not able to exercise their options and then sell stock on the open market.
Instead, they were allowed to exercise their options and sell only to IAC and Match on four specific dates, in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021, on which the stock options would be independently valued, according to the lawsuit.
Match and IAC, which owns 80 percent of Tinder-owner Match, appointed Greg Blatt, Match's then chairman and chief executive, as interim CEO of Tinder in 2016. The plaintiffs said this allowed the two companies to ""control the valuation of Tinder.""
The plaintiffs claimed that IAC and Match engaged in a ""disinformation campaign"" to obtain a ""bogus"" $3 billion valuation for the 2017 date. Some plaintiffs who had left the company were contractually forced to exercise their options using that valuation, according to the lawsuit, while other plaintiffs kept their options.
However, IAC and Match then merged Tinder into Match without the consent of Tinder's board of directors and canceled the future dates for exercising options, the lawsuit said.
""Mr. Rad has a rich history of outlandish public statements, and this lawsuit contains just another series of them,"" IAC and Match Group said in a joint statement.

522,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",This $16 Billion Turkish Wall of Debt Is at Risk From Lira,"(Bloomberg) -- Major Turkish companies, financial institutions and the government have at least $16 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currency that are due by the end of next year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
The amount due by the end of next year is mostly composed of debt issued by Turkish financial institutions, and includes conventional bonds and Islamic sukuk bonds valued at a minimum of $100 million at the time of issuance. Investors are watching closely to see whether Turkish banks and other companies will maintain access to the foreign funding they need to keep economic activity humming as the country’s currency plunges.
“So far, a currency crisis has not turned into a debt crisis,” Stuart Culverhouse and Hasnain Malik, analysts at Exotix Partners LLP, wrote in a report. The country’s low public debt, at 28 percent of gross domestic product, “might be some comfort, and the country has ammunition in the form of $98 billion in official reserves,” they wrote.
But given Turkey’s reliance on external finance, a currency crisis could turn into a debt crisis, they said, especially for those firms that are highly leveraged and particularly sensitive to foreign-exchange moves.
Coca-Cola Icecek AS is first up with a senior unsecured note of $500 million it will repay Oct. 1. The company refinanced the securities last September to extend the maturity to 2024 at cheaper rates than previously, and now has “more than sufficient hard-currency cash” to meet its obligations, CCI said in a statement Tuesday. Fitch Ratings affirmed the company at BBB- this week, but kept its outlook negative in line with that of the sovereign, while pointing out all of CCI’s operations are based in emerging markets.
Heavy Load
Next year has a heavy concentration of bonds maturing for Turkish issuers, Bloomberg data show. Lender Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS has $1.4 billion in three bonds maturing between February and October. The Turkish government has a sukuk of $1.25 billion that’s due in October, plus three bonds denominated in U.S. dollars and euros, nominally valued at $4.4 billion in total, that will mature between March and November.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 01:37PM ET</span>",New York sues OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma over opioids,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state on Tuesday sued Purdue Pharma LP, accusing the OxyContin maker of widespread fraud and deception in the marketing of opioids, and contributing to a nationwide epidemic that has killed thousands.
The state blamed Purdue for running what it called a reckless, decades-long scheme to mislead doctors and patients by overstating the ability of opioids to improve bodily function, while downplaying the risk of addiction.
This enabled privately held Purdue to boost prescriptions and profits, at the cost of lost lives and ""devastation"" in communities now ""awash"" with the painkillers, according to the complaint filed in the state supreme court in Suffolk County.
""The opioid epidemic was manufactured by unscrupulous distributors who developed a $400 billion industry pumping human misery into our communities,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.
""This lawsuit sends a clear message (to those) who mislead the public to increase their profit margins that we will hold you accountable,"" he added.
In a statement, Purdue denied New York's allegations but said it shared the state's concerns about the ""opioid crisis.""
The Stamford, Connecticut-based company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""continues to approve"" of scientific and medical information it has provided to doctors.
New York is seeking to impose civil fines, recoup profits and obtain other damages, including for creating an alleged ""criminal nuisance.""
Purdue sold $1.74 billion of OxyContin in 2017, according to Symphony Health Solutions.
Opioid makers and distributors face hundreds of lawsuits by U.S. states, counties and cities accusing them of using deceptive marketing to sell the painkillers.
New York joined at least 26 other U.S. states and Puerto Rico to sue Purdue over opioids.
Connecticut is not among those states but has been part of a 41-state coalition investigating the opioid industry. Some of its larger cities, including Bridgeport, New Haven and Waterbury, have sued Purdue.
In January, New York City filed its own lawsuit seeking $500 million from Purdue and seven other opioid makers and distributors to fight the opioid crisis there.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in a record 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This included at least 3,086 deaths in New York state and more than 1,100 in New York City.
In 2007, Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty to misbranding OxyContin and agreed to pay $634.5 million to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.

The case is New York v Purdue Pharma LP et al, New York State Supreme Court, Suffolk County, No. 400016/2018.

524,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Fed May End Taper This Year Amid Regime Rethink, Pozsar Says","(Bloomberg) -- America’s growing debt pile may force the Federal Reserve to stop shrinking its balance sheet before the year is out, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar.
With bank reserves at the Fed being pared, the U.S. central bank will soon have to make a choice between activating an overnight facility for repurchase agreements or halting its balance-sheet reduction earlier than many market participants expect, the former U.S. Treasury adviser wrote in a note Monday.
He indicates that policy makers are unlikely to pursue the option of a new facility until alternatives have been exhausted, meaning a premature end to the taper is the most likely outcome. Royal Bank of Canada analysts said last month the balance-sheet runoff could end as early as 2019, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists in May said they’re assuming an end around April 2020.
A dilemma facing the Fed at the moment is how to keep the overnight fed funds rate, the benchmark it uses to control monetary policy, within its target band as it tries to normalize policy. Its task has been complicated by the Treasury department’s need to finance the growing federal budget deficit and a deluge of bill issuance that’s helped push higher a whole swath of short-term funding rates, including the effective fed funds rate. The situation is spurring a debate among market observers about what potential changes the Fed might need to make to maintain effective control of monetary policy.
Adapting the Toolkit
“A rethink of the Fed’s operating regime will be necessary,” Pozsar wrote. “We are transitioning from an environment where reserves are excess to an environment where collateral is excess. The Fed’s monetary toolkit has to adapt.”
So far, the Fed’s response to the upward drift in the effective fed funds rate has been to lower its interest on excess reserves rate, or IOER, relative to the upper bound of its target range. But Pozsar says reductions in this rate won’t push overnight rates lower and there are “more effective and less disruptive ways of dealing with the glut of bills.”
The flood of bills has created an excess of collateral in the repo market and given the constraints imposed by post-crisis regulation, Pozsar argues that bank reserves aren’t overly abundant and thus there isn’t a lot of room for the Fed to shrink its balance sheet. The lack of use of the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase facility “tells us that every penny of reserves is bid and that balance sheet taper from here will cut right into the system’s liquidity bone.”
Of course there are other options to tame short-end rates. The Treasury could change its issuance strategy toward selling more notes rather than bills, or the Fed could announce a “reverse twist” in which the central bank sells coupon-bearing securities from its portfolio and buys bills instead, Pozsar said. Or the Fed could cut the rate on its foreign reverse repo facility, a program the central bank uncapped when there was a shortage of bills due to regulatory changes.
An overnight repo facility is “useful when collateral is in excess supply and reserves need to be added,” Pozsar said. This could exist in tandem with the overnight reverse repo program, which has been used to mop up excess reserves, as conditions could shift again in the future. But until all alternatives have been exhausted and benefits are clear, the central bank is unlikely to launch a new mechanism, in Pozsar’s view.
“If reserves are hard to add, they’ll have to be preserved by ending taper sooner than many market participants expect."""

The emotional support animal must remain in a carrier or be on a leash at all times, Southwest said, adding that customers traveling with pets will need to present a complete letter from a medical doctor or licensed mental health professional on the day of the departure.
Airlines have started to tighten policies to fly animals on growing concerns about passengers bringing aboard exotic pets that could pose a safety risk. 
There are also growing complaints of some passengers falsely claiming pets as emotional support or psychiatric service animals to avoid paying.
The U.S. Transportation Department told U.S. airlines in may that they must continue to allow the transport of the most common service animals, but said it was asking for public comment about amending its existing regulations.
Southwest said it would formally accept fully-trained psychiatric support animals as trained service animals. The changes would be come into effect on Sept. 17, it added.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 12:07PM ET</span>",Coca-Cola bets on Kobe sports drink in fight with Gatorade,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) is buying a minority stake in a sports drink brand backed by basketball star Kobe Bryant, it said on Tuesday, seeking to mount a stronger challenge to PepsiCo's (O:PEP) Gatorade.
Coca-Cola's investment in BodyArmor - which will make it the brand's second largest shareholder - comes as its Powerade drink steadily cedes market share to Gatorade. Coke has also been rattled by falling demand for its trademark fizzy drinks.
While Coke says there is ""much work to be done"" at Powerade, PepsiCo said last month that Gatorade was seeing higher demand after launching zero-sugar versions.
""Proud of our team at @DrinkBODYARMOR and our new partnership with the @CocaColaCo who believes in our mission of becoming the #1 Global Sports Drink. Thanks @Gatorade, we'll take it from here,"" Bryant said on Twitter.
Gatorade and PepsiCo's other sports drinks account for nearly a third of a $20 billion U.S. market, according to Euromonitor International.  Monster Beverage  (O:MNST) and Red Bull follow close behind, with Coke trailing in fourth place with a 7 percent share. Coca-Cola also has a 16.7 percent stake in Monster.
""(BodyArmor) is a positive for Coca-Cola, which is continuing to pursue its product portfolio diversification strategy,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi.
BodyArmor is also backed by  Dr Pepper Snapple  - now part of Keurig Dr Pepper (N:KDP) - which made a $20 million investment in 2015 and boosted its ownership to 15.5 percent in 2016.
But  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said Coca-Cola's investment could end BodyArmor's agreement with Dr Pepper.
""We have learned that BodyArmor has notified Keurig Dr Pepper that they are terminating their existing distribution agreement,"" she said. ""Although the timing and mechanism by which distribution will transition over to Coca-Cola's bottling system is still uncertain.""
Neither Keurig Dr Pepper nor BodyArmor responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Coke did not disclose the size of its investment or other financial details but said it could increase its ownership in BodyArmor, whose higher-priced energy drinks use natural flavors and sweeteners such as pure cane sugar and coconut water concentrate.
""We would not be surprised if Coca-Cola eventually acquires the remainder of BodyArmor,"" Wells Fargo's Herzog said.
Coca-Cola, however, has historically stayed away from full-blown acquisitions, settling instead for acquiring partial stakes in companies - a strategy that allows it to test-drive potentially risky bets.

Bryant, who first invested in BodyArmor in 2013 two years after it was launched, is now its third biggest shareholder. The brand also has endorsement deals with baseball player Mike Trout and another NBA star, James Harden.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Kate Spade sales drive strong Tapestry forecast, shares jump","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - The publicity around the untimely death of designer Kate Spade drew shoppers back to the handbag brand this summer, driving a 31 percent jump in fourth-quarter sales for its new owner Tapestry Inc (N:TPR) that sent shares up 12 percent on Tuesday.
Tapestry, formerly known as  Coach , also issued a better-than-expected forecast, banking on strong demand for the colorful and quirky handbags as well as gains from a reduction in discounts and promotions.
Spade, who built a fashion empire selling accessories that offered affordable luxury to younger working women, committed suicide in her New York apartment in June at the age of 55. She was last associated with the brand in 2006 when she sold her remaining stake in the firm.
""Our e-commerce site as well as our store sales reflected the strong and immediate heartfelt response to loyal customers to the tragic news of our founder's passing,"" Anna Bakst, the brand's Chief Executive Officer said on a call with analysts.
The Kate Spade acquisition helped Tapestry broaden the reach of its handbag business that traditionally focused on older women.
The company has been pulling back flash sales promotions on its website and limiting inventories at department stores to sell more items at full price, a strategy that helped revive sales of its signature Coach brand.
""From what we saw in the stores is there had been promotions up until the time of her passing and then it leveled off ... I think there was a renewed interest in the brand and they were able to benefit from it,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A-Line Partners.
In the fourth quarter, Kate Spade brand's sales rose about 4 percent to $312 million on a proforma basis, the company said, topping analysts' estimate for the brand's revenue and comparable-store sales.
Kate Spade sales are expected to rise at a double-digit rate in 2019, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wills said, adding that the comparable store sales at the brand are expected to return to growth in the second half of the year.
Sales at its signature Coach brand, however, missed analysts' estimates even though they rose nearly 5 percent to $1.10 billion.
For the full year, Tapestry forecast sales in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Wills said Tapestry was closely monitoring the impact of potential tariffs on Chinese imports, but noted that less than 5 percent of the company's handbags were produced in the region.
Excluding one time items, the fashion house reported a profit of 60 cents, 3 cents more than the polled estimate.

Shares of the company were up as much as 12 percent at $53.38, putting them on track for their best day in nearly eight years.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investment firms are exploring a buyout of  Yum China Holdings Inc . (N:YUMC) in what could be one of Asia's biggest M&A deals this year, sources close to the situation told Reuters.
Yum China, which had a market cap of $13 billion as of its closing price on Monday, was spun off from the KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands! Inc (N:YUM) in 2016 and later listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The firm itself has been discussing internally about switching to the Hong Kong bourse for a listing, because of the city's proximity to the Chinese market, potentially higher valuation and its convenient timezone for executives, a separate source with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.
Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group is planning to lead a consortium to buy the KFC and Pizza Hut operator in China, said four of the people. The firm, which has received commitments of over $10 billion for a new fund, has tapped lenders for potential financing of the deal and other investors to join them in the bid, two of them said.
Yum China's shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday.
Global investment house KKR & Co (N:KKR) and Hong Kong-based regional firm Baring Private equity Asia are also weighing up investing in the buyout, according to two sources, who added that no final decision has been made. 
Bloomberg first reported on investors in the Yum China buyout on Tuesday. The report said Chinese sovereign fund China Investment Corp (CIC) and DCP Capital, the investment firm run by former KKR & Co. senior executives, are part of the Hillhouse consortium, adding that Primavera Capital Group, a current investor in Yum China, could also join the bidding group.
Reuters could not independently verify if the investors are all working as one bidding group. A separate source with knowledge of the situation said there could be more than one consortium of bidders.
A spokesman for Yum China said the company does not comment on market rumours or speculation when asked about the buyout intent and the Hong Kong listing plan. Yum Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hillhouse and Baring declined to comment. KKR, CIC, DCP and Primavera did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital and Ant Financial Services Group bought a minority stake in Yum China for $460 million as part of the spin-off deal in September 2016. Both are still shareholders in the company. Ant declined to comment. 
Two sources said a KKR-led consortium, which included Baring, CIC and Chinese investment firm Hopu Investments, had discussions with Yum Brands! about taking a controlling stake in its China business two years ago but failed to get a deal done.
Yum China shares are down 15 percent this year but its Monday's closing price - $34.22 per share, is still above its listing price at $24.51 on Nov. 1 2016. It has lost about $1 billion in market cap since reports about the potential buyout first came out in late July.
Its second-quarter net income increased 13 percent year-on-year but Pizza Hut continued to face challenges in China's competitive casual dining space, its CEO said on Aug. 1.

Former Yum China chairman and chief executive officer Sam Su, who was pivotal in the company's expansion in China, now serves as an operating partner at Hillhouse Capital.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Development bank EBRD has stress-tested for 40 percent lira crash,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - One of Turkey's biggest multilateral investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has passed internal stress tests for a 40 percent drop by the lira, sources told Reuters, but the currency has weakened more than that this year. 
The exercise, which was done in response to the lira's accelerating decline and relayed privately to the development bank's 67 government shareholders at a board meeting last month, concluded it could withstand such a slump, although it would suffer losses.
""It is rather serious, but it would not threaten the bank's financial position,"" the source said, referring to impact of the lira's crash. ""We had some resilience built in.""
Turkey has become the EBRD's largest country of operation since it stopped lending in Russia 2014. It has a combined 7.3 billion euros ($8.31 billion) of projects, loans and equity stakes there, and has pumped in 3.5 billion euros over the past two years. 
The 40 percent drop in the Turkish currency was the most extreme of at least three scenarios modeled by the EBRD's economists and risk management department, which is overseen by one of its vice presidents, Betsy Nelson.
The view was that such a huge fall would be a once-in-a-century event. However, the currency is now down 45 percent this year (TRYUSD=R) and it has shed around 35 percent from the time the stress test was conducted.
An EBRD spokesman would not comment on the test's findings. He reiterated the bank's recent statement that it remained committed to investing in the Turkish economy.
The issue is crucial because the EBRD has a prized triple-A rating and will not want to use up too much valuable capital or have to tap shareholder governments for additional cash. 
One of the sources said the situation was almost certain to be scrutinized again when the bank's directors reconvene in early September.
It often works alongside Turkish banks, all of which have seen their share prices and bonds hammered by the collapse of the lira in recent weeks. 
""I think if it (lira) goes into a freefall, we might have an emergency message,"" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the stress-test. 
The picture for the EBRD in Turkey is also being complicated by troubled relations between the United States, the bank's biggest shareholder, and Ankara.
Late last month, a group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation that would curb lending in Turkey by the EBRD and other international finance institutions in Turkey
It is part of a bid to ramp up pressure on Ankara over the case of an American pastor jailed in Turkey. 

""September will be very busy,"" the source said. ""Turkey will be on everyone's radar.""

Two key industry associations on Tuesday called on the government to cut spending, improve ties with the European Union and bring to an end the spat with the U.S. over the detention of an American pastor who’s been accused of aiding a failed 2016 coup.
It’s part of a growing wave of discontent among businesses and bankers over the failure of policy makers to stem market turmoil that’s seen the lira lose more than a quarter of its value in less than two weeks. The currency rebounded as some bankers, too, increased pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates to contain the slide.
Policy makers need to adopt a series of measures “so that the situation doesn’t make permanent damage to the real economy,"" the Union of Chambers and Commodities Exchanges of Turkey and the Turkish Industry and business Association said in a joint statement. “Businesses are determined to provide support for success of the economy’s government program.""
The lira strengthened 5.4 percent to 6.5339 per dollar by 11:55 a.m. in Istanbul on speculation the central bank will cede to pressure to hoist interest rates, one of the demands of the business groups. They also asked the government to chart out a clear plan to bring inflation -- which soared to a 15-year high of almost 16 percent in July -- back to single digits permanently.
While they are growing more critical, the underlying tone of warnings from businesses has so far been supportive of the government in principle, showing there are limits to how much Turkey’s billionaires are feeling emboldened to speak out after elections in June increased Erdogan’s grip on power.
“Something has to be done about interest rates,” Ali Fuat Erbil, chief executive officer of  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS  (OTC:TKGBY), the country’s second-largest bank by market value, said in an interview aired by NTV. “Besides fiscal discipline, monetary tightening is the remedy. Is there need for that? Yes there is.”

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) on Tuesday reported second-quarter sales that beat Wall Street estimates despite signs of a slowdown in the housing market, boosted by a rebound in demand for seasonal products and shoppers making more purchases to remodel their homes.
The No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain also raised its earnings and revenue forecast for the year, sending its shares up 2.4 percent to $198.8 in pre-market trading. Shares of the retailer have risen 25 percent in the past 12 months.
Consumers have continued to invest money into the places they live even as higher mortgage rates and rising real estate prices have hurt home sales this summer. Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low in June and data for the prior month was revised sharply lower, the latest indications that the housing market was slowing down.
""The (company's) sales strength is likely to garner the most attention as we sense there had been some fear recently that the overall macro picture had been slowing down,"" Stifel analyst John Baugh said in a note. 
The retailer's sales rebounded from the first quarter when cooler-than-usual weather in some parts of the United States hurt demand for spring-season products.
The first quarter sales miss was the first in seven quarters for Home Depot, which has in recent years largely bucked the trend of big-box stores losing shoppers to online retailers including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Home Depot raised its full-year earnings forecast to $9.42 per share from $9.31. It also now expects comparable sales growth of about 5.3 percent, from 5 percent, and sales growth of about 7 percent, from 6.7 percent earlier.
The retailer said customer transactions rose 3.1 percent in the second quarter ended July 29.
Sales at Home Depot stores open for more than a year climbed 8 percent, beating the average analyst estimate of a 6.65 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net earnings increased to $3.5 billion, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter, from $2.7 billion, or $2.25, a year earlier. Analysts expected $2.84 per share.

Net sales rose 8.4 percent to $30.5 billion, beating expectations of $30.03 billion.

555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Elon Musk’s Vast Oil Conspiracy Ends With Saudi Billions,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk has always hated the fossil-fuel industry. His stated mission for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is to hasten its demise, and more than once he’s blamed the “unrelenting and enormous” power of oil interests for sabotaging his efforts. But now, in his bid to take Tesla private, Musk is courting billions of oil dollars.
After a week of playing coy about who he’s been trying to enlist to help buy out Tesla’s publicly traded shares, Musk revealed at least one partner: Saudi Arabia. It’s hard to think of a more perfect symbol of Big Oil and its money than a sovereign wealth fund created by world’s biggest oil producer. Musk said in a blog post on Monday that he’s been in talks with Saudi Arabia “going back almost two years.”
Constructing the appearance of a high-stakes struggle between Tesla and the fossil-fuel industry has always been key to Tesla’s brand strategy. In the age of global warming, Musk has argued over and over again, you’re either part of the solution with civilization hanging in the balance or you’re the problem. Every time he unveils a new Tesla product—be it a battery for your home or an expensive sports car—he’s careful to lay out the case for how it helps the worldwide transition to sustainable energy. The idea that oil money was arrayed against him made buying his products seem like choosing a side in an epochal struggle. 
By now it’s clear, however, that the battle lines can’t be quite so neatly drawn. Some of the very parties Musk has been condemning as threats to the planet want to be seen as part of the solution, too. 
An Oil Conspiracy Theory
To get a sense of Musk’s distrust of the fossil fuel industry, you don’t have to go back far.
In an email to his workforce in June, Musk alleged attempts by a former employee, later identified as Martin Tripp, to “sabotage” the company. The letter described “a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die,” including, Musk said, the oil industry. Tripp has since filed a whistle-blower complaint with the SEC claiming Tesla made misstatements to investors and is seeking $1 million in damages from Musk’s public condemnation.
From Musk’s email:
The oil and gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world—they don’t love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power and electric cars. Don’t want to blow your mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors. If they're willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they're willing to cheat in other ways? 
With Musk’s new disclosures about his talks with Saudi Arabia, it’s clear that this email was written long after he knew the biggest pool of oil money was interested in financing, not destroying, his company.
This wasn’t an isolated suggestion that oil was out to get him. A month earlier, Musk had attacked the credibility of journalists by arguing that the media industry was beholden to fossil-fuel advertisers. 
Elon Musk @elonmusk Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky si… twitter.com/i/web/status/9…
Sent via Twitter for iPhone.
View original tweet.
Musk’s solution was to threaten to launch a website, pravduh.com, that would let users rate journalists and their editors as a way to correct for the corrupting influence of oil money in advertising that supports news.
These examples stretch back years. In 2013, while opening a Tesla showroom in London, he decried attacks by the oil industry on electric vehicles and climate science. “It's kinda like the battle against big tobacco in the old days, and how they’d run all these ads about how tobacco’s no problem,” he said.
In May 2016, just weeks after Tesla unveiled its Model 3 electric car, Musk was especially critical of the oil industry. “It is quite worrying, the future of the world,” he said. “We need to appeal to the people and educate them to sort of revolt against this and to fight the propaganda of the fossil fuel industry, which is unrelenting and enormous.”
Four months later, Tesla accused a former executive from an oil-and-gas services company, Todd Katz, of impersonating Musk in an email to get private data about the company. Tesla alleged he was part of an effort to undermine cleaner transportation.
Making Peace With Oil Money
The fossil-fuel industry, just like the media Musk likes to attack, has never been the monolith he made it out to be. Yes, oil companies have at times lobbied to protect their business and pushed the politics of climate change away from stringent regulation. But some of the biggest innovations and sources of funding for climate solutions have also come from Big Oil.
Take the lithium-ion battery at the core of all Tesla vehicles. That technology was first developed by a chemist at Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in the 1970s. Even today, at a time when electric vehicles are poised to cut demand for oil, there are tens of thousands of electric-vehicle charging stations across Europe owned and operated by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Engie SA and  Statoil  (OL:EQNR) ASA. 
That’s why it’s not totally surprising to learn from Musk’s blog post on Monday that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund first approached him in early 2017. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, or PIF, recently accumulated an almost 5 percent stake and is interested in taking the company private, as Bloomberg News first reported Sunday. The Saudis aren’t even the only ones putting oil money to work for Tesla: The Norwegian sovereign-wealth fund, created by that country’s oil wealth, held 0.48 percent of Tesla’s stock at the end of 2017.
While Saudi Arabia’s economy is built on crude exports, the government has acknowledged that the source of its prosperity is also doing environmental harm and can’t continue forever. Diversification is central to the kingdom’s Vision 2030 program. The country is already investing in solar power, smart cities, and the future of transportation. Saudi Arabia hopes to sell shares of the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, to help expand its sovereign wealth fund to eventually control more than $2 trillion. It makes sense that a portion of that money would find its way to electric vehicles, which are forecast to increased from global sales of 1.1 million last year to 30 million by 2030, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A bigger investment to help take Tesla private would hand some part of the operating control of the world’s biggest electric-car maker over to the world’s biggest oil producer. That’s the kind of shadowy influence that Tesla’s chief executive officer might have framed as a threat. But with traditional automakers researching battery technology to compete with Tesla, and oil states pouring money into Musk’s vision, it’s starting to seem like a vast electric-vehicle conspiracy is underway.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Tech still all the rage while bears prowl emerging markets: BAML survey,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors remain overwhelmingly bullish on U.S. and Chinese tech shares, while short positions on emerging equities are growing increasingly popular, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest monthly fund manager survey showed on Tuesday.
Investors picked ""Long FAANG and BAT"" as the ""most crowded"" trade for the seventh straight month, BAML's August survey found, referring to U.S. tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and China's Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent. 
Tech has kept its crown, even though results-driven declines by Facebook and Twitter last month triggered anxiety over the mega-cap stocks responsible for the lion's share of stock market gains in the U.S. and China. 
Going short emerging-market equities was the second most popular trade, according to the survey, which was conducted between Aug. 3 and Aug. 9 - just before Turkey's lira plunged 16 percent against the dollar on Friday. 
Investors had a small underweight on EM equities, but BAML said prior EM crisis lows saw investors' underweight at -27 percent, versus -1 percent today - suggesting investors could slash allocations a lot further from here. 
Among risks to global markets, investors said for the third month in a row that trade war was the most concerning.
They continued to position for a global monetary tightening cycle led by the U.S. Federal Reserve. A net 54 percent of investors were underweight bonds, while 20 percent were overweight global banks, which gain from higher interest rates.
Overall, global investors became more cautious in August, raising their cash allocation to 5 percent from 4.7 percent. The increased caution was tempered with a more positive outlook on the profit cycle, with a net 5 percent saying profits will improve. 
European fund managers were relatively more bullish, cutting their cash allocations to 4.3 percent from 5 percent. 
The proportion of European investors expecting stronger economic growth rose to the highest since April, and the share expecting a recession in the next 12 months also fell to its second lowest ever. 
U.S. EQUITIES IN FAVOR, UK STOCKS DUMPED
Investors' allocation to U.S. equities rose to the biggest overweight since January 2015, making the U.S. the top equity region for the first time in five years as Wall Street stocks delivered strong earnings.
The U.S. was the most favorable region in terms of corporate profits, according to 67 percent of surveyed investors - the highest proportion in 17 years. 
Meanwhile, investors pulled money from UK equities, which saw the biggest one-month drop in allocations since May 2016 as concerns of a no-deal Brexit rose.
After six months of falling allocations to euro zone equities, investors added to the region again.
As the S&P 500 volatility gauge (VIX) hit its lowest since January on Aug 9, surveyed investors showed the lowest conviction on record for buying volatility. 

Accordingly, going long volatility would be a staunchly contrarian bet, going against the grain of current investor thinking, while BAML also suggested ""long BRIC/short FAANG"" and ""long bonds"" as trades for the contrarian investor.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) has recruited a new chief ethics officer from  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) after costly bribery scandals and a disputed $1.2 million contract with President Donald Trump's former lawyer that the Swiss drugmaker now calls a mistake.
Novartis said on Tuesday it had hired Klaus Moosmayer, 49, from Siemens, where he spent more than a decade helping oversee the German engineering company's efforts to build its compliance system after several of its own bribery scandals.
Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, promoted on Feb. 1 to lead the Basel-based company, has promised to boost its reputation following settlements or fines in corruption cases in China, South Korea and the United States. 
He has also faced U.S. lawmakers' criticism over the contract with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, something Narasimhan called a ""mistake"" that exposed Novartis to accusations it paid to gain influence within the administration.
Moosmayer, a German, replaces Shannon Thyme Klinger, who was appointed as Novartis's general counsel when Felix Ehrat resigned in May to take responsibility for the Cohen agreement.
""We must hold ourselves to (the) highest ethical standards and always aim to win and maintain the trust of society and our many stakeholders,"" Narasimhan said in a statement, while lauding Moosmayer's extensive experience in compliance matters.
Novartis has said neither Narasimhan nor Klinger knew of the contract with Cohen when it was signed in early 2017, shortly after Trump's inauguration.
In recent years, Novartis has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to resolve cases where employees were accused of flouting the law to accelerate sales. Units remain under scrutiny in Greece, Asia and Russia, and a trial is scheduled next year in another U.S. federal lawsuit.
SHORTCOMINGS
Novartis has acknowledged shortcomings amid what ex-CEO Joe Jimenez called a ""results-oriented"" culture, while insisting the Greek probe includes ""many sensational and unfounded claims"".
Moosmayer, a Siemens lawyer since 2000, played a central role in building up the company's policies governing internal investigations, disciplinary sanctions, remediation and compliance risk assessment. 
In 2008, Siemens paid about $1.6 billion to resolve U.S. and European allegations it bribed officials around the world in exchange for business.
At Siemens, one of Moosmayer's main duties was to handle the remainder of what the company dubbed a “compliance crisis"" that had once put the group's future in doubt.
His brief also included helping manage Siemens's response to the diversion of four turbines to Crimea, in breach of EU sanctions imposed after Russia annexed the region from Ukraine in 2014. Siemens's efforts to seize the turbines have been rejected by a Russian court.
Moosmayer, who joins the Novartis executive committee, said he hopes to build on Novartis's personal accountability focus.

""Society has high expectations of the pharmaceutical industry and rightfully so,"" Moosmayer said.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Carlyle starts preparations for $5 billion listing of chemicals group Atotech - sources,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Carlyle (O:CG) is starting preparations for a stock market listing of German speciality chemicals group Atotech, a former part of oil group  Total  (PA:TOTF) which could be valued at around $5 billion, people close to the matter said. 
The private equity investor has asked investment banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering which is expected to take place in New York next year, two of the people said, while another person said a German IPO was also a possibility. 
Carlyle declined to comment. 
Atotech, a Berlin-based maker of speciality chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors, posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $329 million on sales of $1.2 billion last year. 
Carlyle bought Atotech in 2016 at an enterprise value of $3.2 billion or 12 times its core earnings.
The investor would likely seek a valuation of at least 13-14 times Atotech's expected core profit of up to $400 million, or roughly $5 billion, two of the people said. 
U.S.-listed peers such as Cabot Microelectronics (O:CCMP), Entegris (O:ENTG), Quaker Chemical (N:KWR) and Versum Materials (N:VSM) trade at 11-15 times their expected core earnings.
""For Carlyle, it's about taking some money off the table and using a window of opportunity ahead of a potential correction of stock markets,"" one of the people said, adding that the deal could take place in the second quarter, based on 2018 earnings.
Earlier this year, Atotech increased its debt by $500 million to pay its owners a special dividend of the same amount.
While a listing is seen as the most likely exit route, Carlyle will also consider potential bids from chemicals groups or other investors, the people said. 
At the time of Carlyle's buyout, peers such as  Umicore  (BR:UMI) and  Sinochem  (SS:600500) showed interest in the firm which is specialized in metallization, panel plating and corrosion protection.

Atotech, which was founded in 1993 through a merger of Elf Atochem M&T Harshaw and Schering’s (DE:BAYGn) electroplating division, employs more than 4,000 staff. Elf Aquitaine was later renamed Total after it merger with Totalfina, and it agreed to sell Atotech as part of a $10 billion asset disposal program.

LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets regained their footing on Tuesday as the threat from the collapse of the Turkish lira ebbed and reassuring German data offset signs of slowing growth in China.
After three weeks of losses, Turkey's lira finally recovered as the country's central bank moved to ease pressure on the currency, triggering a 7 percent surge to 6.4 per dollar . It still lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and has shed more than two-fifths of its value so far in 2018.
The rot also stopped for the South African rand, the Russian rouble and the Argentine peso. Argentina's central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday. Even so, the peso hit a record low. 
""These things get very volatile in both directions once you have had a really big move,"" Saxo bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy said. ""To suggest this thing is over, you would have to see that Turkey is isolated. I'm not there yet and I don't think the market is there.""
European shares also bounced back after two days of selling as anxieties over contagion from the Turkish currency crisis eased.
After falling to a 21-month low on Monday, euro zone bank stocks (SX7E) rose 0.8 percent versus a 0.4 percent gain by the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) cross-sector benchmark (EU).
Data showed the region's largest economy, Germany, picked up more steam than expected in Q2, although the bounce might have been stronger had surveys from China not proved softer than expected.
Chinese retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all grew by less than forecast in July, a trifecta of disappointment that underlined the need for more policy stimulus in China even as trade risks intensify.
The Shanghai blue-chip index (CSI300) was off 0.9 percent and weighing on MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS), which eased 0.25 percent.
Moves elsewhere were mixed. Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 2.3 percent and Australian stocks (AXJO) added 0.8 percent. 
BACK TO THE FUTURES
EMini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were still a fraction higher. Ten-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent (US10YT=RR). 
Investors were encouraged that U.S. declines were only minor overnight after the losses by the lira and other emerging-market currencies. The Dow (DJI) ended Monday down 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) fell 0.25 percent. (N)
""The more significant emerging-market concern relates to the risk that regional underperformance becomes a source of disruption through swings in capital flows and currencies,"" said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual.
""While the focus at present is on Turkey, where currency depreciation and rising rates has translated into a marked tightening of financial conditions, it could spread to Mexico, Brazil and India.""
Sherwood cited the NAFTA negotiations as a key risk for Mexico and upcoming elections in Brazil and India as potential threats for those two markets.
GOLD LOSES ITS LUSTER
Bond yields in Spain and Italy fell, although the euro was still struggling at $1.1407 (EUR=D3), having touched its lowest since July 2017 on Monday.
It also reached one-year lows against the yen and Swiss franc, safe harbors in times of stress.
The dollar was a touch firmer at 110.95 yen , having hit a six-week trough around 110.10 on Monday. Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. currency (DXY) rose to 96.289 in European trading.
In commodity markets, gold slid to its lowest since late January 2017. It was at $1,1195 an ounce .
U.S. government data last week showed that gold speculators had lifted their bearish bets to a record.
Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York's SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) GLD (NYSE:GLD), have dropped about 10 percent from their April peak and are at their lowest since February 2016. 
Oil prices rose after a report from OPEC confirmed that top exporter Saudi Arabia had cut production to avert looming oversupply. [O/R] 

Brent gained 60 cents to $73.22 a barrel (LCc1). U.S. crude added 64 cents to $67.85 (CLc1).

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares bounced back on Tuesday after two days of heavy selling as investors' anxieties over contagion from a Turkish currency crisis faded slightly, thanks to reassurances from the central bank and government. 
The Turkish lira  firmed after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said he would hold a conference call with investors on Thursday, his first since assuming the post almost two months ago. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark rose 0.3 percent, initially supported by bank stocks (SX7E) which then gave up their gains after Turkey's Erdogan threatened to boycott U.S. electronic products and said it is important to keep a ""firm political stance"".
Banks had been the worst hit by concerns over Turkey, taking the index to a 21-month low, but investors were becoming more optimistic that banks' Turkey exposure was manageable.
""There are only a couple of European banks with some exposure to Turkey, so the overall bank sell-off yesterday seemed a bit overdone,"" said Jauke de Jong, equities analyst at AFS Group. 
Unicredit (MI:CRDI), BBVA (MC:BBVA),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), and ING had been hardest hit due to their Turkey exposure. Euro zone banks (SX7E) were down 0.1 percent by 0854 GMT.
Investors' focus once again turned to results.
 Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) shares fell 5.8 percent, the worst performer, after the Chilean copper producer reported first-half earnings fell due to weaker ore quality and higher costs, and said trade tensions were likely to hurt demand.
German utility RWE (DE:RWEG) rose 2.2 percent after it said its Innogy deal was on track and reported in-line first half profits.
""Numbers were ahead of the street thanks to a solid performance by trading, which – following a negative 1Q EBITDA – posted €125 mn during the second quarter,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.
Swiss dental implant maker Straumann (S:STMN) was a top gainer after results, up 3.4 percent after it raised its full-year revenue target as organic sales growth exceeded 20 percent for the first time in 10 years.
""Whilst we believe the growth guidance upgrade was expected, 18 percent organic growth in the first half is already tracking well ahead of new guidance,"" said UBS analysts.
K&S (DE:SDFGn) shares fell 4 percent after the potash miner reduced the profit outlook for its Salt business.
Broker research also drove some sharp stock moves. 
Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) shares fell 3.7 percent after Citi downgraded the stock to ""neutral"", saying the stock is now trading close to fair value and there is limited scope to raise estimates. 
Shares in German industrial equipment manufacturer  Duerr  (DE:DUEG) rose 4.1 percent with traders saying local broker M.M. Warburg upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"".
A boost to ""overweight"" from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) sent  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) shares up 2.6 percent. 
Overall companies in the MSCI Europe index have delivered year-on-year earnings growth of 11.9 percent in the second quarter, helping support the market.

""The resilient global activity combined with weaker euro and sterling should support earnings further into year-end, despite the challenging EM backdrop and tariffs threat,"" said Barclays analysts.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",Japan's Don Quijote rides high on rule-breaking reputation,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd (T:7532) was once the industry's enfant terrible, overturning standard retail practices with its cluttered and chaotic stores that sell everything from faux leopard-skin rugs to designer watches.
These days, however, Donki - as it popularly known - is more of a role model, defying Japan's weak retail environment to last week report its 29th year of unbroken sales and profit growth.
With sales projected to hit 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) this year, Donki is joining the top ranks of Japan's heavyweight retail market, among the likes of Aeon Co Ltd (T:8267), Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co Ltd (T:9983) and convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382). (Click here for an interactive graphic on the trillion-yen club https://tmsnrt.rs/2nlHCUl)
The company says its success lies in its ability to amuse customers, who have tired of the efficient yet predictable shopping experiences at other Japanese stores.
""Our biggest rival is not Amazon or Aeon, but customers' losing interest,"" Mitsuo Takahashi, Don Quijote's chief financial officer, told Reuters in an interview.
After struggling to find sites in some areas to fuel its sustained expansion, Donki has tied up with FamilyMart Uny Holdings Co Ltd (T:8028) to convert its struggling big box stores, delivering a rapid turnaround at the first six outlets to try the new format.
And on Monday the discounter said it would be interested in buying Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Seiyu supermarket unit, reflecting its increasingly ubiquitous presence on Japan's shopping streets, where it has replaced stores struggling in the new economy.
As Amazon (O:AMZN) grows rapidly in Japan, Donki aims to increase the fun of visiting stores by making its app more interactive - with points to collect and discounts to find - in a doubling down on its store-focused approach. 
""If Amazon is like downloading music, we are like a concert venue. Both are needed,"" Donki Chief Executive Koji Ohara said on Monday. 
THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
Shoppers at Donki are welcomed by tanks of exotic fish before they enter a maze-like warren piled high with goods ranging from face-massaging gadgets to oversized bags of potato chips.
What feels like a pell-mell approach is actually a finely honed company strategy, the result of decades of experimentation in each store. 
First-time customers often come away bewildered and humming the store's unending earworm of a theme song, but return for more, drawn back by a constantly changing array of goods. (Click here for an interactive graphic on Donki's irresistible rise https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfGeOo) 
Many of the products Donki sells are cast off from other retailers, a result of the Japanese penchant for a huge variety of seasonal, limited edition and experimental products, from cans of beer splashed with cherry blossom patterns to yogurt-flavored water.
Stocking decisions are left to store staff, and financial incentives help motivate them to source and display wares effectively. The approach is a far cry from how head offices micromanage the operations of many large Japanese retailers.
With every store catering to local tastes, ""you cannot create a strategy that will be effective against all of their stores,"" Jefferies analyst Michael Jon Allen said of Donki's rivals.

RIDING FORTH
Donki also has a growing range of store formats, including smaller Picasso stores, giant Mega Don Quijote and even a Platinum Don Quijote selling high-end products. 
Looking to expand but faced with a shortage of suitable suburban locations, Donki last year took a 40 percent stake in the merchandise store unit of FamilyMart Uny Holdings.
It's an unlikely marriage of disparate corporate cultures. But so far it seems successful: the companies' first six Donki-style stores have almost doubled sales in the five months to July, with a further 20 stores to be converted in 2019. 
That is helping push Donki toward its target of 500 stores by 2020, from 420 stores currently. Uny has almost 200 locations. 
The purchase of part or all of Walmart's Seiyu chain would mark a dramatic acceleration of that expansion. Walmart says it has not made a decision to sell Seiyu.

DON DON DONKI
Donki's newest frontier is overseas, with two ""Don Don Donki"" stores opened in Singapore in the last year and another due to open in Bangkok this year. 
Founder Takao Yasuda, who moved to Singapore after retiring three years ago, drove the expansion there after finding Japanese products too costly. Prices are as much as 50 percent lower than rivals, said Takahashi, the CFO. 
The Singapore stores are stocked mainly with food and drink, leveraging Japan's culinary reputation. Donki's ""yaki-imo"" or baked sweet potato is its best-selling product.
Singapore-based Euromonitor analyst Chayadi Karim said Don Quijote has tweaked its strategy in Singapore, where shoppers are unburdened by a deflationary mindset and ""are willing to pay that premium for Japanese products."" 
Southeast Asian expansion, with several new stores opening annually, along with 28 outlets in Hawaii and California, are building Donki's food retailing expertise. 
Concerns about overly rapid expansion weighed on the company's shares this year, and like all Japanese retailers, it faces headwinds from the country's aging population and growing affection for online retailers.
But for now, its ability to make money seems to be resilient.
In the most recent quarter Donki's gross margin - a key measure of profitability - climbed 0.4 percent on a year earlier to 26.6 percent.

Analysts consider the percentage of stocks trading above or below 200-day moving average as an indicator of strength or weakness of the underlying market.
China has the worst ratio, with 88 percent of its companies trading below the 200-day moving average, followed by the Philippines and Singapore.
On the other hand, India and Malaysia are in an uptrend, with more than half of their companies trading above the 200-day moving average. 
Another signal that analysts look to confirm a bear market is whether stocks have declined 20 percent from their year-highs. 
China again leads the pack, with a slump of 21 percent from this year's peak of 3,523 in early January, followed by Hong Kong and the Philippines.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn posted second-quarter net profit well below expectations as a rise in component costs and unsold inventory weighed on the performance of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier and world's top contract electronics maker, analysts said.
The company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, reported net profit of T$17.49 billion ($567.25 million) late on Monday, 20 percent short of analyst expectations and slightly below the year-earlier results. Foxconn shares fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday.
Analysts said the results reflected concerns about a loss of momentum in global smartphone sales. Last week, Foxconn unit FIH Mobile Ltd posted a wider first-half loss and acknowledged that it faced a high risk of saturation in the smartphone market.
Foxconn's results showed that its gross margin narrowed in the second-quarter in part owing to the cost of carrying unsold inventory of the iPhone X. Overall global smartphone shipments fell 3 percent to 350 million units in the April-June quarter compared with a year earlier, market research firm Strategy Analytics says.
However, Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Research, predicted a brighter outlook projected by Apple would benefit Foxconn and boost its margins in the third quarter.
Apple has forecast above-consensus revenue for later in the year, when it typically launches new iPhone models. Reports suggest these models will use OLED screens, which can display colors more vividly.
""We expect Hon Hai to be the main assembler of OLED version new iPhones and we believe the OLED iPhone model will see better demand in 2H18F,"" Chen said in a research note.
The company's report also illustrates its moves to diversify by pushing into new areas such as display screens - it bought Sharp Corp in 2016 - autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research.
Still, Foxconn earns most of its profits from manufacturing smartphones for Apple and other brands and from Foxconn Industrial Internet, a unit that makes networking equipment and smartphone casings, among other things.
""Investment in factory automation and component price hikes capped gross margin,"" said Fubon Research analyst Arthur Liao. 
Foxconn's operating costs jumped 18.8 percent in the quarter.
Liao noted that Foxconn absorbed some expenses this quarter related to Sharp's planned acquisition of Toshiba's PC business, as well as development costs from setting up a factory in the United States, and taking Foxconn Industrial public in June.

(This version of the story corrects paragraph 8 to show Foxconn acquired Sharp in 2016 (not this year), and clarifies in last paragraph expenses relate to Sharp's acquisition of Toshiba PC unit.)

China data were also in focus as the country’s industrial data grew slower than expected. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component were both down 0.7% by 1:30AM ET (05:30 GMT) after data on Tuesday showed industrial output, retails and fixed-asset investments all missed estimates. 
Industrial output grew 6% in July from a year earlier, according to official data, while analysts had expected the output to grow at 6.3%. 
Fixed-asset investment growth on the other hand also slowed more than expected to 5.5% in the first seven months of the year. 
Private sector investment, which accounted for about 60% of overall investment in China, rose 8.8% in the period of January to July, compared with an increase of 8.4% in the first half year. 
Retail sales rose 8.8% in July from a year earlier, compared to the expected 9.1% and down from 9% in June. 
Analysts believe an escalating trade dispute with the U.S. and recent tightening policies are likely to impact the outlook of China’s economy and that it may be at risk of a sharper slowdown than expected. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 0.6%. Shares of China Yuhua Education Corp Ltd (HK:6169) plunged 37% on Monday, while other mainland education companies also tumbled as Beijing began seeking consultation over banning the expansion of education corporations, South China Morning Post reported on Monday. 
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 outperformed its regional peers and traded 1.9% higher as the yen gave up some of its recent gains amid safe haven demand on uncertainty in Turkey. 
Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Co Ltd (TW:2354) received some focus after reporting worse-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Net profit came in at 14.49 billion Taiwan dollars, according to a statement, compared to an average estimate of T$21.94 billion. 
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI edged 0.4% higher as  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) retreated 3.4%. Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7%. 
Turkey’s lira took center stage again on Tuesday after the currency pared some of its recent losses after the Turkish central bank moved to calm market nerves. The currency slumped over 20% in four trading days. 
""The efforts announced by the Turkish central bank to stabilize the TRY (Turkish lira) appear to have assisted.

The driving ban comes after 27 engines went up in flames between January and July, which prompted BMW's Korea unit to apologize last week and a recall of 106,000 diesel vehicles including the 520d from Aug. 20.
Amid public concerns over safety the government order will affect about 20,000 BMW cars that are part of the recall but yet to receive safety checks, according to the transport ministry. 
""I am asking owners of the BMW cars subject to the recall to actively cooperate to prevent bigger accidents, despite your inconvenience,"" Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee told a press conference. 
Those who own the affected vehicles, however, can drive for safety checks, the ministry said, adding that the ban is intended for quicker safety checks rather than punitive action against the owners.
Officials at the German automaker identified the root cause as defects in the exhaust gas recirculation system, while the South Korean government is conducting a separate probe into the case and planning to take legal action if necessary.
The order would be effective as soon as owners of the affected cars receive a mail notice, as early as Aug. 15, the transport minister said. 
BMW, which trails only Mercedes in imported car sales in South Korea, saw sales more than double to 59,624 vehicles last year, from five years ago.

South Korea is a relatively small market, ranking eleventh in global auto sales, but is a major market for lucrative, premium vehicles and is currently dominated by  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270).

586,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Brazil's farmers dump sugar for soy as trade war boosts Chinese demand,"By Marcelo Teixeira
ITAÍ, Brazil (Reuters) - Last year, Brazilian farmer Gustavo Lopes sized up his sugarcane plantation against his soybean fields.
He looked at global trends, including rising U.S.-China trade tensions and a stubborn sugar-market glut. Then he tore up the last of his cane fields and ditched a decades-old supply contract with a local sugar mill.
Lopes planted soybeans across his 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) farm in Sao Paulo state - a bet that paid off earlier this month when Chinese buyers loaded up on South American soy after Beijing imposed tariffs on U.S. beans. The farmer got his highest price ever for soybeans.
""It was unusual for this time of year,"" Lopes said in an interview at his farm, where he's prepping to plant another soy crop in September. ""It's got to be a result of Chinese demand.""
Shifting trade flows are redefining the Brazilian landscape, spurring more farmers to align their crops with Chinese appetites. The nation's soy plantings have expanded by 2 million hectares in two years - an area the size of New Jersey - while land used for cane shrank by nearly 400,000 hectares, according to government data.
China's growing demand for meat has supercharged soy imports for animal feed. The Asian nation paid $20.3 billion last year for 53.8 million tonnes of soybeans from Brazil, nearly half its output — and up from 22.8 million tonnes in 2012.
A new 25 percent Chinese tariff on U.S. soybeans - a retaliation for U.S. levies by President Donald Trump - is expected to boost Brazil's soy exports to an all-time record this year.
Brazilian soybean exports to China rose to nearly 36 million tonnes in the first half of 2018, up 6 percent from a year ago. In July, they surged 46 percent from the same month a year earlier to 10.2 million tonnes.
Brazil's grains boom has it rivaling United States as the world's top soy producer this year, after outpacing U.S. exports over the past five years.
All that soy is eating into Brazil's sugarcane belt, which is reeling from sugar prices near multi-year lows. Chinese sugar tariffs have weighed on the global market for the sweetener as developed nations continue to cut back consumption.
""We lost 3,000 hectares of cane area to grains in the last two years,"" said Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, chief executive of Nova América, one of the largest cane growers in Brazil, managing 110,000 hectares.
Rezende said he had seen farmers migrating from sugarcane into grains in nearly every state where both crops are viable.
SHUTTERED SUGAR MILLS
The crop swap is catching on quickly with farmers, threatening the survival of cane mills they once supplied.
About 60 cane mills have closed in the past five years in Brazil's center-south cane region. About 270 that remain open must fight harder than ever to secure cane supplies.
Agroconsult, an agribusiness consultancy, said it has received requests from mills to calculate the premium they will have to pay producers to keep them from switching to grains.
Douglas Duarte, a director at the Londra mill in Itaí - which used to lease part of the Lopes farm - said he has plans to add 500,000 tonnes of capacity at the mill but has yet to line up enough cane supplies. 
With so many farmers focused on grain, Duarte has worked to sign leases with families who are not interested in actively managing their land.
""In places where the owners have expertise with grains — the equipment and everything — then you can't compete,"" he said.
In some places, the closing of cane mills has also discouraged planting. 
Farmer Antonio de Morais Ribeiro Neto gave up planting cane last year after the closure of the sugar mill that he supplied, called Usina Maracaju. Biosev SA (SA:BSEV3), the Brazilian sugar arm of global commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co, shut it down in a cost-cutting move.
So Riberio replaced 400 hectares of cane with soybeans, adding to the 2,000 hectares of soy he already had planted. As he watched the U.S.-China trade war escalate, he bought two new grain silos, more soybean-planting machinery and a new harvester.
'BETTING BIG'
Plenty of sugar mills, which often grow part of the cane they process, have realized they cannot fight the soy boom and decided to plant their own soybeans as part of a crop rotation strategy.
Cane fields typically need to be replanted after five or six years, and mills are using the renovation window to produce soybeans.
""In the past, those areas subject to renovation would be left fallow until the following year,"" said Victor Campanelli, who has exploited the niche.
His firm, Agro Pastoril Paschoal Campanelli, manages the planning, inputs and equipment for sugar mills' one-off soy crops, sharing in the profits.
While the grains bonanza has many farmers flush with cash, some are wary about relying so much on one crop and one massive importer. 
""This Chinese demand has attracted all the farmers,"" said Marcos Cesar Brunozzi, who switched part of his land from sugar to grains in the state of Minas Gerais. ""I hope the whole situation doesn't change suddenly, because we are betting big."" 
Lopes has no regrets about tearing up his cane fields.
Last year, his sugarcane yielded a net profit of 480 reais per hectare - compared to 2,600 reais per hectare for his soy fields.

""I know it won't always be that way,"" he said. ""But still, it's a huge difference.""

FORT DRUM, N.Y. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a $716 billion defense policy bill on Monday that authorizes military spending and includes watered-down controls on U.S. government contracts with China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
Trump signed the law at the U.S. Army's Fort Drum base in upstate New York on his way back to Washington after a 12-day working vacation at his golf club in New Jersey. The bill was named for one of Trump's political critics, the ailing U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, but he did not mention McCain's name.
McCain said in a statement he was ""humbled"" the bill was named after him, adding that it will address ""a growing array of threats.""
Trump later made a reference to McCain at a political fundraiser in Utica, New York, knocking him - as Trump does repeatedly - for voting against a bill to repeal parts of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform law last year.
Even though Trump said the bill ""is the most significant investment in our military and our war-fighters in modern history,"" Obama's first three defense budgets were larger, when adjusted for inflation, according to Todd Harrison at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
WEAK ON CHINA
Some lawmakers wanted to use the bill to reinstate tough sanctions on ZTE to punish the company for illegally shipping products to Iran and North Korea, but the restrictions included in the final National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, that passed Congress were weaker than earlier versions of the bill.
Trump has lifted an earlier ban on U.S. companies selling to ZTE, allowing China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business and putting him at odds with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
Leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies have said they are concerned that ZTE, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and some other Chinese companies are beholden to the Chinese government or Communist Party, raising the risk of espionage.
In response to the bill, Huawei said in a statement to Reuters, ""Huawei supports the US government's goals for better security, but this random addition to the NDAA is ineffective, misguided, and unconstitutional.""
""It does nothing to identify real security risks or improve supply chain security, and will only serve to stifle innovation while increasing internet costs for US consumers and businesses,"" Huawei said. 
The White House opposed putting stronger measures against the companies in the bill, and the measures were softened before lawmakers held their final vote.
The NDAA does strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews proposed foreign investments to weigh whether they threaten national security. That measure was seen as targeting China.
Separately, the NDAA authorizes spending $7.6 billion for 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets, made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). 
The bill also directs the Secretary of Defense to study whether Turkey's planned deployment of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system will risk the security of several U.S.-made weapons used by Turkey, including the F-35 jet. The mandate to produce a study came after an earlier version proposed to bar the delivery of F-35s to Turkey. 

Prior to the ceremony Trump watched an air assault demonstration by U.S. troops at Fort Drum.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 outperformed its regional peers and traded 1.4% higher by 9:41PM ET (01:41 GMT), as the yen gave up some of its recent gains amid safe haven demand on uncertainty in Turkey.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component both slipped 0.4%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 0.6%.
Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Co Ltd (TW:2354) received some focus after reporting worse-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Net profit came in at 14.49 billion Taiwan dollars, according to a statement, compared to an average estimate of T$21.94 billion.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI edged 0.1% higher as  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) retreated 3.4%. Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7%.
Turkey’s lira took center stage again on Tuesday after the currency pared some of its recent losses after the Turkish central bank moved to calm market nerves. The currency slumped over 20% in four trading days.
""The efforts announced by the Turkish central bank to stabilize the TRY (Turkish lira) appear to have assisted. The TRY has not endured further depreciation in overnight trade, but it has not substantially declined either,"" Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a morning note.
Some analysts believed while the uncertainty in Turkey may continue, its correlation to the rest of the asset class may decline soon.
“It’s a large local difficulty, but so far the contagion has been relatively limited,” Ray Attrill, head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd, told Bloomberg in an interview on Tuesday. “We’re seeing a little bit of signs of contagion within the euro zone, within the spreads of those government bonds in countries where the banking sector appears to have the biggest exposure as far as Turkey is concerned. You’d have to say that Turkey is relatively contained.”
Looking ahead, China is due to release industrial production, fixed-asset investment and retail sales data later in the morning."

Icahn's comments come after proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS), as well as hedge fund Glenview Capital Management, extended their support for the deal.
""In light of the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations in favor of the Cigna/Express Scripts transaction and the significant stockholder overlap between the two companies, we have informed the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) that we no longer intend to solicit proxies to vote against the transaction,"" Icahn said in a statement.
The billionaire investor, who has a long position on Cigna and a short position on Express Scripts, has been vocal in his criticism of the deal and last week said Cigna (N:CI) was overpaying for Express Scripts (O:ESRX).
At the time, he urged Cigna's shareholders to rally against the deal at a vote scheduled for Aug. 24, citing regulatory hurdles and the growing threat from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The proposed deal between Cigna and Express Scripts, announced in March, was outlined as a new way for the companies to hold onto profits as the U.S. healthcare industry faces greater scrutiny for rising costs.

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Emerging Markets Contagion? Maybe. Crisis? No.,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Emerging-market equities and currencies as measured by MSCI indexes both fell on Monday to their lowest levels since July 2017, and everyone wants to know whether the turmoil in Turkey will morph into some sort of global contagion that takes down financial markets. If you think of contagion as some sort of event that causes a broad repricing of financial assets, then, yes, contagion is a possibility. But a full-blown crisis? It’s too early to say, judging by the markets. 
Besides Turkey, plenty of sizable markets are under severe pressure: South Africa, Russia, India, Brazil and even China could be included in that group. The MSCI EM Index of equities is down 18.2 percent from its peak on Jan. 26, while its sister currency gauge has dropped 8.14 percent since early April. What often gets lost in the discussion about emerging markets is that while it’s true they probably borrowed too much as major central banks slashed interest rates to zero after the financial crisis, their economies are in pretty good shape. Foreign-exchange reserves for the 12 largest EM economies excluding China stand at $3.15 trillion, rising from less than $2 trillion in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Outside of China and Turkey, current-account deficits have turned into surpluses since 2016 despite tighter funding conditions because of higher U.S. interest rates, according to Bloomberg News’s Netty Ismail and Filipe Pacheco. “There aren’t really any other emerging markets that have exactly the same toxic blend that Turkey has,” Paul McNamara, a London-based fund manager at GAM UK Ltd., told Bloomberg Television. “Only Argentina really has the external deficit, and they don’t have as much domestic debt.”
Some traditional measures of market stresses would seem to back up McNamara’s assertion. The so-called Ted Spread, or difference between the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate for dollars and similar maturity Treasury bills, has dropped to 0.28 percentage point from 0.64 point in April. The difference between Libor and overnight index swap rates has dropped by a similar amount as well. And finally, despite the worry about the exposure of banks to Turkey and a drop in their share prices, a measure of expected short-term bank funding costs has dropped to its lowest since February.
ITALY IS WORTH WORRYING ABOUTIf you’re looking for a market to worry about, check out Italy. Its bonds tumbled in May when a new populist government raised doubts about the country’s continuing membership in the European Union. The rhetoric died down for a while as officials signaled that they were willing to play nice with the rest of the EU. But now the nation’s bonds are back on the decline, with yields on Italian 10-year notes rising on Monday to 2.77 percentage points above those on similar maturity German bunds, the widest gap since the May concerns. With $2.5 trillion in government debt, Italy is tied with France as the world’s fourth-most indebted nation after the U.S., China and Japan. So why aren’t the broader measures of market stresses also panicking about Italy? The answer is probably because central banks — especially the European Central Bank — have proved time and again that they are willing to step in and provide as much money as it takes to prevent another financial crisis. Investors know that’s something Claudio Borghi, the head of the budget committee in Italy’s lower house, probably realizes. He said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday that the ECB should keep providing a shield to the government securities of all monetary union members to avoid a dismantlement of the entire euro system. “There cannot be a system at the mercy of market movements,” Borghi said.
GOLD LOSES ITS LUSTERSurely gold, a traditional market haven, is seeing demand, right? Wrong. The price of the precious metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce on Monday for the first time in 18 months. As recently as April, the price of gold was above $1,350 an ounce. Investors and strategists like to tie gold’s weakness to the strength of the dollar. That is because gold is traded in greenbacks and any increase in the currency’s value makes buying gold that much more expensive. There’s certainly some truth to that, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rising on Monday to its highest level since June 2017. But more is going on to suggest that gold’s decline is far from over. For the first time in more than a decade, gold has some strong competition from cash for the attention of haven-seeking investors. Three-month Treasury bill rates are above 2 percent for the first time since mid-2008. They were about 1 percent less than a year ago and virtually zero from 2009 through 2015. Those higher rates are drawing international investors to the dollar, helping to boost the greenback. Money managers are making a big bet that gold prices will continue to decline. In the week ended Aug. 7, money managers expanded their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, by 54 percent to 63,282 futures and options, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, according to Bloomberg News’s Joe Deaux. That’s the biggest bearish bet since the data began in 2006.
THE YEN'S A WORLDBEATEROne traditional measure of market concern is acting appropriately. The yen, which gained on Monday, is the only one of 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg to appreciate against the dollar this month, rising just more than 1 percent. A Bloomberg Correlated-Weighted Index of the yen against its developed-market peers puts the currency at its strongest level since April 2017. Japan’s healthy current-account surplus means it’s one of the few major economies that isn’t depending on outside capital to fund itself. Also, many investors take out low-cost loans in yen and use the money to invest elsewhere in the world where rates are much higher. In times of “risk off” environment, like now, investors typically reverse those bets, creating demand for yen so they can pay off the loans. This strength in the yen is largely unwelcome in Japan, which desires a weaker currency to boost exports in an economy only forecast to expand about 1 percent this year. As such, yen strength was a main reason the benchmark Topix index of equities tumbled as much as 2.23 percent Monday, the most since March. The Topix has dropped 7.4 percent in 2018 for the worst performance among developed equity markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Topix trades at 13 times estimated earnings, the lowest level since July 2016. The S&P 500 Index in the U.S. is valued at 17.6 times expected profits.
STOCK PREMIUMS RETHOUGHTU.S. stocks haven’t sidestepped the sell-off in global equities, with the S&P 500 Index falling on Monday for the fourth consecutive day. That’s the longest slump since March. Although at 1.28 percent, the declines over the last four trading days are much less than the 2.98 percent drop in the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S., the weakness may indicate that investors are questioning how much they’re willing to pay to be in U.S. equities. The S&P 500’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 17.5 compares with about 13.3 for the MSCI index excluding the U.S. Such a heady premium for U.S. equities is largely predicated on the recent strength in America’s economy continuing, but the U.S. government isn’t even sure that will be the case. The Congressional Budget Office slightly lowered its forecast for U.S. economic growth for this year and warned of increasing uncertainty from the Trump administration’s plans to widen tariffs. The U.S. economy is projected to expand 3.1 percent this year, down from a previous forecast in April of 3.3 percent, the nonpartisan group said in a report on Monday. The expansion will ease to 2.4 percent in 2019, unchanged from April’s projection, on slowing growth in business investment and government purchases, the CBO said.
TEA LEAVESIt’s a big week for economic data in China, and the first round of reports weren’t so great. China’s broadest measure of new credit slowed, underlining concerns about the economy that have prompted authorities to start doing more to support growth, according to Bloomberg News. Next up on Tuesday is industrial production, with the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg calling for a tick up to 6.3 percent annual growth for July from 6 percent in June after robust exports. Also, retail sales are seen increasing 9.1 percent, after a 9 percent jump in June. Chief Economist Tom Orlik wrote in a Saturday note that the view of Bloomberg Economics is that with headwinds to expansion blowing from home and abroad, a tilt toward pro-growth policies carries more pluses than minuses.

While some investors say bargains are already emerging, others bet the best option is to sell stocks and bonds and put their money into cash.

(Reuters) - Elon Musk on Monday explained what he meant by tweeting ""funding secured"" to take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc private: he is confident a deal can be done but has not yet finalized a plan. 
What exactly Musk had intended by saying “secured” has emerged as a potential legal and regulatory minefield for the Silicon Valley billionaire after his unorthodox disclosure on Twitter last Tuesday that he was looking into taking Tesla out of the public markets for $420 a share. 
Since then, no investors have stepped forward publicly as being involved, and Musk now faces investor lawsuits claiming securities fraud and a reported SEC probe into the tweets.
The chief executive of the electric car company said on Monday that the manager of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had voiced support for the company going private several times, including as recently as two weeks ago, but also said that talks continue with the fund and other investors.
Musk said he is also working on figuring out what share of investors will likely roll their stake into a new private company, and by extension exactly how much capital he needs to buy remaining investors out.
Tesla shares rose 0.26 percent to $356.41. They had closed at $376.57 on Tuesday after jumping 11 percent on Musk's announcement.
The company declined to comment beyond Musk's blog post. 
""I left the July 31st meeting (with the Saudi fund) with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,"" Musk said.
""This is why I referred to 'funding secured' in the August 7th announcement.""
The Saudi fund over nearly two years had approached him repeatedly about taking the company private, Musk said, and the latest meeting came after it took a nearly 5 percent stake in Tesla.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) manages more than $230 billion in assets, but about 65 percent of that is stakes in large Saudi companies and most of the rest has been committed in overseas deals such as funding commitments to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group's U.S. infrastructure fund or SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund.
The Saudi fund intends to sell its $70 billion stake in Saudi Basic Industries to oil giant Aramco, which could free up funds for new deals, but that sale may take months to conclude.
Yasir Othman al-Rumayyan, managing director of the PIF, referred Reuters to the corporate communications team, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
FUNDING QUANDARY 
Musk said that since his Twitter post on the possibility of a deal the managing director of the Saudi fund had expressed support for proceeding subject to financial and other due diligence. 
PIF officials have said in the past that decisions at the sovereign wealth fund are made with care, emphasizing corporate governance. The PIF board is headed by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Musk on Monday said he was talking to other potential investors but did not provide any details on the exact source of funding. He also said he was still trying to gauge how many existing shareholders would keep their stake in a new private company. 
Meanwhile, Musk faces scrutiny of his tweet on secured funding.
Securities lawyers said U.S. law requires executives and companies to have a “reasonable basis” on which to make statements, meaning the fact Musk said he believed he had secured a verbal agreement for the funding after the July 31 meeting could put him on a firmer footing with the SEC. 
It remains unclear if his definition of ""secured"" matches those of a reasonable shareholder, who may believe the statement indicated Musk had a written agreement, they said. 
“This supports the idea that there was reasonable basis on which to believe that funding could be secured but it doesn’t eliminate the concern with respect to whether ‘secured’ was an overstatement and only underscores how inappropriate Twitter was for such a disclosure,” said Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and principal at law firm Blakemore Fallon.
Wall Street had voiced doubts about Musk's ability to pull off what could be the largest-ever go-private transaction, valued at as much as $72 billion.
Musk on Monday estimated two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, but said that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for the deal. 
Musk added that most capital for the deal would come from equity and it would not be ""wise"" to burden the company with added debt. Discussing full details on the plan, including the source and nature of the funding, would be ""premature"" now, he said.
A major investment from Saudi Arabia would likely trigger a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns.
Jeremy Zucker, co-head of Dechert’s International Trade practice, said two key determinations would be made if a deal moved forward: whether Tesla contained critical technologies and whether the involvement of Saudi financing was a national security issue. 

The multi-agency oversight operation could also determine whether the investment gave the Saudi’s access to critical technology.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Keeping Tesla shares may not be an option for some big funds,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Elon Musk wants to take Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) private, but some of his big investors may not be able to follow.
Most passive funds would have to drop Tesla if it were removed from stock indexes, experts said on Monday. 
Actively-managed funds might need complicated approvals to hold a stake in the company, no matter how much of a mark Musk has made to date as founder and chief executive of the electric carmaker.
""Our inclination is that if we could go private with him, we would, but it's complicated,"" said one large Tesla investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""We would have to call clients and ask for approval, but it's complicated. And I think it's complicated for many funds,” the person said.
The uncertainty over how many investors could hold private shares, and would want to, would be a challenge for Musk because the final tally would dictate how much capital he would need to raise to buy out those who would sell the stock.
Musk blogged on Monday he was reaching out to top investors to see ""whether they had the ability and desire to remain shareholders in a private Tesla.""
One pool that would likely not be Musk's allies in the effort are big passive vehicles like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (O:VSMPX). 
The fund held about 2 percent of Tesla's shares at June 30. The fund's holdings are based on an index tracking shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, according to its prospectus.
Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann declined to comment on Tesla but said by email, ""As private companies are not included in indexes, any shares held in an index fund when a company goes private would likely be sold/tendered.""
A factor that could work in Musk's favor is that more of his top fund investors are active stockpickers. Active funds would generally have more leeway to continue to own Tesla after a go-private transaction.
According to researcher Morningstar, 19 percent of Tesla's fund ownership rests in passive portfolios, compared with 28 percent at General Motors Co (N:GM) and 56 percent at  Ford Motor Co . (N:F)
Tesla's largest active fund investors include some that have held private companies such as Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund. (O:FBGKX) At June 29 it held securities of private companies like Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc according to a disclosure. A Fidelity spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Private shares can be illiquid and hard to price, raising concerns of whether they are appropriate for public portfolios.
David Barclay, chief operating officer of the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, said he knew of no case of a security remaining in an index fund after it went private.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) restructured its consumer bank on Monday, elevating one executive and triggering the departure of another, as the third-biggest U.S. bank moved to improve results.
The changes will ""harmonize"" Citigroup's consumer business with operating models of units in Asia and Mexico that have produced better results, Stephen Bird, chief executive of Citigroup's global consumer banking business, said in a memo seen by Reuters.
With the new structure, Jud Linville, who had been head of global cards and consumer services and a member of Citigroup's operating committee, will leave and David Chubak will become head of retail banking and consumer lending globally, overseeing products, strategies and investments.
Some of those responsibilities in cards had previously been handled by Linville.
Anand Selva, the current head of consumer banking in Asia, will become head the regional head for North America. Selva has been with Citigroup for 26 years, during which time he has overseen consumer business in 17 countries and advanced digital offerings, Bird said.
The moves come as Citigroup is trying to improve performance of its card business and reconnect with U.S. consumers, despite having few branches, through a new mobile app and partnerships with ATM providers.
Citi-branded cards in the United States are an area of particular concern to Wall Street.
Executives had targeted 3 percent annualized revenue growth from branded cards when the company set profit goals for 2020 at an Investor Day conference in July 2017. But early this year Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach reduced that goal to 2 percent.
""U.S. Cards has consistently missed our expectations, so we believe change could be a positive longer term,"" KBW analysts said in a report on Monday.
Citigroup expects to get a bump in branded-card income as promotions that offered customers little or no interest for a fixed time come to an end. Nearly half of those accounts have been converting to paying full rates, Gerspach has said.
Linville, 60, had been at Citigroup for eight years, and received credit for streamlining the company's roster of card offerings. But stiff competition for premium card customers from rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) have weighed on results.
He declined to comment on his departure.

Citigroup shares fell 1.6 percent to close at $69.16 on Monday.

Two bankers at ZKB, Stephan Fellmann and Christof Reist, also pleaded guilty on Monday to a single misdemeanor conspiracy charge, which carries a maximum prison sentence of one year. The two were originally indicted on a more serious felony charge in 2012.
""On behalf of Mr. Fellmann and Mr. Reist, we are grateful that the Department of Justice kept an open mind about this case and acted with fairness in dismissing the felony charges against our clients,"" Jim Walden, a lawyer for Fellmann, and Sean Casey, a lawyer for Reist, said in a joint statement. ""A misdemeanor offense was appropriate for the conduct of both individuals.""
Fellmann and Reist both admitted at the hearing that they provided services to American clients while they ""deliberately avoided learning"" that the clients were using their accounts to avoid paying U.S. taxes.
The case emerged from a U.S. crackdown on offshore tax evasion by wealthy Americans utilizing undeclared Swiss bank accounts. Fellmann, 53, and Reist, 60, came to the United States voluntarily to face the charges in 2016.
In a 2012 indictment, prosecutors said that from 2003 to 2009, more than 190 U.S. taxpayer clients of ZKB conspired to conceal accounts at the bank from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to evade taxes.
Prosecutors said that both men helped clients open and maintain undeclared accounts using codenames or in the names of sham entities and ensured that mail relating to the accounts was not sent to their American clients in the United States.

The U.S. crackdown has resulted in several recent settlements, including a $5 million deal last month with NPB Neue Bank.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Monday as global jitters from Turkey's plummeting currency spread to Wall Street, with the S&P 500 and the Dow falling for the fourth session in a row. 
Financial stocks bore the brunt of Turkey contagion fears, with shares of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) closing down between 0.8 percent and 2.2 percent.
A pledge by Turkey's central bank to stabilize the plummeting lira failed to calm investors' nerves. The currency has dropped 40 percent against the dollar so far this year.
""The market's all about Turkey and the continuation of the trade issues out there,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Funds in Dallas. ""The market definitely wants to go higher but we're having some curves thrown at us along the way that have caused a few day-to-day pull-backs."" 
But Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares hit an all-time high as the first U.S. listed company to reach $1 trillion in market value continued a post-earnings rally. The stock finished the day up 0.6 percent.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) also reached a record level, hitting $1,925 per share. The stock closed 0.5 percent higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,187.7, the S&P 500 lost 11.35 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,821.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.40 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,819.71.
The second-quarter earnings season is approaching the finish line. Of the 455 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 79 percent have beaten analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, rose for the third straight session to its highest in more than a month. 
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced the departure of Chief Financial Officer David Wells. The streaming service's shares fell 1.3 percent.
Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) slid by 4.3 percent after President Donald Trump tweeted support for a boycott against the company.
Rite Aid Corp fell to more than a five-year low, extending its losses after the retail drugstore chain ended its merger with Albertsons. The stock closed down 5.4 percent.
Among gainers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares edged up 0.3 percent. Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was in discussion with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers of his plan to take the electric carmaker private, but he said financing was not yet nailed down.
Nielsen Holdings jumped 12.1 percent after activist hedge fund Elliott Management disclosed it had taken a stake in the media and consumer research company.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 111 new lows.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",WPP to quit London headquarters in break with past after Sorrell departure,"LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) is set to move out of its central London headquarters after 30 years, in another break with the past following the departure in April of founder and CEO Martin Sorrell from the world's largest advertising company. 
A person familiar with the situation said the company would stop leasing the small mews property which, despite its location in Farm Street in the upscale district of Mayfair, is one of the more low-key headquarters for a FTSE 100 company.
Staff from the head office, who cover areas such as legal and finance, will move into Sea Containers, a large office on the south bank of the River Thames that is already home to some of WPP's agencies. 
That building may not be large enough for all the staff in the parent company however and the long-term ambition is for all staff to work together, the person said, indicating that that may be temporary. 
The move, taken by joint chief operating officers Mark Read and Andrew Scott, marks a fresh start for the group after Sorrell took on Farm Street and its warren of corridors and low ceiling offices in 1987 as part of his acquisition of JWT. 
Sorrell, one of Britain's most high-profile businessmen, quit the group in April after it said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct made against him. 
Sorrell denied subsequent reports he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when asked about his exit from WPP at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in June. 

The company is expecting to announce a new chief executive in early September, with Read seen as the leading candidate. Advertising title Campaign was the first to report the news. A spokesman for WPP declined to comment.

610,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Home Depot Offers Window into Housing
Dow component  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) will report earnings before the bell tomorrow, giving investors insight into the health of the housing market, as well as that of the company.
Wall Street is looking for fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.84 per share on sales of about $30 billion.
While the U.S. economy is humming along well, there is concern about headwinds in housing. New home sales fell sharply in June, and sales of existing homes were also down. Homebuilders are struggling with the rising cost of building materials and shortages of land and workers, which is limiting new construction.
Any weakness in the home improvement retailer’s numbers could exacerbate these worries.
Home Depot investors will likely be focused on online sales, as the company is yet another major retailer that has to fend off competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Online traffic grew 20% in the fiscal first quarter, the company said in its earnings call. About 46% of all online orders were picked up in store during that period.
2. Turkey Crisis Highlights Dollar Strength
Currency markets will be closely watched again tomorrow. The stock market is undecided, unsurprisingly, about how much impact a plunging Turkish economy and currency will really have on U.S. public companies. But investors will be keeping an eye on how much the dollar is rising across the board.
Increasing strength in the greenback could cause worries about the earnings of companies with lots of international business, which are already in the crosshairs due to trade battle concerns.
Today, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was around 96.40. And there is more room for further upside, according to Oppenheimer.
""The key action last week was the US dollar’s index breakout above 95 resistance, in our view. This breakout completed a year-long bottoming formation and confirmed a reversal of dollar index's 2017 downtrend, by our analysis. We see 98 as the dollar index's next likely stopping point,"" Oppenheimer said in a note to clients.
The wild card is whether President Donald Trump will turn tweets into actions in his preference for a weaker dollar to cut the trade deficit.



Last week, J.P. Morgan said it was not ruling out the possibility that the U.S. would sell dollars to reach its trade goals.
3. Import and Export Prices Lead Economic Calendar
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow, with the highlight being import and export prices.
The import price index is expected to have risen 0.1% in July, compared with June, and the export price index expected up 0.2%.
Year on year, import prices were expected to be up 4.6% and export prices up 4.2% for July.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.50%. The S&P 500 fell 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.25%.
The economic turmoil in Turkey continued, stoking fears about a spill over into emerging markets, which would hurt both global growth and sentiment for riskier assets like stocks.
The TRY/USD slumped more than 8% as investors were largely unimpressed by the Turkish central bank's efforts to stabilize the lira and restore confidence in the economy.
A row between the United States and Turkey deepened last week as the Trump administration doubled steel tariffs on Turkey and vowed to pile pressure on Ankara over the fate of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who faces terrorism charges in Turkey.
The reverberations of a plunging lira swept through the markets, hitting financials, mostly banks, which some fear are somewhat vulnerable to a collapse in Turkey's economy, despite analysts claiming the risk of contagion is limited.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) slumped, weighing on the major averages.
""There is little evidence yet of contagion,"" said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners. ""Anecdotally, it's worth pointing out that few clients seem particularly concerned about potential contagion emanating from Turkey.""
Weakness in energy stocks also weighed on the broader averages as oil prices extended declines from last week to settle lower on concerns about global oil-demand growth.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for September delivery fell 43 cents settle at $67.20 a barrel.
Tech stocks, meanwhile, struggled to extend gains from last week, despite a rise in shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) stock closed 2.5% higher after famed short seller Citron Research reversed its earlier negative call on the social media company and slapped a $52 price target on its shares, citing privacy concerns were in the ""rear view,"" and execution was seen on all fronts.
In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said his claim last week that the necessary funding had been secured was based on repeated and ongoing conversations with the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.
""Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,"" Musk said in a blog post published Monday.
Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock tumbled 4% after President Trump said in a tweet Sunday, it's ""great"" that consumers might boycott Harley-Davidson if it moves part of its production overseas.

616,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Elon Musk’s Funding for Tesla Wasn’t So Secure,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Traditionally, when the chief executive officer of a public company announces that he is planning to take the company private at $420 per share, and that he has secured funding for that offer, that means a couple of things. First of all, it means that he plans to make a firm offer to the board of the company to buy all of the shares that he doesn’t already own, for $420 per share in cash. Second, it means that he has enough money—or has agreements with someone who has enough money—to actually pay for those shares.
Last week Elon Musk tweeted “Am considering taking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private at $420. Funding secured.” He followed it up by tweeting more definitively that “Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Tesla Inc. has about 170.6 million shares outstanding, of which Musk owns about 33.7 million, meaning that he’d need about $57 billion to buy all the shares he doesn’t already own at $420 per share, plus perhaps another $10 billion to pay off bonds that come due on a change of control. And Musk’s tweets kicked off a week of speculation about where he had gotten the $60 or $70 billion he’d need for this deal.
Today he posted an “Update on Taking Tesla Private” – on Tesla’s blog, not on Twitter – that sort of answered the question: He didn’t have the funding! In two senses. First, he never had any firm commitments from anyone to give him the money. Instead he’s had some nice chats with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund:
Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private. They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to diversify away from oil. They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction. Obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed to execute on such a transaction.
Recently, after the Saudi fund bought almost 5% of Tesla stock through the public markets, they reached out to ask for another meeting. That meeting took place on July 31st. During the meeting, the Managing Director of the fund expressed regret that I had not moved forward previously on a going private transaction with them, and he strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction for Tesla at this time. I understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed.
I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving. 
How secure was the Saudi funding? So secure that preliminary non-binding abstract discussions of a hypothetical deal continue:
Following the August 7th announcement, I have continued to communicate with the Managing Director of the Saudi fund. He has expressed support for proceeding subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals. He has also asked for additional details on how the company would be taken private, including any required percentages and any regulatory requirements.
Also it’s a little funny that after peddling conspiracy theories about how fossil-fuel interests are sabotaging Tesla, Musk is looking to sell the company to Saudi Arabia. (To be fair, Musk is also “having discussions with a number of other investors, which is something that I always planned to do since I would like for Tesla to continue to have a broad investor base.”)
But there is another, subtler sense in which Musk hasn’t secured his funding. It’s not just that the Saudi PIF hasn’t signed a detailed binding termsheet committing it to put up the $70 billion that Musk would need to buy Tesla. It’s also that he doesn’t even want the $70 billion:
Reports that more than $70B would be needed to take Tesla private dramatically overstate the actual capital raise needed. The $420 buyout price would only be used for Tesla shareholders who do not remain with our company if it is private. My best estimate right now is that approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.
It seems that Musk’s offer to buy Tesla at $420 a share would be contingent on a large majority of shareholders turning it down. That is not how takeover offers usually work! Like, usually, if you offer to buy my shares for $420, and I agree to sell you my shares for $420, then you are happy and you give me the money and I give you the shares. Here, Musk’s offer to buy everyone’s shares for $420 seems to require most of the shareholders saying no. 
Where did that two-thirds estimate come from? Well, not from talking to the shareholders, at least not before Musk tweeted about “Funding secured” and “Investor support is confirmed.” Which is good, because having those conversations with those shareholders would have been super-illegal! As Musk recognizes, now, in his blog post, which I suspect more lawyers have seen than had seen those tweets:
The only way I could have meaningful discussions with our largest shareholders was to be completely forthcoming with them about my desire to take the company private. However, it wouldn’t be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time. 
Will a majority of Tesla shareholders approve of Musk’s “going-private” plan but turn down his offer of money, preferring to stay in the stock as it goes private? Well, I dunno, maybe. His shareholders do seem to be loyal. Certainly Musk’s super-fan retail shareholders would if they could, but it is still not at all obvious that Tesla will be able to turn itself into a private company that is still open to public retail shareholders. The basic structure of U.S. securities law is that companies can sell shares to the general public if and only if they comply with the requirements of being public companies. Musk doesn’t think that those laws should apply to him, but I am not sure that the regulators will agree. 
Meanwhile Tesla’s biggest institutional shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., both of which do a lot of index investing and might have trouble holding nearly as many shares in a private company. They also include T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, both of which do notably invest in private companies. But those private investments are at an entirely different scale from their public investments. Fidelity, for instance, owns about $180 million of stock in Uber Technologies Inc., another buzzy controversial company with a $60 billion-ish valuation that happens to be private. That’s less than one-twentieth of the $4 billion it has in Tesla. Its appetite for a private Tesla might be closer to its appetite for private Uber than for public Tesla.
So the funding is perhaps somewhat less than secured. But you can see where Musk was coming from. “Taking a company private” is a term of art, and it might not be obvious to everyone that it means buying out all of the company’s stock for cash. It might not be obvious how much funding you need to secure to say that you have “funding secured” to take an $80 billion company private, or how many contingencies you need to satisfy before you can say “Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Musk legitimately might not know these things, might not understand how the things he tweeted might be misleading. That wouldn’t even really reflect badly on him. He’s a smart guy who has a lot on his plate and who has not focused extensively on the nuances of securities law and corporate structuring. It was just some tweets.
But here is the thing. Other CEOs don’t always know this stuff either. They might muse vaguely about going private to their investment bankers or lawyers, who would explain the process and options to them. Or they might even muse about it to their boards, who would hire advisers and explore the possibility with them. 
But they wouldn’t muse about it in public. They have lawyers. They have corporate communications policies. They have structures in place to prevent their random whims from causing damage. Any disclosure about a potential transaction will be made in a carefully lawyered press release, published outside of market hours, that emphasizes that nothing has been finalized and that any deal is uncertain and will be contingent on funding and board approval and many other conditions. Responsible CEOs do these things in order to minimize the disruption to their shareholders, to allow them to be fully informed before they make any trading decisions. They don’t just tweet it casually in the middle of the trading day. 
But if you do decide to just tweet your every random thought without consulting anyone, then any errors are kind of on you. It is not really an excuse to say that you didn’t mean to mislead anyone, that you thought that what you were saying was right, that it made sense to you. Because every other public-company CEO cares about this stuff, and tries to avoid saying untrue material things in casual public communications. If you don’t care, if you are just reckless about your public announcements of material information, then you should expect that to eventually go wrong.
Here is the other thing about Musk’s plan to go private while keeping all the same shareholders. It makes no sense. Usually when a CEO wants to take his company private, it’s because he wants to change something. One thing that usually changes is leverage; a going-private transaction normally involves borrowing a lot of money to juice the equity returns of the company, something that is obviously not a consideration here. (“I do not think it would be wise to burden Tesla with significantly increased debt,” blogged Musk, correctly.)
But traditionally the main thing that changes is what is called, in the lingo, “the separation of ownership and control.” A public company is owned by a lot of diffuse semi-anonymous investors who do not have a concentrated interest in the success of the firm, and managed by a CEO who is effectively a hired employee of those shareholders. When it goes private, though, those shareholders are replaced by a few big shareholders. One is, typically, the CEO, who normally increases his ownership share in a going-private transaction, giving him a greater financial interest in the success of the company. (Again that is not applicable here; Musk already owns 21.9 percent of Tesla, has a huge financial interest in its success, and has said that he does not “envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.”) The others are, typically, the CEO’s private-equity backers, who take large equity positions, get board seats, and generally act like focused careful owners of the company. It is a shift in ownership structure, from the hands-off passive investors in the public markets to hands-on active private-equity investors, on the theory that the hands-on investors will do a better job of monitoring and incentivizing management and will make the company more profitable.
That is obviously not Musk’s plan, since he wants to keep a widely diversified shareholder base, including most of the shareholders who own Tesla as a public company. Also he does not … seem like a guy who is looking for more monitoring and incentives from his board of directors? His theory in going private seems to be that he wants his shareholders to be even less involved than they are now.
Musk’s initial explanation last week gave three reasons for wanting to go private:
As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.
The first one is specious: If you’re a long-term holder of Tesla, the stock will be worth what it’s worth in the long term. If you find the short-term price fluctuations distracting, just don’t look at them! Avoiding that distraction by getting rid of the ability to buy or sell Tesla stock seems like wild overkill. 
The third one is also specious: Yes, public markets allow anyone who wants to sell Tesla to sell it, but they also allow anyone who wants to buy Tesla to buy it. People who dislike Tesla can go short, people who like Tesla can go long, and—pretty obviously, judging by its $60 billion market capitalization achieved without ever making a profit—the latter effect dominates. Going private will shut out short sellers, but it will also shut out true believers who want to buy more stock. And as far as I can tell Musk has no evidence at all for his theory that short sellers are somehow doing something to attack or sabotage Tesla. Remember he has the same theory about fossil-fuel interests sabotaging Tesla – but wants Saudi Arabia involved in the buyout.
But Musk’s second reason – “the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term” – is the silliest. Where does that pressure come from? Are there gamma rays of short-termism wafting through the public markets? If being public creates pressure to make short-term decisions, then surely that pressure has to come from public-market shareholders. There is something about those public shareholders – who tend to be relatively diversified, relatively hands-off, relatively passive and to have quarterly performance pressures from their own investors – that makes them concerned primarily with the short term. Whether or not you believe this, you can’t solve it by taking a company private and keeping all the same shareholders. If Tesla’s big shareholders – T. Rowe and Baillie Gifford and Fidelity and Tencent and Vanguard and BlackRock and Capital – are all myopically focused on the short term, then going private and keeping them as shareholders won’t solve anything. If they’re not, then there’s no need to go private. 
The thing is that all of Musk’s enemies are imaginary. I mean, they exist, but they don’t matter. There are short sellers who think that Tesla is overvalued, and they short the stock, and they tweet about it. Musk owes them nothing and can ignore their tweets, as virtually every other public-company CEO does. There are Wall Street analysts who ask questions that Musk doesn’t like, but he can ignore their questions, and sometimes, quite rudely, does.
What matters, for a public-company CEO, is what his shareholders think. He is answerable to them. If they care only about short-term results, if they demand immediate profits at the expense of long-term sustainability, if they can be easily swayed to back an activist’s proxy fight or a hostile takeover, then maybe he should go private. All of those are ridiculous things to think about Tesla’s shareholders. The evidence for that is not only their unfailing loyalty to Musk, but also the fact that he wants to go private and bring them along. The shareholders are not the problem with being public, and there are no other problems.
“The stock market has been kind to Elon Musk,” James Mackintosh wrote last week. If Musk wants to find a widespread pool of investors willing to take a gamble on his vision for Tesla, he has found them. The obvious mechanism for finding a large group of investors to buy shares in a company without expecting to control that company is also the correct one: You list the shares publicly, and let the people who want to buy them, buy them. You don’t need to travel to Saudi Arabia to find someone who’ll put money into Tesla without demanding any control rights in return. They’re right there in front of you. They’re the people who already own the stock. 
If this were a romantic comedy, that would be a satisfying ending. Musk would turn to his loyal best friend, the public market, see the love in its eyes that he had never noticed before, and embrace it as the music swelled. But the point that I want to convey here is that this is not a romantic comedy. This is a highly regulated stock market! There are rules here! You can’t just wing it! The public market is kind and forgiving and long-suffering and infatuated with Musk. But there are some things that it won’t tolerate.

(Reuters) - U.S. bank shares fell for a third straight session on Monday as investor appetite for risk weakened on worries that a currency crisis in Turkey would spread to other countries.
The Turkish lira has tumbled on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's increasing control over the economy and deteriorating U.S. relations, falling as much as 12 percent at one stage on Monday .
The S&P 500 Financial sector index was the biggest drag on the benchmark index (SPX) with big banks among the leading losers. The S&P bank index <.SPXBK> fell 0.9 percent on Monday and was on track for an almost 3 percent drop over three sessions. 
The U.S. banks with the biggest disclosed Turkey exposure in the second or first quarters were Goldman Sachs (N:GS), down 1 percent, Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), down 1.4 percent and Bank of America (N:BAC), down 1.9 percent.
While U.S. banks seemed to have limited direct exposure, investors worried Turkey's problems could expand overseas.
""I don't think Turkey in and of itself is a big concern for U.S. banks. Exposure tends to be low. The concern becomes if there's contagion and it spreads to other emerging markets and other parts of the world,"" said Jeffery Harte, an analyst covering banks at Sandler O'Neill.
""Does it derail some of the strength we've seen in capital markets, in mergers and acquisitions, in equity underwriting especially outside of the U.S?"" he asked. ""I don't think that'll be the case but that's what I'm watching.""
In research Keefe, Bruyette & Woods listed Goldman as the most exposed to Turkey with total credit exposure of $2.53 billion or 3.5 pct of tangible common equity (TCE) in June, mostly with non-sovereign counterparties and borrowers. 
Goldman Sachs shares have fallen in the last four sessions, with a 1.8 percent drop on Friday.
Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), a provider of treasury, issuer and foreign exchange services to Turkey's top 10 financial institutions, had $634 million exposure on June 30, down from $707 million on Dec. 31. That represents about 3.3 percent of that bank's tangible common equity, KBW said.
While Bank of America no longer listed Turkey among the top 20 countries where it has exposure outside of the United States, it was the first to disclose exposure in the first quarter according to KBW. 
In the first quarter Turkey was No. 20 on the bank's non-U.S. exposure list, with $3.15 billion in exposure or 1.8 pct of tangible common equity, KBW said. Bank of America shares fell 1.3 percent on Friday and extended losses Monday.
""You'll see the anxiety from the last financial crisis loom over stocks. All you need is a spark to get people's attention ... Once it settles down you can reinvest,"" said Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby.

""There's a lot of stop gaps in between a country experiencing stress and a complete financial crisis.""

(Reuters) - VF Corp (N:VFC), one of the world's biggest apparel makers, will spin off Lee and Wrangler jeans into a separate public company, it said on Monday, allowing it to focus on its more profitable Vans sneakers and The North Face outerwear businesses.
Denims were responsible for more than half of VF's overall profit in 2000, but have since been outpaced by skateboarder favorite Vans, which has driven much of VF's recent growth.
The spin-off, expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, will also give VF more flexibility to pursue acquisitions and explore new business areas. 
However, investors reacted coolly to the news, with VF's shares falling nearly 4 percent to $92.53 on Monday afternoon. The stock has risen roughly 20 percent year to date.
While VF's activity-based outdoor products business saw profit jump 15 percent in the year that ended in March, earnings from jeans slipped nearly 13 percent in the same period, as big outlets including Walmart Inc (N:WMT) turned to their own denim brands.
""(Jeans) has been the weak link in the portfolio,"" Jane Hali, head of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates, said via email. ""Now they can concentrate on the outdoor coalition and Vans, a much more unified and strong stable of brands.""
The new VF, which already sold off apparel brand Nautica last year, will have annual revenue of more than $11 billion, compared to just over $2.5 billion for the jeans unit, which includes Wrangler, Lee, Rustler and Rock & Republic.
The jeans company will focus on maintaining shareholders' dividends, cutting debt and increasing sales in China and other Asian markets. Acquisitions of smaller firms are a longer-term possibility, VF said.
However, the new spun-off retailer could face headwinds related to changing tastes - with some consumers souring on jeans - and U.S. negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Ed Gribbin, U.S.-based CEO of apparel business and product development consulting firm Alvanon.
""If NAFTA were to go away, that would be a significant challenge for them in the denim business,"" Gribbin said. The jeans division is heavily invested in Mexico. 
VF will shift base to Denver while the still-to-be-named jeans maker will move to the company's traditional base in Greensboro, North Carolina and be led by Scott Baxter, currently president of VF's Americas West group.
Baxter led VF's jeans business from 2011 to 2015.
VF, which has a market value of about $38 billion, projected a 5-cent hit to current-quarter earnings per share due to the deal.

VF had considered ""all options"" for the jeans business including an outright sale, but decided that a spin-off would serve shareholders best, executives said on a conference call with analysts.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A labor union representing American teachers on Friday urged pension funds to cut their exposure to investment firms that have funneled millions of dollars into private prisons, saying the companies are getting rich on the U.S. government's practice of separating migrant families.
The American Federation of Teachers, which influences over $1 trillion in public-teacher pension plans, published a report identifying more than two dozen firms that bet on jail operators CoreCivic Inc and GEO Group Inc and defense contractor General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), which has contracts with migrant shelters. It sent the report to pensions around the country, warning such investments could be hazardous.
Shares of CoreCivic, formerly Corrections Corporation of America, and GEO Group began climbing after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in November 2016. They have risen more in the last months as the Trump administration began prosecuting people who crossed the border illegally. Many were put into facilities run by these companies, and thousands of children were separated from their parents.
In an attachment to the report, the teachers federation names the biggest investors in private prisons, including investment firms Hotchkis & Wiley and Geode Capital Management, as well as hedge funds D.E. Shaw, Millennium Management and Renaissance Technologies. Some of these firms make trading decisions mainly using computer models instead of conducting fundamental research on companies.
""Hedge funds that invest in private prisons are not only profiting off a broken justice system and abetting the administration's policies of family separation ... They are also making a risky bet on an industry rightfully under siege,"" American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said.
The Geo Group released a statement blasting the union's stance as ""outrageous and based on malicious lies ... Our company has never managed facilities that house unaccompanied minors ... nor have we ever provided any other services for that purpose."" 
Amanda Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for CoreCivic, said the company helps the government ""provide solutions for overcrowded and potentially unsafe conditions.""
General Dynamics spokeswoman Lucy Ryan said the company provided support services but ""had no role in the separation of children and families.""
Spokespeople for the fund firms either declined to comment or did not return messages seeking comment.
CoreCivic's stock price has climbed 22.6 percent in the last three months while GEO Group's gain was 7.14 percent in the same time.
Several prominent pension funds, including the California State Teachers Retirement System and the Chicago Teachers Pension Fund, are evaluating their investments in private prisons. Last year New York City pension funds were the first to fully divest from the private prison industry, the report said.

The American Federation of Teachers has long been critical of hedge funds, calling them too expensive and criticizing their lackluster returns in previous reports.

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Turkey's Collapse Sinks Emerging Markets on ‘Manic Monday’,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s market carnage rippled across emerging markets, sending both stocks and currencies toward their lowest levels in a year.
The lira led losses among global peers after the nation’s first steps to bolster the financial system were seen by some analysts as insufficient to protect markets in times of distress. As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at the U.S., took higher rates off the table and said he wouldn’t accept an international bailout, traders pushed down Turkish assets in a selloff that spilled over to other developing economies. The rand’s one-month implied volatility soared by the most since December 2015, while the yield on Argentine’s century bonds rose to 10 percent as the peso sank to 30 per dollar.
""It’s another Manic Monday,"" said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura International in London. ""We go through the list of options they have to stop this: it involves rate hikes, getting the IMF involved and restoring market confidence in the lira. Unfortunately, all the components are going the other way.""
Toxic Blend’ Seen Unique to Turkey, Sparing Other Currencies
Fear that the Turkish meltdown will keeping punishing emerging markets resurfaced Monday as traders also grappled with tensions between the U.S. and other major economies such as Russia and China. Still, many analysts say there are few fundamental reasons to add the whole space to the same basket as several countries have done their homework. That means: while the stress in Turkey may continue, its correlation to the rest of the asset class may decline soon.
“EM has already seen a large selloff between April to July and negative developments in Turkey will eventually be seen (along with Argentina) as isolated given their exceptional external imbalances compared to most EM countries,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts including Luis Oganes and Jonny Goulden wrote in note to clients.
Turkey’s market turmoil didn’t just erase a July rebound in emerging-market stocks -- it also made them the cheapest since early 2016, before a two-year, 60 percent rally. At 10.8, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 12-month blended forward price-to-estimated earnings ratio is now also below where it was after a sell-off in the second quarter. The gauge itself fell 2 percent this month, extending its yearly decline to about 10 percent.
While some analysts say they are happy to nibble at stocks, they aren’t really diving in. Equities in developing markets will likely remain turbulent with little sign of stability to lure bargain hunters despite Monday’s selloff, according to UBS Asset Management.
“We see building value, but you have no visibility on when that value can be realized,” said Geoffrey Wong, head of global emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities at UBS Asset. Investors can be forgiven for feeling wary, “given that we’ve got a 1-2-3-4-5-6 punch, not just a 1-2 punch.”
Here’s what other analysts and investors are saying:"
640,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Malaysia ETF Draws Most Cash Since 2011 Even as Turkey Roils EM,"(Bloomberg) -- Looking for contagion from Turkey’s economic crisis? You won’t find it in Malaysia.
The Southeast Asian nation’s stock market surged into overbought territory last week and the sole U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund tracking the measure attracted the most cash since 2011. The rally came as investors in developing-nation assets fretted over whether Turkey’s plunging currency would spark a selloff in other countries.

The iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF, or EWM, attracted $106 million last week, or almost 20 percent of its total assets, and the Malaysian equity index has recovered 8.7 percent from a July low. Foreigner investors have begun to return to the country after a flight following the surprise victory of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who decided to review some infrastructure projects and revealed the extent of a corruption scandal from the previous government.
“Foreign direct investment and exogenous demand for domestic goods is such a fantastic stimulus for an economy like that,"" said Andy Wester, senior investment analyst at Proficio Capital Partners.
While Malaysia’s ringgit hasn’t escaped unscathed the weakening in emerging-market currencies, it’s held up well compared with other Asian countries. That’s likely added to the allure of EWM, which has almost 40 percent of the fund’s exposure in banks. At the same time, the ringgit weakness will make Malaysian oil cheaper overseas, giving a boost to the country’s crude producers and investor sentiment about the broader economy."

Barely moving lines of mainly Arab tourists snaked outside the Chanel and Louis Vuitton stores in Nisantasi, an upscale Istanbul neighborhood, waiting to reap the benefits of a meltdown that saw the currency lose 18 percent on Friday alone.
""We’re buying clothes, we’re buying makeup, we’re buying brand names,"" said Fatima Ali from Kuwait, visiting the city with her two daughters. ""The prices are very cheap."" 
Like many of her fellow shoppers, Ali brought her suitcases along to fill up. She stood outside a makeup store holding three.
The lira has lost more than 40 percent against the dollar this year, amid worries about President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States.
Erdogan has also urged Turks to extend their hospitality to tourists, who were bringing dollars into the country at a critical time.
""You are already very hospitable but keep that up and extend it. Because at a time when some people are taking out dollars, they are bringing it to you,"" he told a crowd of supporters at the weekend.
Portraying the lira weakness a plot, Erdogan has repeatedly called on Turks to sell their dollars to shore the local currency up.
An employee at an upscale clothing store who declined to give his name said the amount of shoppers was unusual even in high season, attributing it to the lira's fall.
One Egyptian shopper estimated he had saved about $1,000 in comparison to buying the same gifts and clothes at home.
""We hope that the currency, for Turkey’s sake, becomes better,"" said another, Khalid al-Fahad from Kuwait. 

""And at the same time we hope for the sake of customers here that the lira remains as is.""

661,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Illegal fishing, harm to Amazon forest linked to tax havens: study","By Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - Scientists called on Monday for greater transparency over the use of tax havens by companies involved in activities that have harmed the world's oceans and the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest. 
In a study published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, they said many firms involved in illegal fishing worldwide used tax havens to register their vessels, while investments in farming that has damaged the rainforest often flow via offshore accounts.
The study follows the 2015 leak of the Panama Papers, which showed how wealthy individuals and companies use offshore schemes to reduce their tax bills.
Seventy percent of fishing vessels implicated in illegal, unreported and unregulated catches had been registered at some point in a tax haven, led by Belize and Panama, the scientists wrote in the journal.
By contrast, they said, only about four percent of all the fishing vessels registered worldwide are flagged in tax havens.
The scientists also cited documents from Brazil's central bank which showed that almost 70 percent - or $18.4 billion of a total $26.9 billion - of foreign capital invested by major companies in soy and beef farming in Brazil from 2000-2011 had flowed through tax havens. 
DEFORESTATION
Land clearances for beef and soy farms have been ""key drivers of deforestation"", especially in the early years of the period, they said. Most funds for beef and soy went via the Cayman Islands, Bahamas and Netherlands.
""In the fisheries case ... there are examples of illegal uses of tax havens. We are talking about tax avoidance,"" lead author Victor Galaz of Stockholm University told Reuters. 
By contrast, Galaz said there was nothing illegal about using a tax haven to channel money to farms in Brazil, but he added that this could sometimes act as an indirect subsidy for environmentally damaging practices. 
The report did not name fishing companies but the scientists wrote to firms listed on the Brazilian central bank documents, which showed Cargill and Bunge had the largest amount of loans or cash flowing via tax havens.
Both companies said they were committed to protecting the environment and supported a 2006 soy moratorium in Brazil, which bans purchases from recently deforested areas.
""We do not 'hide' profits or cash in tax havens,"" a Cargill official wrote to the authors. ""Our company is subject in the U.S. to full disclosure of all our activities and bank accounts associated with non-U.S. holding companies.""Cargill told Reuters it had nothing to add to that statement.
""Our goal is to build sustainable supply chains free of deforestation,"" a Bunge spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to Reuters, echoing remarks the company sent to the authors.

666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Elon Musk Says Saudi Interest Sparked Effort to Take Tesla Private,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk said interest from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund gave him the confidence to drop the bombshell last week that he was considering taking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. private.
The Saudi Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund had approached Musk going back almost two years about taking Tesla off the market, he wrote in a blog post Monday, confirming that the fund recently bought an almost 5 percent stake. Musk described a July 31 meeting in which the Saudi fund’s managing director expressed regret that Tesla hadn’t moved forward with a go-private transaction.
“I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk wrote in the post. He said this is why he tweeted on Tuesday that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share.
Musk, 47, set off a firestorm last week with the highly unconventional way in which he announced Tesla may leave the public markets. His Twitter postings and a letter to employees -- made public in a post on the company’s blog -- made no mention of the Saudi fund’s involvement. Tesla’s board also released a three-sentence-long statement that only vaguely addressed how the company would be able to fund taking the company private at a market capitalization of more than $70 billion.
Legal Scrutiny
Several investors have since sued Musk and Tesla, claiming the company’s share price had been manipulated. The Securities and Exchange Commission is said to be intensifying its scrutiny of the company and its chief executive officer after having started gathering general information about Tesla and Musk’s earlier public pronouncements about manufacturing goals and sales targets.
One of Tesla’s biggest critics, Vertical Group analyst Gordon Johnson, read Musk’s blog post as a walk-back maneuver from his “funding secured” tweet last week. He cited Musk’s statement Monday that the Saudi fund’s support for taking Tesla private was “subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals.”
“He is specifically stating that funding is not secured, and I think that’s a big deal,” Johnson, whose $93 price target on Tesla shares is the lowest among Wall Street analysts, said on Bloomberg Television. “The question then becomes, what does the SEC do here, and do the shareholders stick with him?”
Musk said he’s continued to communicate with the Saudi fund managing director, whom he didn’t identify by name. He said he’s been reaching out to Tesla’s other large shareholders and that most of the capital required to take the company private will be funded by equity, rather than debt.
“The $420 buyout price would only be used for Tesla shareholders who do not remain with our company if it is private,” he wrote. “My best estimate right now is that approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.”

667,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","Amicus sets $315,000 price for new Fabry disease treatment","(Reuters) -  Amicus Therapeutics  (O:FOLD) on Monday set an average price of $315,000 per year for its newly approved Fabry disease treatment, a price it believes is below that of the main existing treatment in the United States.
Galafold - approved on Friday by U.S. regulators - is the first new Fabry disease treatment in the country in over 15 years, and will compete with Sanofi SA's (PA:SASY) infused Fabrazyme, which has an average U.S. list price of $340,000 for adults, according to Amicus.
Sanofi, however, says Fabrazyme's price is closer to $290,000, when accounting for pediatric patients who tend to use less of the drug because of their weight. The French drugmaker did not detail drug prices separately for adults and children.
The list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. ""Out-of-pocket"" costs vary based on the duration of the treatment and individual healthcare plans.
Galafold is an oral therapy for Fabry disease, a sometimes fatal genetic condition in which accumulation of fat damages several organs. An estimated 3,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease.
Galafold will not have the additional costs of administering an infused drug like Fabrazyme, Amicus says.
The company is committed to keeping new treatments priced at parity with or slightly below existing treatments, it said on Monday.
""If we're going to have more medicines for people living with rare diseases, we've got to bend the cost curve,"" Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview before Friday's approval.
In Europe, where each country negotiates drug pricing, Galafold costs between $200,000 and $250,000 annually.
Amicus does not expect to raise Galafold's U.S. price at a rate higher than consumer inflation, and has said it will use part of the drug's revenue to develop new Fabry disease therapies.

Amicus shares rose 3.5 percent to $15.88 in trading before the bell on Monday.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) shares plunged as much as 14 percent on Monday, losing about $14 billion in value, after newly acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) was ordered to pay $289 million in damages in the first of possibly thousands of U.S. lawsuits over alleged links between a weedkiller and cancer.
After the verdict in favor of a California school groundskeeper with terminal cancer, Monsanto faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States over claims it did not warn of the cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers, including its Roundup brand.
Monsanto, bought by Bayer this year for $63 billion, said that it would appeal against the jury's verdict in California, which is the latest episode in a long-running debate over claims that exposure to Roundup can cause cancer.
The case by plaintiff Dewayne Johnson, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system that he alleges was caused by Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide.
""The jury's verdict is at odds with the weight of scientific evidence, decades of real world experience and the conclusions of regulators around the world that all confirm glyphosate is safe and does not cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"" Bayer said in a statement.
Having closed the Monsanto takeover, Bayer is only awaiting the approval of some final antitrust-related asset sales before folding it into its own organization. It did not negotiate any payments from Monsanto shareholders for Roundup-related litigation.
Bayer shares were down 11.2 percent at 82.93 euros at 1320 GMT, the worst performing stock on the Stoxx Europe 600 index (STOXX), and on track to close at their lowest in almost five years.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said Bayer was in for a ""litigious headache"".
""Whilst an appeal is certain and may indeed likely result in the penalty being moderated at a minimum if not reversed altogether, a large number of similar pending cases will now likely multiply.""
Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said resolving the issue could cost Bayer $5 billion, citing a rough estimate based on a past product liability settlements such as Merck & Co Inc's (N:MRK) $4.9 billion settlement over painkiller Vioxx or Bayer's $4.2 billion total settlement over the Baycol cholesterol drug.
The controversy could also affect future revenues.
Genetically modified (GM) crops that withstand glyphosate are a main source of cash for Monsanto, mainly generated in North and South America, where the technology is widely accepted.
The health worries could further darken the outlook for a product category following the emergence of weeds that have grown resistant to the herbicide.
""We think the risk of withdrawal is extremely low, but if it materialized it would be a major blow to the transaction value paid for the company,"" said Berenberg's Campbell.
SCIENTIFIC DEBATE
Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, patent-free glyphosate herbicides are now sold by the global crop protection industry despite the dispute over its safety.
The U.S. court ruling caught many Bayer investors off guard as no hard evidence of a causal link to cancer had been produced so far.
The World Health Organization's (WHO) cancer arm in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"", but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical was not likely carcinogenic to humans.
A Reuters report in October showed that the WHO's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer.
In Europe, the EU Commission in December drew criticism for renewing the license for glyphosate. Germany and France have meanwhile taken steps to phase out use of the weedkiller.
The U.S. case may prompt some retailers to curb sales of Roundup products. Homebase, one of Britain's largest home and garden improvement retailers, is reviewing the sale of glyphosate-containing products in the light of the jury’s decision, a spokeswoman said.
Glyphosate-exposed stocks also plunged in Asia and particularly in Australia where a withering drought has already hit herbicide sales.
Australian chemical maker  Nufarm Ltd  (AX:NUF), which Macquarie Bank analysts estimate earns about a fifth of its revenue from glyphosate-based products, plunged almost 17 percent to a more than two-year low.

Its top shareholder, Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd (T:4005), shed 3 percent, while Australian rural services firm Elders Ltd (AX:ELD), which retails herbicides, fell 11 percent.

685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Tesla Proves Most Lucrative, Least Volatile Auto Stock","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nikola Tesla electrified the world in the 19th century when he created the alternating-current motor and anticipated 21st century mass communication with his work on wireless transmission of voices, images and moving pictures. Unlike the Serbian-American inventor who died destitute at 86 in 1943, his namesake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is so esteemed eight years after becoming a public company that its valuation is greater than that of every other automaker except Toyota Corp., Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. Tesla's market capitalization per vehicle produced dwarfs all of them, including No. 1 Toyota by a multiple of 25.
And that was before the founder and chief executive officer, Elon Musk, said he was thinking about reorganizing Tesla as a private concern. He was responding in part to analysts who have become increasingly bearish as the stock became more robust.
Tesla's perceived failings include ""burning through cash"" (reported 135 times by Bloomberg News since 2013), more short-sellers than 499 of the companies in the S&P 500, management turnover, and a temperamental leader. This is the noise obscuring the strengthening signal that investors – like owners of the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster in 28 countries – embrace Tesla as the same disruptive force that enabled Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc. to overtake the giant book sellers 20 years ago.
The dichotomy between shareholders and everyone else opining about Tesla was revealed this month when the Washington Post led its Economy & Business section with an article headlined: ""Inside the Tesla Factory: Burning cash, trying not to burn out."" Tesla shares within 24 hours rallied more than 16 percent -- the biggest one-day gain since 2013 -- after Musk said not for the first time that the Palo Alto firm doesn't need any money and will be profitable.
Just as Thomas Edison dismissed Nikola Tesla's invention of AC power transmission as impractical, so does the media's burning-through-cash fixation miss the significance of Tesla shares proving the least volatile and most lucrative among its five largest competitors during the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's because Tesla sales increased 10 times since 2013, a rate that is exponentially faster than revenue growth for Fiat Chrysler (1.2 times), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. (1.1 times) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., whose revenue decreased 8 percent. Tesla's market capitalization during the same period increased 3.3 times, easily surpassing Fiat Chrysler (2.3 times), GM (1.1 times) and Ford, which lost 40 percent of its value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The best is yet to come for Tesla and its zero-emission vehicles. Tesla sales are expected to grow 72 percent in 2018, the most among 40 global automotive peers, according to 26 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla will remain No. 1 with a growth rate of 40 percent next year and 24 percent in 2020. The Model 3, which received the highest owner satisfaction rating in its category from Consumer Reports, ""will become the best-selling entry-luxury sedan in the U.S., outpacing the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-class this year and in 2019,"" said Bloomberg New Energy Finance in a June 13 report. ""Tesla could compound falling sales at incumbent automakers like Audi, BMW, Daimler and Infiniti,"" according to the report.
Money managers, meanwhile, are showing their explicit preference for Tesla.
Recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that 194 mutual funds invested $9.8 billion in Tesla shares, or about 1 percent of the total assets of these funds, while 361 funds invested $6.9 billion in GM, or 0.7 percent of their total assets, and 570 funds invested $12.3 billion in GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the 194 funds holding Tesla produced a 2.67 percent risk-adjusted return during the past three years, when the 570 funds holding the other automakers provided a 1.99 percent return after adjusting for share-price volatility.
The bottom line: Tesla, as the Washington Post and my colleagues at Bloomberg Opinion repeatedly acknowledged, is spending money at a rate considered unsustainable. But shareholders remain indifferent to this perceived peril because Tesla is creating increasingly more value the same way Amazon did more than a decade after reporting no earnings.
Proof can be found among the most-successful money managers, such as Joshua Spencer's T.Rowe Price Global Technology Fund, which has a 209 percent total return (income plus appreciation) the past five years and is No. 1 among 231 similar funds. Under Spencer, Tesla's weighting increased to 13 percent as of March from nothing (Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) was the second-largest weighting at 5.7 percent), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Fidelity Select Technology Portfolio produced a 97 percent total return the past 3 years and is No. 1 among its peers for the period, mostly because manager Charlie Chai made Tesla one of his top 3 investments since the second quarter of 2017.
While Bloomberg News reported Tesla ""burning through cash"" 11 times in 2015, 37 times in 2016, 35 times in 2017 and 52 times so far this year, the shares rallied 7.9 percent in 2015, 45.7 percent last year and 14 percent so far in 2018 (they declined 11 percent in 2016) – proving if nothing else that investors aren't concerned about the growing pains because they already envisage the day when the vehicle of choice for most people is electric. That would be 2040 when 55 percent of new car sales are electric vehicles, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
In the meantime, Tesla investors, like its customers, have traveled into the future, and they aren't turning back.

The preliminary deal, announced last month, has drawn fire from presidential candidates in Brazil who are concerned about preserving jobs and keeping Embraer competitive. A congressional review could further complicate the politics of a tie-up aimed at challenging the alliance of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).
Embraer is a publicly listed company and about 80 percent of its shares are held by foreign investors, but since its privatization Brazil's government has held a so-called golden share giving it veto rights over strategic decisions.
""I always insist that, when you are going to sell any state asset, the people must be heard through the parliament,"" Speaker Rodrigo Maia said in comments published in the Valor Economico newspaper.

""Should Congress ratify the government's position regarding the golden share? ... In principle, I defend that. I think you need a position from Congress,"" he said, according to the paper.

Stadler was arrested in mid-June as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at the premium brand, which is part of Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p).
He was detained on fears he would seek to influence witnesses being questioned as part of an investigation into Volkswagen's emissions scandal.
""The Chamber emphasizes that danger of obstructing justice remains. The release of the accused from custody was therefore rejected,"" the Munich court said in a statement.
Stadler, who stepped down in June, had asked to be released from custody and appealed against his arrest, the Munich prosecutor's office said.
The prosecutors are probing Stadler and another member of Audi's top management for suspected fraud and false advertising tied to illegal pollution levels in its cars and manipulated vehicle tests.

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Europe's major banks lost further ground on Monday, as concerns about Turkey's deepening currency crisis spread to other emerging markets.
The euro zone banking equity index (SX7E) was down 1.6 percent, hovering near its lowest level this year and falling for the fourth session in a row.
Turkey's lira pulled back from a record low against the dollar on Monday morning after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks, but the currency's meltdown continued to shake global markets. The lira has lost most than 40 percent of its value so far in 2018.
The Russian rouble hit its lowest level since early 2016, under pressure from the lira's slide and investors' concerns about new U.S. sanctions against Russia.
Shares in European banks were hit across the board for the second trading session in a row, with those exposed to Turkey and other emerging markets suffering the steepest losses. 
""There is a panic move on all emerging market currencies, the stress spreads on the South African rand, the Indian rupee or the Mexican peso,"" said analyst Alexandre Baradez from brokerage IG Group.
Shares in Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), Dutch bank ING (AS:ING) and Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) - which all have units in Turkey - shed more than 3 percent, extending Friday's losses.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) fell 1 percent. 
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove and Deutsche bank calculated the impact on the four banks of a potential exit from Turkey, including the write-down of their assets there and the loss of intergroup funding.
The JP Morgan report said the hit on the core capital would be ""a significant but manageable"" 87 basis points for ING and 53 basis points for BBVA. UniCredit's core capital ratio would actually benefit from not having to set aside money for forex losses linked to the lira depreciation. BNP would have a limited capital impact of 3 basis points.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) saw worst-case scenario equity losses for the four banks at 12 percent of group equity for BBVA, 4 percent for UniCredit and ING, and under 2 percent for BNP Paribas. 
""This is not our base case, but even if it were to occur, the impact should be manageable for European banks,"" it said.
A BNP Paribas spokeswoman declined to comment on the analysts figures. UniCredit and ING did not immediately comment.
BBVA did not immediately comment on the analysts' data but a spokesman for the bank noted that BBVA's CEO Carlos Torres recently said every 10 pct depreciation of the lira in Turkey leads to an impact of around 2 basis points on the bank's capital ratio.
European banks with large businesses in emerging markets such as  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)  in Russia or Santander (MC:SAN) in Mexico also saw their shares losing ground on Monday. Santander fell 2.5 percent and Societe Generale dipped 1.3 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (L:BARC) has begun shifting direct ownership of its French, German and Spanish branches from a British-based entity to its Irish bank, according to sources with direct knowledge of the plans, ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union.
The move shows Barclays putting its Brexit contingency plans into action, in common with other banks which are not waiting for the outcome of negotiations over how financial services will operate after Britain leaves the EU in March. 
The British bank outlined plans to expand its EU-based Irish entity in a slide presentation to investors earlier this month, saying the unit would primarily consist of Barclays corporate, investment and private banking activities and its Barclaycard credit card business in Germany.
In addition to the French, German, and Spanish branches, Barclays will ultimately move all of its European branches under control of Barclays Bank Ireland, one of the sources said.
Its other main corporate and investment banking businesses in Europe include Luxembourg, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands, according to a Reuters review of company filings.
Barclays Bank Ireland will have total assets of around 224 billion pounds ($286 billion) after absorbing all the European business, Barclays said in its presentation to investors, out of 1.1 trillion pounds for the entire bank as of the end of 2017.
Barclays no longer operates a consumer banking business in Europe, having sold the last of its retail operation in 2016 as the bank shifted its global strategy to focus on the United States and Britain.
While Barclays' European branches will still ultimately be owned by its London-listed holding company, the change in organizational structure shows how lenders are shifting business to try to avoid any disruption that Brexit might cause. 
Banks are trying to ensure that even under a 'no-deal' scenario, where Britain would crash out of the EU without any agreements in place, they would still be able to serve EU customers as before.
British banks have largely chosen to base their main European hubs wherever they already have a suitably licensed existing subsidiary, as they seek to minimize costs and inconvenience in the event a last-minute deal renders the reorganizations unnecessary.

Barclays rival HSBC (L:HSBA) has begun shifting direct ownership of its European branches from its British entity to its French subsidiary, while Lloyds (L:LLOY) is planning three EU subsidiaries, Reuters reported in July.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 05:14AM ET</span>",The Chinese street's view of the trade war: some say they won't buy U.S. products,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese officials have been mostly measured and moderate in their response to U.S. President Donald Trump's ratcheting up of a trade war with Beijing in recent weeks through his announcement of a series of punitive tariffs. They have generally avoided adding to tensions, allowing the Communist Party's official media to make the most bellicose comments. 
But the mood on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai is a little less accepting. Reuters talked to a cross section of 50 people, mainly from the two cities, about how concerned they are about the trade war, what they think Beijing's response would be, and whether they think Chinese people should boycott American products in retaliation.
The interviews showed there is no palpable sense of crisis or panic yet. There is division and confusion over how China should respond to Trump, with some arguing that Beijing should strike back at American interests but others saying they didn’t know what could be done. 
But perhaps most worrying for American businesses selling in China, a significant minority of the people interviewed – 14, or 28 percent - want to stop buying American products now, and some say they are already boycotting anything made in the U.S. Others said they would continue to buy American but that could change in the future.
If that was representative of the whole of China – and words were turned into action - it might start to put a dent in sales of Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhones, Disney's (N:DIS) movies, Starbucks' (O:SBUX) drinks and General Motors' (N:GM) cars, among other American products – and that's without any boycott being organized by the government or activists.
A decade after China basked in the patriotic glory of an inspirational opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympics, nationalist sentiment is rarely far below the surface.
The straw poll's sample is very small and clearly not scientific. The interviews were also conducted in a country where people are often guarded and may well not let foreign media know their real views. Any individual's comments deemed inappropriate – criticism of Xi would fall into this category – could lead to trouble with the authorities. 
But the views expressed in the 50 interviews are more than the basis for idle curiosity. 
Here are the results of the straw poll:
-Asked whether they were worried about the trade war, only 11 of the 50 (22 percent) said they were, and 39 (or 78 percent) said they weren't concerned.
-Asked what Beijing should do in response to Trump's punitive tariffs, 19 (or 38 percent) said that it should strike back hard. The rest came up with various responses, including a refocus on development of the domestic economy, building other export markets, while 8 (or 16 percent) said they had no idea what the government should do.
-Asked whether they would stop buying U.S. products, 14 said they would, 31 said they wouldn't (some indicated their views could change if the trade war intensifies), and five didn't have a view.
Here are some of the comments from those interviewed:
""Of course I'm concerned. It's a clash between the largest and second-largest economy,"" said Shanghai stockbroker Cai Qing, 40. ""None of the relevant parties were fully prepared for the trade war. Policies were rushed, including U.S. policies,"" he added. 
""To put it bluntly, Americans have always been so arrogant - they make everyone their manufacturer so they can reap the economic fruit,"" said Qu Xinjun, who works in the steel industry in Shanghai. 
""Trump is waging a psychological war with China. He was trying to intimidate China. From a psychological standpoint, we should not worry about the trade war, but rather focus on domestic development,"" he said. ""We should trust our country and the leadership and trust that we can win the war."" 
""China has to hit back, which could show its great power status. China has to win this match,"" said Beijing interior decorator Zhang Shiyou, 56. 
China has other markets it can look to, and President Xi Jinping's landmark proposal to build a new Silk Road, called the Belt and Road initiative, he said. 
""We Chinese should not buy Apple phones. Like the saying 'Buy the nation's products, love China', buying domestic products will boost our own industries."" 
""A lot of American goods are actually made in China,"" said Wei Shaochuan, 26, the founder of a tech start-up in China's central Henan province, was interviewed on WeChat.
""But if, after a period of time, the trade war really incites a sense of hatred against the United States, then I will not watch American movies, not listen to American music, not recommend  Disney  (N:DIS) to friends, and start writing social media posts saying that Americans are not good, in order to counter American cultural products,"" he said.
""I'm a strong supporter of Chinese products. I'm a firm opponent of any American product, especially after reading the news,"" said Zhao Guoxin, 61, a store owner in Beijing. ""The other day I went to this American shop and I told them I won't buy one single thing, and I made them very awkward. To be honest I do think America is pretty obnoxious,"" he said. 
""To be honest, importing from the U.S. isn't our sole route,"" said Wang Yangqing, a Beijing nurse who said she was in her 20s. ""We could also import from European countries. For girls, we use some American skin care products. If tariffs keep rising, I may shift to products from other places such as Japan or Korea."" 
""China should strike back properly,"" said Xu Dong, 25, a student in Beijing. ""But I won't stop buying their products. Some enterprises like Apple in fact bring in tax revenues and employment. It's a brand that is doing good to China,"" he said.

""For me it [the trade war] is great!"" said Zhu Tao, 34, a ship catering manager in Beijing. ""That's because I receive my salary in U.S. dollars and since the U.S.-China trade war started the U.S. dollar has kept increasing in value compared to the yuan. So I think it has really helped me. It's great!""

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks dragged European shares down on Monday as a growing economic crisis in Turkey shook investor confidence in lenders exposed to the country, while pharmaceuticals group Bayer sank 11 percent after its subsidiary  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) lost a key lawsuit.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent to a three-week low, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 0.4 percent as pharmaceuticals group Bayer weighed. 
Bayer (DE:BAYGn) was the worst performer, sinking 10.8 percent after Monsanto, the U.S. agriculture giant it acquired in June, was ordered to pay damages in a lawsuit alleging its glyphosate weedkiller caused a man's cancer.
""With several other similar cases up for hearing, we expect this to be an overhang on the stock,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts. 
Bayer's shares were set for their biggest one-day fall in more than nine years.

""Should rates be increased by 10 percent with a stabilization of EUR/TRY at 7, we would still see some earnings downside of 10% for BBVA and 8% for UCG,"" said JP Morgan analysts, cutting their earnings estimates for the exposed banks.
A growing economic crisis in Turkey which took the lira to a new record low of 7.24 to the dollar overnight has spurred selling across global markets with some contagion to other emerging markets.
""The fears that all this will end in tears eventually are strong, more so with populist economic thinking at the helm, from the U.S. to Turkey, and the UK to Italy,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts. 
The lira pulled back from its record low after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut lira and foreign currency reserve requirements for Turkish banks.
South African financials stocks  Investec  (L:INVP) and Old Mutual (L:OML) fell 2.9 percent and 2.3 percent as Turkey worries took the rand down to a new two-year low .

Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) fell 0.8 percent as Air France weighed and the deepening crisis in Turkey sapped investors' appetite for companies involved in tourism in the country.
Tour operator TUI (L:TUIT) fell 4.1 percent, while budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) lost 1.4 percent and cruise operator Carnival (L:CCL) declined 1.1 percent.
A rare gainer,  United Internet  (DE:UTDI) shares jumped 6.2 percent to the top of the STOXX. 
The internet provider and virtual mobile network operator reported a 32.4 percent rise in profits and said it was considering bidding for 5G licenses next year.
Shares in asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) fell 2.9 percent after it said it would liquidate nine funds whose trading it halted last month after suspending the investment director who ran them.
Broker notes also spurred some stock falls.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares fell 1.6 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the stock to ""underperform"".  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) shares also suffered a 3.8 percent fall after a BAML downgrade to ""underperform"". 

Overall MSCI Europe companies have delivered 11.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth in their second-quarter results, in euro terms, and analysts were revising up their earnings estimates despite investors growing increasingly risk-averse.

712,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Bayer Drops After Monsanto Loses Roundup Cancer Trial,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) plunged by the most in almost seven years as investors weighed the potential costs of a protracted legal battle over Roundup weed killer, the cornerstone product of newly acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co.
Monsanto was socked with $289 million in damages in the first trial over claims that the herbicide causes cancer when former school groundskeeper Lee Johnson prevailed Friday in San Francisco state court.
The trial was an important test of the evidence against Monsanto and will serve as a template for litigating thousands of other claims over the herbicide. Bayer closed a deal to buy Monsanto for $66 billion in June. If the litigation generates large verdicts against the agricultural company, it could have a material impact on Bayer’s bottom line, said Chris Perrella, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.
The verdict came as a surprise, and may stir memories for some Bayer investors of the scandal over cholesterol-lowering pill Lipobay, said Markus Mayer, an analyst with Baader Bank AG. The company paid more than $1.1 billion to settle suits over the heart drug.
“Investors might worry that this will become a ‘Lipobay 2.0’,” Mayer said.
Shares of Bayer slumped as much as 12 percent, the most since September 2011, in Frankfurt on Monday. That extended its rout this year to 19 percent.
The “decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews -- and conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and regulatory authorities around the world -- support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr. Johnson’s cancer,” Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge said in a statement Friday.
Does the World’s Top Weed Killer Cause Cancer? Trump’s EPA Will Decide
Since Roundup is ubiquitous in modern farming, there’s a “huge potential liability,” though it’s very uncertain it will materialize, Bloomberg’s Perrella said. Bayer investors might not be aware of the risks because many analysts covering the company focus on pharmaceuticals, he said.
Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup, was first approved for use in Monsanto’s weed killer in 1974. While becoming the world’s most popular and widely used herbicide, the question of whether it causes cancer has been hotly debated by environmentalists, regulators, researchers and lawyers -- even as Monsanto has insisted for decades that it’s perfectly safe.
Jurors awarded Johnson $39 million for his losses and $250 million to punish the company after finding it liable for a design defect and failing to warn of Roundup’s risks. Monsanto said it will appeal.
Working for a school district in Benicia, California, about 40 miles east of San Francisco, Johnson mixed and sprayed hundreds of gallons of Roundup. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2014, and in July 2017, after chemotherapy and other treatments, his oncologist gave him six months to live.
Johnson’s lawyers, relying on his testimony and expert witnesses, argued that his exposure, including accidents that soaked from head to toe in Roundup, caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was seeking $412 million in damages.
Monsanto May Have Lost, But Pesticide Case Far From Over
Monsanto scientists knew of the cancer risk posed by Roundup as far back as the 1970s, but failed to inform the public and instead engaged in a ""deliberate effort to distort the truth” as the weed killer generated hefty returns, Johnson’s lawyer, Brent Wisner, told the jury in closing arguments Tuesday.
“Despite the Environmental Protection Agency’s failure to require labeling, we are proud that an independent jury followed the evidence and used its voice to send a message to Monsanto that its years of deception regarding Roundup is over and that they should put consumer safety first over profits,” Wisner said in a statement after the verdict.
Monsanto argued that the type of cancer contracted by Johnson takes many years to form. The short period between Johnson’s first exposure in 2012 and his diagnosis in 2014 made any connection between his contact and the disease impossible, according to the company.
Monsanto lawyer George Lombardi insisted that science has found no connection between Roundup and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In fact, Lombardi told the jury, no one has yet figured out what causes the disease.
“We don’t know why people get mycosis fungoides,” he said, using the name of the specific form of cancer Johnson has. ""It would be nice if we could tell people why they get it, but we can’t.”
The case is Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto Co., CGC-16-550128, California Superior Court, County of San Francisco (San Francisco).

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) is considering suspending operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China due to slumping sales and rising labor costs, the Electronic Times reported on Monday.
Samsung might stop producing mobile phones this year at Tianjin Samsung Telecom Technology, located in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, the South Korean newspaper said, describing the move under consideration as a potential withdrawal.
The world's biggest smartphone maker said on Monday that nothing had been decided on the fate of its Tianjin operation.

Just five years ago, Samsung had 20 percent of the Chinese market only to see that fall to less than 1 percent this year, outgunned by Huawei ,  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and other Chinese brands, particularly on pricing.
The South Korean tech giant is also under pressure to jump-start faltering smartphone sales after posting its slowest quarterly profit growth in more than a year, as rivals nip at its heels with cheaper, feature-packed models.
In addition to the Tianjin plant, Samsung also another Chinese phone factory in Huizhou.
In recent years, Samsung has focused its major mobile phone investments on production facilities in Vietnam and India. It opened the world's biggest smartphone factory outside New Delhi last month, which is slated to become an export hub. 

According to the Electronic Times, its Tianjin plant in China produces 36 million mobile phones a year and its Huizhou plant makes 72 million units a year, while the two factories in Vietnam combined make 240 million units a year.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","Tesla's slow disclosure raises governance, social media concerns","By Michelle Price and Jessica DiNapoli
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s (O:TSLA) handling of Chief Executive Elon Musk's proposal to take the carmaker private and its failure to promptly file a formal disclosure has raised governance concerns and sparked questions about how companies use social media.
Musk stunned investors last Tuesday by announcing on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private in a potential $72 billion transaction and that ""funding"" had been ""secured."" 
Tesla's shares closed up 11 percent before retrenching after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Tesla why Musk announced his plans on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.
Musk provided no details of his funding and as of Thursday Tesla's board had not received a financing plan from Musk, Reuters reported, leaving investors and the broader market clamoring for more information.
Putting aside whether Musk misled anyone, the unorthodox manner in which he announced the news and Tesla's failure to promptly clarify the situation with a regulatory filing is a corporate governance lapse that raises questions about how companies use social media to release market-moving news, securities lawyers said.
""Management buyouts or other take-private transactions already suffer from serious information asymmetry between management and public shareholders,"" said Gabriel Rauterberg, a University of Michigan law professor.
SEC rules typically require companies to file an 8-K form within four business days of a significant corporate event. 
While several securities lawyers said Musk's tweets alone did not trigger this obligation, such a filing would be prudent given the unusual circumstances, David Axelrod, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said. 
""An 8-K would provide some more details, it would say what stage negotiations are in, and provide more information than 53 characters in a tweet,"" he added.
SEC guidelines published in 2013 allow companies and their executives to use social media to distribute material information, provided investors have been alerted that this is a possibility. Tesla did this in a 2013 filing. 
But such disclosures have to be full and fair, meaning the information is complete and accessible by all investors at the same time, a bar that Musk's tweets may not have met. 
""Twitter is not designed to provide full and fair disclosure. That doesn't mean that you couldn't, but in a series of 20 to 30 characters I'm not sure you're getting full disclosure,"" said Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and principal at law firm Blakemore Fallon. 
Tesla and the SEC did not reply to requests for comment on Sunday. 
Securities lawyers said there was also a question mark over whether Musk selectively disclosed information on the possible terms of the deal when he subsequently replied to followers, two of whom claim in their handles to be investors. 
Those tweets were not immediately visible to all followers of Musk's main feed until he retweeted them.
The 47-year-old billionaire' s history of joking about Tesla and using twitter to bait his critics, also appears to have undermined trust in Musk's feed as a reliable source of company information, with many investors initially believing Tuesday's tweet was a prank. 

""Musk's irreverence and showmanship is part of the Tesla brand, I get that, but I don’t think the securities laws do,"" said Fallon.

730,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Turkish Contagion Infects Rand With Steepest Plunge Since 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s rand plunged the most in almost a decade and Mexico’s peso slumped as financial turmoil in Turkey sapped demand for emerging-market assets.
The two currencies fell along with their developing-nation peers as Turkey’s lira tumbled for a fourth day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan showed no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S. administration. As investors worry about the country sliding toward a full-blown financial crisis, traders are trimming their holdings of developing-nation securities.
The lira’s slide “may fuel volatility in emerging-market assets and dampen investor sentiment in the near term, as markets are already skittish,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Melbourne. “But the drivers of the lira’s decline are very specific to Turkey -– therefore it should not derail the positive fundamentals in other emerging markets over a longer term.”

Investors were already cautious about emerging markets as the prospect of a global trade war compounded concerns about a more hawkish Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. In South Africa, uncertainty about the ruling party’s policies on land and mining has also contributed to the rand slumping more than 15 percent decline against the dollar this year.
The rand was 4 percent lower at 14.6617 per dollar as of 12:55 p.m. in Tokyo on Monday after sliding as much as 9.4 percent, the most since October 2008. Mexico’s peso slid as much as 2.3 percent, the biggest decline since January 2017.
“The rand should continue to be influenced by the Turkish lira crisis through the sentiment channel,”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA strategist Jason Daw wrote in a research note. “Until the lira stabilizes, the prospects for the South African currency are not encouraging.”
Emerging Asian foreign-exchange markets were also hit, though to a lesser degree. India’s rupee dropped to a new record low, while the Indonesian rupiah slumped 0.9 percent.
Healthy foreign-exchange reserves and robust fundamentals mean Asia’s emerging economies are in a strong position to withstand any external shocks, said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist for emerging-market Asia at Natixis Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 11:47PM ET</span>",Australia's Nufarm shares plunge 17 percent after Monsanto weedkiller cancer finding,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Californian court finding that a  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) weedkiller caused cancer in a school groundskeeper sent shares in an Australian maker of a similar product, Nufarm Ltd, tumbling almost 17 percent to a more than two-year low on Monday.
A California jury on Friday found Monsanto liable in a lawsuit filed by a man who alleged the company's glyphosate-based weed-killers caused his cancer and ordered the firm to pay $289 million in damages.
Macquarie Bank analysts estimate Nufarm earns about a fifth of its revenue from products containing glyphosate, the world's most widely-used herbicide. 
""There is longer term regulatory risk (regarding) this, if (we) do see a change of regulatory stance over time,"" Macquarie analysts wrote in a note published on Monday.
Concerns about glyphosate drove down Nufarm shares almost 17 percent in early trade to their lowest since February 2016. 
The stock has already been battered after the company issued a profit warning in July citing lower demand for its crop-protection products after dry weather in Australia.
The firm, however, sought to allay investor worries, saying it does not expect glyphosate-related issues that have arisen over the past week to ""have any impact on Nufarm's business"".
""The product has a 40-year history of safe use and continues to be an important tool for farmers. Nufarm will continue to work with regulatory authorities around the globe to maintain its glyphosate registrations,"" it added in a statement.
Monsanto, owned by Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), also denies that glyphosate causes cancer and says decades of scientific studies have shown the chemical to be safe for human use. It is appealing the California jury's verdict.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical not likely carcinogenic to humans.
But the World Health Organization's cancer arm had in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" and earlier this month Brazil suspended the use of the chemical for 30 days while it weighs health concerns. 
In 2016, The Weekly Times quoted Nufarm Managing Director Greg Hunt saying the firm had ""worked very hard to reduce its reliance on glyphosate"" to 20 percent from 50 percent.
Nufarm shares were down 12 percent at A$6.66 ($4.84) by 0325 GMT, off the day's low of A$6.27, in a broader marker that was 0.5 percent lower.

732,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Saudi Fund in Talks to Invest in Tesla Buyout Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is working to be part of any investor pool that emerges to take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. private, as Elon Musk enters a week where his plan will draw added scrutiny from the electric-car maker’s board, advisers and investors.
The Saudi Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund, which recently built a stake just shy of 5 percent in Tesla, is exploring how it can be involved in the potential deal, according to people with knowledge of the fund’s plans. But the potential transaction’s staggering $82 billion price tag means Tesla is still likely to need to tap other sources of cash.
Tesla board members are preparing to meet with financial advisers this week to evaluate Musk’s proposal. Directors will probably tell Musk, the chairman, to recuse himself, according to CNBC, and they’ve told him to hire his own separate advisers. Musk is hoping to avoid having one or two large stakeholders in a company and would instead prefer to gather the funds from a larger group, the people said, and is canvassing other potential investors including asset managers.
Musk’s tweet announcing the deal -- and a proclamation of “Funding secured” -- shocked investors, and he has yet to back up his claim that he has financing for the transaction. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether the tweet was meant to be factual, according to a person familiar with the matter, and at least two investors have sued Musk and Tesla alleging share-price manipulation. While the entrepreneur owns 20 percent of Tesla, more than $60 billion would be needed to buy the business from public shareholders.
The Public Investment Fund didn’t respond to requests for comment, and Tesla declined to comment.
It won’t be easy for Tesla to obtain the funding, according to Nannan Kou, a senior associate at Bloomberg NEF in Beijing.
“The question is still around Tesla’s future sales. This is essentially a chicken-and-egg problem,” Kou said in an email. “At this stage, it is hard for Tesla to convince the general investors that delivery will ramp up quickly. So the potential investor must be patient and strategic-looking.”
Earlier Discussions
Discussions over taking Tesla private have failed before. Musk and SoftBank Group’s Masayoshi Son held talks last year that touched on taking Tesla private, two people with knowledge of the talks have said. The discussions failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership.
SoftBank isn’t planning to participate as a potential source of capital in a deal taking Tesla private, according to people with knowledge of that matter who asked not to be identified as the details aren’t public. Among the reasons, they said, is that SoftBank has already placed big bets on the future of the automobile with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., and that Tesla faces increased competition and has yet to deliver on its mass-market ambitions.
The Saudi fund’s talks began before the controversial Aug. 7 tweet in which Musk said he was weighing a plan to take the company private. The PIF sees its investment in Tesla as a strategic way for the world’s biggest crude producer to hedge against oil, said the people, who asked not to be identified. The Saudi fund hasn’t made any firm decisions on whether to increase its stake, or by how much, but talks are ongoing, they said. It wasn’t immediately clear how much the fund would invest in Tesla.
Wall Street is awash with speculation on who might team up with Musk to do a deal. Musk and his advisers are seeking a wide pool of investors to back a potential take-private of the automaker to avoid concentrating ownership among a few new large holders, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk has said he still expects to own about 20 percent of Tesla after any transaction, and that he hopes all shareholders will remain owners of a private company.
The SEC, which already had been gathering information about Tesla’s public pronouncements on manufacturing goals and sales targets, is intensifying scrutiny of the company’s statements in the wake of Musk’s tweet, people familiar with the matter have said.
The Public Investment Fund approached Musk several months ago to discuss buying a minority stake, but he initially resisted the investment and said there were no plans to issue new shares, according to a different person familiar with the talks at the time. As a result, PIF itself decided to buy about $2 billion in Tesla shares on the market with the help of an investment bank, the person said.
The current talks about the PIF potentially participating in a take-private transaction started in recent weeks, the other people said.
The Saudi government is planning to turn the PIF into a $2 trillion powerhouse to help diversify the kingdom’s oil-dependent economy. In a tweet on Sunday, the nation’s Energy Department said Saudi Arabia currently is working to develop a city to support the supply of raw materials and parts for the automobile industry. The goal is to reduce imports, increase exports, encourage foreign investments and provide jobs.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asia share markets skidded and the euro hit one-year lows on Monday as a renewed rout in the Turkish lira infected the South African rand and drove demand for safe harbors, including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen.
The run from risk dragged MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 1.3 percent to a five-week low. Japan's Nikkei lost 1.6 percent with every bourse in the region in the red.
EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.4 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields dipped further to 2.85 percent.
China's blue chip index shed 1.4 percent, while Hong Kong stocks lost 1.6 percent as the local dollar fell to the limits of its trading band.
Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400.
The lira found just a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions.
Yet the dollar was still up almost 10 percent on the day at 7.0000 lira. This time last month it was at 4.8450.
The currency tumbled on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States.
""The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
""This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,"" he added.
Kenningham noted Turkey's annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. 
The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added.
""Nonetheless, Turkey's troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.""
BANKS EXPOSED
Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45.
Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13700. It was last at $1.1380 and still a long way from last week's top at $1.1628. 
The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.21, but was a shade firmer against a basket of currencies at 96.431.
The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire, with the dollar adding 5 percent on the rand. Dealers said Japanese retail investors had been squeezed out of long positions in the rand sending the yen steaming higher.
""Contagion risks center on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,"" warned analysts at ANZ.
""Turkey's massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that's threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.""
In commodity markets, gold found little in the way of safety flows and was last down at $1,208.21 an ounce.

Oil prices were mixed with Brent off 14 cents at $72.67 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 2 cents to $67.65.

ULSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - When Lee Dong-hee came to Ulsan to work for  Hyundai Heavy Industries  five years ago, shipyards in the city known as Hyundai Town operated day and night and workers could make triple South Korea's annual average salary.
But the 52-year-old was laid off in January, joining some 27,000 workers and subcontractors who lost their jobs at Hyundai Heavy (KS:009540) between 2015 and 2017 as ship orders plunged.
To support their family, Lee's wife took a minimum wage job at a  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) supplier. His 20-year-old daughter, who entered a Hyundai Heavy-affiliated university hoping to land a job in Ulsan, is now looking for work elsewhere.
The Lee family's fortunes mirror the decline of Ulsan, which is now reeling from Chinese competition, rising labor costs and its over-reliance on Hyundai - one of the giant, family-run conglomerates or chaebol that dominate South Korea. 
Generations of Hyundai workers like Lee powered South Korea's transformation from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War to an industrial and manufacturing powerhouse, making the southeastern port of Ulsan the country's richest city by 2007. 
But some experts say the chaebols have now become complacent and risk averse, failing to keep pace with their overseas competitors.
South Korea's focus on exports has also made Asia's fourth-largest economy vulnerable to growing protectionism by major trade partners and other external shocks. 
""Hyundai was everything to me. I feel hopeless,” Lee said at his apartment, a high-rise complex popular with Hyundai Motor workers 10 km (6 miles) from the automaker's factory.
With young people fleeing in search of jobs, Ulsan is now the fastest-aging city in the country, according to Statistics Korea. The city's population of 1.1 million has more than quadrupled since 1970, but fell for the first time in 2016 even as population grew in the rest of the country.
ONCE A PROSPEROUS COMPANY TOWN 
In many ways, the challenges facing Ulsan mirror those faced in the American Midwest in the 1970s and 1980s, when the once prosperous industrial heartland was hit by massive job and population losses. 
Some experts and industry executive warn Ulsan - home to the world's biggest shipbuilder and largest carmaking complex - might be South Korea's 'Rust Belt' in the making.
“It could be worse here, since it's all about Hyundai and its suppliers,"" said Mo Jong-ryn, a professor of international political economics at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""There is no alternative."" 
Legendary businessman Chung Ju-yung founded Hyundai Motor in Ulsan in 1967 and Hyundai Heavy six years later, turning the small fishing village known for whale hunting into a giant company town.
For decades, job seekers flocked to the city, drawn by high wages, company-subsidized housing and generous benefits.
Hyundai's dominance is still keenly felt. Workers wearing gray Hyundai uniforms drive Hyundai cars, shop at Hyundai department stores, live in Hyundai apartments and go to Hyundai hospitals for medical service. Their children go to Hyundai schools and universities.
In the wake of the downturn, Hyundai Heavy has been selling assets such an employees’ dormitory, and a large foreign community complex it used for clients such as  BP  (LON:BP) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and their families, officials say. The foreigners' complex featured townhouses, a golf course, a swimming pool and school. 
A spokesman said Hyundai Heavy was doing its utmost to ""normalize our company"", working with labor unions to address a lack of work and an idled workforce.
Ripples from Hyundai's struggles spread throughout Ulsan.
Eom Soon-ui runs a small noodle place in a traditional market blocks away from Hyundai Heavy's headquarters. One recent workday, the market was mostly empty, with about a dozen restaurants as well as uniform shops catering to shipyard workers closed.
“Hyundai makes or breaks for merchants like us. They're doing poorly, so I'm struggling to make ends meet,"" she said.
Ulsan accounted for 12 percent of South Korea's exports last year, the lowest since 2000 and down from its peak of 19 percent in 2008, according to customs data.
The city also has seen a rising number of suicides and now has the highest suicide rate in the country for those aged between 25 and 29, according to Statistics Korea.
Ulsan University Hospital, run by Hyundai Heavy, recorded 182 suicide attempts in the first half of this year, compared to about 150 a year earlier, a hospital official said.
Taxi drivers have been told by police not to drop people off on Ulsan's newly built bridge after three people killed themselves there in just one month.
""People believed that if they work hard, they will be better off, and if their children study hard, they will be better off,"" said Park Sang-hoon, an official at an Ulsan suicide prevention center. ""Confronting a different reality now, it seems that many of them are getting to a point of hopelessness, and some are even making extreme choices."" 
DOMINANT AT HOME, BUT FALTERING ABROAD
After massive shipbuilding job losses, auto workers fear it could be their turn next.
Hyundai Motor has been already moving some production offshore, and an internal forecast seen by Reuters shows domestic output is expected to fall to 37 percent this year, down from nearly 80 percent in 2004.
Executives say that's necessary because of high labor costs and strong unions at home. 
But workers say many of Hyundai's problems are its own making, like failing to forecast a SUV boom in the key U.S. market and missing the shift to electric cars. 
Hyundai Motors declined to comment for this story. Earlier this year, it pledged to hire 45,000 across the group over the next five years and invest heavily in new businesses including “wearable robots” and artificial intelligence. 
However, some experts say South Korea's reliance on a few powerful chaebol is holding the country back. 
South Korea’s top 10 conglomerates had revenue equivalent to 66 percent of the country's gross domestic product in 2017. By comparison, the combined revenue of America's top 500 companies was 65 percent of U.S. GDP, according to Fortune magazine's annual survey last year.
“South Korea’s chaebol have been complacent,” said Lee Dong-gull, the chairman of state-run Korea Development Bank.
Because of their near monopolistic market positions at home, conglomerates have been reluctant to take risks and slower to innovate, Lee said.
Faltering in key overseas markets, South Korea forecasts export growth will slow to 5.3 percent in 2018 and 2.5 percent next year, from 15.8 percent last year.
NO LONGER A PARADISE
That means more pain for Ulsan and other exports hubs. 
South Korean President Moon designated Ulsan and several other cities as “industrial crisis zones"" in May, setting aside 1 trillion won ($890 million) this year to support affected workers and suppliers, and to promote new industries.
Moon says the chaebol-oriented economic policy has reached its limit, and has widened the gap between haves and have-nots.
Under a new policy of “innovative growth"", Seoul is boosting investment in fuel cells and self-driving cars, “smart factories” and drones, as well as artificial intelligence, the internet of the things and big data.
Long-time Hyundai men say they aren't feeling benefits of the new policy.
Lee, the former Hyundai Heavy worker, learned painting and molding to do home interior work, but is struggling to find a job because the downturn has also hit the real estate sector.
Ha M.H., who came to Ulsan in 1982, said he is leaving Hyundai Heavy in August after 36 years, because the company's backlog for offshore platforms has run dry.

“Foreign inspectors from Scotland and elsewhere who used to work here in good old days still call Ulsan a paradise,"" Ha said. ""All of my friends have left, and I am the last man standing.""

736,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Arabia's PIF has shown no interest in bankrolling Tesla buyout - sources,"By Saeed Azhar, Marwa Rashad and Pamela Barbaglia
DUBAI/RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has shown no interest so far in financing Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's proposed $72 billion deal to take the U.S. electric car maker private, despite acquiring a minority stake in the company this year, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The 47-year-old investor and engineer stunned financial markets on Tuesday when he said on Twitter that he was considering a take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world's first luxury all-electric sedan car. He also said he had secured funding for the proposal, without providing details.
Investors and analysts viewed PIF as a natural financing partner. Beyond amassing a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, the sovereign wealth fund has poured tens of billions of dollars into technology investments, including $45 billion in SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Vision Fund over five years.
However, a source who is familiar with PIF's strategy said it was not currently getting involved in any funding process for Tesla's take-private deal.
A second source close to the situation also said PIF was not taking part in any such plan at this stage. This source said that the Saudi fund would not make an investment of this kind without seeking guidance first from Softbank. According to separate sources who spoke to Reuters last week, Softbank is currently not pursuing an investment in Tesla given its investment earlier this year in rival GM Cruise.
Pressure is mounting on Musk to produce details of his financing plan.
Bloomberg reported on Sunday that PIF is in talks that could see it become a significant investor in Tesla as part of the take-private plan but has made no firm decision, citing people with knowledge of the fund's plans. 
Tesla's board has not received a detailed financing plan from Musk and is seeking more information, sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The board will make a decision on whether to hire advisers and launch a formal review of Musk's take-private proposal in the coming days, based on how much detail on the financing plan it receives from Musk, another source said.
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for PIF was not immediately available for comment. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Musk.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Tesla to ask about Musk's assertion on Twitter that funding for his proposed deal was ""secured"", the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
Tesla is facing a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company, as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Mercedes, Audi, BMW and other rivals.
Taking Tesla private would remove the pressure from Musk coming from hedge funds betting that the company's stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow. It would also remove the company from the glare of Wall Street that comes with reporting quarterly earnings publicly.
In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla.
Musk has also said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent in a buyout deal, and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose.
Investment bankers and analysts have so far reacted with scepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.
Some analysts have suggested that Musk could convince Tesla's top shareholders, such as Fidelity Investments and China's Tencent, to roll their equity stakes into the deal, thereby significantly reducing the amount of money needed to be raised.

However, the deal structure would come with big logistical and legal challenges when it comes to buying out smaller shareholders, analysts have said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump backed boycotting American motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Sunday, the latest salvo in a dispute between the company and Trump over tariffs on steel.
The Wisconsin-based motorcycle manufacturer announced a plan earlier this year to move production of motorcycles for the European Union from the United States to its overseas facilities to avoid the tariffs imposed by the trading bloc in retaliation for Trump's duties on steel and aluminum imports. 
In response, Trump has criticized Harley Davidson, calling for higher, targeted taxes and threatening to lure foreign producers to the United States to increase competition.
""Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction, including Harley competitors. A really bad move! U.S. will soon have a level playing field, or better,"" Trump said in a Twitter post.
Harley Davidson has repeatedly declined to comment on Trump's remarks over the course of the dispute. The company could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday. 
Harley has forecast that the EU tariffs would cost the company about $30 million to $45 million for the remainder of 2018 and $90 million to $100 million on a full-year basis.
Trump met Saturday with a group of bikers who support him, posing for pictures with about 180 bikers at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on vacation. 

Motorcycle companies based outside the United States include Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Yamaha Corp (T:7951), Europe's BMW (DE:BMWG) and Ducati as well as India's  Hero MotoCorp  Ltd (NS:HROM),  Bajaj Auto  Ltd (NS:BAJA), among others.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will further decrease its holdings of U.S. securities in response to new sanctions against Moscow but has no plans to shut down U.S. companies in Russia, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on state TV on Sunday, RIA news agency reported.
On Friday, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would regard any U.S. move to curb the activities of its banks as a ""declaration of economic war"" and would take retaliatory action.
Washington said on Wednesday it would impose fresh sanctions by the end of August after it determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, sending Russia's rouble currency to a two-year low.
Speaking on a weekly TV talk show, Siluanov said the new U.S. sanctions, some of which could restrict purchases of Russian government bonds, were ""unpleasant but not fatal"".
""We have lowered to the minimum level and will further decrease our investment in the U.S. economy, in the U.S. securities,"" Siluanov said, shedding light on the nature of an unexpected drop in Russia's holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds.
Russia has ditched its holdings of U.S. Treasuries in the past few months as relations between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated, data showed last month.
Russia will also have more settlement in roubles and other currencies, such as the euro, than in dollars, Siluanov said.
""Eventually, this will negatively impact U.S. investors. But we are not planning now any limitations such as shutting down McDonalds,"" Siluanov said. He referred to calls by some lawmakers to shut down prominent U.S. companies in Russia starting from 2014, when relations with the West soured over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine's crisis.
""Our citizens work in these companies, these companies pay taxes into the budget of our country,"" Siluanov said.
While admitting that U.S. sanctions would boost inflation in Russia as they hurt the rouble, Siluanov said there were no plans to ban using the dollar in Russia.

""Of course, the government has no such plans. That would be a step to an impasse.""

Le Monde this week reported that Air France-KLM's nominations committee had picked Canadian Benjamin Smith as its top candidate to head the airline at a time the French brand, Air France, is struggling to cut costs amid union opposition.
The group has not denied Smith is a candidate, saying only that no decision has been made yet.  Air Canada  (TO:AC) has made no comment.
""It might be useful to say what Air France does not need: enough with candidates who are ambassadors for external interests,"" Paul Farges, a board director representing employee shareholders, wrote in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper.
Farges' comments highlight the opposition among Air France staff to any new chief who might ride roughshod over their demands, in particular over higher pay, and focus on cost-cutting rather than restoring the Franco-Dutch group's reputation as a leading aviation player.
The French state is the biggest shareholder in Air France-KLM with a stake of about 14 percent. Delta Airlines  (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines  (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.
Senior French officials say President Emmanuel Macron is open to considering a non-French national to lead the group for the first time. The appointment is seen as a test of Macron's resolve for the state to take a lighter touch on the economy.
Referring to the potential pick of a North American boss, Farges wrote: ""Would France not be renouncing its air sovereignty at a time each country is bitterly defending the economic interests of its companies?""
Air-France-KLM has been hunting for a CEO since the abrupt departure three months ago of Jean-Marc Janaillac, who quit after pilots led a revolt against a pay offer aimed at ending costly strikes.
Air France needs to cut costs, as its sister brand has, to keep up with leaner rivals in Europe including British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and compete with the rise of low-cost carriers and Gulf carriers.
Farges said Air France workers were not to blame for the challenges facing the unit.
""Air France's difficulties this summer are not related to a failure of employees, but to the attrition of the fleet at a time when the growth of the market requires increasing the volume of supply and staff,"" he said. 

An eventual vote on a new CEO will go to the 18-strong board of directors.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. tells China's HNA to sell stake in NYC building near Trump Tower: WSJ,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. government has ordered Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] to sell its majority stake in a Manhattan building whose tenants include a police precinct tasked with protecting Trump Tower, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments to weigh whether they present national security concerns, informed HNA several months ago that it had to divest itself of its holding in the building, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
CFIUS however did not explain to the aviation-to-financial services conglomerate why it had to sell the property, according to the report. 
At the behest of CFIUS, HNA set up a blind trust and transferred its stake in the building to the trust that has its own board of directors, which have a fiduciary duty to the trust, not to HNA, the report said. 
HNA is now in talks with potential buyers interested in the building to abide by the CFIUS order, though it was not given a deadline to sell, the report added. 
CFIUS is an interagency U.S. government body whose chair is the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. Asked on Saturday about the Journal report, a Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment, saying the department does not comment on specific CFIUS cases.
An HNA spokesman, asked by Reuters for comment on Saturday, referred to a statement it gave on Thursday, which said that ""there is no seizure or forced sale of 850 Third Avenue underway or pending."" 
""There are unique facts and circumstances regarding the location of this particular property that did not exist at the time of purchase which have raised certain concerns, and HNA Group is taking measured steps to address them,” he said. 
The group in 2016 acquired a 90 percent stake in the building, valued at $463 million, months before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. 
The building, located a few blocks from Trump Tower, houses the New York Police Department’s 17th precinct, whose duties include security for Trump Tower, said the report. It is among a handful of investments HNA made on a $50 billion acquisition spree in recent years. Trump maintains a residence in Trump Tower.
The CFIUS order also comes as the cash-strapped Chinese group has been shedding non-core assets such as real estate to slash the massive debt it accumulated from its shopping spree.

Earlier this week, HNA sold a 30 percent stake in aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings to Janpan's Orix for $2.2 billion. It also agreed to sell Radisson Holdings Inc to a consortium led by Chinese hospitality group Jin Jiang International Holdings Co.

DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) needs a broad overhaul in strategy carried about by a new external chief executive, as mid-term targets announced this week will not be enough to put the German group back on track, according to one of its investors.
Union Investment owns just a 0.2 percent stake in Thyssenkrupp, worth about $28 million, but has been one of the most critical shareholders of the steel-to-submarines conglomerate and repeatedly urged management to seek a deeper restructuring.
""Thyssenkrupp needs a strategy shift. This is easier to achieve when someone new comes in from the outside,"" fund manager Ingo Speich said in the first public comments by an investor after the group published 2020/21 targets on Wednesday.
That included margin goals for the group's four divisions, but drew a muted market response as analysts pointed out that they were only in line with consensus forecasts.
""They won't move the needle in capital markets. There, the main questions are who the new CEO will be and what the strategy is going to look like,"" Speich said.
Thyssenkrupp has been thrown into turmoil after both its CEO and chairman resigned in July, under pressure from shareholders to revive the group's share price, which has fallen a third since 2011.
A profit warning last week has deepened the crisis for interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who served as finance chief but has taken the helm until a long-term successor for Heinrich Hiesinger is found.
Former Thyssenkrupp finance chief Stefan Kirsten, former  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) board member Siegfried Russwurm and  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG) CEO Matthias Zachert have been tipped as potential candidates.
""(Kerkhoff) stands for the old strategy. It would send a stronger signal to capital markets if the new CEO came from the outside,"" Speich said. ""A good combination could be a new external CEO who will be supported by Kerkhoff.""
Speich, along with larger shareholders Cevian and Elliott, is not in favor of an outright break-up of the group but said there should be a more active management of its portfolio.
""This includes replacing some areas or strengthening them via acquisitions. This could also result in the addition of jobs,"" he said.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:03PM ET</span>","Lawsuits accuse Tesla's Musk of fraud over tweets, going-private proposal","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Chief Executive Elon Musk were sued twice on Friday by investors who said they fraudulently engineered a scheme to squeeze short-sellers, including through Musk's proposal to take the electric car company private.
The lawsuits were filed three days after Musk stunned investors by announcing on Twitter that he might take Tesla private in a record $72 billion transaction that valued the company at $420 per share, and that ""funding"" had been ""secured.""
In one of the lawsuits, the plaintiff Kalman Isaacs said Musk's tweets were false and misleading, and together with Tesla's failure to correct them amounted to a ""nuclear attack"" designed to ""completely decimate"" short-sellers.
The lawsuits filed by Isaacs and William Chamberlain said Musk's and Tesla's conduct artificially inflated Tesla's stock price and violated federal securities laws.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed class-action complaints filed in the federal court in San Francisco. The company is based in nearby Palo Alto, California.
Short-sellers borrow shares they believe are overpriced, sell them, and then repurchase shares later at what they hope will be a lower price to make a profit.
Such investors have long been an irritant for Musk, who has sometimes used Twitter to criticize them.
Musk's Aug. 7 tweets helped push Tesla's stock price more than 13 percent above the prior day's close.
The stock has since given back more than two-thirds of that gain, in part following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had begun inquiring about Musk's activity.
Musk has not offered evidence that he has lined up the necessary funding to take Tesla private, and the complaints did not offer proof to the contrary.
But Isaacs said Tesla's and Musk's conduct caused the volatility that cost short-sellers hundreds of millions of dollars from having to cover their short positions, and caused all Tesla securities purchasers to pay inflated prices.
Tesla's market value exceeds $60 billion, and its shares closed Friday up $3.04 at $355.49.
According to his complaint, Isaacs bought 3,000 Tesla shares on Aug. 8 to cover his short position.
The proposed class period in Isaacs' lawsuit runs from the afternoon of Aug. 7 through the next day, and in Chamberlain's lawsuit runs from Aug. 7 to Aug. 10.

The company will cut royalties, food-service pricing and online fees through 2018, while also funding the rebranding of the chain.
This comes days after the company said its North American comparable sales for July had fallen 10.5 percent and would continue falling in the coming months.
Founder John Schnatter resigned as chairman of the board in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call.
""We appreciate the assistance being extended to our franchisees and believe the assistance program will help mitigate the impact that the founder's inexcusable words and actions have had on franchisees,"" Vaughn Frey, president of Papa John's Franchise Association said in a statement.

(Reuters) - The union that represents many  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) employees announced the ratification of a four-year extension of their labor contracts on Friday, paving the way for an 11.2 percent increase in wages over the four years.
Verizon and the union workers agreed to the deal well in advance of the current contracts' expiration in August 2019, seeking to avoid another conflict that prompted strikes in 2016. 
The new contracts, which cover 34,000 employees in northeast and mid-Atlantic regions served by the largest U.S. wireless network, also include better retirement benefits, the Communications Workers of America said in a statement.
Separate agreements were also approved to cover certain Verizon retail workers in New York and Pennsylvania, the union said.
Verizon said in an email to employees that it was ""pleased that these agreements have been ratified.""

Employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have not yet completed the ratification process, but Verizon said in an email that it expects the process to be completed next week.

The lawsuit, filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), said United failed to prevent and correct the pilot's behavior, even after the flight attendant made numerous complaints. 
United said in an emailed statement that it had reviewed the allegations in the complaint and disagreed with the EEOC's description of the situation, without providing further detail.
""United does not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace and will vigorously defend against this case,"" spokeswoman Erin Benson said in the statement. She said the airline could not comment further. The EEOC could not be reached for a response. 
The flight attendant and pilot were in a relationship while working for the airline. She ended the relationship after he refused to stop the posts, which included her name, occupation and home airport, the lawsuit said.
According to the complaint, one post told prospective airline passengers to ""look for her when you fly!"" because she was the ""new reason to 'Fly the Friendly Skies,'"" in reference to United's advertising slogan.
The posts, made on various websites, were seen by co-workers and adversely affected the flight attendant's working environment, according to the lawsuit. 
The EEOC is seeking damages for the flight attendant and asked the court to order United to eliminate and prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.

According to the lawsuit, the pilot retired in 2016. United declined to comment.

MACUSPANA, Mexico (Reuters) - In the swampy wetlands of southern Mexico, officials and researchers are struggling to explain the deaths of dozens of manatees, the chubby marine mammals once confused with mermaids by ancient mariners.
Fishermen who navigate the muddy waters inland from the coast of Tabasco state have discovered since May at least 28 dead West Indian manatees, also known as sea cows, along the Bitzal River and nearby streams. 
The cause of the deaths remains a mystery. Locals report deaths of fish in the river and blame polluted water in an area that is near onshore and offshore drilling projects operated by national oil company Pemex. 
The company says tests show no contamination in the area. 
Other scientists wonder if the deaths of the placid animals, which divide their time between the ocean and inland rivers, are related to wider changes in the climate and rising sea levels. 
""Whenever you see a die-off like this of a long-lived animal, it can be a canary in a coal mine,"" said David Gonzalez-Socoloske, a tropical mammal ecologist at Andrews University, a small private college located in Berrien Springs, Michigan.
""Beyond the concern for the species, it tells you that something is going on with the environment,"" he said.
Across the Gulf of Mexico in Florida, 92 manatees have died since January within an area where the growth of microscopic algae has caused a harmful ""red tide,"" according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
But the same type of algae, which only grows in sea water, cannot grow in Tabasco's fresh water where manatees have been perishing, said Ricardo Aguilar of Mexican wildlife advocacy group AZCARM. ""The only relation is that the animals dying are manatees,"" Aguilar said.
Desperate to prevent more deaths while they investigate the cause, wildlife authorities in Mexico have vowed to capture and transfer about 30 of the gentle herbivores to a nearby nature reserve. 
But capturing a manatee, which can weigh up to 1,100 pounds (500 kg), is difficult, said Leon Olivera-Gomez, a marine specialist at the Autonomous University of Tabasco and the rescue mission's lead scientist.
Before the capture, Olivera-Gomez said scientists use sonar to locate the animal. Then, a group of some 20 people on wooden boats surround and trap it with large fishing nets.
So far, the scientists have caught just two adults and a calf.
VULNERABLE POPULATION
Olivera-Gomez said around 500 manatees, which are distantly related to elephants, are believed to live in Tabasco's waterways. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a leading wildlife conservation group, describes the population as vulnerable.
Past efforts in Mexico to save threatened marine mammals have seen mixed results. 
In a bid last year to save the vaquita, a pint-sized porpoise that swims in the Gulf of California, two of the critically endangered animals were placed in a breeding program, but one died in captivity.
The manatee deaths highlight threats to the Gulf's lowland wetlands, which have historically been defined by seasonal rains and dry spells that scientists say will grow more extreme as global sea levels rise. 
Climate swings, Gonzalez-Socoloske added, can make animals like manatees less resilient to disease-causing pathogens.
Tests around the district of Macuspana, the birthplace of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, plus waterways in Centla and Jonuta, have not shown any spills from oil activity, Pemex said in a statement on Tuesday.
Last month, Mexico's water authority CONAGUA collected samples from the Bitzal lagoon and said the water did not contain high enough levels of oil, metals or pesticides to explain the deaths.
However, Dennis Potenciano, 43, the leader of the fishing cooperative in Macuspana, home to around 700 fishing families, said oil contamination has killed numerous fish and made the water undrinkable.
""The government doesn't tell us anything,"" he said. ""They treat us as if we are illiterate.""

""We aren't catching anything because the river is so contaminated,"" he said, on the grassy edge of a shallow waterway where he and friends found 12 dead manatees, flies swarming around their stiff, upturned flippers.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:54PM ET</span>",Wall Street ends lower as Turkey woes hit banks,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and James Thorne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Friday as a deepening economic crisis in Turkey dragged on bank shares and triggered a move out of riskier assets.
The Dow and S&P 500 posted declines for the week following five straight weeks of gains, but the S&P 500 remains just 1.4 percent below its record high from Jan. 26.
A drop in technology shares added to the day's bearish tone. The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) fell 0.8 percent, with Intel (O:INTC) down 2.6 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to ""sell."" 
Microchip Technology (O:MCHP) shares fell 10.9 percent after a disappointing second-quarter revenue forecast.
A slump in the Turkish lira  worsened after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the country.
Investors fled to safe-haven assets, pushing the dollar (DXY) higher and weighing on U.S. bond yields (US10YT=RR).
""It was a classic risk-off move,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in New Jersey. ""You worry about the collateral damage. You worry about the effects on Europe. You have banks losing because the 10-year U.S. Treasury (yield) came down.""
The S&P financial index (SPSY) fell 1.2 percent, among the biggest drags on the S&P 500. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 196.09 points, or 0.77 percent, to 25,313.14, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 20.3 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,833.28 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 52.67 points, or 0.67 percent, to 7,839.11.
For the week, the Dow fell 0.6 percent and the S&P 500 dipped 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq gained 0.3 percent for the week after strong gains in some technology shares.
 Citigroup  (N:C), the most global of the major U.S. banks, fell 2.4 percent. JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC) were also lower.
""Any time that there's any movement in currencies, financials tend to reap the contagion risks,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.
Shares of trade-sensitive companies also declined, including Boeing (N:BA), 3M (N:MMM) and  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), which were all down at least 1 percent.
Tesla (O:TSLA) shares ended up 0.9 percent. The number of Tesla shares sold short rebounded and are now higher than before Chief Executive Elon Musk on Tuesday proposed taking the electric car maker private, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.
Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer prices rose in July and the underlying trend continued to strengthen, pointing to a steady increase in inflation pressures.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 102 new lows.

About 6.7 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.4 billion-share daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

771,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Turkish Currency Weakness Hits Global Bank Stocks
As we’ve seen with Greece and other countries, a national economic crisis can quickly turn into a global economic problem. And now social media can add to those worries in an instant.
The Turkish lira hit an all-time low against the dollar Friday. The currency was already struggling when U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted he was doubling down on tariffs on the country.
USD/TRY hit an all-time high of 6.6170 during Friday’s session.



“I have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar!” Trump proclaimed via his Twitter account, noting that the tariff on aluminum would now be 20%, while the levy on steel would rise to 50%.
The currency’s decline raised fears about how much exposure banks have to Turkey. European banks have the most exposure, but U.S. banks are owed about $18 billion, according to the Bank of International Settlements.
Analysts, however, were quick to downplay the impact on European banks, citing most of the exposure was to Turkish equity, and not a falling lira.
U.S. financial stocks struggled as a result and the overall market finished the day in the red.
2. Elon Musk Tweet Leads Tesla on a Wild Ride
Speaking of tweets that shook markets, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares had a wild ride this week after co-founder and CEO Elon Musk tweeted (out of the blue) he was considering taking the company private and had the funding to do so.
On Tuesday, during market hours, Musk wrote: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""



Musk issued a public statement to employees later in the day making the case for a private Tesla, calling wild stock price swings a “major distraction,” saying hitting quarterly objectives might not be good long-term decisions and adding that the large short position gives people incentives to “attack” the company.
The next day, the Tesla board confirmed there was a discussion about taking the company private, which would be a deal worth about $72 billion. On Friday, Reuters reported that the board had not received a detailed financing plan from Musk.
With all this news, the stock, while jumping around sharply through the week, ended barely higher for the week.
Shares closed Friday at $355.49, compared with the Friday Aug. 3 close of $348.17.
3. Inflation Numbers Still Support Fed Plan
Inflation measures dominated the economic calendar this week and, overall, there was little to change the market’s belief that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates two more times this year.
The market expects a rate hike at the September and December meetings, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Those worried about overheating prices could relax some Thursday, when the producer price index (PPI) came in flat, month over month, confounding expectations for a rise.
But consumer price data out Friday raised some red flags, with the core consumer price index (CPI) hotter than expected year over year.
“The annualized core figure is now at its highest level since 2008,” Marvin Loh, senior global market strategist at BNY Mellon, wrote in a note.
Stagnant wages in the face of rising prices were also a concern.
“The recent gains in inflation have essentially outstripped any wage gains, even as the unemployment rate is likely to hit low levels not seen since the 1960 in the coming months,” Loh wrote.
4. Oil Posts Another Loss for the Week
Oil prices fell to a sixth-straight weekly loss, as bearish data overcame concerns about a global supply shortage.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by 1.351 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 3, missing expectations for a draw of 2.800 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday.
On Friday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) raised its estimate of world oil demand growth next year to 1.5 million barrels a day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd.
The IEA also warned that upcoming oil sanctions against Iran could bring turmoil to the market later in the year. U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil are expected in early November and could increase the potential of a global energy supply shortage.
""As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,"" the IEA said.
But the IEA also said non-OPEC production would continue to rise, led by U.S. producers. The IEA raised its estimate for growth in non-OPEC oil output next year to 1.9 million bpd day, from 1.8 million bpd in its previous report.
5. Snap Can’t Snap Social Media’s Bad Streak
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was the latest social media company to disappoint Wall Street when it reported numbers this week.
The operator of Snapchat’s quarterly loss was narrower than expected and the company beat revenue forecasts. That was enough to boost shares just after it reported after hours.
But by the time the stock opened, pessimism had taken over. Daily active users were down in the second quarter, compared with the first, and also missed estimates.
Still, Snap wasn’t punished nearly as much as heavyweights Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Shares ended down about 3.5% for the week."
772,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Posts Triple-Digit Loss as Turkey Turmoil Spooks Markets,"Investing.com - The Dow fell sharply Friday on fears a rout of the Turkish lira could have an overarching impact on the global economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.77%. The S&P 500 fell 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.67%.
The lira dropped to a record low against the dollar after President Donald Trump doubled metals tariffs on Turkey, exacerbating investor concerns about Turkey's ability to pay its debts.
That left many fearing the fallout could spread beyond Turkey's border, prompting traders to abandon riskier assets like stocks in search of safe-havens like gold, yen and Treasuries.
Volatility, as measured by the so-called fear index VIX, rose nearly 17%, underlying investor concerns about the broader impact of a possible crash in Turkey's economy.
The exposure to a slump in Turkey's economy is ""pretty international,"" though limited to the banking sector, said Tim Ash, a senior EM strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.
Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed that Japanese banks are owed $14 billion, U.K. lenders $19.2 billion and the United States about $18 billion.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fell 0.98%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) fell 1.78% and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fell 2.12%, dragging financials lower and weighing on the major averages.
Corporate earnings, which have mostly offset geopolitical uncertainty amid ongoing concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade war, added little support to sentiment on equities.
Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) stock closed down nearly 10%, despite posting better-than-expected revenue and earnings a day earlier as investors digested news that Chief Operating Officer Dennis Woodside was stepping down.
 Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) stock closed nearly 8% higher, shrugging off its wider-than-expected quarterly loss as the company revealed a private equity firm had bought a stake in the company.
Energy was the sole sector to close above breakeven as oil prices settled higher Friday on expectations for both a rebound in oil demand growth and steeper losses of Iranian crude from the market.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for September rose 82 cents to settle at $67.63 a barrel,
Economic data, meanwhile, showing upbeat consumer inflation and reaffirming investor expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike rates twice more this year, did little to lift stocks.
The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index  rose 0.2% last month and core CPI rose 2.4%, beating economists' estimates.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Automakers balk at U.S. request for confidential info for import probe,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two automotive trade groups on Friday raised ""significant concerns"" over the U.S. government's request for confidential business information as it probes whether automotive imports pose a national security risk, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The U.S. Commerce Department survey demands sweeping details on operations of major U.S. and foreign automakers, including planned changes to U.S. facilities, revenue for specific classes of products and use of auto parts. The survey says companies that do not comply could face fines or criminal charges.
The Commerce Department opened an investigation in May into whether imported autos and parts pose a national security risk. This drew sharp criticism from automakers, foreign governments, dealers, parts suppliers and others who warned that proposed tariffs on imported cars and parts could hike vehicle costs, hurting auto sales and industry jobs. 
Automakers, many of which face Monday deadlines to comply with the survey, have said there is no evidence auto imports pose a national security risk. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, one of the two groups that sent the letter Friday, said in July that tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
Administration officials and congressional aides have said the probe was partly designed to win concessions during talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. 
The auto trade groups, which represent General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Honda Motor Co (T:7267),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and other major automakers, warned in the letter that the companies have ""grave concerns"" that releasing confidential information would have a ""seriously adverse impact"" and questioned whether the government would ensure the information was kept secret.
The automakers challenged the department's assertion that President Donald Trump could opt to release some information submitted by automakers under the 1950 Defense Production Act. They also questioned the government's precautions in keeping survey data confidential and said the survey suffers from ""several procedural defects.""
Commerce officials on Friday dismissed the automakers' concerns, saying the department ""routinely requests, and accordingly, safeguards firms' confidential data in both its trade cases and as part of its industry surveys.""
The survey wants the average value of U.S. auto parts content for passenger cars, trucks, SUVs and vans. It demands automakers disclose gross profits for U.S. operations and asks them to rate suppliers and disclose ""how important price, tariffs, product availability, and performance/quality are in deciding to use this supplier.""

It also asks whether vehicle imports have resulted in ""any negative effects.""

(Reuters) - Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL] expects a single-digit percentage increase in its U.S. capacity in 2018, a company executive said on Friday, as sales rebound after travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration weakened demand from the Middle East early last year.
Matt Schmid, senior vice president, Emirates North America, said by phone from Toronto that travel demand to and from the United States is back at levels from before January 2017. 
Emirates has already increased the number of flights on some U.S. routes it had reduced in spring 2017 after U.S. government travel restrictions weakened demand.
""Now we are really back on track,"" he said. ""Demand is extremely strong again.""
The carrier is also adding capacity in Canada, expanding its A380 service to the country's largest city, Toronto, effective Aug. 18.
Schmid said Toronto has one of the airline network's highest seat load factors, or percentage of available seat capacity filled with passengers. 
""There is very strong demand between Toronto and Dubai and between Toronto and the key destinations we serve beyond Dubai,"" he said.
Emirates is expanding its Canadian network at a time when Saudi Arabia's state carrier has suspended flights to and from Toronto. The oil-producing giant recently froze new trade and investment with Canada following a diplomatic row when Ottawa urged Riyadh to free arrested rights activists.
Emirates has said it does not comment on intergovernmental affairs.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 03:17PM ET</span>",Energy executives lament Trump tariffs as costs rise on pipeline projects,"By Collin Eaton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Turkey could push up costs even further for domestic oil and gas pipeline projects, as energy executives said they were already struggling from earlier tariff rises. 
There are more than a dozen U.S. energy pipelines on the drawing board, some of which are still seeking financing. The projects would pave the way for greater U.S. oil and gas exports and relieve a bottleneck in West Texas shale fields that is starting to pinch output in the region.
Turkey delivers just 4 percent of steel mill imports, valued about $1.18 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. But doubling tariffs on a supplier could force buyers to turn to other steel makers and, in turn, lift steel prices that have already ballooned in recent months. 
On Friday, Trump authorized a doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports - to 50 percent and 20 percent, respectively - ratcheting up a diplomatic dispute with the NATO-member country.
The Trump administration's original move in March to raise tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports was proposed to safeguard U.S. jobs against overseas rivals.
That had already added $40 million to the cost of a Plains All American (N:PAA) crude oil pipeline that will use steel supplied by a Greek company, Plains executives said. 
""We are moving forward with the project, but believe that imposing a tax on pre-existing orders is unjust, especially considering the specific materials we purchased abroad were not readily available in the U.S.,"" Willie Chiang, Plains' chief operating officer, said on Tuesday.
The trade actions ""threaten important energy infrastructure projects,"" said Catherine Landry, a vice president at trade group Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. Companies were ""being unfairly punished for participating in international trade,"" she said.
 Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI), the second largest North American pipeline operator, had already ordered nearly half of the specialized pipe needed for its Gulf Coast Express project from Turkish steel maker  Borusan Mannesmann  (IS:BRSAN) before the original tariff went into effect, spokeswoman Sara Hughes said.
The Houston-based company on Friday declined to comment on the impact on the project of the doubling of the tariff. The $1.75 billion Gulf Coast Express is a natural gas line being constructed from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Kinder Morgan had applied to the U.S. Commerce Department for an exemption to the original, 25 percent tariff but had not yet received a decision, the spokeswoman added.
Alan Madison, a spokesman for Borusan Mannesmann's U.S. subsidiary, said the company and its Turkish parent were still studying Trump's new proposal and declined to comment further.
The Turkish currency fell more than 18 percent on Friday, increasing its costs to import raw materials, but making exports relatively cheaper. 
""The Turks can export to many other countries, but with a weak lira, their products become cheaper to buy. The cheap lira actually can help increase their export volume,"" said George Gero, a managing director at RBC Wealth Management who follows metals markets. 

Steel futures on Friday were up 1 percent at $907 per ton on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but are up 46 percent from $621 per ton a year ago.

784,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Turkey Financial Crisis Erupts, Stoking Concerns of Contagion","(Bloomberg) -- Turkey entered a full-blown financial meltdown on Friday, sending tremors through global markets, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared his refusal to bow to U.S. political demands and market pressures.
The unraveling was swift, highlighting the fragility of Turkey’s economy after years of a growth-at-all-costs policy bias that left its companies saddled with hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt. The lira plunged as much as 17 percent on Friday alone, bringing its loss for the year to 42 percent and raising the specter of contagion into Europe and across other emerging markets.
While the trigger was U.S. sanctions for Turkey’s imprisonment of an American pastor, many investors say the $900 billion economy was already headed toward a cliff, and only needed a push. The sell-off represented a vote of no-confidence in a new system of government that handed Erdogan unrivaled authority, essentially paralyzing the bureaucracy in Ankara.
“This is a textbook currency crisis that’s morphing into a debt and liquidity crisis due to policy mistakes,"" said Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “The way things are going, markets need to be prepared for a hard landing in the economy, corporate defaults on foreign currency debt, and possible bank failures.”
With the turmoil in Turkey fueling contagion fears, investors shunned riskier assets and sought safety in developed nations’ bonds. Treasuries and bunds rallied. South Africa’s rand, the Argentine peso and global stocks fell. The euro sank as much as 1.2 percent to the weakest in a year against the U.S. dollar amid concern about European exposure to Turkish banks.
Extreme Measures
Investors are now saying that only extreme measures could bring Turkey back from the abyss. Previously taboo topics like an international bailout or the imposition of capital controls are now being discussed privately in Turkish financial circles. There were also signs of panic setting in among Turkish citizens. Visits to three different bank branches in Istanbul on Friday indicated that requests for foreign-currency withdrawals had skyrocketed; and each of the three banks reported that they were in need of more cash from headquarters.
If they were intended to calm markets, two speeches by Erdogan and another by his son-in-law, the newly appointed economic czar, had the opposite effect. Erdogan was defiant about Turkish resistance to what he calls a financial attack, though he seemed to pointedly avoid openly escalating tensions with the U.S. or naming President Donald Trump. Berat Albayrak, the minister, gave a presentation largely devoid of figures or specifics.
Erdogan’s Riposte
“Those who assume they can bring us to our knees through economic manipulations don’t know our nation at all,” Erdogan said at his Black Sea hometown of Gumushane, where he was breaking ground for a new roadway. He said Turkey could achieve record economic growth in 2018, “despite all the attacks staged against our country through foreign exchange rates.""
What started as financial turmoil is showing signs of spilling over into the rest of the economy. Turkey’s private companies have borrowed heavily in foreign currencies and now sit on a pile of debt equivalent to about 40 percent of yearly economic output. Over the past year, several of the nation’s largest and most respected conglomerates have requested restructurings of billions of dollars in foreign debt, and more are sure to follow.
“The key to any hope of Turkish stability is the ability for banks to roll over syndicated loans,” said Paul McNamara, a money-manager at GAM UK in London. “So far, that’s been absolutely fine.""
Still, banking shares slid 6.5 percent on the Turkish stock exchange on Friday, bringing their decline this year to 36 percent. Investors are now betting that they’ll be hit by a toxic cocktail of slowing growth, rising bad loans and markedly higher interest rates.
On borrowing costs, investors now believe that Turkey’s central bank will have to flout Erdogan’s desires and announce a significant increase to its benchmark 17.75 percent benchmark rate just to stop the currency’s freefall to levels that had been unimaginable even a month ago.
“Seems like a complete crash, so they need to act now,” said Morten Lund, a strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “The lira will keep falling if they don’t hike rates today.”
An aggressive rate hike by the central bank, on the order of 1,000 basis points, would be a “good start” at this point, according to Paul Greer, a money manager at Fidelity International in London.
On the U.S. side, Trump tweeted his analysis of the situation: ""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!""

804,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>",Russia tells Washington curbs on its banks would be act of economic war,"By Andrew Osborn and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia warned the United States on Friday it would regard any U.S. move to curb the activities of its banks as a ""declaration of economic war"" and would retaliate, as new sanctions took their toll on the rouble and U.S. lawmakers threatened more.
The warning, from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, reflects Russian fears over the impact of new restrictions on its economy and assets, including the rouble which has lost nearly six percent of its value this week on sanctions jitters.
Economists expect the Russian economy to grow by 1.8 percent this year. But if new sanctions proposed by Congress and the State Department are implemented in full, which remains uncertain, some economists fear growth could be almost to zero.
President Vladimir Putin discussed what the Kremlin called ""possible new unfriendly steps by Washington"" with his Security Council on Friday.
Moscow's strategy of trying to improve battered U.S.-Russia ties by attempting to build bridges with President Donald Trump is backfiring after U.S. lawmakers launched a new sanctions drive last week because they fear Trump is too soft on Russia.
That in turn has piled pressure on Trump to show he is tough on Russia ahead of mid-term elections. The State Department announced new sanctions on Wednesday linked to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain in March.
On Friday, the White House strongly condemned the poisoning incident, which a spokesman for Trump's National Security Council called ""a reckless display of contempt for the universally held norm against chemical weapons"".
The new sanctions pushed the rouble to two-year lows and sparked a wider sell-off over fears Russia was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complained about the new sanctions in a phone call on Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Separate U.S. legislation introduced last week in draft form by Republican and Democratic senators, dubbed ""the sanctions bill from hell"" by one of its backers, proposes curbs on the operations of several state-owned Russian banks in the United States and restrictions on their use of the dollar.
Medvedev, speaking on a trip to Russia's far east, said: ""I can say one thing: If some ban on banks' operations or on their use of one or another currency follows, it would be possible to clearly call it a declaration of economic war.""
""And it would be necessary, it would be needed to react to this war economically, politically, or, if needed, by other means. And our American friends need to understand this.""
Pro-Putin lawmaker Vyacheslav Nikonov who in 2016 prompted the Russian parliament to erupt in applause when he announced Trump had won the White House, called for a tough response. 
""War is war,"" Nikonov wrote on Twitter. ""We need to rid ourselves of any dependency on our rival as much as possible and stop helping them. Our response must not just be symmetrical but preventative. We need to respond now and toughly."" 
FEW GOOD RETALIATORY OPTIONS 
In practice however, there is little Russia can do to hit back at the United States without damaging its own economy. Officials in Moscow have made clear they do not want to get drawn into what they describe as a mutually-damaging tit-for-tat sanctions war.
The threat of more U.S. sanctions kept the rouble under pressure on Friday, sending it crashing to its lowest level since June 2016 before it recouped some losses.
""The Russian currency has been caught in a perfect storm of weakening crude oil prices and the new U.S. sanctions, in addition to the threat of even tougher punitive measures in the coming months,"" said Lilit Gevorgyan, economist at IHS Markit.
The Russian central bank said the rouble's fall to multi-month lows on news of new U.S. sanctions was a ""natural reaction"" and that it had the necessary tools to prevent any threat to financial stability.
Central bank data showed on Friday it had started buying less foreign currency on Wednesday, the first day of the rouble's slide, to try to tamp down volatility. 
Analysts doubt, however, that the authorities will take much action to support the falling rouble, as they decided not to intervene during a similar sell-off in April, which was also driven by U.S. sanctions. 
The fate of the U.S. bill that would tighten sanctions much further is not certain. The full U.S. Congress will not be back in Washington until September, and congressional aides said they did not expect the measure to pass in its entirety. 

While it was difficult to assess so far in advance, they said it was more likely that only some of its provisions would be included as amendments in another piece of legislation, such as a spending bill Congress must pass before Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Tesla short-sellers back in force as shares remain shaky,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares sold short has rebounded and are now higher than before CEO Elon Musk proposed on Tuesday taking the electric car maker private, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.
As of Thursday, 34.75 million Tesla shares were sold short, up from 34.67 million shares on Monday, S3 data showed. Tesla is the most shorted U.S. stock.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
Short-sellers racked up paper losses of $1.3 billion on Tuesday after Tesla shares rallied 11 percent. Since then, the shares have given up all the gains and short-sellers have recouped about a $1 billion, the data showed.
The share fall has been fueled by investor skepticism over the deal's prospects and media reports that U.S. regulators are asking Tesla why Musk announced his plans on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.
Tesla and the Securities and Exchange Commision declined comment on Thursday. 
Emboldened, shorts have pushed Tesla short interest percentage to 27.3 percent of the float on Thursday, up from 27.2 percent on Monday, S3 data showed. 
""This hasn't scared the large players in the market at all,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.
Musk has come under pressure from hedge funds betting that Tesla's stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow, and Tesla is the most shorted U.S. stock. He reasons that taking Tesla private would relieve that pressure.
""His whole focus on shorts is a misallocation of his time and resources,"" said investor Christopher Irons, founder of independent investigative research website quoththeravenresearch.com. 
Irons has a small position in out-of-the money put options on Tesla that make money if the stock declines.
""Short-sellers will go away if he executes on his business plan and will grow in numbers if he doesn't,"" he said.

Tesla shares were down -0.9 percent at $355.78, on Friday morning.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia largely failed in its bid to overturn the European Union's gas market rules in a World Trade Organization ruling published on Friday.
Russia launched the dispute in 2014, claiming that the EU's ""Third Energy Package"" and the EU's energy policy overall unfairly restricted and discriminated against Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom (MM:GAZP).
Russia argued that the EU broke WTO rules by requiring the ""unbundling"" of gas transmission assets and production and supply assets, which effectively stopped Gazprom - long the major supplier of gas to Europe - from owning the pipelines through which it sent gas to the European market.
Russia said the EU had unfairly discriminated in favor of liquefied natural gas and upstream pipeline operators by exempting them from those unbundling requirements.
The panel of three WTO adjudicators ruled against Russia on those points. 
However, they upheld Russia's complaint about an unbundling exemption for Germany's OPAL pipeline, granted on condition that Gazprom supplied no more than 50 percent of the gas in the pipeline.
The 50 percent cap could only be exceeded if 3 billion cubic meters of gas was released annually at a fixed price to competing suppliers on the Czech market.
The WTO panel also agreed that Croatia, Hungary and Lithuania had discriminated against Russia by requiring a security of energy supply assessment for foreign, but not domestic, pipeline operators.
The European Commission called the ruling an important positive outcome that secured the core elements of the Third Energy Package, a 2009 reform that sought to integrate the EU's energy market while increasing competition.
""The Commission will now analyze the ruling in detail, in particular as regards a limited number of issues on which the WTO-compatibility of EU energy policy has still not been recognized,"" it said in a statement.
Russia's Economy Ministry said the parts of the ruling that went in its favor would help to improve access for Russian gas on the European market, and to level the playing field for pipeline service providers. 
""This is a positive precedent that makes it possible to change the norms that created obstacles for Russian suppliers in the EU market, both in EU legislation and in the legislation of its individual member countries,"" it said in a statement.
Gazprom said it had always said that European energy policy should take gas suppliers' interests into account, and therefore it was satisfied with the points where Russia had won. 

Either side can appeal within 60 days.

807,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",How Trump's Steel War on Turkey Is Changing Global Trade Flows,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s latest broadside against Turkish steel is a fresh blow to one of the country’s most important industries and will reshape global trade flows.
Under a higher level of tariffs, Turkey will continue to lose American customers, once the country’s top buyers of steel. The new tariffs won’t put Turkish steelmakers out of business, but force them to find new markets, likely across North Africa or the Middle East, or displace other imports to Europe.
Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTrumpI have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!
Sent via Twitter for iPhone.
View original tweet.
Steel, in its more basic form of slabs, sheet or reinforcing bar, is a highly liquid market and it’s usually easy for a company to find new buyer. Attacking imports has become a favorite tool of politicians from Europe to the U.S., causing flows to be rerouted. The global industry has been described as a game of whack-a-mole. If exports are blocked in one market, the action shifts elsewhere.
The U.S. plans to double tariffs on Turkish steel to 50 percent, and raise the rate on aluminum to 20 percent, Trump said on Twitter today.
Turkey ranks as the world’s sixth-biggest steel producer. In aluminum, Turkey is a tiny player. The U.S. imported about 4,500 tons of aluminum bars, rods and profiles from the country in 2017, according to World Bank statistics.
The measures are designed to add pressure on Turkey to release an American pastor and will further squeeze an economy that’s being engulfed by a financial crisis and plunging currency. An index of Turkish steel stocks plunged almost 10 percent after the announcement, before recovering some of those losses.
Turkey exported about 500,000 tons to the U.S. in the five months to May, compared with more than a million tons in the same period last year, according to data from the U.S. Census bureau. The U.S. has fallen from Turkey’s main steel buyer to number three.
In response to U.S. tariffs earlier this year, Turkey turned its exports toward European countries, such as Italy and Spain. The new U.S. tariffs will heighten fears that even more steel will head to the region, pressuring European producers. Regulators have introduced so-called safeguard measures, which slap tariffs on steel if imports exceed historical averages.
“The tariffs on Turkey itself won’t form a big threat,” to Europe, Philip Ngotho, an analyst at ABN Amro Bank NV, said by email. “Europe has measures in place to limit imports of steel into Europe, so that will continue to offer some protection from potentially cheaper and more steel from Turkey.”"

811,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>","Bear Market Hits Nigeria as Politics, EM Woes Deter Traders","(Bloomberg) -- Nigeria’s stocks entered a bear market as worsening political tensions and an emerging-market sell-off caused foreign investors to shun assets in Africa’s biggest oil producer.
The Nigerian Stock Exchange All Share Index fell 2.2 percent to 35,446.47 by the close in Lagos, the commercial capital, bringing the decline since its 2018 high on Jan. 19 to 21 percent. Traders consider a market to be in bear territory when it’s down 20 percent from its last peak.
The rout marks a sharp turnaround from the first few weeks of the year, when Nigerian equities were the best performers in the world. Despite crude prices rising since then, sentiment toward Nigeria has soured as the dollar strengthens and the U.S. ratchets up a trade dispute with China. Investors have also been deterred by a political spat playing out before presidential elections in February that’s seen several lawmakers defect from the ruling party to the main opposition group and the intelligence services blockading parliament.

“People are just waiting until the election is over before investing in Nigeria,” Paul Clark, a money manager in Johannesburg at Rand Merchant Bank’s Ashburton Investments, said by phone Friday. “The economy isn’t doing too badly and the companies aren’t doing too badly. But the downturn is a function of general riskier sentiment. We won’t see any new investors coming into the market as we move toward the elections.”
While stock markets in countries such as China and Brazil have fallen into bear territory this year, Nigeria’s is the first major bourse in Africa to do so. Egypt’s is in a technical correction, meaning it’s down more than 10 percent from a recent peak.
Dangote Cement Plc, Africa’s biggest producer of the building material, dragged down Nigerian stocks the most on Friday, declining 6.1 percent to 214 naira, bringing its losses this year to 7 percent. The overall index is down 7.3 percent in 2018.
“We have a political climate that is unfolding,” the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission’s head of strategy, Mo Omamegbe, said in an interview in Lagos. “That political climate is uncertain. You can’t do anything about it. The hope is that the rhetoric on both sides of the political spectrum is such that there are no unwanted effects on the market.”

813,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",UniCredit Watching Turkey Risk as Erdogan Compounds Lira Woe,"(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI) said it’s been “paying particular attention” to geopolitical risks in Turkey, where the tumbling lira is driving down the value of its local banking venture.
“The credit-led growth model seems to be running out of steam,” while a sharp rise in funding costs forced private and foreign banks to slow lending, UniCredit said about Turkey in its first-half financial report, published Friday as European bank stocks with exposure to the country tumbled. The bank’s risk-management group is also especially focused on Russia, Brexit and challenges from regulation, the report said.
UniCredit jointly controls Turkey’s Yapi Kredi Bankasi AS, part of a banking empire that sprawls over 14 countries, serving 25 million clients. The Italian bank injected more money into Yapi Kredi less than four months ago as part of a rights offer that was worth about $1 billion at the time. The lira has plummeted against the dollar since then as Turkish tensions with the U.S. worsened and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the prospect of interest-rate increases to defend the currency.
European bank stocks slid Friday as Turkey’s lira dropped by as much as 24 percent to a record low of more than 6.5 to the dollar. UniCredit fell as much as 6.7 percent, the most in more than 2 months, and was down 5 percent as of 3 p.m. in Milan trading. The stock is the worst performer on Italian benchmark FTSE MIB index and the second-worst on the 48-member STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index.
The Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank was concerned about the Turkish exposure of some lenders, including UniCredit, Spain’s BBVA (MC:BBVA) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) of France. The watchdog doesn’t see the situation as critical yet, the FT said.
Earlier this week, UniCredit Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier played down the effects of the Turkish crisis on earnings, calling the impact of the lira moves “very small” and praising Yapi Kredi’s performance. UniCredit is “in Turkey for the long term, going through cycles,” Mustier said to analysts on an Aug. 7 conference call.
UniCredit bought a stake in Yapi Kredi with local partner Koc Holding AS in 2005. The unit held 7 percent of UniCredit’s risk-weighted assets as of June 30. The contribution of Yapi Kredi to UniCredit’s second-quarter earnings was up 27.5% from a year earlier excluding currency effects. Counting the lira’s slide, it was down 3.4 percent, the bank said on Aug. 7.
The first-half report is a supplement to the bank’s second-quarter results, which were released Tuesday and beat analysts’ estimates. A spokeswoman at the Italian lender declined to comment on the report, and referred to Mustier’s comments earlier this week.
On Russia, despite the “aggravation of the stalemate” with the West that could lead to further sanctions, the nation’s economy has shown improvement, UniCredit said. However, sanctions, tariffs and moves by the Russian government are still risks, it said.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Gene-editing startups ignite the next 'Frankenfood' fight,"By Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - In a suburban Minneapolis laboratory, a tiny company that has never turned a profit is poised to beat the world's biggest agriculture firms to market with the next potential breakthrough in genetic engineering - a crop with ""edited"" DNA.
Calyxt Inc, an eight-year-old firm co-founded by a genetics professor, altered the genes of a soybean plant to produce healthier oil using the cutting-edge editing technique rather than conventional genetic modification.
Seventy-eight farmers planted those soybeans this spring across 17,000 acres in South Dakota and Minnesota, a crop expected to be the first gene-edited crop to sell commercially, beating out Fortune 500 companies.
Seed development giants such as  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON),  Syngenta  AG (OTC:SYENF) and DowDuPont Inc have dominated genetically modified crop technology that emerged in the 1990s. But they face a wider field of competition from start-ups and other smaller competitors because gene-edited crops have drastically lower development costs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has decided not to regulate them.
Relatively unknown firms including Calyxt, Cibus, and Benson Hill Biosystems are already advancing their own gene-edited projects in a race against Big Ag for dominance of the potentially transformational technology.
""It's a very exciting time for such a young company,"" said Calyxt CEO Federico Tripodi, who oversees 45 people. ""The fact a company so small and nimble can accomplish those things has picked up interest in the industry.""
Gene-editing technology involves targeting specific genes in a single organism and disrupting those linked to undesirable characteristics or altering them to make a positive change. Traditional genetic modification, by contrast, involves transferring a gene from one kind of organism to another, a process that still does not have full consumer acceptance.
Gene-editing could mean bigger harvests of crops with a wide array of desirable traits - better-tasting tomatoes, low-gluten wheat, apples that don't turn brown, drought-resistant soybeans or potatoes better suited for cold storage. The advances could also double the $15 billion global biotechnology seed market within a decade, said analyst Nick Anderson of investment bank Berenberg.
The USDA has fielded 23 inquiries about whether gene-edited crops need regulation and decided that none meet its criteria for oversight. That saves their developers years of time and untold amounts of money compared to traditional genetically modified crops. Of those 23 organisms, just three were being developed by major agriculture firms.
The newly competitive landscape could foster more partnerships and licensing deals between big and small firms, along with universities or other public research institutions, said Monsanto spokeswoman Camille Lynne Scott. Monsanto - which was recently acquired by  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) - invested $100 million in startup Pairwise Plants this year to accelerate development of gene-edited plants.
North Carolina-based Benson Hill, founded in 2012 and named after two scientists, mainly licenses crop technology to other companies. But it decided to produce its own higher-yielding corn plant because of the low development costs, said Chief Executive Matt Crisp.
Calyxt plans to sell the oil from its gene-edited soybeans to food companies and has a dozen more gene-edited crops in the pipeline, including high-fiber wheat and potatoes that stay fresh longer.
Developing and marketing a traditional genetically modified crop might easily cost $150 million, which only a few large companies can afford, Crisp said. With gene-editing, that cost might fall as much as 90 percent, he said.
""We're seeing a huge number of organizations interested in gene-editing,"" Crisp said, referring to traditional crop-breeding companies, along with technology firms and food companies. ""That speaks to the power of the technology and how we're at a pivotal point in time to modernize the food system.""
UNCERTAIN REGULATORY, PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE 
Supporters of gene-editing say it allows a higher level of precision than traditional modification. 
With CRISPR, one popular type of gene-editing technology used by Syngenta, scientists transfer an RNA molecule and an enzyme into a crop cell. When the RNA encounters a targeted strand of DNA inside the cell, it binds to it and the enzyme creates a break in the cell's DNA. Then, the cell repairs the broken DNA in ways that disrupt or improve the gene.
(For a graphic on how the Syngenta process works, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2KJmtxr )
Biotech firms hope the technology can avoid the ""Frankenfood"" label that critics have pinned on traditional genetically modified crops. But acceptance by regulators and the public globally remains uncertain. 
The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on July 25 that gene-editing techniques are subject to regulations governing genetically modified crops.
The ruling will limit gene-editing in Europe to research and make it illegal to grow commercial crops. The German chemical industry association called the decision ""hostile to progress."" 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue blasted the ruling for enacting unnecessary barriers to innovation and stigmatizing gene-editing technology by subjecting it to the EU's ""regressive and outdated"" regulations governing genetically modified crops.
The USDA also has no current plans to regulate gene-editing in animal products, according to a document provided by the agency. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, plans to regulate gene-editing in both plants and animals, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote in a June blog post. The agency is developing an ""innovative and nimble"" approach to regulating gene-editing, he wrote, that will aim to ensure its safety for both humans and animals while allowing companies to bring beneficial products to market.
The USDA, by contrast, chose not to regulate gene-edited crops because the process typically introduces characteristics that are ""indistinguishable"" from those created through traditional plant breeding, which take much longer, USDA Secretary Perdue said in a March statement.
Although there has been no widespread consumer resistance to gene-editing, activists who have long opposed genetically modified crops remain suspicious of any sort of tinkering with DNA. The new technique raises risks of creating undesired changes in the food supply and warrants increased regulation, said Lucy Sharratt, coordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network.
That kind of opposition is why agribusiness giant Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) is pursuing gene-edited technology with caution, said Randal Giroux, the firm's vice-president of food safety, quality and regulatory affairs.
Cargill announced in February that it would collaborate with Precision BioSciences to develop healthier canola oil, but is proceeding slowly on agreements to store and transport other companies' gene-edited crops pending clarity from regulators, Giroux said.
""We really do want to see gene-editing evolve in the marketplace,"" Giroux said. ""We’re watching to see how consumers adopt these products and react to these products.""
SECRET FIELD-TESTING
Other major agriculture biotech firms are moving more aggressively, hoping to take advantage of lighter regulation to speed development. 
A gene-edited crop may take five years to move from development to commercialization in the United States, compared with a genetically modified crop that could take 12 years, said Dan Dyer, head of seeds development at Syngenta.
The firm is working on better-tasting tomatoes that take longer to spoil and hopes to launch a gene-edited crop in the mid-2020s, said Jeff Rowe, Syngenta's president of global seeds.
DowDuPont - at a secret location in the U.S. Midwest - is field-testing waxy corn, a variety grown for industrial purposes that has been edited for higher yields. The company plans a commercial launch next spring.
Smaller firms will be nipping at the heels of these massive companies in the race to bring the next generation of genetically engineered foods to market, said Robert Wager, a biology faculty member at Vancouver Island University.

""The lack of USDA-regulated status is a huge game-changer,"" he said, ""for universities and small startups to enter the market.""

816,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 09:13AM ET</span>","Ryanair strike hits 55,000 passengers across Europe","By Padraic Halpin and Victoria Bryan
DUBLIN/BERLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) endured its worst one-day strike on Friday after a walk-out by pilots in five European countries disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 travelers with the budget airline at the height of the summer holiday season.
Ryanair, which averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by agreeing to recognize unions for the first time in its 30-year history, has been unable to quell rising protests over slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements.
In response to unions serving strike notices, Ryanair had announced the cancellations of 250 flights in and out of Germany, 104 to and from Belgium and another 42 in Sweden and its home market of Ireland, where around a quarter of its pilots were staging their fifth 24-hour walkout.
The airline expected the travel plans of 42,000 travelers to be hit by the action in Germany alone, with the majority of passengers switched to another Ryanair flight and the remainder either refunded or rerouted.
""What I find unjustified is that the pilots draw the short straw, because people want to fly cheaply,"" said Daniel Flamman, one of several passengers Reuters spoke to at Frankfurt airport who said they sympathized with the pilots.
""It's annoying that it's happening in the summer holidays, but it's the only means they have.""
Ingolf Schumacher, pay negotiator at Germany's Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) union, said pilots had to be prepared for ""a very long battle"" and that it could take months to push through change at Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
The unrest is one of the biggest challenges to face long-term chief executive Michael O'Leary, who was once quoted as saying he would rather cut off his hand than recognize unions and on another occasion crossed a picket line of baggage handlers to help load a plane.
The outspoken O'Leary has in recent years tried to soften Ryanair's abrasive public image, fearing it could be counter-productive for Europe's most profitable airline.
LOW-COST MODEL
Unions are pushing for better pay and conditions at Ryanair and want collective labor contracts governed by local laws, rather than Irish ones.
Among other issues, they are also seeking changes to Ryanair's practice of moving staff to different bases without much notice, and a reduction in hours. 
A Dutch court rejected a case from Ryanair seeking to block pilots in the Netherlands from joining Friday's strike, but the Irish airline said all of its flights there would run as scheduled. The impact of the strike was limited with Ryanair apparently able to replace the striking Dutch pilots.
Shares in the airline were 4.2 percent lower at 12.97 euros by 1240 GMT, having fallen 21 percent since the action ramped up in mid-July to stand well below the 14.21 euros they slumped to in December when Ryanair shocked markets by recognizing unions.
HSBC said it was seeing interest from investors looking to purchase Ryanair shares based on its valuation but argued that this was premature.
""We expect the company to lower profit guidance for FY19 as it lowers capacity, on both strike disruption and crew shortages, and see weaker unit revenue trends as strike-affected traffic is redeployed on to operating flights and as passengers book away from what is currently a less reliable travel option than usual,"" HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said.
Ryanair has said that strike action will hit average fares because it takes up seats that it could otherwise have sold at a high last-minute price.
Ryanair insists it will not change the low-cost model that transformed the industry and has made it Europe's most profitable airline.
At Charleroi Airport, Belgium's second largest and a major Ryanair hub in the region, striking staff gathered in the departure hall and held up banners reading ""Ryanair must change- Respect us"".
""Ryanair is the only multinational in Belgium that doesn't respect the Belgian law and that's not normal,"" said Didier Lebbe, a representative of union ACV-CSC, whose demands include securing its pilots pay when they are on stand-by.
Ryanair has further angered unions by threatening to move jobs away from bases affected by stoppages, and began carrying that out in Dublin where it cut its winter fleet by 20 percent and put over 300 employees on preliminary notice.

The airline will hold talks via a mediator on Monday with the Irish pilots union, which said it had no current plans for further strikes.

It said it is aiming to employ engineers and artificial intelligence specialists.
""This is part of an increase in R&D investment. It doesn't mean we are cutting (staff) somewhere else to do this,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm told Reuters. 
Many investors expect the Swedish company to benefit from a new cycle of network upgrades as demand for 5G gear kicks in later this year or early in 2019, starting in the United States.
After a broad restructuring and clear out of top management, Ericsson is tackling falling spending on networks by telecoms operators, but it has added recruits in research and development in order to be ready to meet eventual demand for 5G networks.
The company, which has around 95,000 employees worldwide, also said it would build its first 5G radios in the United States by the end of this year. 
Once the world's biggest supplier of mobile communications gear, Ericsson competes with bigger telecom equipment players Huawei of China and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
Nokia last month said it had won a $3.5 billion deal with T-Mobile, the third biggest U.S. mobile carrier. The United States is Ericsson's largest market, accounting for around 25 percent of its revenue.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Local TV companies such as Sinclair Broadcast Group (O:SBGI) and Gray Television (N:GTN) are set for a significant political advertising boost this year as candidates and special interest groups are spending heavily to woo voters in mid-term elections. 
Demand for commercial airtime is particularly strong ahead of elections for one third of the U.S. Senate seats, and all 435 House of Representatives seats as well as positions such as state governorships, because U.S. President Donald Trump's Republican party is fighting to keep its majority in both houses of Congress while Democrats are battling to turn the tables. 
Politicians and their supporters from both political parties are looking to win voters with their stances on hot button issues such as gun control and abortion rights. 
""There's a lot of excitement and probably a lot of paranoia and a lot of fear, and those things drive political dollars,"" Kevin Latek, chief legal and development officer at Gray Television, told investors on Tuesday, according to a conference call transcript. 
Gray posted second-quarter political ad revenue of $18.1 million, 20 percent above the high end of its forecast and 9 percent above the same quarter in 2014, the last mid-term election year. Political ads brought about 7 percent of total second-quarter revenue at Gray, which forecast a third-quarter range of $41 million to $45 million for the segment versus $41 million in 2014. 
After reporting bumper second-quarter political revenue on Wednesday, Sinclair raised its 2018 target for the segment to $160 million from a range of $140 million to $150 million. The new target would be 5.8 percent of total revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters data. 
Of course the momentum could change as 80 percent of political ad spending typically occurs between the start of September and election day, which is Nov. 6 this year. But analysts are hopeful the early strength will continue. 
""It looks like its going to be a record year even without a Presidential race,"" said Daniel Kurnos an analyst covering broadcasters at Benchmark Company. 
For 2018, political advertising could generate $2.4 billion revenue for local broadcasters compared with $2.1 billion in 2014, according to Kantar Media CMAG unit's latest forecast issued in 2017. Steven Passwaiter, vice president and general manager at CMAG, said he aims to update the estimate this month. 
The 2016 U.S. presidential election generated $2.85 billion for local broadcasters, according to Passwaiter. The presidential race tends to attract more advertising dollars than local mid-term battles but 2016 spending was much weaker than expected as Trump relied far more on free media than past candidates. (https://reut.rs/2M8IPNw) 
That disappointment, which pummeled broadcasters shares in 2016, is fuelling hopes that forecasts are more solid this year. 
""Everybody got burned two years ago because the presidential spend turned out to be a dud. I think these guys are going to be incredibly careful not to raise expectations to disappoint the street again,"" said Passwaiter. 
Gray Television shares rose 14.8 percent in the two sessions after its Aug. 7 quarterly report. In 2016, the stock fell 24.7 percent from June to October. 
Sinclair's shares rose 4 percent on Wednesday after its report, although enthusiasm was dampened by the collapse of its effort to buy Tribune Media (N:TRCO).Sinclair stock fell 20.6 percent from June to October in 2016. 
Another local broadcaster E.W. Scripps (O:SSP), rose 5.7 percent after it reported results on Aug. 3 including political ad revenue of $14.9 million, compared with $7 million pro forma political revenue in the 2014 quarter. Political brought 5.3 percent of its total second-quarter revenue. 
Investors are careful about making bets on political revenue for broadcasters as it only shows up every two years, before elections and is unpredictable. 
The amount a broadcaster generates varies a lot in election years as it depends on how many of their stations serve battleground states where campaigns spend heavily in a particular year for reasons such as close polls. 
Also, strong demand for political commercials tends to eat into core advertising revenue from clients like carmakers as broadcasters only have a finite number of timeslots, said Leo Kulp, analyst at RBC Capital Management. 
But even if broadcasters can't bank on future political windfalls, a strong season is still a big positive, according to Kulp. 

""What it does is help generate incremental free cash flow. It's going to translate to the companies deleveraging more and giving them more capacity to do M&A,"" he said.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Banks' post-Brexit 'fragmentation' plans hold risks and costs,"By Sinead Cruise and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks that move some of their business and staff out of London to cities scattered across Europe after Brexit could be taking on extra risks and costs without being sure of boosting revenues. 
Several of the world's biggest banks are in the process of relocating a number of staff who deal directly with clients and some back-office functions as Britain prepares to leave the European Union next March. 
The banks, which include JP Morgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Citi (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Bank of America (N:BAC), plan to ""fragment"" their operations by expanding or launching services in more than just one city.
While beefing up operations in traditional financial centers such as Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Paris, they are also seeking to expand in cities such as Madrid, Milan, Berlin and Dublin.
Playing down the links with Brexit, the banks say the moves will bring them closer to clients and cut the costs of concentrating their operations in expensive London.
But the rush to set up offices in continental Europe has been mainly triggered by the fear of losing the benefits of EU ""passports"", which remove internal borders and allow banks operating in London to serve clients across the bloc. 
""It is an enforced change in strategy. If Brexit wasn't happening, would we be doing all this? No, of course we wouldn't. And neither would anyone else,"" said an insider at a large U.S. bank. 
""Does it get you closer to clients? Yes, of course it does. But people are trying to make a virtue out of a necessity,"" said the insider, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.
It is not clear how much the fragmentation strategy will cost the industry or each individual bank, partly because each subsidiary will need its own pool of capital, the size of which will depend on what business activities and staff it needs.
But research by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) suggested non-EU banks that until now have used Britain as a gateway to serve EU clients may have to allocate an aggregate 35-45 billion euros ($40-52 billion) of capital to turn EU branches into subsidiaries. 
Reuters reported in July that British lender Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) was planning to operate from three separate European subsidiaries after Brexit. Its decision underscores the vast reorganization that even banks with relatively small continental interests are having to undergo.
But some experts question whether moving out of London will have any financial benefits. 
""The economics will pull everything back here before long. A lot of money could be wasted in discovering that,"" said Barney Reynolds, head of financial institutions at Shearman & Sterling.
HUNDREDS SET TO MOVE
Some bankers say splintering complex businesses across multiple cities will make financial services such as trading and debt issuance more expensive for European companies, governments and investors. The region as a whole may suffer, they say.
""If you were a theoretician, you would say that one center in Europe that is dominant would probably be more effective than a fragmented approach,"" John McFarlane, chairman of  Barclays  (L:BARC) and lobby group TheCityUK, told Reuters.
Hundreds of staff could move from Britain. Barclays is shifting up to 200 roles to Frankfurt and Dublin as part of its Brexit planning, while HSBC (L:HSBA) is preparing to relocate up to 1,000 roles to the continent.
""Brexit, naturally, will dominate how financial services firms manage their organizations at least for the short term, drawing on budgets and taking resources away from other areas of focus,"" said Shankar Mukherjee, Financial Services Partner at consultancy EY.
""The impact will likely be felt on incremental capital requirements, as well as the ongoing costs of supporting multiple legal entities. We expect that this will pose questions around the ongoing profitability of certain business lines within Europe, particularly for smaller firms.""
Earlier this year, Synechron Business Consulting Group estimated it would cost an average 50,000 pounds ($64,000)to relocate a single employee to a European city. This excluded IT expenses, the costs of regulatory permissions or licenses or the capitalization of the new business hub.
Several banks say redistributing London-based staff to cheaper European cities will help them curb costs. But new offices leased by Bank of America in Paris's fashionable 8th arrondissement or Goldman Sachs's in Milan's historic center do not look like moves made on a shoestring budget.
""They say they are playing catch-up on moving expensive back-office operations outside London but I don't think anyone had such a significant outsourcing plan before Brexit,"" the bank insider said.
Any competitive advantage banks hope to gain by launching offices or expanding in multiple continental cities could quickly disappear if rivals do the same a few streets away.
""It is a zero-sum or slightly negative-sum game,"" said Chris Dyer, Director of Global Equity at Eaton Vance, an investor in Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

""The banks may realize some benefits but at a cost. Having people in one location has benefits in terms of information flow and relationships. The banks will have to be more thoughtful about capturing and distributing information on clients, markets and risks across the expanded employee footprint,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A plummeting Turkish lira sent ripples through global equities and emerging markets on Friday, as rising fears of a wider fallout sent investors scurrying for the safety of assets such as the yen and U.S. government bonds.
The lira fell as much as 12 percent against the dollar earlier in the day, its worst day since Turkey's financial crisis of 2001, on the back of a deepening rift with the United States, worries about its own economy and lack of action from policymakers.
The currency is down more than 35 percent this year, its losses accelerating as the dollar jumped to 13-month highs
That is spreading fear of an impact on other economies and markets -- bank shares across the continent fell and the euro slipped to its lowest since July 2017 as the Financial Times quoted sources as saying the European Central Bank was concerned about European banks' exposure to Turkey. 
Shares in France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Italy's UniCredit and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), the banks seen as most exposed to Turkey, fell as much as 4 percent. 
That took European bank shares down 1.3 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.7 percent. (EU)
The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.6 percent on the day, having erased all its gains for the week. Wall Street was set for a weak open.
""People looking at things this morning are much more aware that there is central (major) contagion risk,"" said David Owen, chief European economist at Jeffries in London. 
""Having said that, what's happening in emerging markets is leading to risk-free rates being bid for and that includes Treasuries, Bunds and gilts.""
As investors piled into ""safe"" bonds, German yields hit three-week lows and yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell to 2.8913 percent.
Investors are now awaiting the release of the U.S. consumer price inflation for July for clues on the interest rate outlook and to gauge if new import tariffs were starting to have an impact. The data is expected to show inflation likely increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.1 percent in June. 
The Australian dollar - often viewed as a proxy for global risk appetite because of its commodity reliance - was the biggest faller among developed currencies, down 1 percent on the day. Going in the opposite direction was the safe haven Japanese yen, which hit a one-month high against the dollar.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a group of six major currencies, breached the 96 level, taking it to its highest level since July 2017.
Adding to emerging market currency woes was the Russian rouble, weakened to 67.12 to the dollar. Overnight it had retreated to its lowest since November 2016 on threats of new U.S. sanctions, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65-per-dollar threshold.
""Other EM currencies have held their ground against the dollar, having generally been weakening previously,"" said analysts at Capital Economics.
""In most cases though, we suspect that this resilience will prove temporary,"" they said, highlighting expectations of rising U.S. interest rates and worries over growing U.S. protectionism.
In commodities, U.S. crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $66.51 a barrel, while Brent crude was 0.4 percent lower at $71.77 per barrel.

Despite the broader flight to safe havens, gold was lower. Spot gold fell 0.3 percent to trade at $1,207.15 per ounce.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: FTSE Russell may give mainland China stocks more weighting than MSCI,"By Jennifer Hughes
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Index provider FTSE Russell could give a greater weighting to mainland Chinese stocks than rival MSCI if it decides to include them in its flagship indices next month, its chief executive told Reuters.
MSCI this year became the first index provider to force its passive fund followers into Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks - a milestone in the opening up of Chinese markets to international capital. It was also a highly contentious move due to investor concerns about Chinese corporate governance and market practices.
The growing financial might of mainland firms is hard to ignore. Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed A-share companies are worth a combined $7.1 trillion in market capitalization - and together can be considered the world's second-largest equity market after the United States.
In MSCI's flagship emerging markets index, Chinese A-shares only account for 0.78 percent - part of a gradual, phased inclusion to avoid sudden market moves. Asked whether FTSE Russell's A-share weighting could be bigger, CEO Mark Makepeace said: ""I think that's a possibility.""
""We'll only do it if we have the support of the big investors,"" he said in an interview, adding the firm was still consulting with investors and other stakeholders.
The FTSE emerging markets index currently has a slightly higher total proportion of Chinese stocks - mainly those listed in Hong Kong and New York - at 32.2 percent versus MSCI's 31.2 percent.
The growing popularity of passive funds which track indices has made index providers powerful arbiters of market trends. Trillions of dollars are benchmarked against MSCI and FTSE Russell indices.
FTSE Russell estimates that about 40 percent of passive funds tracking global indices and global emerging market indices follow its benchmarks and the rest follow MSCI. MSCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT PUSH
Makepeace's comments follow an announcement this week by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) that attracting inflows to China was among its priorities.
The commission said it would ""actively support the inclusion of A-shares in the FTSE Russell international index and raising the proportion of A-shares in the MSCI index.""
China has recently made a raft of decisions giving foreigners greater access to its markets. These include the easing of foreign investment curbs in the banking, auto and resources sectors.
In June, Beijing lifted a monthly cap on foreign fund manager outflows which investors had frequently cited as a sticking point for their China interest.
Makepeace said investors expected foreign ownership of listed Chinese companies, currently limited to 30 percent, to rise at some point. 
""I think the question for people like FTSE Russell and MSCI is not whether we include A-shares but it's how much. Over the next five to seven years we have to get to that foreign ownership limit – and that's only going to go up,"" he said.
But many international investors remain cool to mainland shares. Just under half of foreign investors polled by the Asian Corporate Governance Association thought MSCI's inclusion was wrong. Only 27 percent were in favor while the rest said they had a neutral stance.
The survey reported that 59 percent of investors felt they did not understand corporate governance in China, including practices around the roles and responsibilities of non-executive directors, supervisory boards and Communist Party committees.
The ease with which mainland-listed companies can suspend trading - leaving investments effectively frozen - is also an oft-cited concern, although mainland regulators have been working to limit suspensions. 
About a third of the Chinese market was suspended in this fashion during a 2015 market rout, scarring foreign investors unable to value their holdings accurately.
Makepeace said, however, however the next stage for China was for institutional investors to help shape corporate governance practices.
""Governance is going to follow international investors coming into this market. You're not going to get the engagement [with management] if you don't have the ownership,"" he said.
FTSE began including A-shares in 2015 but only via a parallel set of indices - one with A-shares, one without - that allowed investors to include the mainland if they chose. Its biggest fund manager client, Vanguard, began to transition to the new indices that year, but few other big investors followed.
There are nearly 1,900 companies listed on the main Shanghai and Shenzhen boards, ranging from China's giant state-owned banks to piano makers.
Both MSCI and FTSE weight their indices by companies' market capitalization. The A-share firms given the largest weighting by MSCI include Shanghai Electric Group (SS:601727), Zhangzhou  Pientzehuang  Pharmaceutical Ltd (SS:600436) and HLA Corp (SS:600398).

828,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",European shares tumble as Turkish turmoil hits banks,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday as worries over a dramatic fall in the Turkish lira jolted financial markets, with banks such as Spain's BBVA and Italy's UniCredit falling on worries over their exposure to the country.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.8 percent to a one-week low, as investors fretted about the possible political and economic repercussions of the Turkish crisis. The index was down 0.4 percent on the week.
The Turkish lira fell more than 10 percent to a record low, as concerns over a widening rift with the United States persisted after a Turkish delegation returned from talks in Washington with no apparent solutions. 
""As the talks ... have broken down for the time-being, no relief is to be expected,"" BayernLB analyst Norbert Wuthe said.
""At the same time, the new U.S. sanctions against Russia have unleashed concern in the German economy,"" he added.
Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) index fell 1.2 percent, underperforming the broader market.
Most sectors were trading in negative territory.
Banks were among the biggest fallers after the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about the exposure of some of the euro area's biggest lenders to Turkey — chiefly BBVA, UniCredit and  BNP Paribas  - in light of the currency fall.
Shares in France's BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP), Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) fell by around 3 percent.
According to Jefferies analysts, Turkey contributed 14 percent to BBVA's first-half group profits and 9 percent to UniCredit's consolidated profit, although their capital exposure is limited. Both banks have said a 10 percent fall in the Lira could shave 2 basis points off their capital adequacy ratio. 
The broader impact on the European economy is also seen as limited. Berenberg economist Carsten Hesse estimates that a fall of eurozone exports to Turkey of 20 percent would subtract no more than 0.1 percentage point from economic growth.
""The eurozone banking exposure seems too small to cause a significant eurozone crisis,"" he said.
""But even if we are wrong and a potential meltdown of the Turkish banking sector would cause serious trouble for some eurozone banks, bank supervisors would have sufficient tools at their disposal to contain the damage.""
Elsewhere, a profit warning from K+S (DE:SDFGn) sent shares in the German potash miner tumbling 8.8 percent to the bottom of the STOXX index. 

Shares in London-listed  Evraz  (L:EVRE) fell 6.9 percent as shares of Russian metal and mining companies fell after a report that Russia is considering raising more revenue from the sector.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:45AM ET</span>",Trade war threatens reign of luxury stocks,"By Helen Reid and Sarah White
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - An escalating trade war between the United States and China could abruptly end a glittering stock market run for luxury goods firms, with some investors already put off by lofty valuations in a sector powered by shoppers in the two countries. 
From pricey handbags to designer shoes, booming sales at the European companies that dominate the industry like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have made them investor favorites, with shares still near record highs. 
But the possible trickle down effect of tit-for-tat tariffs hikes on consumers is adding to jitters over heady valuations, even though luxury firms are not as directly threatened by rising protectionism as carmakers and industrial companies.
The sector has an average valuation of 21 times 12-month earnings forecasts, according to Reuters data, down from its May peak, but still 23 percent above its 10-year average. 
""We are not making a call that they are bad companies, we think they're great companies. But they're bad investments,"" said Edinburgh-based David Keir, co-manager of the Saracen Global Income and Growth fund, which dropped its LVMH holdings last year and sold out of German suit maker  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in early July. ""Now there's an incremental risk from the great unknown of trade tariffs as well.""
It would not be the first demand-driven wobble the luxury industry has faced. In 2012, a Chinese crackdown on corruption caused purchases of premium cognac and other high-end goods used as gifts to fall sharply, taking the likes of LVMH and Remy Cointreau shares down with them. 
This time, tariffs threaten consumers' spending power in both the United States and China – the world's two biggest consumers of European luxury goods, which make up just over half the industry's revenues. 
The impact on confidence in China's markets, including the depreciation of the renminbi that would eat into Chinese tourists' budgets for shopping in Europe, is among risks that may not be fully reflected in stocks yet, analysts warn. 
""We see very little priced in so far,"" said UBS analysts, who forecast as much as a 30 percent share price drop in the sector index in the event of a fully-fledged trade war.
Among the stocks that would be worse affected, UBS included Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY). The two brands are in the midst of turnaround plans that have yet to fully hit their stride.

CHINA THRIVING
So far, the knock-on effect on revenues has been muted. 
If anything, Chinese demand for Louis Vuitton's leather goods ticked up in the second quarter compared to the first, LVMH reported, while most firms argue their core clientele is here to stay. 
""We have still an expansion of the middle and upper class in China,"" Kering's group managing director Jean-Francois Palus told analysts following the company's half-year results. 
Sales in China have been largely driven by a young clientele unafraid of splurging on branded goods, and often financed by their parents and grandparents, with rising property prices also providing a source of wealth.
Even a moderate slowdown in the pace of revenue growth, as is expected regardless of the trade spat after two years of rebounding demand in China, is not enough to spook some drawn to the sector's underlying strengths. 
""Demand is really healthy,"" said Andrea Gerst, co-portfolio manager of GAM's Luxury brands fund, which has stakes in many major European labels. ""If comparatives get more difficult, then the absolute madness may not be as strong, but there'll still be healthy growth.""
More broadly, global luxury sales are driven by some of the world's wealthiest shoppers who might shrug off any direct impact from tariffs were it to come to that. 
""With luxury you've got people who are far less price-sensitive as your customers and so you ask yourself if there's a tax put on and the price goes up a bit, how much is that really going to change the demand?"" said Fergus Shaw, partner and portfolio manager at Cerno Capital.
Shaw said his fund owns LVMH shares, and he has not been tempted to sell out, expecting any impact from tariffs to be much smaller than the anti-corruption drive was.

NERVES
Yet market nerves around the sector are becoming more evident, and luxury companies and industry lobbies are on alert. Even good or in-line results from luxury companies for the second quarter prompted some sharp sell-offs on results day.
Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the luxury sector at the start of July to ""underweight"", citing trade war worries. 
Italy's Confindustria Moda, the national association of textile and fashion companies, said its entrepreneurs feared a possible rise in tariffs and that it was monitoring the situation in the hope of avoiding ""a protectionist escalation"".
It estimates goods in the sector are already subject on average to 12 percent trade tariffs, and are unlikely to be targeted for increases, however. 
Though the bulk of luxury manufacturing is still anchored in Europe, some firms are also weighing whether to make changes to their supply chains should they get caught in the crossfire. 
""This is an industry in which we have the capability, as we do and as we have done in the past, to switch capacity from one location to the other as is necessary,"" Ray-Ban maker Luxottica's (MI:LUX) finance chief Stefano Grassi told analysts following second-quarter results. 

The Italian group, which makes designer sunglasses for Chanel and Versace among other labels, could for example shift more production to the United States if needed, where it has a factory. It also has three in China, while the majority of its plants are in its home base.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Scrap that: China's metal recyclers rush to divert or sell U.S. cargoes as tariffs loom,"By Tom Daly
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese copper fabricators and importers are scrambling to divert or resell cargoes of U.S. copper scrap en route to China after Beijing hit such imports with a 25-percent duty as the trade row with Washington deepens, sources said. 
U.S. scrap metal, waste paper and plastics cargoes arriving in China from Aug. 23 will incur the new levy after China announced on Wednesday its final list of tariffs on $16 billion of U.S. goods. Scrap was not on a draft list released in June.
In the first quarter there were almost 2,200 cargoes of copper scrap per month sent to China from the United States, according to Reuters' calculations based on customs data. The average cargo of scrap copper sent to China is about 20 tonnes.
With less than two weeks before the new tariffs come into effect, China's imposition of duties threatens to disrupt trade for one of the world's top metal and scrap consumers, as recyclers rush to find new homes for cargoes to avoid paying new duties. 
""Last night I lost sleep,"" an executive at a metals recycler with processing yards in Zhejiang province said on Thursday. He has several cargoes of U.S. scrap copper due to arrive in Ningbo port after the deadline or about to load on the U.S. East and West coasts.
""We don't have a solution yet, but we're discussing it with the supplier,"" he said, adding he was looking for buyers in Japan, South Korea, India and even Europe.
Those importers with stranded cargoes will likely have to offer discounts to attract buyers, sources said.
The penalties are China's latest blow to the U.S. recycling sector, after Beijing hit aluminum scrap with hefty duties in April as part of the trade dispute. 
""The impact will be draconian on both U.S. scrap processors and Chinese consumers,"" Michael Lion, Hong Kong-based president of Lion Consulting Asia and a Chinese metals industry veteran, said in an email.
Companies such as Sims Metal Management and  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) Corp's scrap subsidiary David J Joseph are major exporters of U.S. scrap to China and elsewhere. 
Last year, the United States sold almost $6 billion worth of scrap commodities to China and was the second-largest supplier of copper scrap behind Hong Kong, exporting 535,371 tonnes worth roughly $1.8 billion in 2017. Hong Kong sent 627,180 tonnes, according to Chinese customs data. 
For a graphic on China's top copper scrap suppliers, click https://reut.rs/2vwSPpK 
The global recycling sector is also reeling from Beijing's tighter restrictions on waste imports introduced over the past year as China aims to stop being the dumping ground for the world's garbage.
China's scrap metal imports dropped by a third in the first half of 2018 to 2.86 million tonnes, while the country has barely imported waste plastic this year.
An executive with a major scrap metal recycler in Asia said there would likely be a combination of resales, trans-shipments and reluctant payment of the 25-percent tariff.
""Those that can resell may see (that) as the best option even if at lower numbers as there is always risk in trans-shipment,"" the source said, adding that there were ""many"" cargoes already on the water. 
An executive at a Zhejiang-based copper rod maker, which uses scrap as raw material, also said shipments via a third-country were an option, although cargoes could even be sent back to the United States after docking in China.
The three executives declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
Responding to the news, the Washington-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) warned that China may struggle to find enough material from other countries.

Buffeted by crosscurrents ranging from the trade war and rising defaults to monetary stimulus and cheapening valuations, the Shanghai Composite Index has recorded seven straight swings of 1 percent or more as of Thursday-- the longest such stretch since Chinese markets crashed in 2015. Intraday moves in the index have grown the most extreme in 30 months, while the country’s market capitalization fluctuated by at least $97 billion for seven consecutive trading sessions through Thursday.
The rollercoaster ride continued on Thursday as the Shanghai Composite jumped 1.8 percent, the biggest gain worldwide, on news that regulators plan to reduce barriers for foreign stock investors. The index has been bouncing around its lowest level since early 2016 in recent weeks amid what market watchers describe as a growing divide between bulls and bears. It added 0.3 percent as of 9:53 a.m. local time on Friday.
“There is no consensus,” said Steven Leung, an executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “In these circumstances, lots of investors in China have turned into short-term investors.”

839,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Foreign Investors Keep Buying Chinese Stocks as Markets Go Wild,"(Bloomberg) -- Slumping stocks and market volatility aren’t holding back foreign investors from snapping up Chinese shares.
Foreign investors bought net $20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) mainland shares through Hong Kong links from July 25 through Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In that time the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled to a two and a half-year low before enjoying its best day in two years, whipsawing between gains and losses to send its volatility higher. The daily quota usage on Thursday reached the highest since early June, when A-shares had recently been included in MSCI Inc.’s benchmark gauges.
""Foreign investors’ buying remains very robust despite the weak performance this year -- many of them are long-term institutional funds,"" said Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. ""They’re not so pessimistic about China’s economic growth in the longer term. There’s also a consensus that MSCI would continue to add to its weighting of A-shares, so some investors would take the market rout as an opportunity to add.""
Concerns over China’s economic slowdown, an escalating trade dispute with the U.S. and a weakening yuan have sapped sentiment in mainland markets, where domestic retail investors dominate. The Shanghai gauge has dropped 16 percent year-to-date to become one of the worst performers in the world, yet foreign investors have purchased some 200 billion yuan of stocks. The average daily net purchase this year is about 60 percent higher than the same period in 2017, according to data on quota usage. Shares surged on Thursday on news regulators plan to further open the stock market to foreign investors.
Southbound flows have not reciprocated though. Mainland investors pulled out net HK$7.5 billion ($955 million) last week out of Hong Kong stocks through the same links, the third-biggest weekly total on record.

News Corp's subscription video services division that includes Australian pay TV company Foxtel - acquired by Rupert Murdoch-controlled News Corp earlier this year - contributed $610 million to its overall revenue in the fourth quarter ended June 30.
The company's news business, which houses the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, made $1.29 billion in revenue, rising 1 percent from a year earlier and accounting for almost half of overall revenue as the number of digital subscribers grew.
Revenue at News Corp's online real-estate listings unit rose 19 percent while its book publishing division - home to HarperCollins - saw a 20 percent jump in revenue.
News Corp said net loss available to shareholders narrowed to $372 million in the fourth quarter from $430 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 8 cents per share, above analysts' average expectation of 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue surged about 30 percent to $2.69 billion, above estimates of $2.65 billion.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Fitch voiced concerns on Thursday that TV Azteca's legal battle with American Tower Corp was ""not positive or favorable"" for the Mexican broadcaster's credit profile, two days after Reuters reported the lawsuit.
MATC Infraestructura, a unit of cell tower owner and operator American Tower (N:AMT), sued TV Azteca (MX:AZTECACPO) for nearly $97 million in a New York state court, saying the company has defaulted on a loan.
In an interview, Alberto Moreno, a senior director at Fitch, said the agency will likely evaluate what the case means for TV Azteca's credit rating. 
""Our sense is obviously this is not favorable or positive for the credit profile of the company,"" he said. ""We will continue monitoring.""
A spokesman for TV Azteca declined to comment. 
The broadcaster did not confirm or deny having defaulted on the loan from American Tower in court papers, but argued it had not been served properly.
In April, Fitch upgraded TV Azteca's outlook to ""positive"" from ""stable,"" noting that the company had reduced its net debt by 23 percent in 2017.
The market has viewed the dispute in New York as part of an ongoing negotiation between TV Azteca and American Tower, Moreno said. 
""They (TV Azteca) have enough liquidity and enough access to financing in order to cover their obligations,"" he said.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 05:58PM ET</span>",Loeb's Third Point calls for Campbell Soup sale: filing,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb and fellow  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) shareholder George Strawbridge on Thursday called for a sale of the iconic U.S. food company best known for its canned soups, according to a regulatory filing.
The joint effort, first reported by Reuters earlier on Thursday, could prove difficult as descendants of former Campbells Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined stake of about 41 percent in the company.
Loeb's Third Point hedge fund and Strawbridge together own a 8.42 percent stake in the 150-year-old company, with Third Point holding 5.65 percent, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Third Point said it believed a strategic review underway at Campbell would create ""significant value"" for shareholders if conducted properly. Third Point also said it may seek board seats if it feels that Campbell's directors have failed to do their job appropriately.
Campbell said its board ""remains dedicated to delivering a go-forward strategy that will drive value for all shareholders,"" and that it would make its plans public later this month.
Campbell shares rose as much as 4 percent on the news that Loeb, whose fund occasionally pushes management of its portfolio companies to perform better, is involved. The stock closed up 0.7 percent at $42.28. Since January, it has dropped 12.7 percent.
The 56-year-old investor bought his stake in Campbell after Chief Executive Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down in May. She left after the company gave a bleak forecast for the year and said it would embark on a review of its many brands.
Rival activist shareholder Carl Icahn also considered an investment in Campbell, but decided against it because the family dynamics would make it tough to press for big changes, according to a source familiar with the matter. Icahn's office declined to comment.
Campbell's annual meeting was held early last November, which means that Third Point would have a relatively short period of time to nominate potential directors if Loeb plans to mount a board challenge later this year.
Loeb's $18 billion hedge fund has a history of making investments in food companies, including most recently Nestle SA (S:NESN), where it has been pressing management to spin off some units and streamline the portfolio.
Campbell in 2015 reorganized into three divisions, creating the Campbell Fresh unit after combining what was a packaged fresh division with soups sold to supermarket delis. But Campbell Fresh struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales.
Analysts have said that the most logical path for the company may be to separate its profitable but debt-laden snack business from its slower-growing soup business.

While Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, it is not currently exploring a bid, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kraft Heinz did not respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - William Ackman's publicly traded hedge fund is outperforming the broader stock market this year, fueled by rising prices at Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP), the billionaire investor said on Thursday.
""While a few months of strong performance is too short a period to judge our performance, we believe that (Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings) is back on track,"" Ackman wrote in his firm's interim financial report. Pershing Square Holdings is up 12.7 percent this year through Aug. 7.
The gains outpace the Standard & Poor's 500 index's 8.1 percent rise and many rival hedge funds returns and could signal a comeback for the 52-year-old manager after years of back-to-back losses that helped shrink the hedge fund's assets to roughly $8 billion, about half of what Ackman managed at the firm's peak in 2015.
Chipotle added 5.6 percent while Automatic Data Processing, where Ackman lost a bitter proxy fight in 2017, added 5.1 percent, the financial report said. Lowe's Companies, a relatively new investment, added 1.3 percent.  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF), where Ackman expected the nutrition and diet company's stock price to drop before he exited the bet earlier this year, hurt the portfolio with a loss of 3.3 percent.
A number of Ackman's portfolio companies, including burrito chain Chipotle, home improvement retailer Lowe's and Oreo cookie maker Mondelez, have appointed new chief executives. ""We initiated our investment shortly after Lowe's announced the CEO search process,"" Ackman said in the report, adding that Marvin Ellison, now Lowe's CEO, ""was the leading candidate on our list of potential CEO recruits."" 
Ackman's returns are among the most heavily scrutinized in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, especially since he has often publicly pushed management at his portfolio companies to perform better. This year, however, Ackman is pursuing a lower profile and has shrunk his firm's size through layoffs to get back to what he calls his roots of focusing on investments. 

Ackman and other Pershing Square executives have used hundreds of millions in personal assets this year to buy shares of the publicly traded fund, a step applauded by the board chair. ""The board is pleased to see such a strong commitment from the Investment Manager,"" Anne Farlow wrote in the introduction to the interim report.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Factbox: U.S. companies with exposure to Russia,"By April Joyner
(Reuters) - Although the United States and Russia have imposed economic sanctions on each other since 2014, several large U.S. corporations, including PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), still count Russia as a growth market.
But new developments have raised the possibility of fresh challenges for U.S. companies in Russia.
The United States on Wednesday announced it would impose fresh sanctions on Russia after Washington determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain. Russia on Thursday condemned the new round of sanctions as illegal and said it had begun working on retaliatory measures. 
A senior U.S. State Department official said on Thursday the sanctions on Russia will target exports of national security-related goods including sectors such as specialized oil and gas technology and some electronics and sensors. 
In April, the United States imposed sanctions on 24 Russian oligarchs and government officials and 12 Russian companies.
Russia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.
Publicly listed U.S. companies generated more than $90 billion in revenue from Russia in 2017, according to the Thomson Reuters Country of Risk model, which estimates companies' financial exposure to different countries. Among the industries with the greatest exposure to Russia are food and beverages, technology and pharmaceuticals.
Here are some of the U.S. companies that maintain significant operations in Russia.
TECHNOLOGY
Cisco Systems Inc's (O:CSCO) product revenue in Russia grew 20 percent in 2017, ahead of Cisco's technology product revenue growth in the other so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, China and India.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) had double-digit revenue growth in Russia, the company's chief financial officer said on an earnings conference call in May. 
During Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) earnings call last October, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood noted that market conditions had improved in ""key markets like Brazil and Russia.""
But following U.S. sanctions, two of Microsoft's official distributors in Russia curbed sales of Microsoft software to more than 200 Russian companies, Reuters reported in January.
CONSUMER BRANDS
In Mondelez International Inc's (O:MDLZ) quarterly earnings call in January, Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said the company had become the leading chocolate maker in Russia.
PepsiCo reported that in 2017, its Russian operations generated net revenue of $3.23 billion, which made up 5.1 percent of the company's total net revenue.
McDonald's categorizes Russia as a high-growth market and has opened new locations there in the past two years, according to its annual financial report.
Philip Morris International (N:PM) has been among foreign companies with exposure to Russia's tobacco market. The company's sales exposure to Russia is 7 percent, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
PHARMACEUTICALS
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) has identified Russia as a strong market for regional consumer brands, and the company is seeking to extend its reach there through products such as contact lenses, executives have said.
 Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) is among the top five companies for branded generic drugs in Russia, the company's chief financial officer, Brian Yoor, said in January.
In the first quarter of 2018, weaker sales growth in Russia led to lower sales in Abbott's established pharmaceuticals business than analysts expected.
AEROSPACE, INDUSTRIALS
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) named Russia as one of its largest growth markets at an industry conference in March. But in its annual report, the company noted pricing pressures from government-funded competitors in Russia, China and Japan and said it would defend itself from the ""unfair subsidization of competitors.""
Russia may stop supplying titanium to Boeing as part of its response to U.S. sanctions, a parliament member said, according to a report by RIA news agency.
Also in the industrials space, industrial manufacturing and engineering company  Colfax  Corp (N:CFX) has an 8 percent sales exposure to Russia, according to the Goldman Sachs note.
AUTOMAKERS
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) doubled down on Russia even as its big U.S. rival, General Motors Co (N:GM), pulled out in 2015. The automaker's sales from its joint venture with Russia-based  Sollers  PAO (MM:SVAV) grew in 2017.

Ford now has a 3.1 percent market share in Russia, according to the company's annual financial report. In October, the company said its Russian results ""continued to improve, approaching breakeven.""

The S&P 500 was in slightly positive territory most of the day, putting it once again close to the record high it hit Jan. 26. The Nasdaq also neared its all-time high. 
The technology sector has been at the center of a sharp recovery in U.S. stocks since a market rout in February. 
Shares of Apple rose 0.8 percent, while those of Amazon (O:AMZN) were up 0.6 percent.
""It's hard pressed for this market to really leap ahead. It's been a slow, steady climb, led by an increasingly smaller number of companies,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Somehow, technology seems a little more insulated"" to concerns facing some companies, including trade war tensions, Meckler added.
Leading sector declines was the S&P energy index (SPNY), which fell 0.9 percent. Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY) fell 4.2 percent after it maintained a tepid production forecast for the year. The S&P financial index (SPSY) was down 0.6 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 74.52 points, or 0.29 percent, to 25,509.23, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 4.12 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,853.58 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 3.46 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,891.78.
The biggest drag on the S&P 500 was Booking Holdings (O:BKNG), which fell 5 percent after it forecast third-quarter profit below expectations.
Rite Aid (N:RAD) fell 11.5 percent after the drug store chain and U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos (N:ABS) agreed to terminate their merger agreement.
Chip stocks fell after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The latest data pointed to strength in the labor market, underscoring the health of the U.S. economy despite ongoing trade tensions. 
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, a Labor Department report showed.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 68 new lows.

About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:54PM ET</span>","Tesla shares fall 5 percent on Wall Street skepticism, SEC probe reports","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) shares slipped nearly 5 percent on Thursday, wiping out the gains fueled by Chief Executive Elon Musk's announcement of a plan to take the company private, after reports of concern by regulators and on doubt the deal could be done.
Shares fell early in the day, weighed by Wall Street's skeptical response to Musk's idea of going private and a Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was asking Tesla why Musk announced his plans on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.
The shares slipped further on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that the SEC already had been looking at Tesla's public statements, citing two unnamed people it said were familiar with the matter.
Short sellers, who bet that shares will fall and have been a longtime irritant to Musk, increased their positions slightly on Thursday.
""Instead of seeing slight covering, which we have seen over the last couple of days, we are actually seeing slight short selling today,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners in New York.
""The short-sellers right now might be smelling blood in the water,"" he added. 
Tesla disclosed in its most recent quarterly report that it has ""received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities,"" including the SEC. The company did not disclose in its filings the details of those requests or its responses.
Musk was asked by an analyst on an Aug. 1 conference call whether Tesla had received a notice from a regulator that would prevent it from raising capital. He said that Tesla had not received such a notice, and that he had no expectation of raising new equity.
Tesla and the SEC declined comment on Thursday.
Ratings agency Moody's also said on Thursday that Tesla's consideration of going private based on Musk's letter to shareholders published after his tweets on Tuesday was negative for the company's credit outlook. 
Tesla's future rests largely on its Model 3 sedan, and it is ramping up production after months of what Musk called ""manufacturing hell."" It also faces $1.2 billion in convertible debt maturities through March of next year, the ratings agency wrote.
""Although the company's cash generation will improve during the second half of 2018 and over the coming year as Model 3 production improves, we continue to expect that Tesla will need to access the capital markets in order to fund its operating requirements and repay the maturing convertible debt obligations,"" Moody's wrote. 
Tesla's $1.8 billion August 2025 junk bond fell half a point to be bid at 90.875 cents on the dollar. After Musk’s tweets on Tuesday, they had climbed as high as 93 cents, around where they were the day before Moody’s downgraded its Tesla rating to ""B3"" – six notches into junk territory - from its previous rating of ""B2.""
Wall Street analysts have expressed doubts about the billionaire' s ability to gather enough financial backing to complete a going-private deal.
Musk said in his initial tweet that he had secured financing but has not given any evidence of that.
""People were definitely disappointed there wasn't more information on the financing or the alleged financing, or even what he meant,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, who does not own Tesla shares.
Tesla shares fell to $352.45, down about $4 from where they were before Musk's tweets on Tuesday sent them soaring to a near one-year high.
Short-sellers, who had racked up paper losses of $1.3 billion on Tuesday, have since recouped about a $1 billion, S3 Partners reported. 

Tesla short interest stood at $12.17 billion on Thursday, up from $11.97 billion on Monday, according to S3 data.

851,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Consumer Inflation on Tap
Investors will get a look at some more inflation numbers before many hit the road to get a jump on the weekend.
The consumer price index (CPI) comes out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the CPI rose 0.2% in July, compared with June, and the year-over-year gain will be 3%. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% month on month. The year-on-year core CPI gain is expected to be 2.3%.
Wholesale inflation numbers out Thursday were encouraging for the stock market, coming in flat. The core PPI was up 0.1% for the month, up less than anticipated.
Those numbers will give the Fed a lot of room to breathe when it comes to hiking interest rates.
2. M&A Hits Speed Bumps
Mergers and acquisitions, or the termination thereof, are gaining market attention.
Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and Albertson’s called off their $24 billion merger. Institutional Shareholder Services advised shareholders last month to vote against the deal because Rite Aid would not get a fair ownership interest.
Rite Aid ended the day down about 12%.
Ad Tribune Media (NYSE:TRCO) walked away from its deal to be acquired by Sinclair (NASDAQ:SBGI) for $3.9 billion. Tribune also sued Sinclair for being too aggressive with regulators. The deal looked already in trouble as the FCC voiced opposition on competition grounds.
Look for more comments tomorrow about Cigna (NYSE:CI) proposed $54 billion takeover of Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX). Carl Icahn recently expressed his opposition to the deal, calling it a “folly.”
Glenview Capital’s Larry Robbins hit back today, supporting the deal.
3. Oil Rig Data Caps a Busy Week for Oil
Oil prices continue to have an impact on the market and energy stocks have been particularly active this past week.
The Baker Hughes U.S. oil rig count comes out tomorrow at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT). Data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil output fell to 10.8 million barrels a day last week.
""Some traders swooped in and picked up oil as it is relatively cheap today, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding its prospects,"" said David Madden at CMC Markets.
""The Energy Information Administration report yesterday, pointed to a fall in U.S. demand,"" Madden said. ""Traders are also concerned about China's demand, given the country is locked in a trade spat with the U.S."""
852,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P 500 Struggles to Hold Gains as Energy, Trade Concerns Weigh","Investing.com - The S&P 500's march toward all-time highs was stalled by falling energy stocks and trade-war concerns, which offset upbeat corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.29%. The S&P 500 fell 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.04%.
Quarterly earnings continued to lend supported to the broader market as Century Link, and Viacom reported better-than-expected earnings.
 CenturyLink  (NYSE:CTL) stock rose 13%, pushing the telecom sector higher, after reporting earnings above expectations and raising full-year guidance. Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) closed 6% higher as earnings topped expectations, but revenue fell short.
The slew of reports Thursday kept the trend of above-forecast earnings intact, countering investor concerns over the trade war between the U.S. and China.
About 340, or 76%, of S&P 500 companies' earnings reported so far, have been better-than-expected, according to FactSet.
In the latest on trade disputes, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce slapped a 25% tariff on an additional $16 billion worth of U.S. products on Wednesday. In a surprise move, however, the ministry removed U.S. crude from the list of goods subject to the levy, but included oil products.
The announcement from China came after the Trump administration followed through with a 25% tariff on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods.
Concerns over the trade war flared up in energy markets, as oil prices settled lower amid worries about a possible  slowdown in global crude demand.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September fell 13 cents to settle at $66.81 a barrel.
Economic data, meanwhile, offered little to boost sentiment on equities, showing the pace of wholesale prices in June was flat, while jobless claims grew less than expected.
The data arrived a day ahead of an all-important consumer inflation report.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slumped nearly 5% as investors questioned whether CEO Elon Musk would be able to fulfil his ambition to take the company private.
""We do see some potential issues transitioning the current shareholder base to this type of private structure as there may not be enough liquidity for large institutions within the current fund ownerships,"" Goldman Sachs said. ""We note that incremental equity or leverage could potentially be needed to help finance a management buyout.""

858,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs sued by ex-managing director who said he was whistleblower,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) was sued on Thursday by a former managing director who said the Wall Street bank retaliated against him and fired him after he complained about its dealings with an unidentified, ""notorious European businessman.""
Christopher Rollins, now chief executive of BTIG Ltd, a London-based unit of investment banking and trading firm BTIG LLC, is seeking at least $50 million plus punitive damages in his complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The 2000 Harvard University graduate accused Goldman and Jim Esposito, promoted this week to global co-head of its trading business, of violating his rights as a whistleblower under the federal Dodd-Frank law, and also accused Goldman of defamation.
""The suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest it,"" Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said in an email, responding to a request for comment on behalf of the defendants and several bankers named in the complaint.
DuVally referred to a filing with a U.S. brokerage regulator that said Goldman discharged Rollins after he allowed unauthorized trades by a counterparty that had been denied a trading account because of compliance concerns.
Lawyers for Rollins did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rollins had been Goldman's co-head of trading execution for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
In his complaint, Rollins said the European businessman claimed to have more than $1 billion to invest, and became a Goldman client after two senior bankers met him on his 200-foot (61 m) ""superyacht"" in the Mediterranean Sea.
Rollins said the bankers and former vice chairman Michael Sherwood ""used their influence"" to steer nearly $2 billion of transactions linked to the businessman past the bank's anti-money laundering controls from Sept. 2015 to Aug. 2016.
But Rollins said Goldman ""scapegoated"" and suspended him after uncovering suspect trades involving a European company and linked to the businessman, who he claimed to know only socially.
The complaint said Esposito ""decided that Rollins' 16-year career with the Firm would be terminated on February 5, 2017,"" after Rollins had begun reporting questionable activity to Goldman's lawyers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Rollins' defamation claim arose from Goldman's having allegedly provided ""false and damaging information about Rollins to regulators, defaming Rollins to prospective employers,"" the complaint said.

The case is Rollins v Goldman Sachs & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-07162.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. middle market direct lending strategies still raking in capital,"By Leela Parker Deo
(Reuters) - Investors continue to inject capital into US middle market direct lending strategies at a pace that could result in 2018 fundraising surpassing the record tallies seen in 2016 and 2017.
So far in 2018, US$35bn has been raised for middle market strategies, including direct lending funds, private debt funds, middle market Collateralized Loan Obligation funds and Business Development Company (BDC) equity raises, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Another US$29bn has been announced, but not yet closed. This comes on the heels of US$69bn for all of 2017 and a total of US$61bn for 2016.
Top tier asset managers and veteran middle market lenders continue to amass significant amounts of capital in response to unprecedented investor demand for the asset class for the third year in a row. Lending conditions, as a result, remain highly competitive, favoring managers with size, scale and track-record.
Global alternative asset manager Ares Management said on the firm’s August 2 second quarter earnings call that it raised US$1.4bn in a first close of a new US senior direct lending fund and that it anticipates a final close in excess of US$3.5bn by year-end, including additional equity commitments and expected leverage. Ares’ US direct lending business is managed through Ares Capital Corp (ARCC), a specialty finance company and the largest BDC by market capitalization and total assets.
Late last month, Ares also announced the final close of its fourth European direct lending fund, Ares Capital Europe IV, at a hard cap of €6.5bn, exceeding the fund's initial €4.5bn target within six months of its launch.
“Our recent fundraising momentum is not surprising given the significant investor demand for alternative credit and our long-standing market leadership and successful track records in both the US and European illiquid credit markets,” said Ares Chief Executive Officer Michael Arougheti in the earnings transcript. “Investors are gravitating toward defensive asset classes with high current yields, low volatility and [that] benefit from rising interest rates.”
Twin Brook Capital Partners, the middle market direct lending subsidiary of Angelo Gordon & Co, is raising its third direct lending fund in as many years. The firm, which lends to lower middle market companies with between US$3m and US$50m in Ebitda, attracted over US$2bn in a first close for the AG Direct Lending Fund III, according to a source. Twin Brook pulled in US$2.3bn in 2017 and US$850m in 2016, respectively, for its two previous direct lending funds.
Twin Brook declined to comment.
GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of global investment firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX), is poised to make a significant new play in the direct lending space after GSO concluded its investment sub-advisory relationship with asset manager FS Investments in April.
Blackstone announced in December 2017 that it planned to launch a new, internal direct lending business. To that end, the firm is aiming to raise US$10bn in equity and debt capital this year and into next, sources familiar with the matter said.
A spokeswoman for the investment firm declined to comment.
Blackstone, separately, is buying a 55% majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC.
UNDER PRESSURE
Having accumulated deep pools of capital, lenders are under tremendous pressure to put money to work for their investors, even as investor protections in loan documents have eroded and deal structures have become increasingly aggressive.
“Lenders are forced to put money to work. Sitting on cash means nothing,” said one middle market lender.
The unitranche product, a loan structured to combine senior and junior debt into a single tranche at a blended cost of capital, has benefited from the tremendous level of demand coming from direct lending platforms. With so much capital available to private equity sponsors and borrowers, unitranche volume has soared and spreads have tightened considerably.
Issuance rocketed to US$8.67bn in the second quarter of 2018, up 178% from the first quarter. Sponsor and borrower demand for the product has pushed the cost of unitranche loans down, which typically come at a premium for borrowers. The average spread on unitranche facilities fell to only 605bp over Libor in the second quarter of this year, down from 633bp in the prior period and 661bp in 2017.
While lenders compete on structures and pricing, hold sizes represent another battlefield. Lenders can and must take down sizeable pieces of a given deal in order to win assets.
Previously, before the explosion in alternative capital and private credit strategies, the larger more established middle market lenders took US$75m tickets in a given deal, widely considered a significant hold. Today some of those same participants can commit US$200m-$300m hold sizes. 
The ability to commit such large amounts of capital to one deal has transformed the competitive landscape, giving substantial advantage to credit managers with size and scale.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Donerail Group in talks to buy Chicago Tribune owner Tronc - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Donerail Group, an investment firm led by former activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP executive Will Wyatt, is in talks to acquire Tronc Inc (O:TRNC), the publisher of Chicago Tribune, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
If the talks lead to a deal, Tronc would become the latest U.S. newspaper publisher to fall in the hands of a private equity firm or a hedge fund, as regional papers struggle with declining circulation amid the proliferation of online media.
Donerail Group has secured financing for the deal and is in advanced negotiations with Tronc, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is not imminent and there is no certainty an agreement will be reached. If a deal is reached, an announcement could come later this month, one of the sources added.
One of the challenges facing Donerail, as a newly established firm, is convincing Tronc's board of directors that it can go ahead with the deal, one of the sources said. The terms of Donerail's offer could not be learned.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Donerail declined to comment, while Tronc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tronc shares rose 7 percent on the news to $17.75 on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of close to $650 million. 
The Chicago Tribune reported on Wednesday that Tronc was weighing an offer from a private equity firm, without identifying it.
Wyatt is a veteran investor in the media and the consumer sector, having led some of Starboard's biggest bets in the space, including in  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO), one of the largest U.S. television station operators.
Tronc agreed to sell the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and some other newspapers to billionaire investor Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million cash in February, a move aimed at lowering its debt, slashing its pension liabilities and helping it expand its digital operations. 
Former Tronc chairman Michael Ferro Jr's fund Merrick Venture Management, which owns 25.6 percent of Tronc, agreed in April to sell its stake to McCormick (NYSE:MKC) Media for $208.7 million but subsequently terminated the sale of the stake, arguing that the investor group breached its obligations.
Tribune Co spun off its newspaper assets in 2014 as Tribune Publishing, which in 2016 renamed itself Tronc, short for ""Tribune Online Content."" 

Tribune Publishing had once been part of media conglomerate Tribune Co, that emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and was owned by Capital LLC (N:OAK) and Angelo, Gordon & Co. In 2013, Tribune decided to separate its publishing business from its more-profitable broadcast division through a tax free spinoff.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 03:02PM ET</span>",Samsung unveils gaming-friendly Galaxy Note 9 to boost sales,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) launched the Galaxy Note 9 ""phablet"" in New York on Thursday, promising better battery life and quick cooling to attract gamers and revive flagging sales.
The focus on gamer-friendly features appears to be a shift away from Samsung's previous positioning of the Note as a productivity-boosting device, and is an attempt to lure younger customers as the company's smartphone sales falter.
U.S. carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said the new device will be available for pre-order from August 10, with the 128 gigabyte model priced at $999.99 and 512GB model at $1,249.99.
Sprint Corp (N:S) will introduce the smartphone on August 24 and offer a 50 percent discount as part of a promotional scheme.
Samsung also launched the Galaxy Home speaker, a device that will use its Bixby voice assistant and compete with similar products from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.
The company last month posted its slowest quarterly profit growth in more than a year as rivals such as China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] nipped at its heels, challenging the market leader with cheaper, feature-packed models.
An industry source said the new Note would be priced similarly to its predecessor Note 8, which sold at around $950. The Note 8 sported dual rear cameras and the biggest screen to date on a Samsung smartphone.
The new Note will support up to 1 terabyte of memory - it will have a 512 GB version that will support an additional 512 GB memory card - the source said, making Samsung the first major smartphone maker to sell a 1TB phone.
Samsung launched the Note 9 at 11 a.m. in New York on Thursday, or Friday midnight in Seoul. The new Note is set to hit stores on Aug. 24, Samsung said.
The launch comes about three weeks earlier than its predecessor's release date, a move prompted by increased competition in the second half of the year as rivals release new smartphone models.
During the event, the company also unveiled its Samsung Galaxy watch with a wireless pad and charger duo for its watch and Note 9.
Samsung said the Note 9 will be the first Android phone to support Fortnite, a hugely popular video-and-smartphone survival game that was only playable on computers, consoles and Apple products until now. Lovers of the game will get an exclusive Note 9 character skin or alternative appearance for characters.
The phablet - a cross between a smartphone and a tablet - would also be able to cool down quickly during game sessions that typically heat up phones a lot.
Its S Pen stylus is Bluetooth-enabled and designed to act as a remote for controlling YouTube video playback.
For its smart speakers, Samsung has partnered with  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) for music streaming. Spotify shares rose nearly 5 percent to $186.96 after the announcement.
HOPES ON NEW MODEL
""We expect the Note 9 to sell more than its previous model and we will mobilize all our sales and marketing resources to ensure the successful launch,"" KyeongTae Lee, Samsung's vice-president of mobile communication, told investors on the company's earnings conference call last week.
Samsung does not break out shipments of its smartphone models, but analysts reckon it has shipped around 10 million Note 8 models so far.
The company hopes to break through its sales slump with the new Note, after it reported last month that its flagship Galaxy S9 phone missed sales targets. Profit in the mobile division fell by a third in the April-June quarter.
Chinese rival Huawei predicted last week it would become the world's top smartphone seller by volume - displacing Samsung - in the final quarter of next year.
Meanwhile, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) managed to sell more of its $1,000 iPhone Xs in the June quarter and regain some favor in China.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 02:52PM ET</span>","Tribune Media ends merger deal with Sinclair, files suit","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) -  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) terminated its $3.9 billion sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group (O:SBGI) on Thursday and sued Sinclair for breach of contract, claiming the rival TV-station owner mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.
The collapse of the deal, hatched 15 months ago and backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially ends Sinclair's hopes of building a national Conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) Fox News.
Sinclair, the largest U.S. broadcast station owner with 192 stations, said Thursday it would no longer pursue the Tribune merger and denied Tribune's allegations. The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission expressed opposition to the deal last month, when it questioned Sinclair's candor over the planned sale of some stations, suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them. 
The FCC voted 4-0 in July to refer the deal to administrative law judge for a hearing, a move that officials said privately would effectively kill the merger.
The Tribune lawsuit seeks about $1 billion of lost premium to Tribune’s stockholders and additional damages in an amount to be proven at trial over what it called Sinclair's ""misconduct."" 
Sinclair's president and chief executive, Chris Ripley, said ""we unequivocally stand by our position that we did not mislead the FCC with respect to the transaction or act in any way other than with complete candor and transparency."" 
The FCC said Sinclair did not “fully disclose facts"" relating to the planned sale of three stations, including pre-existing business relationships the company had with prospective buyers. It also said the $60 million purchase price for Tribune's WGN-TV in Chicago ""appeared to be significantly below market value.""
Sinclair shares sank 3 percent to $26.37 in afternoon trading, while Tribune climbed 2.9 percent to $34.60.
'PLAYED HARDBALL'
In its lawsuit, Tribune said Sinclair failed to live up to obligations to agree to asset sales to independent operators in order to win approval for the deal. 
Instead, Tribune said, Sinclair played hardball with the Justice Department, and in January 2018 when the top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, told Sinclair that the divestitures were inadequate, Sinclair General Counsel Barry Faber replied, ""Sue me.""
The suit said ""Sinclair’s absurdly aggressive regulatory proposals, disregard of the FCC’s signals, and the lengthy and avoidable delays that flowed from Sinclair’s behavior"" led to the merger's failure.
The FCC said in July Sinclair ""did not fully disclose"" facts about the merger, raising questions about whether the company had ""attempted to skirt the commission's broadcast ownership rules"" and would, in fact, actually control the stations Sinclair said it was divesting.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been vocal in his opposition to the deal, a stance that was criticized by Trump. Pai declined to comment Thursday.
""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn't approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People,"" Trump said in a Twitter post in July.
Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August 2017 that Sinclair forces its TV stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.” The group praised Tribune's announcement Thursday.
Pai told Congress after Trump's tweet that he stood by his decision to refer the issue to a hearing.
Sinclair said in May 2017 it planned to acquire Chicago-based Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets in a deal that would help Sinclair reach seven out of ten U.S. households.
OTHER BIDS?
Tribune is likely to receive other bids as the industry faces a wave of consolidation.
Nexstar Media Group (O:NXST) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA), partnering with private equity, had considering buying Tribune before Sinclair announced its deal and are likely bidders, analysts have said.
Last month, Cox Enterprises Inc  said it was exploring strategic options for its 14 television properties, citing statements by Pai ""that he intends to loosen rules around ownership of local TV stations.""
The FCC voted last month to refer the proposed merger to an administrative law judge to review questions about Sinclair's candor, a move that analysts had then said would likely lead to the deal's collapse. 
The company is ""open to all opportunities"" in terms of industry consolidation or remaining independent, Tribune Media Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern told investors on a call on Thursday. He noted there was ""tons of activity out there.""
The FCC is considering changing the rules that limit how many TV stations one company can own.
Kern said he would continue to run the company until Tribune reached a ""permanent state.""
He said the merger's failure was not the result of ""an unwelcoming regulatory environment"" but how Sinclair moved forward.
QUESTIONS ABOUT DIVESTMENTS
Under the terms of the deal, Tribune and Sinclair had the right to call off the merger without paying a termination fee if it was not completed by Aug. 8.
A dozen Senate Democrats said in April Sinclair was deliberately distorting news coverage by forcing local stations to read scripts that criticized what it described as “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.”
The FCC raised questions after Sinclair had proposed to sell WGN to Maryland auto dealer Steven Fader, a longtime business associate of Sinclair Executive Chairman David Smith, as Sinclair would largely continue to operate the station under a services agreement. 
Sinclair also had planned to sell stations in Dallas and Houston to Cunningham Broadcasting Corp, a company controlled by the estate of Smith’s mother.
To attempt to satisfy the FCC, Sinclair had said last month it would not divest WGN and would seek to put the two Texas stations into a divestiture trust to be sold and operated by an independent trustee.
The FCC's concerns followed similar questions raised in separate filings by the American Civil Liberties Union and conservative news outlet Newsmax Media.
The ACLU said Thursday ""the merger would have trampled on First Amendment principles"" and ""crippled the future of journalism.""
Sinclair announced on Thursday it has approved a $1-billion share repurchase. 

Commenting on the repurchase, Ripley, said: “It is unfortunate that Tribune Media Company terminated our Merger Agreement. Nonetheless, we strongly believe in the long term outlook of our Company and disagree with the market’s current discounted view on our share price. The $1 billion authorization does not use our future free cash flow generation, but simply the excess cash currently on our balance sheet.”

863,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Is SpaceX the model for a private Tesla?,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has held up his closely held space transportation company SpaceX as a model for taking his loss-making electric car company private, saying he wants existing Tesla investors to continue to hold stock.
Below are several questions and answers on SpaceX, its shareholders, valuation and customers.
WHAT DID MUSK SAY WHEN HE COMPARED SPACEX AND TESLA?
In a letter https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private on Tesla's website, Musk said that taking the company private would shield Tesla from the scrutiny of Wall Street and its demand for positive quarterly results. Musk pointed to SpaceX to explain the benefits of private ownership. 
""SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.""
Musk said in a tweet that he hoped all current investors would stay with Tesla when it went private and had a ""special purpose"" fund structure in mind to accomplish that. A special purpose vehicle is a structure that pools investors into a single entity. Private market experts say they are unclear how that would work. 
WHAT IS SPACEX? 
Founded in 2003, Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX has upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. The company has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars in contracts, including from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. In February it test-launched the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.
WHO OWNS SPACEX? 
A Musk trust owns 54 percent of the outstanding stock of SpaceX, and has voting control of 78 percent of the outstanding shares, according to a 2016 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, SpaceX's most recent.
No other shareholder owns 10 percent or more. Alphabet's  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL) invested $900 million in January 2015, Google said. Five Fidelity Investments funds had a collective stake worth roughly about $436 million, according to disclosures from March and June, the most recent available. 
After raising $450 million last year and another tranche of $214 million this year, the company is valued at about $25 billion.
Other investors include venture capitalists and private investors such as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. 
A SpaceX spokeswoman declined to comment on its shareholders, future or current investors, or its capital structure. She referred to comments that Musk has made publicly. 
CAN EMPLOYEES, SMALL INVESTORS BUY AND SELL SHARES? 
Employees get stock units or options to buy shares they can sell after several years, according to people familiar with the matter.
SpaceX is a regular sponsor of stock sales for investors and employees to cash out. Musk said that every six months, employees and external shareholders can buy and sell shares. Two people who have worked at SpaceX and an investor confirmed the process, although they say it is tightly controlled, with SpaceX determining who can sell, who can buy, as well as how often sales are held.
One former SpaceX employee, who still owns shares, said the last selling period was in March and the previous selling window was in August 2017. 
The former employee added that SpaceX workers are given ample opportunities to sell shares in the secondary market.
""For most folks who own Tesla and SpaceX, they recognize these are long-term investments,"" the ex-employee said. ""But it's hard to completely ignore it when it's always in the news and there's so much volatility.""
Musk said he wants all Tesla investors to continue to hold private company stock.
""Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity's SpaceX investment,"" he wrote in a tweet.
The Fidelity funds own shares in SpaceX that were purchased directly, and not through a special purpose fund.
Other SpaceX investors have stakes in the company through the special purpose funds, or special purpose vehicles. In those cases, many investors put money into a single fund, and that fund takes a stake in the company, according to a SpaceX investor.
Generally, companies do not know the identities of investors in the special purpose vehicles, although they are typically professional, and not retail, investors, who for various reasons are unable to directly invest in a highly valued startup. 
Regulations cap the number of investors in a private company at 2,000.
DOES NASA CARE IF ITS CONTRACTORS ARE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES? 

NASA has selected both private and public companies for space services. For example, it hired  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) and SpaceX for cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, and partnered with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and SpaceX as the companies develop rocket-and-capsule vehicles for carrying astronauts to the space station.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp CEO sees job cuts as part of overhaul: FAZ,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's embattled industrial group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) expects job cuts as part of an overhaul of its operations, daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing an interview with the top executive.
""Our employees... are fully aware that this (overhaul) cannot be accomplished without cutbacks,"" interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff said in an interview with the newspaper to be published on Friday.
""People know that we have to earn money. At corporate headquarters, we already saved more than 100 million euros ($115.55 million) in costs in the first nine months of our fiscal year, and without causing any noise. Getting by without any job cuts at all will certainly not be possible,"" Kerkhoff was quoted as saying.
Essen-based Thyssenkrupp, which has been in crisis-mode since CEO Heinrich Hiesinger and Supervisory Board Chairman Ulrich Lehner both resigned last month, set itself new mid-term profit margin targets for its four divisions earlier on Thursday. 
Activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott, which together hold about a fifth of Thyssenkrupp, have led calls for a major improvement in the company's operating performance.

Separately, Kerkhoff told the newspaper he does not feel pressed for time as he leads the search for a new chairman and strategy for the group.

865,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Markets in U.S. Are Defying the Tumult Convulsing Rest of World,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 has been edging back toward its January peak, and the U.S. Treasury just auctioned a record amount of 10- and 30-year debt with relative ease. Looking at American markets, there’s little sign of the angst that’s been roiling emerging economies.
At this point, few strategists are warning about the potential for knock-on hits to the U.S. economy or the Federal Reserve’s policy agenda. And some American assets may even benefit from the volatility abroad.
To the likely dismay of President Donald Trump, the dollar is widely seen as a winner should tit-for-tat protectionist measures push investors to seek a haven. That pattern was at work on Thursday as emerging-market currencies extended their slump, led by Turkey’s lira and Russia’s ruble amid threatened American sanctions. In the U.S., Treasuries and the greenback advanced, while the S&P 500 was little changed.
“If we looked at the world through just a U.S. lens, it would all seem quite sublime. Geopolitics and geo-tensions are far from it, however,” Marty Mitchell, former head government bond trader at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and now an independent strategist, said in his daily newsletter Thursday. “It’s just a strange and disconcerting world that we live in, yet the U.S. equity market and the U.S. economy just keep chugging along.”
The S&P 500 was up about 0.1 percent at 1:30 p.m. in New York Thursday, bringing its 2018 increase to about 7 percent. Ten-year Treasuries gained, with yields falling 3 basis points to 2.93 percent. The government’s unprecedented $26 billion sale of the maturity Wednesday drew above-average demand, and Thursday’s $18 billion sale of 30-year bonds, also a record, was solid.
‘No Evidence’
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists say there are few signs that the tariffs already implemented or the fear of an escalation in the trade dispute are having a substantial impact on U.S. companies’ hiring plans or overall economic variables that would affect growth.
“We find no evidence of a relative deceleration in job growth over the last three months, compared to the prior year, in more export-dependent industries,” the analysts wrote in a note published Aug. 8.
Tom Orlik at Bloomberg Economics says the tariffs are for now too small to move the dial on aggregate measures of the U.S. economy. Tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, or even $200 billion in Chinese goods, are a fraction of the $17.7 trillion of annual merchandise trade, Orlik says.
So for now, investors may have good reason to be confident in U.S. assets amid the global turmoil. But that doesn’t mean they can ignore the events offshore, such as Turkey, says Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group.
Turkey’s lira sank to a record low Thursday and bond yields climbed as the threat of further U.S. sanctions over the detention of an American pastor lingered. Geopolitical concerns dragged down currencies in other major emerging markets from South Africa to Brazil.
“While I expect the goings-on in Turkey to remain contained to Turkey (the recent problem is the U.S. sanctions against it), it is becoming such a financial mess there that we still have to be on watch for any contagion in terms of risk behavior in other emerging markets,” Boockvar wrote in a note Thursday.

Mercedes-Benz GLE and GLS models, built in the United States between May 4 and June 12, 2018, have a brake issue which poses a ""safety risk,"" according to a Chinese customs document circulating on Chinese social media. 
The document said authorities in Shanghai had found the rear brakes on these vehicles to be ""insufficient."" The authenticity of the documents could not be verified with Chinese authorities. 
Daimler said the company had been made aware of a potential brake issue related to vehicles in China imported from the United States. 
""We are working with the relevant authorities to resolve the issue,"" a spokeswoman said on Thursday. Daimler could not immediately comment on the number of vehicles affected, and is seeking to resolve what it described as an ""entirely technical issue."" 
On Wednesday, Chinese authorities said they would impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from steel products to autos, in an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the United States.

In June, Daimler cut its 2018 profit forecast because of the trade war between China and the United States, sparking fears of a wave of earnings downgrades in the auto industry.

The S&P 500 Energy Sector index fell about 0.7% at 11:50 AM ET (15:55 GMT).
Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), the weakest component in the index, fell about 8%.
Apache will give about $1 billion in assets to Kayne Anderson Acquisition for the deal.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Hess (NYSE:HES) and Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) were also down midday.
Energy stocks slumped despite the fact the crude oil was little changed as traders digested a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories and the prospect of less Iranian crude on the market.
The first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran went into effect on Tuesday, while a second round is expected in early November. The second set of sanctions are expected to hit the countries energy infrastructure and oil exports, increasing the potential of a global energy supply shortage.
Many countries, including Europe, China and Russia, oppose the sanctions, but the White House wants other countries to stop buying oil from Iran.
Oil prices have been driven higher in the past few months as demand for oil outstrips supply, but trade tensions have weighed on markets. China is imposing a 25% tariff on $16 billion of U.S. imports in response to a U.S. tariff of the same amount on Chinese goods. As the two largest economies in the world go head-to-head over trade policies, investors worry about its potential impact on commodities and the global economy."
885,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Viacom shares gain as 'Mission Impossible' powers Paramount,"By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Viacom Inc's (O:VIAB) quarterly profit beat analysts' estimates and the media company forecast a strong current quarter, boosted by the success of its movie ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"".
The upbeat results and forecast lifted the company's shares by 7 percent, with Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish saying Paramount Pictures will turn in a profit again in the fourth quarter.
The studio's latest Tom Cruise-starrer Mission Impossible movie is on track to become a money churner after grossing nearly $330 million worldwide since releasing in the last week of July.
""Given the success of 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout', we expect September quarter to be the third consecutive quarter of profitability for Paramount,"" Chief Financial Officer Wade Davis said on a post-earnings call.
Since taking the helm in 2016, Bakish has focused on Paramount and the company's cable TV business, which like its peers has been losing subscribers in the face of competition from Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime video.
The owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon said domestic advertising revenue fell 3 percent to $922 million, while domestic affiliate revenue also fell 3 percent to $978 million.
But, the company expects domestic affiliate revenue to increase in the current quarter and domestic ad sales to start growing again in 2019.
""We'd call this a mixed set of results. Most positives are cost initiatives at Media that are improving margins and Paramount's revitalization,"" said RBC analyst Steven Cahall. ""Most negative is the advertising result since it's still Viacom's largest revenue pool."" 
The results come when Viacom investors are weighing the prospects of a merger with CBS Corp (N:CBS). 
Major shareholder Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari want to merge Viacom with CBS - a company they control - but the efforts are being opposed by CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves.
In the midst of the raging legal battle, CBS is investigations allegations of sexual misconduct against Moonves.
""Investor sentiment and enthusiasm are being driven by better fundamentals in F2019 and renewed expectation of a merger with CBS,"" said JBL analyst Jeffrey Logsdon.
Bakish said on the call he would not comment on any specific M&A related queries. 
Net income attributable to Viacom fell to $522 million, or $1.29 per share, in the third quarter ended June 30, from $683 million, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue fell 3.7 percent to $3.24 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.18 per share.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.07 per share and revenue of $3.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, as new U.S. sanctions targeting dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector took effect despite pleas from Washington's allies. 
The move follows Washington reneging on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proved difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business.
""U.S. decisions on sanctions do not affect the legal situation in Switzerland with regard to Iran,"" said Fabian Maienfisch of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).
Renewed U.S. sanctions may affect Swiss firms that have business relations with Iran, however. 
""Switzerland regrets that the sanctions situation in relation to Iran is again deteriorating,"" he said.
The Swiss federal government would defend Swiss economic interests but cannot dictate the reaction of companies to the new climate, he said, adding: ""[The government] recommends that companies pursue their commercial relations with Iran and inform themselves about the situation"".

Swiss-based Nestle (S:NESN), the world's biggest food company which produces infant formula and cereals as well as bottled water in Iran, said on Tuesday that it sees no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on the country.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (Reuters) - When General Motors Co (N:GM) engineers were developing the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, some of them joined public tours of  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) Dearborn, Michigan factory to watch aluminum-bodied F-series trucks go down the assembly line.
The redesign of the Ford F-series trucks, launched in 2014, set a new standard for fuel economy and lightweight vehicle construction. But armed with stopwatches and trained eyes, the GM engineers believed they saw problems.
“They had a real hard time getting those doors to fit,” Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM truck programs told Reuters.
His team did more intelligence gathering. They bought and tore apart Ford F-series doors sold as repair parts. Their conclusion: GM could cut weight in its trucks for a lower cost using doors made of a combination of aluminum and high strength steel that could be thinner than standard steel, shaving off kilograms in the process.
These pounds and penny-based decisions will have major implications in the highest stakes game going in Detroit: dominance in the world’s most profitable vehicle market, the petrol-fueled large pickup segment. What's more, GM is banking on strong sales of overhauled 2019 Silverados and GMC Sierras to fund its push into automated, electric vehicles – a business many investors see as the auto industry’s long term future.
The risks are high given the hits automakers have taken from U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies.
Rising aluminum prices spurred by Trump’s tariffs are driving up costs on the Ford’s F-series, while rising steel and aluminum prices drag on GM results. GM also has a significant risk should the United States, Mexico and Canada fail to agree on a new NAFTA trade deal, given GM trucks built at its Silao, Mexico factory could face a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA collapses.

Interviews with GM executives and a tour at its factory here in northwest Indiana provide a detailed look inside GM's plan for the most important vehicles in its global lineup.
These big pickups are everything Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model 3 or a Chevy Bolt electric car is not.
The mostly steel body is bolted to the truck's steel frame, rather than the one-piece body and frame electric vehicles. The majority of trucks will have a V-8 gasoline engine in front powering the rear wheels – like the classic GM cars of the 1950s. Some Silverados will have new four-cylinder engines, but there is no electric or hybrid offering as of now. The new Silverado - GM's top-selling vehicle in the United States - is a technology achievement of a different kind.
It is taller and has a longer wheelbase than its beefy predecessor, which can help it more easily meet federal fuel efficiency rules. But it is 450 pounds lighter, and its V-8 engine achieves 23 mile per gallon on the highway that rivals smaller SUVs.
Wall Street investors give Tesla and its electric vehicles a higher value than GM’s shares. GM is betting that its core customers in the American heartland will keep paying premium prices - 27 percent of GM trucks sell for more than $55,000 - for these vehicles capable of hauling a trailer by day and substituting for a luxury sedan by night.
Large pickups generate at least $17,000 a vehicle in pre-tax profit for GM, the company has indicated in disclosures to investors. GM executives told Reuters that with the new trucks, GM will have a big cost advantage they can use to chop at Ford’s leading market share.
“We think we have thousands of dollars advantage (over Ford) just in the aluminum costs. It’s big,” said Herrick during a walk through the Fort Wayne plant, which began shipping the new Silverados and Sierras late last month.
He said GM plans to use its Silverado cost advantage to put more safety or entertainment technology in the trucks, fund programs such as a promised fleet of electric cars and return money to shareholders.
At Ford, truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said the company plans to stick to its game plan. For 41 years, the F-series trucks have been the best-selling single model line in the United States. For the first half of this year, the F-series line – which ranges from the light-duty F-150 to medium duty commercial trucks – has a 59,000 vehicle lead over the combined Chevrolet and GMC large pickups.
“There’s always been competition in this segment and there always will be,” Eckert said.
Ford’s purchasing director Hau Thai-Tang at an investor conference on Wednesday called the F-series pickup “one of our profit pillars,” and said Ford plans to increase the share of its 2018-2022 product development budget allocated to trucks and commercial vehicles to 29 percent from 24 percent in its prior 2015-2019 plan.
Ford said it cuts costs by recycling about 20 millions pounds of aluminum scrap every month in its operations, enough to build about 37,000 F-series bodies.
A LIGHT METAL DUEL
For decades, Ford and GM matched each other’s moves closely and built trucks that were similar in design, technology and capability.
With the launch of GM’s new trucks, the rivals' technology strategies have diverged.
Ford in 2014 launched a new generation of F-series trucks with all-aluminum body structures for its big pickup trucks, and challenged rivals to find a better way match the fuel efficiency and towing power achieved using the lightweight metal and turbo-charged, six-cylinder engines.
Rising pressure from the U.S. government to slash carbon dioxide emissions made Ford’s move look smart.
The debate within GM over whether to follow Ford’s aluminum strategy “was a really hotly contested item for us,” said Herrick. He recalled skeptical questions when he sought approval from GM’s board for the billions of dollars required to launch the new Silverados at three factories.
“Son, it really costs this much to build all those trucks?” the 58-year-old executive recalled being asked by a member of the board.
Herrick, and Global Product Development chief Mark Reuss, said the shareholders’ billions would be better spent on what they call a “multi-material” strategy.
The new Silverado and Sierra got close to the Ford truck’s weight using seven different grades of steel in the cab, aluminum hoods, door exterior panels and tailgates. Reuss pushed development of a novel carbon fiber plastic that will be molded to make load beds for certain high-priced GMC models – and perhaps be used in different ways in future GM models, Reuss said.
Before GM's direction was clear, a supplier to Ford sent Reuss a box of the rivets his competitor was using to fasten the F-series aluminum body panels together, anticipating he’d be ordering them, too.
“They’re still on my desk,” Reuss said in an interview.
The combination of weight reduction and engine technology produces a rear-wheel drive 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter V-8 and an eight-speed automatic transmission that averages 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway, with a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon. Different versions of the truck get different mileage ratings.
A Ford F-150 with a 3.5 liter turbo six cylinder and optional equipment that boosts the payload to about 3,230 pounds is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city, 21 on the highway and 19 combined, according to the government. An F-150 with a lighter payload rating of about 2,640 pounds is rated at 18 miles per gallon city, and 25 miles per gallon on the highway, according to the government. Chevrolet claims a payload of 2,190 pounds for a 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter engine and an eight-speed transmission.
FOUR DOORS FOR PROFIT
In some crucial ways, GM is following Ford.
GM previously could not keep pace with demand for crew cab pickups – models with four, sedan-style doors in the cab. Ford used its lead in crew cab design to develop luxury truck models, such as the F-450 Limited, that have sticker prices as high as $100,000.
Average selling prices in the segment are around $42,000 to $45,000 - higher than the industry average.
GM has now dedicated two factories to building light duty pickups - in Fort Wayne and Silao, Mexico - which have the flexibility to build “darn near 100 percent crew cabs if we wanted,” Herrick said.
The GMC marketing division, meanwhile, is putting more emphasis on its Denali luxury truck brand, while Chevrolet will market more luxurious versions of the Silverado such as the frontier-themed High Country, which has leather seats and a Bose sound system. GM executives said they want to increase the company’s share of trucks sold at prices above $55,000 from the current 27 percent.
John Bergstrom, who owns a multi-brand network of dealerships based in Neenah, Wisconsin, said the new GM trucks should pull in buyers who currently don’t drive a pickup.

“We didn’t have the technology we needed,” Bergstrom said. With the new truck, “we’ve got that. They almost magically figured out how to get fuel economy out of these things.”

The industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.
Under its new strategy, which includes the creation of an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, Maersk aims to expand its transport and logistics business in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance. 
It wants to provide end-to-end solutions for customers rather than just shipping a container from port to port.
Success of the platform depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince industry players to sign up.
Port operators in Singapore, Hong Kong and Rotterdam, customs authorities in the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Australia and Peru, and container carrier Pacific International Lines (PIL) are among the companies and organizations that have joined the platform, Maersk and IBM said in a joint statement. 
The platform is still in the pilot phase and ""is expected to be fully commercially available by the end of this year,"" they said.
Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.
The platform named TradeLens aims to help manage and track the paper trail by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end.

More than $4 trillion in goods are shipped each year, and more than 80 percent of the goods consumers use daily are carried by the ocean shipping industry, Maersk said earlier this year.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 09:04AM ET</span>",The 'Friends' trend: '90s fashion revival for back-to-school season,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Urban Outfitters Inc (O:URBN),  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) and other retailers are filling stores with styles from the 1990s in a bet that fanny packs, chunky-soled sneakers and high-waisted ""mom jeans"" will lift back-to-school sales.
U.S. apparel retailers, hurt by more consumers shopping online and declining mall traffic, have been starved for a major new fashion movement to entice finicky millennial buyers.
With back-to-school spending expected to rise due to a strong economy and high consumer confidence this year, retailers are hoping renewed interest in '90s fashion will fuel a recovery in the sector after several quarters of sales declines.
The trend is a leading back-to-school story, with a six-fold increase in the number of kidswear products described as 90s' style online in July, said Katie Smith, analyst for retail technology company Edited. 
Chunky sneakers or Buffalo shoes alone, - a streetwear classic from the '90s with thick rubber soles - recorded a 76 percent rise in arrivals in kidswear this June, Smith said.
The fashion reboot is being characterized as the ""Friends"" trend, according to A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello, with teens and millennials inspired by what characters wore on the '90s hit television show that is now available on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and YouTube.
For example, Urban Outfitters is selling the 'Urban Renewal Remade '90s Shortall Overall' and the 'New York minute corduroy skirt', which resemble clothes worn by Rachel Green, a popular character played by Jennifer Aniston on ""Friends"". 
""There has to be something that is forcing teens to get out there and shop and I think there hasn't been something for such a long time. So that's why I think this (trend) is a positive shift,"" Santaniello said.
The back-to-school sales period is the busiest shopping season behind the year-end holidays, and can contribute a third of profits for retailers.
Shoppers will be doling out an average of $284 on clothing and shoes compared with $186 on electronics, a 28 percent increase over last year, according to a survey by RetailMeNot Inc, a website that tracks coupons and promotions at major retail brands.
Deloitte's annual back-to-school survey shows that shoppers will spend more on clothes and accessories, about $15 billion or 55 percent of the total $27.6 billion expected to be spent. https:// Retailers are in a pretty good spot, especially in North America, where the economy is healthier than a year ago, NPD's lead retail analyst Marshall Cohen said. (Click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2MrWMCu for an interactive on back-to-school quarter performance of apparel retailers) OLD BECOMES NEW AGAIN American Eagle's global brand president Chad Kessler said it is bit of an evolution, with high-rise mom jeans and crop tops influencing shoppers this year.  ""I do think the 90s are a big influence,"" Kessler said. Because Urban Outfitters targets both adults and young shoppers, with its Anthropologie and namesake stores, BlueFin Research analyst Rebecca Duval said she expects the company to be one of the strongest brands this season along with Gap Inc (N:GPS). Urban Outfitters is expected to post same-store sales growth of 5.6 percent in the third quarter, while American Eagle could report a 4.6 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, marking the best growth in three years. Although Gap and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) are not expected to show the same same-store sales growth, overall sales for the four retailers are expected to be the highest in at least four years. U.S. apparel retailers struggled after millennials, born between 1986 and 1996, switched to fast-fashion trends from European labels like H&M (ST:HMb) and Inditex's (MC:ITX) Zara.  The shift forced retailers to diversify inventory and rely less on once popular logo emblazoned apparel.  Social media is also having an impact, with retailers using the medium to market and rope in younger buyers.  
""Every twenty years fashion comes back ... You stay away from something long enough and you crave it,"" Vanessa Valiente, personal stylist and the creator of fashion blog V-Style, said.

If the index breaks above 2,872.87, it would notch its first record high since Jan. 26.
The Nasdaq was also less than 1% away from a record while the Dow remained 3.9% below its all-time high.
Against this backdrop, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often viewed as a gauge of anxiety in financial markets, fell to a seven-month low of 10.17.
Investors have wrestled with trade worries over the past several weeks, but tensions between Washington and Beijing have mostly taken a back seat to a bevy of corporate results that have helped underpin stocks.
Wall Street has reached the tail end of the latest corporate earnings season.
Nearly 90% of S&P 500 companies have released their calendar second-quarter results so far. Of those companies, around 77% have reported better-than-forecast quarterly profits, according to FactSet.
Those earnings have helped to bolster the belief that a steady U.S. economic expansion will continue, despite heightened tariff skirmishes with China.
However, looking ahead, autumn could bring a reality check to markets in the form of slower U.S. growth indicators, U.S. mid-term elections and - above all - the risk of a full-blown global trade war.

929,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Scrutinizes China’s HNA Over Building Near Trump Tower,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s HNA Group Co. (HK:0521) said it’s been questioned by the U.S. government’s investment-review panel over its ownership of a building in Manhattan near Trump Tower.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which assesses deals posing potential national-security risks, raised concerns about some “unique facts and circumstances” regarding the location of the building, a representative for the Chinese company said in a statement. Those issues didn’t exist when HNA bought the 850 Third Avenue property, according to the statement.
The 21-story building houses one of only two police precincts that are within a mile of Trump Tower, the president’s base when he’s in New York. HNA said it’s taking steps to address concerns voiced by the committee, without providing further detail.
HNA also denied a New York Post report that President Donald Trump’s administration is poised to seize a majority stake in the building, which the debt-saddled company has been looking to unload. “There is no seizure or forced sale of 850 Third Avenue underway or pending, and it is grossly inaccurate and misleading to suggest otherwise,” it said.
Trade War
The scrutiny comes amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China’s government, which is said to have decided to help HNA pull itself out of recent liquidity challenges. The Chinese conglomerate, which has sold more than $17 billion in assets to reduce its massive debt load, has been marketing the Manhattan building among several properties it is considering selling.
Trump has been zeroing in on Chinese investment in the U.S. amid his escalating trade war with the world’s second-largest economy.
The increased attention has seen some high-profile deals scuppered, such as Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s attempt to buy Dallas-based payment provider MoneyGram International. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd.’s $117 billion attempt to buy California’s Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. -- which would have been the largest tech deal in history -- was shot down on concerns the merger would benefit China’s emerging telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.
Plans to bolster CFIUS’s powers may mean more deals get into trouble. The body’s reach may be expanded under a bill that Congress is expected to pass in August.
This isn’t the first time HNA has crossed CFIUS’s radar. In late April, it abandoned plans to buy SkyBridge Capital from former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci after waiting months for approval from the body. The group has also faced heightened scrutiny across its holdings worldwide, partly because of questions about its ownership.
HNA agreed to buy the 850 Third Avenue building before Trump was elected. The company has become a poster child for a swathe of Chinese acquirers that sought out high-profile deals around the world before the government started reining them in last year amid concern about unsustainable corporate debt levels.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>",Rosy assumptions on retirement timing invite rude financial surprise,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Working longer can boost the odds of a secure retirement - that is an article of faith in retirement planning circles these days. 
But many people do not wind up working as long as they expect or hope. And baking in too much optimism about career longevity to your retirement plan can take a heavy toll.
A new research report by Morningstar warns that assumptions about working longer actually can work against you - by considerable margins in some cases - if retirement comes sooner and savings fall short.
“What people are doing is picking unrealistic ages,” said David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar and author of the report. “You might say that you want to work until 67, but a lot of things can go wrong.”
Most formal retirement plans are built around a specific retirement age. But health problems, job loss or just plain burnout often produce a different outcome. Blanchett found that for anyone planning to retire after age 61, the chances of meeting your income and standard-of-living goals can fall sharply if you do not work at least to that age.
“In other words, if your plan predicts a 90 percent chance of meeting your goals if you work until your late sixties, you might really only have a 60 percent chance of meeting that goal,” he said in an interview.
There has been a general trend toward working longer in recent years. Labor participation rates have jumped substantially among men and women in their 60s and early 70s. Thirty-nine percent of men age 65 to 69 were working in 2017, compared with 27 percent in 1990, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census Bureau data. Among  women, the comparable participation rate jumped to 29 percent from 17 percent. 
Data on claiming of Social Security benefits also points toward delayed retirement. As recently as 2004, half of all men and 55 percent of women filed at age 62. But in 2016, just 32 percent of men and 37 percent of women were filing at 62. The share of men filing at their full retirement age - 66 - also jumped from 11.5 percent in 2004 to 17.9 percent in 2016. For women it rose from 7.5 percent to 12.6 percent (https://reut.rs/2Kebif6).
ALTERNATE SCENARIOS NEEDED
But when it comes to individuals, numerous surveys point to the unpredictability of actual retirement dates. (https://reut.rs/2zLey1A). Blanchett reviewed one of the best available data sets - the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This is an especially useful data set because it tracks a specific group of households over time, allowing a comparison of when people predicted they would retire - and when they actually did. 
The HRS data suggests that planned and actual retirement ages align at 61, Blanchett reports. That is, people who plan to retire earlier than that age tend to retire later, and those who plan to retire after 61 retire earlier than expected. Each planned retirement year (earlier or later) results in a half-year difference in actual retirement age. For example, people who plan to retire at age 69 likely will retire at 65.
Blanchett searched the HRS data for other predictors of whether people will achieve their intended retirement age, such as gender or how frequently they exercise. “Some were worthwhile, but only on the margin,” he said. “By far, the most important predictor was the expected age, and how far it varied from 61.”
Blanchett also looked at the probability of retirement plan success for people who make it to their planned retirement ages against those who do not. That was done using Monte Carlo analysis, which uses algorithms to serve up a range of possible outcomes.
If you work with a financial adviser, your plan likely revolves around a specific retirement age assumption. Blanchett’s findings suggest that you have a conversation about ""what if?"" scenarios - run some alternatives examining the impact of an earlier date. If you are a do-it-yourselfer, most online planning tools can help you make alternate projections.
But Blanchett’s key finding is that people need to save more, to protect against overly optimistic assumptions of a delayed retirement. How much more you should be saving depends on how long you hope to work and your expected annual rate of withdrawal. For example, if you aim to work to age 69 and withdraw 4 percent annually, the amount of money you are saving now should be ratcheted up by 80 percent.
Is that realistic, considering the retirement saving shortfall most workers already face? “The average saving rate is 3 percent now, and many people could double that,” he said. “I know some people won’t do that, but this data should at least get people thinking about making a plan - you need to be conservative and realistic about your goals.”
But the risks of a working-longer plan also point to the importance of Social Security for most retirement plans - the program is designed to help people cope with risks such as premature loss of work and income. Workers can file for benefits as early as age 62, but for some workers facing an earlier-than-expected retirement, it will make sense to delay claiming benefits even if it means using savings to meet living expenses. This offers one of the best routes to higher retirement income, since benefit amounts are increased 8 percent for every 12 months of delay. 
“Social Security is the best source of retirement income we have - period,” Blanchett said. “And the best thing you can do is delay filing for benefits - you can’t beat the payout from delayed retirement credits.”

931,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 07:46AM ET</span>","Mazda, Suzuki, Yamaha Motor apologize for improper vehicle tests","By Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co improperly tested vehicles for fuel economy and emissions, the Japanese government said on Thursday, revealing fresh cases of compliance failures by manufacturers.
The results came to light after the government had ordered the automakers to check their operations after revelations of improper testing at Subaru Corp and Nissan Motor Co last year.
The conduct of automakers globally has come under intense scrutiny after Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.
In the Japanese cases, the carmakers have not broken any laws or prompted massive recalls. But a growing list of improprieties has tarnished the image of the country's manufacturing industry for high-quality products and efficiency.
Suzuki, Mazda and Yamaha cleared vehicles for emissions or fuel efficiency even in cases where they were tested under invalid conditions, the ministry said in a statement. The errors related to slight deviations in the speed of the vehicles during testing that should have invalidated the test results.
The automakers examined tests they had conducted over different periods of time and in Suzuki's case they stretched back to 2012.
None of the automakers found significant problems with actual emissions and fuel economy performance of the vehicles, which were destined for sale in Japan, and do not plan any recalls.
Suzuki, Japan's fourth-largest automaker, said that of 12,819 sample vehicles tested for fuel economy and emissions since June 2012, around 50 percent of them had been inspected improperly.
""I deeply apologize and will lead efforts to prevent recurrence,"" Suzuki Chief Executive Toshihiro Suzuki told a news conference.
Mazda said there were irregularities in 4 percent of similar inspections on its cars, or just over 70 vehicles. In Yamaha's case, irregularities were found in 2 percent of inspections, or just a handful of vehicles.
Both Mazda and Yamaha apologized.
Suzuki and Yamaha shares fell 6 and 5 percent, respectively, and Mazda shares were down 1 percent, underperforming a steady benchmark Nikkei average.
In July this year, Nissan admitted it had improperly measured exhaust emissions and fuel economy for 19 vehicle models sold in Japan.
Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Toray Industries - all key suppliers of motor parts to global manufacturers - admitted to product data fabrication last year.

Many of the automakers, already hit by lackluster sales, have also been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imported vehicles.

The UR-V is produced and sold in China, the world's biggest auto market, by Honda's joint venture with the  Dongfeng Motor Group  (HK:0489). 
As many as 18,907 vehicle recalls are linked to problems caused by an unusual amount of uncombusted petrol collecting in the engine's lubricant oil pan, the Defective Product Administration Center of State Administration of Market Regulation said on Thursday. 
The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car's check-engine light came on, Honda has said.
The Japanese automaker says the problem does not affect the engine's performance and there have been no reports of accidents because of this particular issue. 
Honda recalled 96,900 SUV Avancier vehicles on Monday. The cold-climate engine issue also prompted the Tokyo-headquartered automaker to recall 130,000 of its popular CR-V SUV models and 294,500 Civic cars from China earlier this year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGN) reported higher than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, as its sales growth continued to outpace rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) in North America even as it stagnated in western Europe.
Shares in the company famous for its three-stripe brand jumped 10 percent to a four-month high, putting them on track for their best day since the group increased its financial guidance in March. There were up 8.2 percent at 0955 GMT.
The results are the latest endorsement of a strategy implemented by Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted since taking over in 2016, focused on improving profitability as well as expanding in North America and China and pushing sales via ecommerce.
Adidas has a strong pipeline of new products that will support sales this year and beyond, Rorsted told journalists, noting strong demand for its 1980s retro ""Continental"" leather sneakers that were relaunched in June. 
""Full-year guidance reconfirmed ... which should reassure investors ... particularly given Adidas will have good visibility on the important third-quarter wholesale order book,"" said Piral Dadhania, analyst at Royal Bank of Canada.
Sales rose 10 percent to 5.26 billion euros ($6 billion) after currency effects, beating the 8 percent expected by analysts, while attributable net profit of 396 million was also ahead of the average forecast for 386 million.
Some analysts had expected higher marketing spending in the quarter due to the soccer World Cup would dent the bottom line, but Adidas counteracted that with higher prices and sales through more profitable channels such as ecommerce.
Adidas saw sales growth in North America slow slightly to 16 percent, but that was still well ahead of the 3 percent growth Nike reported for its March to May fiscal fourth quarter, the firm's first increase in the region for a year. 
In greater China, Adidas sales growth accelerated to 27 percent, slightly ahead of Nike's 25 percent.
As Adidas had previously cautioned, sales were flat in western Europe, where Nike has been growing faster, but they jumped 14 percent in Russia, which hosted the World Cup.
Adidas has made management changes in western Europe after the company failed to focus enough on the launch of new products, Rorsted said, adding sales were likely to stay flat in the region in the second half of the year.
Nike teams dominated the final rounds of the World Cup, but Rorsted said the tournament was still a success as Adidas sold more than 8 million shirts and more than 10 million balls, and saw a boost to downloads of its app, advertised in stadiums.
Adidas said it was taking an impairment of 475 million euros related to the Reebok trademark in 2016 after the German Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel disagreed with how it calculated historical book value.
But it said the restatement had no impact on its cash position and reiterated its guidance for 2018 and beyond, adding Reebok's prospects were unchanged. Rorsted noted that sales in North America rose 6 percent despite many store closures.

Adidas bought the Reebok brand in 2005, but it has performed poorly since. Rorsted has given Reebok until 2020 to return to profitability and said it should be helped by a new partnership with British designer Victoria Beckham.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Stock investors rediscover defensives before trade war deadlines,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - The risk of trade barriers and slowing global business activity has kept the European equity market in check this year.
That, however, has been a boon for shares in companies such as drug-makers and consumer staples that are less dependent on the economic cycle and which investors say could provide a shelter should trade tensions between Washington and Beijing blow up.
After over a year of neglect, fund managers began in the second quarter to pour money back into firms such as yoghurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO), food giant Nestle (S:NESN), drugmakers  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and Roche (S:ROG), as well as tobacco giant BAT (L:BATS) and the maker of Durex condoms  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB). 
In some cases they have turned a blind eye to challenges facing some of these companies because their compelling valuations and resilience to any trade-related economic downturn was an incentive to re-engage.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates a full-blown trade war would wipe 0.8 percentage points off global GDP growth. 
""We are slightly more invested in defensive sectors also in relation to the risk of a trade war,"" said Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Prime Partners.
He said his firm had bought Danone shares a few months ago and had some drugmakers as strategic assets. He added that they had invested in these companies, betting on their growth potential and not purely because they are defensive. 
Europe's equity market is barely in the black in 2018 but while sectors such as autos, which are highly dependent on global trade, have been a drag, defensives have filled the gap. 
The move started when U.S. President Donald Trump said in March he would introduce import tariffs on steel and aluminum, stoking fears of a global trade war. It then continued at the start of the summer in the run-up to a series of key deadlines for the United States to decide on planned protectionist moves.
""Investors in European equity have become familiar with the theme of a return of leadership of defensive stocks,"" wrote Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts last week when he upgraded European personal & household sector to overweight.
A key date on investors' radars is Sept. 5 when a comment period on Trump's plan to tax $200 billion of Chinese imports expires, paving the way for a decision in the following weeks. Analysts also expect Washington to decide on possible auto import tariffs in October. 
These deadlines are fuelling expectations there will be no exception this year to August being a traditionally turbulent month for markets. ""The defensive bias should remain apparent through August into September,"" Potts said. 
Graphic on defensives vs cyclicals: https://reut.rs/2OjVwBQ
""HIGH-PROFILE POKER GAME""
Defensives have been a very popular trade during the long years of easy monetary policy in Europe that squeezed rates to zero, boosting their appeal as cash flow machines paying steady dividends to their shareholders.
But when in the second half of 2016 an economic recovery in Europe gathered pace, defensives started to lose ground to stocks more tied to the business cycle. Their decline continued throughout the ""euroboom"" year of 2017 but the tide appeared to turn once again when Trump kicked off the trade war.
Much of how the revival will pan out will depend on whether the United States and China will be able to find an agreement or there is a trade war escalation.
""Is Trump just playing this very clever high-profile poker game with the Chinese. Will he back down and reach some sort of compromise?"" said David Hussey, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. He said stocks like Reckitt - which he described as a ""textbook example"" of the fortunes of income paying companies - or tobacco firms were ""interesting"" investments earlier this year because of cheap valuations. 
""They've (tobacco firms) been awful performers for a variety of reasons. But when you get to valuations which ... assume the business disappears in 10 to 12 years, that's just not realistic,"" he said.
The defensive stocks' rally this year has filled a valuation gap versus cyclicals and fund managers such as Hussey and Schupp but also Federico Trabucco at Kairos Parnters in Milan say they are ready to tweak their holdings in turbulent markets.
Some strategists recommend that clients keep some extra cash ready. While defensives have legs to gain further in a less valuation-oriented move, a big rebound in cyclicals cannot be ruled out, depending on the trade talks' outcome.
Beyond the tariff noise, however, the global economy continues to tick along well and corporate earnings growth is stellar in the United States and strong in Europe.

""I've lifted my exposure to defensives as a tactical move. But if the trade clouds clear in September/October, you must be ready to turn around your portfolio,"" said Trabucco.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Russian market selloff deepens on U.S. sanctions move,"By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A new sanctions move by Washington against Moscow sent Russian markets sharply lower on Thursday, adding impetus to an existing selloff as the rouble hit a two-year low and shares and bonds also tumbled.
The Trump administration said overnight that fresh sanctions were needed after it determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. Russia's embassy in the U.S. called the measures draconian.
The rouble dropped to its weakest level since August 2016, at 66.73, before paring losses to trade at 65.80 by 0915 GMT .
""There is local panic on the currency market,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note. ""At times, the number of those who want to ditch the rouble is becoming so high so there is not enough liquidity.""
The Russian currency is on track for its deepest weekly fall since early April when it lost 6.7 percent, after Washington imposed sanctions on Russian companies to punish Moscow for ""malign activities."" 
Thursday's drop followed a massive sell-off on the Russian market the day before, after the Kommersant daily published what it said was the full text of a draft U.S. law detailing a separate of series of possible penalties against Russia.
Analysts warn of dire consequences for the rouble if the measures pass through Congress.
""If the bill becomes law and Russia retaliates, we estimate that USD/RUB could move to 72.00, while EUR/RUB could hit 83.50, as any major selloff of Russian local debt, local credit and stocks would amplify outflows from the rouble,"" Danske Bank said in a note.
BROAD-BASED SELLOFF
With the threat of sanctions multiplying, concern is also growing about the lack of a reaction to the selloff from Russian financial authorities, analysts at Rosbank said in a note.
The central bank did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on the rouble's drop and its possible consequences.
As the selloff deepened, government bond yields hit their highest since January 2017, and five-year Russian credit default swaps (CDS) - which reflect the cost of insuring its debt against default - rose to their highest since June 19 of 154, up from 133-134 earlier this week .
Benchmark stock indexes were also down. The dollar-denominated RTS (IRTS) shed 2.0 percent to 1,092.1 points after sliding to 1,073.15, its lowest since April 11. The rouble-based MOEX (IMOEX) was 0.3 percent lower at 2,286.3 points.

Russia's largest airline Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) fell 12.25 percent to 98.15 roubles, its lowest since August 2016, after Washington said it was considering suspending the carrier's flights to the United States.

Shanghai blue chips climbed 2.7 percent amid talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, just the latest in a series of growth boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens.
Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending also underpinned industrial resources including iron ore and copper.
The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reverse early losses to nudge up 0.5 percent.
The relief had yet to spread to Europe with financial spreadbetters tipping London's FTSE to open 8 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX 4 points down and Paris' CAC flat.
Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, weighed in part by a shock slump in core machinery orders.
Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles.
Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free trade agreement at talks in Washington later in the session.
Early on Thursday, China's state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so.
China had already announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude.
The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. [O/R]
Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging up 12 cents to $67.08 per barrel, while Brent bounced 24 cents to $72.52.
MORE SANCTIONS 
In currency markets, the Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain.
There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that would impose widespread sanctions on Russia for election meddling.
The rouble duly slid to its lowest since late 2016, with the dollar buying 65.74 rubles having jumped 3.3 percent overnight.
The pound skidded to its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears grew Britain might leave the EU without a deal on trade with Brussels.
Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a 'no-deal' Brexit, an event which could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain's biggest export market.
Sterling was last trading at $1.2881, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight.
The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a traditional safe-haven, with the dollar easing to 110.95 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday.
The euro was relatively steady at $1.1610, while the dollar index was a shade firmer at 95.124.
The New Zealand dollar dropped 1.1 percent to a two-year trough at $0.6665 after the country's central bank pledged to keep rates at record lows well into 2020. 
""The risk of rate moves over the next 12 months is weighted more toward cuts than hikes, and financial markets will price the risk accordingly,"" said Kiwibank chief economist, Jarrod Kerr.

""The good news here is interest rates and exchange rates will remain lower for much longer, assisting growth.""

950,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>","China's state firms cementing lucrative role in South China Sea, new research shows","By Greg Torode and Brenda Goh
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Beijing's giant state-owned enterprises are playing an increasing role in China's build-up in the South China Sea and could seek to cement their dominant position in coming years, according to new research.
The work by academic Xue Gong and published by Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute this week sheds light on a little-examined element of rising tensions across the vital trade route, showing extensive work by Chinese SOEs in developing infrastructure and tourism, as well as oil and gas, some in hotly disputed areas.
Some experts and regional diplomats believe the strong commercial presence could further complicate any future regional solution should Beijing, which research shows has encouraged firms to operate, protect them politically and militarily.
China's state-owned enterprises operated in a complex and often opaque environment, serving national strategic interests as they sought new opportunities, Gong told Reuters.
""They cannot operate independently but they are ultimately opportunists and when the policy environment is favorable, then they will go for it. And we have seen signs of that behavior in the South China Sea,"" said Gong, who is based at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
""If the Chinese government can maintain an upper hand and leverage while achieving stability, there might well be greater opportunities."" 
China' Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While the research notes the difficulty in obtaining financial information, it suggests turning China's seven reefs and cays in the Spratlys archipelago into man-made islands was a multi-billion dollar effort.
It cites state media estimates that building up Fiery Cross island alone, now home to a 3km runway and military facilities including missile and radar installations, cost around $11 billion.
The on-going build up of the seven islands deep in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia has alarmed the United States and other regional powers.
China's so-called nine-dash line claim covers much of the South China Sea, overlapping claims of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
DIGGING IN
Gong's research shows how China Communications Construction Corporation (CCCC) and its subsidiaries seized on policies advocated by President Xi Jinping in 2012 to expand its maritime capabilities via the South China Sea, in part by developing some of the world's largest dredgers.
CCCC planned to list its dredging operation in 2015, but its application later lapsed, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
CCCC has formed new units centered on the Paracels, which China disputes with Vietnam, that are eyeing expansion in tourism, logistics, fishing as well as on-going construction business, according to the paper.
(Graphic on South China Sea construction: https://tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne)
It has earmarked $15 billion for investment across various sectors - a plan that ""stems from the fact that it has quietly benefited from land reclamation in the South China Sea through implementing national tasks"", the research states.
CCCC also collaborated with other state firms, including China Travel Service Group (CTSG), to develop a nascent cruise ship and tourism industry in the Paracels after state leaders in 2012 overcame earlier reluctance to back such moves. 
CCCC, which has units listed in Hong Kong (HK:1800) and Shanghai (SS:601800), did not respond to requests for comment. China National Travel Service, which oversees CTSG after a series of mergers, did not respond to requests for comment. 
More than 70,000 tourists have traveled on four cruise ships that ply the South China Sea since the Paracels route was opened in April 2013, the Hainan Maritime Safety Administration said in January. 
Some 680 commercial flights landed on the expanded runway at Woody Island, where Sansha City is now the administrative hub of China's South China Sea operations, in the year ended December 2017.
ENERGY PUSH 
The Singapore research also details how China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) lobbied for funding and greater Chinese involvement in the South China a decade ago after facing criticism from scholars concerned at activities by rival claimants.
CNOOC later earmarked $32 billion for exploration, and built a giant deep water drilling rig which was placed off central Vietnam in 2014, sparking tensions with Hanoi.
According to its first quarter filings of listed unit CNOOC Ltd which is in charge of all the group's exploration and production business, the South China Sea's share of the company's total oil and gas output rose to 45 percent - up from 43 percent last year. That was second only to its Bohai operations off north China.
CNOOC's latest annual report listed eight new discoveries in the South China Sea, out of a total of 19 struck offshore China in 2017. 
Some players like CNOOC ""appear more skilful and effective in mobilizing resources to influence state policy, while some actors, such as enterprises in the tourism industry, respond only when the state provides incentives,"" Gong noted.
In a statement to Reuters, CNOOC Ltd (HK:0883) said it had a deep water development strategy for the South China Sea and planned to extend investment on future exploration and development. 
""All oil and gas companies among the globe are welcomed to jointly invest and operate in offshore China and to achieve success together with the company,"" CNOOC Ltd said.
A host of other state firms are reportedly eyeing slices of the South China Sea action, from nascent nuclear energy programs, telecommunications, fisheries and banking.
Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at ISEAS, said the work showed ""Beijing is incentivizing companies to become major players in the South China Sea.""
""This is something that China can do that the other claimants cannot do, particularly on this scale,"" he said.

""The dispute is absolutely no closer to resolution, either a legal or a political resolution, and the role of China's state owned enterprises only highlights that.""

Europe's largest telecoms operator said it now expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to reach 23.4 billion euros ($27.17 billion) in 2018, up from 23.3 billion previously, at constant exchange rates.
""We remain firmly on track,"" Chief Financial Officer Thomas Dannenfeldt said of the results. ""The trends in Germany and the United States are positive. At our European subsidies, we are again posting sustained growth.""
U.S. unit T-Mobile , which is seeking regulatory approval to take over rival Sprint, has already reported strong customer growth in its second-quarter results.
Its contribution was dented, however, by the U.S. dollar's 10 percent decline against the euro over the last 12 months.
Deutsche Telekom's revenues declined by 2.8 percent, year on year, to 18.37 billion euros, shy of expectations in the company's own poll of analysts. Adjusted EBITDA was also just down, by 0.3 percent, albeit beating market expectations.
On an organic basis, stripping out the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.3 percent and 3.9 percent respectively.
Adjusted net profit, the key metric for setting dividends in Deutsche Telekom's recently adopted mid-term strategy, rose 3.3 percent to 1.238 billion euros.
That stripped out the impact of a 600 million euro settlement over an ill-fated road toll project, against which Telekom took a charge in the quarter.

955,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Musk Mystery Enters Day 3 as Pressure to Show the Money Mounts,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street and Washington have the same question for Elon Musk: Where’s the money?
Two days after he vowed on Twitter that he had “funding secured” for a spectacular $82 billion deal to take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. private, he has offered no evidence to back up the statement. No one has stepped forward publicly -- or privately -- to say they’re behind the plan. People with or close to 15 financial institutions and technology firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they weren’t aware of financing having been locked in before Musk’s tweet.
All of which could be problematic as the Securities and Exchange Commission starts investigating the matter. Regulators have asked the company if what Musk tweeted was factual and why such a disclosure was made via social media rather than in a filing, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Judith Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tesla also declined to comment.
“When Musk tweeted this, was he saying this was something that was definitely going to happen? Something that might happen?” said Ira Matetsky, a partner at Ganfer & Shore in New York, outlining questions the SEC might ask. “How would a reasonable investor interpret that and was it consistent with the facts as they existed at the time?”
‘I Wish’
Tesla closed down 2.4 percent to $370.34 Wednesday in New York -- well below the $420 at which Musk said shareholders would be bought out.
The chief executive officer raised the go-private possibility with the board last week, according to a statement from six of Tesla’s nine directors. They said he had “addressed the funding for this to occur,” without providing details.
As for Tesla shareholders, Musk said in one of his Twitter posts that “investor support is confirmed” for his plan. The largest shareholders declined to comment. At the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which as of March owned about 213,000 shares, spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto said there was no advance warning.
“We have not been contacted by Tesla IR,” she said. “They didn’t reach out before the tweet either.”
Leaving the public marketplace isn’t a new vision for Musk, who told Rolling Stone in an interview published in November, “I wish we could be private with Tesla. It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.”
In April 2017, when Musk held talks with Masayoshi Son about SoftBank Group Corp. investing in the electric carmaker, they touched on the possibility of fulfilling Musk’s wish, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership and have not started up again.
Musk’s personal stake in Tesla is almost 20 percent, meaning he would need roughly $70 billion to take it out of the market. That kind of money may be accessible through sovereign wealth funds or other strategic investors, said Dwight Scott, president of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP’s GSO Capital Partners. The money-losing and cash-burning company is an unlikely candidate for debt investors to be willing to help go private.
It’s possible Musk could persuade some large institutional and strategic investors to either newly become or remain shareholders in the private company, which could reduce his funding needs, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein who has long been bearish on Tesla shares.
But “if no firmer details emerge,” he wrote in a note to clients, “investors would likely increasingly debate Musk’s credibility and seemingly unhealthy focus on the shares’ price and volatility.”
It’s also possible Musk has some unconventional plan that would take Tesla private without using traditional sources. On Twitter, he alluded to the creation of a “special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla,” though he didn’t elaborate on how it would work.
“What investors are waiting for is more details around what is meant when Elon Musk says funding is secured,” George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI who rates Tesla the equivalent of a hold, said on Bloomberg Television. “They are raising a lot of sensible questions around who would be providing the funding and how exactly this might work.”

957,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Musk's Tesla buyout plan could test Wall Street's nerves,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A leveraged buyout of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be an ominous sign of market exuberance, but investors may need more justification to run for the exits.
CEO Elon Musk's suggestion on Tuesday that he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share, putting a value of $72 billion on the carmaker, had some investors wondering whether getting such a huge deal completed would signal that Wall Street has become overheated after nearly a decade of gains following the 2008 financial crisis.
""A mega-LBO of a company notorious for its cash burn rate would be the clear sign that this is the ultimate market top,"" Mike O’Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading, wrote in a client note. ""This is the type of behavior often witnessed at market extremes.""
Still, others took the opposite view, seeing Tesla as an exception to the rule. The company draws both love and hate on Wall Street, being simultaneously favored by institutional investors like Fidelity and also the most heavily shorted major stock on the market.
""I don't think that the Tesla news tells us much of anything about the broader market,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""Instead, it is just a reflection of Elon Musk's personality and how much he hates being accountable to shareholders and short-term measures of success.""
Indeed, a deal is far from done and may never materialize. Pointing to the rate at which Tesla is burning through cash, growing competition from other electric carmakers, and its difficulty hitting production targets, analysts and investors were skeptical that lenders would be willing to finance what would likely be the largest leveraged buyout in U.S. history.
In addition, leveraged buyouts usually depend on growing earnings to determine how much debt can be serviced to complete the buyout, but Tesla has never yet produced an annual profit, so dealmakers said any buyout transaction for Tesla could probably not involve placing much more debt on the company.
Tesla lost nearly $2 billion last year as it struggled to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, and while Musk said last week that the company would become consistently profitable starting in the September quarter, he has failed to reach many targets in the past.
VALUE EXPLOSION
Compared with its peers, Tesla's valuation has had a runaway ride. At $63 billion, Tesla's stock market value is already larger than General Motors (NYSE:GM), at $53 billion.
Reflecting shareholders' expectations that Tesla will grow its production exponentially, its market capitalization is equivalent to about $626,000 for every car it sold last year, compared to GM's valuation of about $5,500 per car it sold.
If Musk's deal were to be done, it would be larger than the $44 billion buyout of TXU Corp in 2007, which was the largest ever, and would even top it in inflation-adjusted terms of $55 billion.
Musk's $420 per share deal would also top the 1988 $30 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, now seen by many as the high-water mark of excess on Wall Street during that decade. Inflation adjusted, it would be $63 billion.
His per share price would represent a 23 percent premium over the previous day's close, although that is not that rich compared with some recent deal premiums.
A Tesla buyout at current valuations may be an ominous signal that investors are finding it difficult to find earnings growth after nearly a decade of economic recovery. Merger and acquisition activity on a quarterly basis hit multi-year peaks in 2000 and in 2007, just before significant stock market declines.
Global leveraged buyouts reached $154 billion in the first seven months of 2018, up 15 percent from the same period last year but still below the $464 billion in the first seven months of 2007, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.
""If you look at past market cycles and you look at crescendos in M&A activity or LBO activity or IPO activity ... those things tended to crest within 12 months of a market top,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.
""Whether this is that point in time, we won't know until we get past it but it's definitely a consideration in terms of the market psychology.”

958,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",U.S. airlines say further amending websites to change Taiwan references,"CHICAGO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The United States' three largest airlines said they are in the process of amending their systems to address Chinese requests over how they refer to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, after Chinese state media reported that they had yet to complete revisions in time for a Thursday deadline. 
The Global Times newspaper on Thursday singled out Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (N:UAL), American Airlines (O:AAL) and Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA) in a report which said that the companies had yet to meet requirements set by China's aviation regulator. 
China has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, do not refer to self-ruled Taiwan as a non-Chinese territory on their websites, a demand the White House slammed in May as ""Orwellian nonsense.""
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which has been pushing airlines to make the change, had originally set a deadline for July 25. However, it said last month that the four U.S. airlines had asked for another extension as it perceived their amendments as ""incomplete"".
It was unclear what the exact deadline was in view of the time difference between the United States and China or what additional amendments the U.S. carriers were making. 
Checks on Thursday showed Delta, United and American Airlines now list only Taipei's airport code and city, but not the name Taiwan, while there is no mention of Taipei or Taiwan on Hawaiian Airlines' website. 
""United Airlines has begun to roll out changes to its systems to address China's requirements,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.
""United abides by and respects local laws and regulations in all markets and jurisdictions where we operate and conduct business. United flights to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to operate normally.""
Delta said that it, and other U.S. carriers, were ""in the process of implementing website changes"" in response to the CAAC's request. It added that it remained in close consultation with the U.S. government throughout the process. 
Shannon Gilson, a spokeswoman for American Airlines said: ""Like other carriers, American is implementing changes to address China's request.""
Hawaiian Airlines, Airlines for America, a trade group which represents major U.S. carriers, and the CAAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Global Times reported the CAAC as saying that it was closely monitoring the situation. 
It is unclear how China might punish airlines that did not comply with its requests, but in December it added a clause to rules governing foreign airlines in the country, saying regulators could change a company's permit if it did not meet ""the demand of public interest"".

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the democratic island a wayward province of ""one China"". Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously.

""Fundamentally, this new generation of CEOs has a remit for change,"" said EY's lead analyst for consumer products and retail, Andrew Cosgrove. ""Boards are realizing that we need new thinking."" 
That means introducing new skills into the C-Suite.
""I'm hearing people saying for the very first time things like 'We're going to recruit a head of marketing with a background in analytics',"" said Oliver Wright, global lead for consumer goods and services at Accenture Strategy.
Last year Mark Schneider became the first outsider in nearly a century to take the reins at Nestle, the world's largest food company. The 52-year-old healthcare veteran, nearly a decade younger than his predecessor, has stepped up acquisitions and divestitures and restructured parts of the business as he contends with activist shareholder Third Point.
Sean Connolly, 53, took over the helm at Conagra Brands (N:CAG) in 2015 and has already moved the group's headquarters, announced sweeping cost cuts, launched new products aimed at millennials and agreed to buy rival Pinnacle Foods (N:PF). 
By top management standards, early-50s is still relatively young, given that the average age of CEOs in the S&P 500 was 57.4 last year, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart.
FRESH PERSPECTIVE 
Just over half of the 39 consumer packaged goods companies in the Fortune 500 have changed their CEO in the last two and a half years, according to executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates. 
That represents 15 percent of all CEO changes in that group of companies in that period, even though the sector only makes up 8 percent of the Fortune 500. 
Analysts are speculating whether the latest new appointment Laguarta, a 54-year-old Spaniard who speaks four languages, will be more open to strategic options like separating PepsiCo's U.S. bottling business or breaking up the company. 
Laguarta is a PepsiCo veteran with 22 years at the company, but others have looked elsewhere for new leaders. 
About half of the new CEOs hired in the sector hired in the past five years have been internal candidates, down from roughly three quarters over the past 20 years, said David Cooper, head of Bain's consumer packaged goods practice.
The growing acceptance of input from outside the industry comes as the consumer goods sector has been aggressively targeted by private equity firms and activist investors looking to shake things up. 
Private equity firm 3G, known for engineering mergers and slashing costs, shocked the industry in 2015 when it combined Kraft Foods (NASDAQ:KHC) with its H.J. Heinz, keeping partner Bernardo Hees in charge. Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management recently won a board seat after a proxy fight with Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG). 
""A lot of companies have been spinning and reacting, trying to figure out how they can essentially '3G' themselves to preempt being taken over, being the next victim,"" said Andrew Hayes, a Russell Reynolds consultant who has helped several major consumer companies find top managers.
More CEO turnover is expected as the last generation of leaders run out of room to grow using the established playbook of consolidation and focusing on emerging markets.

""Indra Nooyi's done a great job, she wants to go out close to on-top,"" said Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj of PepsiCo's departing leader. ""I think you'll see that from many other CEOs as well.""

BATAVIA, Ill. (Reuters) - German-owned discount supermarket Aldi Inc is rolling out scores of new products in the United States, it said on Thursday, in an aggressive push to expand in the country even as rivals are struggling in a drawn-out price war.
Aldi, the world's No. 5 retailer owned by Aldi Sud, embarked on a $5 billion plan last year to remodel and expand its U.S. chain to 2,500 by the end of 2022 from 1,600 in June 2017. Its small store model keeps prices down and has upended Britain's grocery market.
A fifth of all products in Aldi stores will be new by early 2019, the company said, adding that it had targeted popular categories including easy-to-prepare food and fresh, organic produce and meat. Aldi said it was halfway through remodeling some of its stores to include more refrigeration space.
Traditional grocers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) have been slashing prices to win back shoppers lost to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other e-retailers. Surging commodities and transportation costs are also forcing companies that supply retailers with packaged goods to raise prices.
Aldi, whose products are 90 percent private-label, is far less exposed to these rising costs.
""At a time when the rest of the industry is really struggling, Aldi is thriving and investing,"" Aldi Chief Executive Jason Hart said in an interview. Regular supermarkets offer too many products, while Aldi's four- to five-aisle stores help to keep down costs and prices, he added.
Seeking to drive e-commerce sales, Aldi began working with Instacart Inc last year to deliver groceries in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles.
Rival German discount grocery chain Lidl, which opened its first U.S. stores last summer, also aims to grow in the United States, pricing products at up to 50 percent cheaper than competitors.

Aldi is also expanding in Britain, where store openings by traditional market leaders  Tesco  Plc (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) have slowed to a trickle. The company aims to have 1,000 UK stores by 2022, up from 762, a top Aldi executive told Reuters in March.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",Apple says it is monitoring Infowars app for content violations,"By Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday that an app belonging to popular conspiracy theorist Alex Jones remains in the company's mobile App Store because it has not been found to be in violation of any content policies.
The Infowars Official app has become the App Store's third most-downloaded news app this week after Apple removed access on Sunday to some of Jones' podcasts from its digital store. Apple had said the podcasts violated the company's rules against hate speech.
The company had not explained why the app remained available until issuing a statement on Wednesday.
""We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,"" Apple told Reuters in a statement.
Jones' podcasts differed from the Infowars app in a key way. The podcast app allowed access to an extensive list of previous episodes, subjecting all of those past episodes to Apple's content rules. 
The Infowars app contains only rebroadcasts of the current day's episodes, subjecting a much smaller set of content to the rules. Apple said it regularly monitors all apps for content violations.
""We continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines and if we find content that violates our guidelines and is harmful to users we will remove those apps from the store as we have done previously,"" Apple said.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Spotify Technology SA also removed some content this week that had been produced by Jones. Google has not said why the Infowars app, which offers live streams and articles, was not removed in its app store as part of the actions.
Twitter has drawn public outcry for not removing Jones' account. The company is responding by expediting a review of its content policies, according to an internal email that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey shared on Twitter on Wednesday. 

The message noted that Twitter would have taken action against Jones had he posted the same content on its service as he had on Facebook and YouTube.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 11:45PM ET</span>","China's Dada-JD Daojia raises $500 million from Walmart, JD.com","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dada-JD Daojia, a Chinese online grocery and delivery firm, said on Thursday it has raised $500 million from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and JD.com Inc in its latest round of financing. 
The company comprises of two businesses and is partly owned by JD.com. Dada operates a network of 5 million delivery men, while JD Daojia partners with retail stores and provides one-hour delivery services of groceries and other items. 
Walmart said it invested about $320 million in the latest fundraising. The Arkansas-based company's partnership with Dada-JD Daojia dates back to 2016 when it invested $50 million, the company said, adding that at present, 200 Walmart stores in 30 major Chinese cities have a presence in JD Daojia.
""We are confident that this deeper collaboration with Dada-JD Daojia will enhance our omni-channel footprint and deliver a better O2O (online to offline) customer experience,"" said Wern-Yuen Tan, president and CEO for Walmart China.
The global retail giant has been pushing to integrate its retail network in China with the country's burgeoning ""smart retail"" movement, as retailers and tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd cut deals to combine shoppers' online and offline experience.
Earlier this year, Walmart said it opened its first small-sized high-tech supermarket in the southern city of Shenzhen, which will stock products that customers will also be able to buy on the U.S. retailer's store on JD Daojia. The stores are competing with Alibaba's Hema to provide fast delivery of grocery to customers.
Alibaba is China's top e-commerce player, while Tencent is strong in social media and gaming and has, along with Walmart, a considerable stake in number two online retailer JD.com.

Alibaba and Tencent have between them splashed over $10 billion on retail-focused deals, boosting their reach offline and meaning few brick-and-mortar sellers are left without an allegiance to one or the other.

963,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street's Biggest Bull Sees S&P 500 Rising 12% by Year's End,"(Bloomberg) -- As U.S. equities flirt with a fresh all-time high, the most optimistic strategist on Wall Street is doubling down on his view that the S&P 500 Index will soar 12 percent in less than five months.
By the end of this year, the index will reach 3,200 points as the economy and earnings drive the next leg of the bull market, according to Canaccord Genuity LLC’s Tony Dwyer. Reset global expectations and a demographic tailwind will also fuel a second-half ramp-up, the strategist said, after the gauge climbed to within a percentage point of surpassing its January peak.
“Any pause in the upside should be considered opportunity,” Dwyer wrote in a note to clients this week. “There is no doubt the unpredictable news backdrop of a potential trade war with China and a rise back to 3 percent in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield can cause increased volatility, but the fundamental backdrop commands using it as an opportunity to add risk.”
The U.S. benchmark surged to a record 2,872.87 in January before a spike in volatility and a jump in interest rates sent stocks spiraling into a 10 percent correction by early February. Since then, the index has steadily recovered and closed at 2,857.70 on Wednesday.
Key to Dwyer’s bullish thesis are factors already paramount to the bull market: ever expanding profits and rising confidence among consumers and businesses. U.S. investors are scaling the wall of worry that’s clouded by unpredictable developments in the trade war, cheered by the Federal Reserve’s belief that the economy can withstand higher rates.
Dwyer’s target for the benchmark U.S. stock gauge is the highest among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Canaccord strategist sees the rally continuing into next year, with an end-2019 target of 3,360, a further gain of 5 percent on 2018’s estimate.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rebounded and traded 1.7% and 2.8% higher by 11:05PM ET (03:05 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 0.9%.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced a 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods including passenger cars and motorcycles on Wednesday. Beijing’s announcement came after the Trump administration confirmed a list of $16 billion worth of Chinese goods that would be hit with tariffs in the previously day. China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the U.S.’s decision is “very unreasonable,” and that China has no choice but to retaliate.
Separately, the China Passenger Car Association said on Wednesday that vehicle sales in China slipped for a second consecutive month. Retail sales of cars, SUVs and multipurpose vehicles fell 5.4% to 1.6 million units in July, compared with a 3.7% drop in June and trimmed the year-to-date growth in the world’s biggest automobile market to 2%.
A slowing economy and a tit-for-tat trade war with the U.S. were cited as headwind for the car sales in China.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% after data showed the country’s core machinery orders fell 8.8% in June, the fastest pace in six months, compared to the median estimate for a 1.3% decline.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.7% in morning trade, although the energy subindex underperformed amid drop in oil prices. Santos Ltd (AX:STO) fell 0.5% and Woodside Petroleum Ltd (AX:WPL) lost 0.2%.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:18PM ET</span>",Rite Aid and Albertsons terminate merger amid opposition to deal,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Drug store chain  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) and U.S. grocer Albertsons Companies Inc (N:ABS) agreed to terminate their merger agreement, the companies said on Wednesday, a little over 10 days after a shareholder advisory firm opposed the deal.
Last month, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) had said that Rite Aid investors should vote down its $24 billion merger with Albertsons saying the agreement was not going to give the drug store chain's shareholders a ""fair ownership interest"" in the combined company.
The ISS report was seen as a blow to Albertsons and its majority owner, private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, who were hoping that the deal will help them win a new business amid pressure from retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
Also opposed to the deal is Highfields Capital Management, which is Rite Aid's fourth-largest shareholder, owning 4.4 percent of Rite Aid's outstanding shares as of the most recent filings with regulators. 
Albertsons said it disagreed with the view that the U.S. grocer was not offering sufficient merger consideration to the shareholders of Rite Aid, who were to get 30 percent of the combined company under the terms of the agreement.
Rite Aid Chief Executive John Standley said the company heard the views of its shareholders and would operate as a standalone firm. Albertsons said it was unwilling to change the terms of the agreement.
The U.S. grocer had hoped that the deal, which was seen as part of a wave of consolidation in the drug retailing sector, would help Albertsons become a formidable competitor to CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA), while also giving its private equity owners a way to cash out on their decade-long investment in the company. 
Cerberus first took a stake in Albertsons in 2006 and the retailer became the dominate grocery franchise on the West Coast when Cerberus bought Safeway in 2014.
Under the settlement agreement, neither of the companies would be responsible for any payments as a result of the termination, Rite Aid said in a statement on Wednesday.
The drug store chain also said it was evaluating governance changes at the company. 
Albertsons reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance on Wednesday, including an expectation for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.7 billion.

Rite Aid's shares have fallen by about 21 percent since the deal was first announced in late February.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:12PM ET</span>",Video of Redstone patriarch to be reviewed in CBS legal battle,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A video of 95-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch of the family that owns the voting majority of CBS Corp (N:CBS), can be reviewed in the U.S. broadcast and media company's legal battle against the family, a Delaware judge ruled on Wednesday.
Redstone, however, will not be required to give testimony, the judge decided.
National Amusements Inc, the Redstone family's holding company, and CBS are in the midst of a high-stakes legal dispute over control of the company and its potential merger with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also majority-owned by NAI. Shari Redstone, the daughter of Sumner, has pushed to combine Viacom with CBS.
The health and mental faculties of Sumner Redstone, the founder and chairman emeritus of Viacom, and the majority owner of NAI, are a flashpoint for dispute in the battle for control. 
""We are very pleased with the court's ruling today, which will now allow us to conduct appropriate discovery from National Amusements on the issue of who controls NAI,"" CBS said in a statement, adding that the video of Redstone would be kept confidential. 
National Amusements declined to comment.  
CBS had pushed to have the tape, which could end up as evidence in the trial, included for review, while NAI has previously said that the recording broke California law because Redstone did not know he was being filmed.
The contents of the video have not been made public. A source with knowledge of the situation said the video was taken by a CBS board member, is several minutes long and shows Sumner Redstone's physical and mental state.
National Amusements must produce certain documents requested by CBS, according to court filings. 
CBS said it will also be able to secure National Amusements' documents relating to the 2016 ousting of five Viacom directors, including then-CEO Philippe Dauman.

The CBS board had approved a dividend earlier this year that would dilute the Redstone family's majority voting rights in the company, in an attempt to prevent the merger with Viacom.

967,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Tesla Board Weighs Musk's Go-Private Gambit Doubted by the Market,"(Bloomberg) -- For the moment, Elon Musk is struggling to overcome his doubters.
One day after stunning Wall Street by tweeting that he might take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. private, six of the company’s directors confirmed that he indeed had raised the possibility with the board.
But the announcement did little to quiet the growing skepticism surrounding Musk’s proposal. Nor did news that emerged hours later that Musk had held preliminary, but unsuccessful, talks with SoftBank Group Corp. last year to potentially carry out the go-private plan. Tesla shares sank as much as 3.3 percent early Wednesday, cutting into the gains posted the day before.
Many questions remain unanswered, including the big one: how would Tesla come up with the money to pull off a deal valuing the unprofitable company at more than $80 billion?
“How could Tesla possibly fund such a large transaction?” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein who’s long been bearish on Tesla shares. “If no firmer details emerge,” he wrote in a note to clients, “investors would likely increasingly debate Musk’s credibility and seemingly unhealthy focus on the shares’ price and volatility.”
Tesla shares closed down 2.4 percent to $370.34 Wednesday in New York. That’s well below the $420 price at which Musk said shareholders would be bought out.
“Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private,” six directors on Tesla’s nine-member board said in a statement. “The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this.”
The board lent credence to the idea that Musk’s tweets Tuesday were more than spur-of-the-moment whims from a notoriously impulsive billionaire. The chief executive officer has talked about it before; in a Rolling Stone interview published in November, he said “I wish we could be private with Tesla. It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.”
And in April 2017, when he held talks with Masayoshi Son about SoftBank investing in Tesla, the two also touched on the possibility of fulfilling Musk’s wish, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership.
Skepticism abounds that Musk has secured the means to take the electric-car maker private. He suggested he did in an initial post, but Tesla hasn’t disclosed any sources of financing, and no one has stepped forward publicly to say they’re backing the plan.
The board said only that Musk had “addressed the funding for this to occur.” No bank or investment fund contacted by Bloomberg News thus far has indicated it was aware of Musk’s plan to finance a Tesla buyout.
For more on Tesla, check out the Decrypted podcast:
Names excluded from the board statement were Musk; his brother, Kimbal Musk; and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist and early Tesla backer who’s been on leave since November.
LBO Unlikely
Musk owns an almost 20 percent stake in Tesla, meaning he’d still need roughly $70 billion in financing to take Tesla private. That kind of money may be accessible through sovereign wealth funds or other strategic investors, said Dwight Scott, president of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP’s GSO Capital Partners. Musk’s money-losing and cash-burning company is an unlikely candidate for debt investors to be willing to help go private.
“It’s very hard to put leverage on this company,” due to its negative cash flow and “operational issues,” Scott said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.
It’s possible Musk could persuade some large institutional and strategic investors to either newly become or remain shareholders in the private company, which could reduce his funding needs, Sacconaghi said.
“What investors are waiting for is more details around what is meant when Elon Musk says funding is secured,” George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI who rates Tesla the equivalent of a hold, said on Bloomberg Television. “They are raising a lot of sensible questions around who would be providing the funding and how exactly this might work.”

968,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Chinese Investors Turn Against Hong Kong Stocks Amid Market Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors have gone off Hong Kong stocks again.
After turning net buyers in July, mainland traders have been selling the city’s stocks this month, returning to an April-June trend, when they dumped HK$24 billion ($3 billion) shares over a record three consecutive months. The reversal came as the Hong Kong benchmark declined every day last week, but investors continued to pull out Monday through Wednesday, when the Hang Seng Index rose 2.5 percent.
“Southbound flow to Hong Kong has been positive since 2016, but the tide started to turn in April,” said Tang Jianzhuo, a Shenzhen-based portfolio manager at E Fund Management Co. “Some mainland capital was forced to pull out due to deleveraging pressure on the mainland, while some chose to sell due to trade concerns and weaker expectations for the economy.”
Net sales last week amounted to about HK$7.5 billion, the third biggest weekly total on record, according to Bloomberg calculations based on daily trading data. Another HK$4.5 billion were sold this week. It’s a far cry from January, when the Hang Seng Index soared to a record high and investors piled in via trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Mainland investors have spent about HK$86 billion buying Hong Kong stocks this year, averaging out at about HK$601 million in net purchases a day. That’s down about 60 percent from 2017.
The waning inflows have exacerbated the Hang Seng Index’s declines this year, Tang said. Stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland have fallen hard this year amid deteriorating trade relations with the U.S., a weaker yuan and signs of slower economy in China, where a deleveraging campaign has hampered growth.
“We think the southbound outflow is also related to profit-taking by mainland investors,” Tang said. “After two years of good performance in Hong Kong, many southbound funds have earned sizable profits.”
Top Sells
Mainland investors have lowered their stakes in 15 out of 50 Hang Seng Index members this year. Tencent Holdings, Ping An Insurance Group and AAC Technologies Holdings are among those experiencing the biggest outflows, according to Bloomberg calculations based on shareholding data from the Hong Kong stock exchange.
“Large caps with good liquidity could bear the brunt of selloffs if investors want to exit,” said Cheng Lv, Shanghai-based analyst at Huatai Securities Co. Heavyweights like banks and technology firms could take a blow when mainland investors cash out, she said.
While Chinese investors’ holdings in Hang Seng Index members is near a seven-month low, their exposure to Hang Seng Composite Small Cap Index members remains close to the highest in at least a year, according to Bloomberg data. China Education Group and Gemdale Properties & Investment Corp. are among the most popular stocks in terms of inflows this year.
Onshore investors are keeping a close watch on two areas to decide whether to keep selling: Chinese economic growth indicators and trade talks between China and the U.S., said Wang Menghai, Shanghai-based money manager at Fullgoal Fund Management Co. Wang oversees 7 billion yuan ($1 billion) in assets investing via the trading links.
“If the trade solutions or economic growth turn out to be better than expected, funds would flow to Hong Kong,” Wang said. “If the trade tensions escalate, or there are bad signs for the economy, investors may not have much motivation to buy Hong Kong stocks in the near-term.”
Wang said he is avoiding sectors closely related to the trade tension between China and the U.S. and allocating to companies with abundant free cash flow, as they are more resilient during volatile times. He also favors companies with low gearing, given deleveraging measures being taken on the mainland.
The weaker yuan is an overhang for investors. Huatai’s Lv said companies listed in Hong Kong that generate a bulk of profits on the mainland will see their earnings hit when translated into the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the greenback.
The yuan is the weakest currency in Asia over the past three months, falling around 7 percent against the dollar. The government has stepped in to try to stem the decline, on Friday making it more expensive to short the currency and then this week urging major banks to prevent any “herd behavior” and momentum-chasing moves.
“We may not see a strong comeback of southbound flows in the near-term,” Lv said.

969,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>",Saudi Investment Freeze Doesn't Amount to Much in Canada,"(Bloomberg) -- The decision by Saudi Arabia to halt new investments and unload assets in Canada is likely to have limited impact.
Saudi assets in Canada are confined mainly to stakes in upscale hotel operators, some small stock holdings in companies like Canadian National Railway Co., and grain facilities.
Most investments have been made by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal through his Kingdom Holding Co., a Riyadh-based conglomerate with investments in hotels, real estate and equities. The company’s international hotel unit joined Bill Gates’s Cascade Investment and Canadian Isadore Sharp in a 2007 buyout of management company Four Seasons Hotels Inc., taking a 47.5 percent stake.
“The matter does not affect the day-to-day operations of Four Seasons,” spokeswoman Sarah Tuite said in an email. “It is business as usual as we continue to welcome guests to our hotels and resorts worldwide.”
Alwaleed’s influence in the kingdom has diminished after his arrest last year in an anti-corruption sweep by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is seen to be sending a message to critics of his leadership with this latest reaction against Canada.
Wheat Board
G3 Global Grain Group, a joint venture between state-owned Saudi Agriculture & Livestock Investment Co. and U.S. agri-food company Bunge Ltd., bought a 50.1 percent stake in the Canadian Wheat Board for C$250 million ($192 million) in 2015. SALIC boosted its stake to 75 percent a year later. The partnership also holds an interest in a grain export terminal being built near Vancouver. On Tuesday, officials of the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based G3 said the company continues to buy and sell grain as usual. Officials didn’t immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday.
Last year, Toronto-based technology startup QD Solar Inc. received funding from a group that included Saudi’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Netherlands-based venture capital firm DSM Venturing.
Saudi lender National Commercial Bank has an asset manager that held investments in 41 Canadian companies including Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. in its AlAhli North America Index Fund, according to May 2017 filings. CN Rail, at $473,500, was the largest Canadian investment of the fund’s $148.2 million portfolio.
Two-way trade between the two countries is tiny -- around 0.4 percent of Canada’s total trade in 2017. Canada exported C$1.37 billion worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year, mostly tanks and other armored fighting vehicles and their parts, according to Statistics Canada. The country imported C$2.63 billion in goods from Saudi Arabia over that period, mostly crude imported to the Irving Oil Ltd. refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick.
Export Development Canada, the country’s trade financing agency said it has exposure of about C$2 billion to Saudi Arabia, and about 250 customers operating in the kingdom.
“Canada stands up firmly and respectfully for human rights,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Wednesday in Montreal, sidestepping questions on the impact of the Saudi moves. He also declined to say whether Canada would apologize for its statements about the women’s activists.
The tanks and armored vehicles are manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada, based in London, Ontario, a unit of U.S. defense giant General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)., under a C$15 billion contract with Saudi Arabia signed by the Canadian government in 2014.
Currency Reverses
Saudi’s move had a brief impact on the Canadian dollar, with the loonie depreciating as much as 0.5 percent to C$1.3120 per U.S. dollar after the Financial Times reported the Saudi Arabia central bank and state pension funds instructed overseas asset managers to dispose of Canadian assets starting Tuesday.
Canada’s currency later reversed those losses to trade 0.3 percent higher at 4:29 p.m. in Toronto. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed 0.2 percent higher at 16,315.08. Yields on 10-year government bonds fell 1 basis point to 2.36 percent.
Saudi holdings of Canadian dollar reserves are between C$10 billion and C$25 billion, with the upper end of that estimate representing 10 percent of daily Canadian dollar trading volume, according to estimates from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Gold, Engineering
Canadian direct investors in Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, include Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s second-biggest producer, and SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., Canada’s biggest engineering and construction company.
SNC, which has been operating in the kingdom for five decades, said late Wednesday it’s not yet been able to “fully assess” the impact of the tensions with Saudi Arabia on its business. SNC had revenue of about C$993 million in the country last year, representing about 11 percent of total sales.
“If a widespread commercial embargo on Canadian commercial interests in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were to be implemented on a prolonged basis, there will be an impact on our future financial performance,” SNC said in a statement.
As for Barrick, the Toronto-based miner said it doesn’t expect its copper mine in Saudi Arabia to be affected by the escalating tensions with Canada.
(Updates with SNC-Lavalin comment in penultimate paragraph.)

The cash-and-stock transaction has already won approval from U.S. regulators, but awaits the green light from more than a dozen countries, including China, Russia and regulators from the European Union.
Fox is on track to close the deal in the first half of 2019, Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said on a conference call with analysts, while reiterating that news and live sports will underpin the profile of the new Fox.
Revenue from both Fox's film and cable divisions topped financial analysts' estimates comfortably in the fourth quarter ended June 30.
Fox's filmed entertainment unit saw revenue jump some 27 percent to $2.3 billion, driven largely by the success of ""Deadpool 2,"" in which actor Ryan Reynolds plays a foul-mouthed superhero. The film, distributed by Fox's Twentieth Century Fox studio, has so far grossed $730 million worldwide at the box office.
Revenue from the cable division, home to the Fox News and FX channels, rose 13.8 percent and accounted for more than half of overall revenue.
Affiliate fees, the fees Fox receives from cable operators, climbed 12.3 percent to $3.57 billion. The growth reflected ""subscriber increases in both digital (multi-channel video programming distributors) services and our younger under-penetrated channels,"" Fox CEO James Murdoch said on the conference call.
The Indian Premier League, a hugely popular cricket tournament airing on Fox's Star India and watched by over a billion viewers, drove a 55 percent surge in international advertising revenue.
Overall, Fox's revenue jumped 17.7 percent to $7.94 billion, topping expectations of $7.56 billion.
Net income attributable to shareholders increased to $920 million from $476 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Fox earned 57 cents per share, topping analysts' estimates of 54 cents.

Fox is also trying to buy the 61 percent of British pay-TV group Sky it does not already own. On Tuesday, Fox triggered a 46-day deadline to raise its bid for Sky in a battle with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The company now has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast's offer for Sky.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:19PM ET</span>","Roku's platform drives quarterly revenue beat, shares jump","By Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Roku Inc on Wednesday topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue as its strategy to focus on its ad-supported platform paid off, with more viewers spending longer hours streaming content.
Shares of Roku, which made a spectacular debut on the Nasdaq last year, rose as much as 9.2 percent in after-hours trading after the company said it added 22 million active accounts in the second quarter.
Roku is known for its device that connects televisions to streaming services from companies such as Hulu, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, the company has been witnessing intense competition in this space from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's Apple TV, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Chromecast and Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Fire TV.
This led the company to tap other revenue sources such as licensing its technology to television makers and earning a share of the advertising revenue from media companies based on sign-ups for apps on its platform and namesake channel. 
The company's subscriber addition rose 46 percent in the quarter and streaming hours increased 57 percent to 5.5 billion hours.
Roku's average revenue per user grew 48 percent to $16.60, helping overall platform revenue nearly double to $90.3 million in the quarter. 
""Live news launch in mid-May and World Cup in June likely contributed to the performance in the quarter,"" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte said. 
Separately, the company also launched the Roku Channel for the web in the United States and the channel app on select Samsung (KS:005930) smart TVs.
""We don't think the new platforms like web will have any big impact in the short term, but in the long term it's going to expand the reach and help with the overall performance of the business,"" Chief Executive Officer Anthony Wood told Reuters.
Roku reported a profit of $526 million in the quarter ended June 30 compared with a loss of $15.5 million a year ago.
Excluding items, the company broke even on a per share basis, better than the average analyst estimate of a 15-cent loss. Total net revenue rose 57.4 percent to $156.8 million, beating estimates of $141.5 million. 
The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast to $710 million, beating estimates of $698 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Shares of the company were trading up 7.8 percent at $50.92.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:44PM ET</span>",SEC examining Musk's tweets on taking Tesla private: WSJ,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators are asking Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) why Chief Executive Elon Musk announced his plan to take the electric carmaker private on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
Musk announced his plan on his personal Twitter account on Tuesday, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked Tesla about the facts of the matter, why it was disclosed on Twitter rather than in a regulatory filing and whether it believed investor-protection rules had been met, the Journal said.
The agency declined to comment and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Tesla shares fell 2.4 percent to $370.34 on Wednesday after closing up 11 percent on Tuesday, ending about $50 per share below what Musk said he was considering offering.
Musk had dropped the surprise plan in a terse tweet, saying, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""
He has not provided details or evidence of the funding by Twitter or in a following blog posted on the Tesla web site, and several securities attorneys told Reuters Musk could face investor lawsuits if it was proven he did not have secure financing at the time of his tweet.
""The words 'financing secured' are the danger point – that’s a statement of fact and could set him up to be accused of a material misstatement if it's proven false,"" said Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business with a background in law. 
Using Twitter to announce materially important information is not common, but the SEC allows companies to use social media to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules if investors are alerted about which outlets will be used.
Musk is a prolific tweeter and Tesla alerted investors in a 2013 SEC filing that they should follow Musk's Twitter feed for ""additional information"" about the company. 
There is no reference to Musk's Twitter account on the company's investor relations page under ""investor communication,"" although Tesla's Twitter feed is included.
Some Wall Street analysts were skeptical of Musk's ability to gather the huge financial backing to complete such a deal, given that Tesla loses money, has $10.9 billion of debt and its bonds are rated junk by credit ratings agencies.
""Who gives $30 to $50 billion to buy back the shares?"" asked NordLB analyst Frank Schwope. ""And if you stay as a shareholder you get less information than before and you depend more and more on Elon Musk.""
BIGGEST LBO
Tesla's board on earlier on Wednesday said it was evaluating taking the company private, which would be the biggest leveraged buyout of all time.
In a statement on Tesla's website https:// six of Tesla's nine directors said the board had met several times over the last week to discuss such an idea and was ""taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this.""
Musk's plan for a price of $420 a share would value a deal at more than $70 billion. 
Tesla said on Wednesday the discussions had addressed the issue of how to fund such a deal, but gave no details. The statement did not address how the $420-per-share price was established. 
Public companies have four days https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersform8khtm.html to report certain material events that shareholders should know about to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The deal would be the biggest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the $45 billion record set by Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings.
The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which sources said on Tuesday had taken a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, or a major technology investment fund such as SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Vision Fund, bankers said.
SoftBank is currently not interested in a deal for Tesla after earlier this year taking a stake in General Motors Co's (N:GM) self-driving unit, Cruise, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday.
Musk and SoftBank held unsuccessful talks about a take-private deal in April 2017, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News, which first reported on that meeting, said the talks failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership. 
China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, could also be a possible partner.
SURPRISE MOVE
In a letter https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private after his tweet on Tuesday, Musk fleshed out his idea, suggesting shareholders would get the option to sell their shares or remain investors in a private Tesla, out of the glare of Wall Street and its need for positive quarterly results. 
He said that would allow Tesla to ""operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible."" 
Some on Wall Street shared that view. 
""They’re being bombarded with questions that we don’t think are as relevant to the long-term value of the company,"" said Sam Korus, an analyst for ARK Investment Management, which had 443,874 Tesla shares as of June 30. Korus said he would need more details from Musk to judge whether a buyout offer would be practical and at what price it would be attractive. 
Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla's valuation higher than that of GM. 
The company is still working its way out of what Musk called ""production hell"" at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company's profitability rests.
Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk.
The six board members who issued the statement on Wednesday included James Murdoch, chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) and Brad Buss, who was the chief financial officer of solar panel maker SolarCity until it was bought by Tesla in 2016. 

Other board members mentioned in the statement included Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias and Linda Johnson Rice. Tesla's other board members are Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk and venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed slightly lower on Wednesday as falling crude prices and trade jitters held markets in check.
The Nasdaq posted its seventh consecutive daily advance, while the Dow was down marginally. The S&P 500's dip occurred as the index has inched closer in recent days to its record high set on Jan. 26.
""We had in January the fastest 10 percent decline from an all-time high in history,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling in Austin, Texas. ""When you have substantial declines, particularly off of previous highs, you normally will see periods of digestion.""
China introduced new 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of goods imported from the United States in the latest tit-for-tat in the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.
""This is going to continue at least until the midterm elections"" in November, Phipps said. ""Why would (China) negotiate with the U.S. now when they may get a mixed government to negotiate with after November?"" 
Trade-sensitive industrial companies (SPLRCI) were the biggest drag on the Dow. The decline was led by Boeing (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT).
Energy stocks (SPNY) fell 0.8 percent as crude prices (LCOc1) dropped due to slowing Chinese demand and trade concerns.
Technology (SPLRCT) provided the largest boost to the S&P 500, led by  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) fell 2.4 percent as its board evaluated Elon Musk's idea of taking the electric automaker private, a day after the chief executive surprised the market by floating the proposal on Twitter.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 45.16 points, or 0.18 percent, to 25,583.75, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.75 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,857.7 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 4.66 points, or 0.06 percent, to 7,888.33.
Second-quarter earnings season has entered the home stretch, and of the 440 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 78.6 percent have beaten analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) dropped 2.2 percent after its quarterly profit missed estimates, and after a source reported that China has denied the company's request to screen its film ""Christopher Robin"" in the country.
Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) were slightly up in choppy post-market trading after posting better-than-expected results.
Among gainers, CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) beat analyst estimates and announced it now expects its acquisition of Aetna (N:AET) to close in the latter half of 2018. The drugstore operator's shares rose 4.2 percent.
Drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL) recovered from earlier losses after it said it was actively evaluating a ""wide range of alternatives"" following a disappointing earnings report. The stock ended the session up 1.8 percent. 
 Michael Kors Holdings  Ltd (N:KORS) gained 6.7 percent after beating analyst profit forecasts and raising its full-year forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Ford executive says baby offroader in product pipeline,"By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plans to introduce a small utility vehicle based on its compact Focus sedan, with more rugged offroad styling cues than the Escape, a top executive said on Wednesday.
The new model, which will share parts with the Focus and Escape, will feature ""offroad positioning and imagery"" and will carry a premium price, according to Hau Thai-Tang, executive vice president of product development and purchasing. Thai-Tang was speaking at an investor conference in New York 
The vehicle, as yet unnamed, is an all-new model with a design intended to recall Ford's classic mid-1960s Bronco offroader, according to a source familiar with the company's plans. The new compact could debut in 2019 as a 2020 model, said the source. 
Thai-Tang cited the vehicle as an example of how the U.S. automaker is changing its product development process to use more flexible vehicle architectures, increase parts commonality and speed new products to market more quickly.
Ford unveiled a boxy Bronco concept at the 2004 Detroit auto show that never went into production. The U.S. automaker said last year it plans to launch a midsize Bronco, based on the upcoming Ford Ranger midsize pickup, for model year 2020.
Unlike the 2020 Bronco, which will use a trucklike body-on-frame architecture, the ""baby Bronco"" will be more carlike since it will share its underpinnings with the Focus and Escape.
Ford has said it plans to phase out the Focus sedan and hatchback in North America because of declining demand for conventional passenger cars.

But it expects to introduce a wagon-like variant of the redesigned compact, called Focus Active, with modest crossover-like styling cues reminiscent of the Subaru Outback, the source said, adding that the Focus Active will share common parts with the small offroader.

997,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Snaps Four-Day Winning Streak as Trade-War Fears Return,"Investing.com - The Dow posted its first loss in five days Wednesday as falling energy stocks and an escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China weighed on sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.18%. The S&P 500 fell 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.06%.
The tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and China came to fore, denting investor appetite for risker assets such as stocks, as both countries showed a willingness to follow through with additional tariffs.
China announced Wednesday morning that it will impose a 25% levy on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, including large passenger vehicles, motorcycles and crude.
The announcement from China comes after the Trump administration followed through with a 25% tariff on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, including semiconductors, rail equipment and some motorcycles.
The latest volley of American and Chinese tariffs takes the total of targeted goods to $50 billion on each side and are slated to come into effect on Aug. 23.
Falling energy stocks also held back performance following a rout in oil markets on the back of data showing U.S. oil supplies fell by less than expected, while the U.S.-China trade spat also weighed on sentiment.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September fell 3.2% to settle at $66.94 a barrel.
Mixed earnings, meanwhile, did little to lift the mood on equities. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) stock surged after reporting above-consensus earnings on Wednesday, while Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stocks tumbled after both reports failed to impress investors.
The slew of mostly upbeat corporate earnings in the quarter has helped US stocks shrug off the ongoing tit-for-tat U.S.-China trade war so far, but momentum could wane as the earnings season draws to a close and the market enters the ""dog days of summer,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank.
U.S. stocks will likely resume upside momentum if either the current trend of bullish earnings extends into the third quarter or the trade war between the U.S. and China abates, Sandven added.
""Better-than-expected third quarter results in mid-October or a resolution to trade tensions with China would be among catalysts warranting further upside,"" he said.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's decision to announce on Twitter Tuesday that he was considering taking the company private has reportedly attracted inquiries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions.

998,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Trade War Worries Aren’t Going Away 
While earnings season’s grip on market direction loosens, trade’s impact on stocks persists.
It could be argued that the U.S. and China are now officially in a trade war (if they weren’t before). The two sides aren’t talking and China is hitting back at every U.S. salvo.
Today, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it will impose a 25% charge on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, raging from fiber optic cables to vehicles. The announcement from China comes after the Trump administration followed through with a 25% tariff on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods Tuesday evening.
“This is very unreasonable,” China’s ministry said in a statement. “In order to defend China’s rightful interests and the multilateral trade system, China has to retaliate as necessary.”
That takes the total of targeted goods to $50 billion on each side. China’s tariffs are slated to come into effect on Aug. 23.
From the market perspective, the longer this continues, the tougher it will be for Wall Street to find clear direction. Apart from the effects of tariffs on the bottom lines of companies, stocks will be subject to swings every time there are reports or statements that signify escalation or easing of the trade battles.
2. Market Will Be Hoping for Tame Inflation
Macro makes a comeback tomorrow after a very brief hiatus and investors will have two economic indicators on which to trade.
The featured act is wholesale inflation. Economists expect that the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.2% in July and is up 3.4% year over year. The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, is also expected to post a 0.2% rise on the month, up 2.8% on the year.
The report comes out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Earlier today, Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin said that the U.S. central bank should follow through on gradually raising interest rates to more normal levels, given the current strength of the American economy.
“It is difficult to argue that lower than normal rates are appropriate when unemployment is low and inflation is effectively at the Fed’s target,” he said in a speech delivered Wednesday.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak tomorrow at 9:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Also on the calendar are initial jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists expect just a slight rise in weekly first-time claims from the week before.
3. Media Earnings in the Spotlight
As noted, earnings season is waning, but it’s not completely gone. Media stocks are some of the bigger names issuing results today and tomorrow.
Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) reported profit and revenue that topped expectations after hours Wednesday. Those results might help shares of  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), which is buying Fox's TV and movie studio assets.
Tomorrow, Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) reports before the bell. Tronc (NASDAQ:TRNC) will also issue results. And after hours, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) will report earnings."

Money fund assets grew by $23.87 billion to $2.827 trillion in the week ended Aug. 7, just shy of the $2.828 trillion in the week of June 13.
The rise in money fund assets coincided with the growing supply of Treasury bills as the government has been ramping its borrowing to finance its budget deficit.
Money funds are major buyers of T-bills and other short-term debt.
Taxable money market fund assets increased by $25.20 billion to $2.697 trillion, while tax-free assets decreased by $1.33 billion to $130.16 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
iMoneyNet's money fund average seven-day simple yield for All taxable money-market funds was unchanged in the latest week at 1.56 percent, while its average seven-day simple yield for tax-free and municipal money-market funds jumped to 0.80 percent from 0.58 percent last week.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected an antitrust challenge by 23 beer drinkers to  Anheuser-Busch InBev  SA's (BR:ABI) $107 billion purchase in 2016 of SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc, which they claimed would thwart competition and raise prices in the U.S. beer market.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Portland, Oregon said SABMiller's agreement with antitrust regulators to divest its U.S. beer business, by selling its stake in the MillerCoors joint venture to  Molson Coors  Brewing Co (N:TAP), would prevent increased concentration in the industry.
It also rejected as speculative the argument that the merger violated the federal Clayton Act because it gave Molson Coors an incentive to adopt Anheuser's distribution practices, to combat its rival's newly increased size.
That law requires consumers to properly allege that a merger ""creates an appreciable danger or a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects in the relevant market,"" Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown wrote for a three-judge panel. "" (The) consumers' allegations do not belly up to this bar.""
Anheuser-Busch InBev's brands include Budweiser and Bud Light, Beck's, Corona, Hoegaarden, Stella Artois, the craft beers Goose Island and Blue Point, and many others.
Joseph Alioto, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview he would ask the panel or an 11-judge appeals court panel to revisit the case.
""The court overlooked the elephant in the room: that the 72 percent of the market that was occupied by ABI, SAB and Molson is now occupied by two,"" Alioto said. ""Is the elimination of the second-largest brewer in the world from the U.S. market a lessening of competition? I don't think there is any doubt.""
A spokeswoman for Anheuser declined to comment.
Wednesday's decision upheld an October 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon.

The case is DeHoog v Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-35912.

NEW YORK(LPC) - At least three US companies including warehouse retail store BJ’s Wholesale Club are seeking to cut borrowing costs on existing term loans after a surge in new money issuance this year put a brake on opportunistic repricing and refinancing transactions in July. 
July saw 139 US companies turning to the leveraged loan market to back buyouts and raise new debt, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. However, not a single issuer attempted to cut pricing on existing loans, the data shows. 
Opportunistic deals dried up as a wave of new money deals during the second quarter tipped the market in favor of lenders that were able to push back on deals and bargain for better pricing. In all, US$245bn of new paper was placed during the second quarter, the highest volume since the second quarter of 2007 hit a record US$261bn. 
Repricing activity has returned though for strong credit as new deals have slowed down.
“Loan repricings are driven by both volume and tone in the market,” said a senior banker. “You’re dependent on soft call protection rolling off and the general tone in the marketplace. The market didn’t feel all that great in July and there were a lot of new deals getting done. Investors had their choice of deals to pick from, so they didn’t have to simply let deals reprice.”
The room for more opportunistic deals might also be limited as the earlier refinancing waves have pushed the maturity wall further to 2023 and 2024, according to Eric Rosenthal, senior director of leveraged finance at Fitch Ratings.
“There’s very little coming due in 2018, 2019, and even 2020,” Rosenthal said. “We have only US$88bn in institutional term loans due over the next two and a half years, which is striking. You are seeing some deals get done at 175bp over Libor with some Double B names. It can’t go much lower than that.”
HARD TIME
Repricings may be back in the market only as an option for companies with specific credit events as opposed to the broad repricing trend that allowed companies to reprice their loans almost at will every six months earlier this year and last year. 
For example, in June BJ’s raised net proceeds of US$637.5m in its IPO, which the company will use to completely repay its US$625m second-lien term loan. The company is also paying down a portion of its first-lien debt. Moody’s upgraded BJ’s corporate family rating to B1 from B3 following the successful IPO, citing its pro-forma leverage ratio reducing to around 5.4 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from 6.2 times.
BJ’s is using this event to ask lenders to cut pricing on its soon-to-be US$1.5bn term loan due in 2024. The company on Wednesday lowered the rate to 300bp over Libor with a 25bp stepdown when net first-lien leverage drops to 3 times. BJ’s lined up the loan at a size of US$1.925bn to back a dividend recapitalization in January 2017 at a price of 375bp over Libor.
“I think we’ve repriced so much of the market, the opportunities are now limited,” said the banker. “Unless there has been a structural change to the credit such as a deleveraging event, you’re going to have a hard time.”
Also looking to cut pricing is chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor, which on Tuesday launched a repricing of its US$503.8m term loan B with guidance circulating in the 175bp-200bp over Libor range with a 0% floor. Cypress in March priced the then US$505m term loan, due July 21 2021, at 225bp over Libor.
Moody’s upgraded Cypress’s corporate family rating to Ba3 from B1 in February on continued improvement in operating performance.
Natural gas electricity producer Compass Power Generation on Wednesday started shopping a price cut for its US$744m term loan with guidance in the 325bp-350bp over Libor range. The company arranged the loan at a size of US$750m in December 2017 to back a dividend recapitalization, issuing the debt at 375bp over Libor with a 1% floor.
“I’m guessing (these repricings) are going to get done,” said a portfolio manager. “These are very good quality companies. There’s not a lot of high-quality paper out in the new pipeline. It will be an interesting test to see if the demand is still there. I don’t think Single B credits could get repricings done though in this environment.” 
Looking ahead, M&A activities will be the biggest driver of the loan market, which is expected to continue to give investors the ability to put their money to work with new deals instead of holding onto existing loans at lower prices, Rosenthal said.
Several jumbo US buyout loans are expected to launch after Labor Day, including a US$13.5bn loan and bond financing backing Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s purchase of Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk (F&R) unit and a US$8.05bn financing for KKR’s buyout of physician services provider Envision Healthcare.
Blackstone announced on January 30 that it was buying a 55% majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC.

1013,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Elon Musk Talked With SoftBank About Tesla Investment in 2017,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk and Masayoshi Son held talks last year about SoftBank Group Corp. investing in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., including potentially taking the electric carmaker private, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
Son and Musk met in April 2017 to discuss an investment in Tesla, the people said. The talks touched on taking Tesla private, but failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership. Musk proposed a structure that would have given him disproportionate control over the company through stock with supervoting rights, one person said. There are no active talks between the companies now, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. Tesla spokesmen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment.
At the time of the talks, Tesla was trading at just over $300 a share. The shares surged 11 percent to $379.57 on Tuesday after Musk said he’s considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, or an enterprise value of about $82 billion. He currently owns 20 percent of the company, so more than $60 billion is needed to buy the business from public shareholders.
Japan’s SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund often pay handsomely for large stakes in technology companies. In return, they like a say in the management of the businesses they back. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, a major backer of the Vision Fund, has built a $2 billion stake in Tesla already.
An acquisition of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla by overseas investors would likely trigger a national-security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The panel, which has stepped up its scrutiny and blocked some deals lately, could impose conditions, including limits on control of the company and information sharing.
""Most of the obvious funding sources for Tesla’s take-private transaction are foreign-based,"" Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note. ""We imagine the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would likely object to any foreign investor buying a significant portion of a distinctively American manufacturer such as Tesla""
Still, SoftBank is familiar with CFIUS. The company’s 2017 agreement to buy U.S.-based robotics firm Boston Dynamics was reviewed by the panel. In another deal, CFIUS forced SoftBank to relinquish day-to-day control of Fortress Investment Group before approving that $3.3 billion purchase, the Financial Times reported earlier this year.

The AMA said that the $69 billion deal, announced in December, would lead to a ""substantial reduction"" of competition in pharmacy benefit (PBM) services market and the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan for seniors. 
The AMA said the deal would increase concentration in 10 of the 34 Medicare Part D regional markets to the point where it is presumed likely to increase market power. 
""CVS and Aetna ... operate as rivals in some of the same markets, raising substantial concerns,"" said AMA President Barbara McAneny in a statement.
McAneny said the merger would mean higher prices, less choice and stifled innovation in PBM services, health insurance and pharmacy services.
CVS said in a statement that it strongly disagreed with the AMA's assessment of the deal. 
""We believe that competition within each of the business segments in which we operate – pharmacy benefit management, pharmacies and insurers – is fierce and will remain so,"" the company said in a statement.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart announced in May it was acquiring about 77 percent of Flipkart for roughly $16 billion in the biggest deal for India's e-commerce sector, which  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates will grow close to an annual $200 billion in a decade.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved the proposed acquisition of Flipkart by Walmart, the agency said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.
The acquisition of Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart will give Walmart, which runs 21 cash-and-carry stores in India, a stronger foothold in Asia's third-largest economy where it has struggled to expand in the last decade, partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in bricks-and-mortar retail.
A local trader body, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), had opposed the Walmart-Flipkart deal, saying the combination would create unfair competition and drive local convenience stores out of business.
On Wednesday, CAIT said it was disappointed by the CCI's approval.
""We will certainly move the court against the CCI's decision,"" Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT's secretary general told Reuters. ""CAIT has called an emergency meeting of its governing council on August 19 at Nagpur, where we will finalise our strategy for a nationwide movement.""
Walmart has previously said it supports local manufacturing in India by sourcing from small and medium suppliers, farmers and businesses run by women.

""We believe that the combination of Walmart's global expertise and Flipkart will position us for long-term success and enable us to contribute to the economic growth,"" Walmart said in a statement after the CCI announcement.

(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday and the drugstore operator defended its pharmacy benefits management business in the face of the Trump administration's move to clamp down on escalating drug costs.
Shares of CVS Health, which agreed to buy health insurer Aetna (N:AET) for $69 billion in December, rose 3.6 percent to $67.76.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are in the crosshairs of the U.S. administration, which last month proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers, insurers and PBMs.
""Drug manufacturers want you to believe that increasing drug prices are a result of them (being) happy to pay rebates and that PBMs are retaining these rebates,"" CVS Health Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said on a conference call. 
""This is simply not true.""
The company said new rules announced on Tuesday that gave Medicare Advantage health plans tools to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices, indicates the administration recognizes PBMs have a key role to play in reducing drug costs.
Adding to competition, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in June agreed to acquire a small online pharmacy firm, a move that put the world's biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and PBMs.
""We welcome competition ... expect more of it in the years to come and are confident that we ourselves are key disruptors,"" Merlo said.
CVS Health also said it now expects its Aetna deal to close during the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The Aetna deal is likely to reshape healthcare in the United States as it brings together one of the nation's largest PBMs and pharmacy operators with one of the oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans. 
Net loss attributable to CVS was $2.56 billion, or $2.52 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30.
CVS said it took a $3.9 billion goodwill impairment charge in the reported quarter related to the Omnicare business in its retail unit.
""The Omnicare write-down was somewhat of a surprise, but overall we were already expecting modest results out of that business,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 

Excluding items, the company earned $1.69 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.61, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 11:16AM ET</span>",Old-line Kroger shows new moves in grocery delivery drive,"By Lisa Baertlein
CINCINNATI (Reuters) -  Kroger Co  (N:KR), the nation's biggest supermarket chain, whose founder delivered groceries by horse and buggy, is using a different kind of horsepower in its race with online grocery sellers.
The 135-year-old company is experimenting with a variety of technologies as it battles Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) to find a profitable formula to serve customers who want milk and eggs whisked to their doorsteps. These shoppers are a tiny but fast-growing segment of the $800-billion U.S. grocery market. Kroger must win them over to survive.
""We want to serve the customer on their terms,"" said Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who for years has kept tabs on the economics of grocery delivery. ""For us, every penny counts.""
In a series of interviews with Reuters at Kroger headquarters in Cincinnati, McMullen and other executives outlined a host of experiments and initiatives. These include self-driving delivery vans, third-party delivery contractors and curbside pickup in Kroger parking lots. Most of these efforts are an attempt to leverage one of the company's most valuable assets: brick-and-mortar stores located within a mile or two of most of its current customers. 
But Kroger is breaking with that familiar model for its next big push. It is betting big on giant warehouses staffed with fast robots to pack orders straight for delivery to shoppers.
In May, Kroger paid roughly $248 million for a minority stake in Ocado (L:OCDO), a British company whose newest machines can pull together a 50-item grocery order in as little as five minutes. That technology leapfrogs what is currently in use by any retailer in the United States. It has turned Ocado into the world's No. 1 online grocer, serving 679,000 active customers in the United Kingdom without operating a single supermarket. 
This year Kroger and Ocado will pick U.S. sites for the first three of 20 planned high-tech warehouses, known as ""sheds,"" that take a couple of years to build, Kroger executives said. They declined to name locations, but said Kroger plans to break into at least one new area where it does not have existing stores.
Industry veterans said Kroger's partnership with Ocado was a bold move that positions the company, which posted 2017 sales of $123 billion, to grab share from younger players seen as nimbler and more innovative. 
""This will be a game-changer ... and probably the most likely catalyst for grocery e-commerce in the U.S. to take off,"" said London-based Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former e-commerce executive at British food seller  Tesco  (L:TSCO).
Kroger executives would not say whether they will use their own drivers or outsource delivery from the sheds.
Meanwhile, the company has teamed up with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Nuro to test a driverless delivery van in Phoenix. And Kroger continues to invest in curbside pickup.
Earlier this month it launched a beefed-up online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers via  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) and FedEx Corp (N:FDX). 
But competitors are not sitting still. 
Walmart, which waged a brutal price war to become the top U.S. grocery seller, recently launched its own self-driving car project. Later this year it will begin testing automated grocery picking at a supercenter in Salem, New Hampshire.
Amazon, meanwhile, already sells more non-perishable groceries online than any other retailer. It spent $13.7 billion last year to acquire the Whole Foods supermarket chain with an eye to turning those stores into distribution hubs to bolster its AmazonFresh delivery service. The company just launched curbside pickup at Whole Foods, starting with stores in Sacramento, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia.
DEMAND DILEMMA 
It is all largely a bet on the future.
Analysts say online grocery purchases currently account for just 1 percent to 4 percent of U.S. industry sales. Three-quarters of online shoppers surveyed said they rarely or never buy groceries that way, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos telephone poll of nearly 6,000 adults fielded from June 26 to July 11.
(For a look at why U.S. shoppers are not buying groceries online, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LYQUUV) 
Investment in automation has spurred faster growth overseas. Online grocery sales account for 5.6 percent of the market in the United Kingdom and 3.8 percent in China, compared to 1 percent in the United States, according to market research firm IGD Retail.
Kroger is letting go of old models that have proven unprofitable.
Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman revealed for the first time that the company never made money on Home Shop, a roughly 30-year-old delivery service it shuttered in April. Kroger offered it in just 20 stores in the company's King Soopers division in the Rocky Mountain area, for prices ranging from $10.95 for an internet order to $20.90 for telephone orders. That was not enough to cover the cost of labor and the expense of operating a fleet of refrigerated trucks. 
""It's highly inefficient to do that out of a store. You can't get the critical mass you need,"" Schlotman said.
Kroger replaced Home Shop with Instacart, one of a handful of third-party delivery firms that now serve more than 1,200 Kroger stores. 
Monteyne, the supermarket analyst, said Kroger's new delivery push is a recognition of the value of online shoppers. These customers crave convenience and tend to spend more per order than those who just drop by the supermarket for a few items. The ""first-mover"" advantage is key to locking them in. 
That is how Kroger lost Cincinnati shopper Alene Annan, 50. Tired of hauling dog food and Diet Coke up two flights of steps to her home, she switched to Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL], which was among the first stores to offer delivery in her area. 
Still, she said she is open to switching back to Kroger when its new service is ready. 
""They just have to make it easy,"" Annan said.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",Saudi-Canada row could further rattle foreign investors eyeing kingdom,"By Saeed Azhar, Katie Paul and Maha El Dahan
DUBAI (Reuters) - A worsening row between Saudi Arabia and Canada about human rights threatens to undermine Riyadh's foreign investment drive, a campaign already unsettled by a series of assertive political and diplomatic initiatives by the top oil exporter.
The kingdom froze new trade and investment with Canada and expelled its ambassador this week, angered by a call from Ottawa for the freeing of arrested rights activists.
Riyadh's action may do some damage to the miniscule trade between the two countries - Saudi Arabia's main state wheat buying agency, for example, has told grains exporters it will no longer buy Canadian wheat and barley.
But the row raises question marks more broadly for the foreign investors Riyadh is counting on to become partners -- to the tune of tens of billions of dollars -- in the modernization of the Arab world's biggest economy.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MbS, has made a strong pitch for foreign capital since rising to power in 2015, spearheading an ambitious economic and privatization plan that included the future listing of oil company, Saudi Aramco.
At the same time, he has sought to project Saudi power in an increasingly unstable Gulf, fighting a costly war in neighboring Yemen, working to isolate sometime ally Qatar, and deepening a contest for regional influence with arch rival Iran.
At home, an anti-graft campaign watched closely by foreign investors saw mass arrests of princes and top officials, including some businessmen with a high international profile.
Critics said the spat risks slowing a faltering foreign investment drive. Inflows have slowed mainly due to years of low oil prices, but regional turbulence doesn't help, they say.
""Saudi Arabia simply cannot afford to alienate any other sections of the global community in the midst of its unpopular military engagement in Yemen, its indirect confrontation with Iran, "" prominent Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi wrote in the Washington Post.
""Most importantly, Saudi Arabia’s economic transformation requires more friends than enemies.
CONTRACTS
MbS, he wrote, ""needs to use ways and means that investors are accustomed to. If business executives fear a backlash over any possible criticism regarding their investment, the new vision of Saudi Arabia would be in serious jeopardy.""
The kingdom insists it is justified in punishing Ottawa for its public appeal over the activists. A statement decried ""a blatant interference in the Kingdom's domestic affairs, against basic international norms and all international protocols.""
Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Wednesday ruled out mediation and said Riyadh might take more measures.
But for some, the Canada row strengthens an impression of impulsive policy-making.
Germany, for example, found itself in hot water last year after appearing to criticize Riyadh's ties with Lebanon -- The kingdom reacted by moving to exclude German companies from government contracts.
""It risks suggesting that policymakers may be backsliding on some of the recent measures to open up the economy, and that policymaking can be quite arbitrary. This might hurt investment into the country,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
New foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia plunged to a 14-year low in 2017, U.N. figures show, posing a blow to MbS's plans to raise inflows of foreign capital sharply.
In an effort to reverse that trend, Saudi Arabia last year hosted a Davos-style gathering of global investors in Riyadh, which MbS wants to make a regional financial powerhouse.
Within days, the euphoria of the event was dampened by the severity and secrecy of an anti-graft crackdown that saw the detention of high profile businessman including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the face of Saudi business to the outside world.
Prince Mohammed has defended last November's crackdown, in which dozens of top business leaders and princes were detained, as necessary to combat ""the cancer of corruption"".
Most detainees have been freed, and the authorities say they have said they plan to seize more than $100 billion in assets.
As a result, fund managers face a dilemma over Saudi Arabia, weighing attractive developments like privatization and its classification as an emerging market by index provider MSCI from mid-2019, against the kingdom’s riskier impulses.
 ""Against the growing and encouraging will to invest, the incident with Canada brings to light some of the issues that many investors see as inseparable,"" said Christopher McKee, the CEO of PRS Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy.
GLOBAL CAPITAL
""The real issue isn’t so much about Canada as the way in which Saudi Arabia — in a world of mobile global capital — responds to international criticism.""
In 2017, Saudi Arabia exported $2 billion worth of goods and services to Canada, less than one percent of Saudi Arabia's total world exports of $220.07 billion, over the same period, while Canada's exports were even lower.
 It is unclear how far the row will affect that activity, although the suspension of educational exchange programs with Canada may affect thousands of Saudi students and cost Canadian universities millions of dollars in tuition fees.
But for now, the mood is uncertain.
""For all businesses, we are entering dangerous territory that nobody really wants,"" said Omar Allam, former Canadian diplomat and head of global consultancy Allam Advisory Group.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",Boeing sees more narrowbody delivery delays in third quarter,"SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA). the world's largest planemaker, said on Wednesday it expects delivery delays of its hot-selling narrowbody aircraft to continue deeper into the year as it grapples with delays of fuselages and engines from suppliers.
""You saw some of that making its way into 2Q deliveries a little bit, and you'll see more of that in Q3 where we'll expect to have deliveries lower than our production rate,"" Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told an analyst conference. 
""And so therefore you'll see a much more heavily weighted Q4,"" Smith added. ""Those jobs are now in our factory and each one of those suppliers is getting more on track,"" he said.
The top-selling 737 is powered by engines made by French-U.S. venture CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE) of the United States. CFM has had some industrial problems in producing its new LEAP engine for the 737 MAX and some aircraft for rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Boeing is also grappling with delays on fuselages supplied by Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR). Spirit, which makes some 70 percent of the structure of the 737, has faced disruptions this year in its own supply chain as parts makers scrambled to meet soaring demand. Spirit has said it is working to get back on track by mid-2018.
Boeing aims to reach production of 57 of the narrow-body jets per month in 2019.
Smith also said Boeing continues to spend a lot of time talking to airlines about a possible new mid-market jet it says will fill a niche between the bread-and-butter single-aisle planes that dominate most fleets and the bigger long-range, twin-aisle jets.

Discussions continue to focus on the plane's economics and how airlines could use the aircraft to optimize their product lines, Smith said.

The company said on Tuesday second-quarter comparable sales fell 6.1 percent in North America and would continue to slip for the coming months, citing negative publicity from the acrimonious exit of founder and former Chairman John Schnatter.
Schnatter, who founded the company in 1984, was forced to leave in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. 
""Papa John's results proved to be as eventful as expected with a sizable comp downturn, dueling press releases and ongoing boardroom drama,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a note on Wednesday.
Saleh said the pizza chain is now faced with an uncertain path to recovery as founder Schnatter continues to advocate for more control. The analyst also said that a sale of the pizza chain would be unlikely under these circumstances, despite depressed stock prices.
Right after the results on Tuesday, Schnatter issued a statement blasting Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie for the poor results. 
The company's shares hit a low of $38.05, levels last seen in September 2014, in early trading on Wednesday. The stock has lost 19 percent since Schnatter's departure in July.
Ritchie on Tuesday vowed to move beyond the fight with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter's image from company promotions.
Papa John's said the efforts would cost it $30 million to $50 million over the rest of the year.
However, Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull questioned how effective the company's campaign would be, given that Schnatter holds a 30 percent stake in the pizza chain. O'Cull cut his price target to $35 from $38.

Jefferies analysts said any turnaround would take time and that it did not expect same-store sales to turn positive until the second-half of 2019.

Musk shocked the market, yet again with a tweet on Tuesday that he was considering taking the loss-making company private at $420 a share. Shares were down 3 percent in premarket trading after closing up 11 percent at $379.57 on Tuesday.
""Given the haphazard process of disclosure last afternoon, our initial impression was that Elon Musk sprung his plan of going private upon the public without consulting Tesla's board of directors or major shareholders,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note titled ""Going private? Who knows... does Elon?""
Most analysts were skeptical, but some said a deal could materialize if Musk succeeded in lining up the right funding. The company already has a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund as well as Tencent, which took a 5 percent stake in 2017.
""Elon's tone and messaging regarding a potential transaction lead us to believe that there could be significant outside funding lined up,"" RBC analysts said.
Tesla's stock has swung wildly in the past several years, hit by the company's production issues as well as Musk's own explosive remarks on Twitter that have turned off investors.
The move to take the company public would remove Musk, who himself has a 20 percent stake, from the public arena - and contentious criticism.

""Distraction or not, the move feels right even if Musk is downplaying how supportive public markets have been. With Tesla unable to take on more debt, we wonder who may fund the potential deal and end up as a new large shareholder,"" Jefferies said in a note.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:28AM ET</span>",Elon Musk's Tesla buyout would reengineer take-private deals,"By Joshua Franklin and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Elon Musk has always done things his own way, from designing space rockets to manufacturing electric cars. Now the Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO is looking to reengineer how a company can be taken private.
Musk announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, or $72 billion, in what would be the biggest deal of this kind. He said the funding for the deal was secured, but did not provide details.
Tesla shares ended up 11 percent at $379.57, indicating investors gave some credence to the plan.
But investment bankers and analysts reacted with skepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.
""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity.
Finding equity partners and bank financing is key to take-private deals. When Michael Dell took his eponymous computer maker private for $24.9 billion in 2013, for example, he brought in buyout firm Silver Lake that contributed $1.4 billion in equity, raised more than $10 billion in bank debt, and received a $2 billion loan from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT). 
When a Twitter user commented on Musk's proposed deal by posting ""Just like Dell did. It saves a lot of headaches"", Musk responded by tweeting ""Yes"".
Dell's take-private deal, however, may not be possible to replicate with Tesla, which has a $10.9 billion debt pile, is losing money, and whose bonds are rated junk by credit ratings agencies. Without the ability to add more debt, Musk may have to turn to sources of capital that are less accustomed to using debt to juice returns in the way private equity firms are. 
SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS
One option could be sovereign wealth funds, investment bankers said. 
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a stake of less than 5 percent in Tesla, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. PIF did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would bankroll Musk's take-private deal.
SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) $93 billion Vision Fund, whose investors include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, is seen as an obvious partner given its appetite for big technology investments, but was not contacted by Musk and is not interested in a deal given its investment in Tesla competitor Cruise, the self-driving car unit of General Motors Co (N:GM), according to a source familiar with the matter. SoftBank declined to comment.
China's Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner. 
However foreign capital sources would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Any proposal for funding from Chinese firms could face even tougher checks amid mounting U.S.-China trade tensions.
Many attempts by founders and top executives to take their companies private have never come to fruition. In March,  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) Chairman Paul Jacobs stepped down from the board to pursue a long-shot take-private bid for the U.S. chip maker, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. To date, this bid has not materialized. 
U.S. department store operator Nordstrom Inc's (N:JWN) attempt to go private also failed earlier this year, after banks balked at providing the necessary financing to the founding family members seeking to put together the deal.
SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE
Musk has said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose, and then cash out when they wanted.
But sources familiar with SpaceX told Reuters it is not clear how Musk would apply it to Tesla. Fidelity Investments, the major backer of SpaceX, did not invest in it through a special purpose vehicle, according to the sources.
Fidelity declined to comment, while SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
SpaceX only has a limited number of shareholders, who often choose to sell on their shares in the private market. 
By contrast, allowing thousands of Tesla shareholders to remain invested through a special purpose vehicle would essentially mean that shares in that new vehicle are publicly traded in some way.
Even if such a deal was cobbled together, it is not clear whether so-called ""liquidity events"", that Musk said he organizes at SpaceX every six months, would be sufficient for all existing Tesla investors to cash out.

""To have a deal of this size, that'd be unprecedented as far as I can remember,"" Kaplan said.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>",Inside Tesla's troubled New York solar factory,"By Salvador Rodriguez and Nichola Groom
SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s (O:TSLA) production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by assembly-line problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of CEO Elon Musk, eight former and current employees of both companies told Reuters.
Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla's partner in the joint venture, Panasonic (T:6752), to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla's ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.
The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla's cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk’s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since.
(For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2KjWlYU )
The ""Solar Roof"" produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging.
""Aesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,” said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. “That's the big issue.”
In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said ""hundreds"" of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were ""being scheduled for install.""
In California, the nation's leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state’s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That's about double the national average for solar systems.
Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype.
Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant.
“We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,“ the company said in the statement. “We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.”
The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs.
Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement.
It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee.
Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals.
“We believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,” the company said in a statement. 
Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million ""for additional specified scope costs,"" according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility’s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade.
Empire State Development, the state's economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters.
Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March.
""After investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,"" he said. ""It just does not look like it’s heading down that path.""
Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments.
None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing. 
Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment.
EQUIPMENT IN BOXES
Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company.
That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla’s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn't buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee.
“We have been entertaining outside customers,"" the employee said.
Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof.
JA Solar declined to comment.
Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said.
For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said.
MIXED REVIEWS
One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced.
It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems.
“It’s fantastic. I love it,” he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. “I'm a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.”
Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased. 
He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers.

""We've been begging Tesla for information,"" he said. “It's been extremely frustrating.""

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) has shifted ownership of its Polish and Irish subsidiaries from its London-based entity to its French unit, and will do so for seven more European branches, as it prepares for Britain's exit from the European Union.
HSBC France will also acquire the activities of seven European branches in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain, Europe's biggest bank said on Wednesday.
The move is aimed at ensuring HSBC can continue to serve its European customers ahead of Britain's exit from the EU in March 2019, after which British-based firms are expected to lose so-called passporting rights that allow them to sell financial services in the bloc.
HSBC has not yet begun transferring any of the up to 1,000 staff it has said could ultimately move to its French unit from Britain, Chief Executive John Flint told Reuters on Monday.
The change in its organizational structure in Europe shows HSBC putting its Brexit contingency plans into action, in a sign of how banks are increasingly not waiting for the outcome of negotiations between Britain and the EU as to how financial services will operate between the two parties.
While the HSBC branches and subsidiaries will still ultimately all be owned by its umbrella entity  HSBC Holdings , the move is significant in showing the bank pressing on with Brexit contingency plans.
HSBC executives have since the Brexit vote in June 2016 maintained that the bank will be among the last to have to make such moves because it has a fully-licensed French banking subsidiary rather than branches that other banks have had to convert.
Banks are choosing to go ahead with organizing their businesses such that even in the 'no-deal' scenario under which Britain crashes out of the EU without any agreements in place, they will still be able to serve European customers as before.
British rival Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) is planning three such subsidiaries in Europe, Reuters reported last month, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has made its Irish unit its new European hub while also shifting jobs to Frankfurt. [nL8N1UE1GK][nL4N1TY45C]

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 07:34AM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters grows revenue, sees Blackstone deal closing in fourth quarter","TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp on Wednesday reported a 2 percent rise in quarterly revenue and reaffirmed its 2018 forecast, saying it was on track for a ""solid"" year. The news and information provider reported second-quarter revenue of $1.31 billion, compared with $1.28 billion a year ago. Adjusted for special items, earnings were 17 cents per share, down from 19 cents per share a year ago.
Analysts had expected revenue of $1.31 billion and earnings of 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Thomson Reuters reported a 6-percent decline in operating profit to $204 million, which it said was primarily due to costs and investments ahead of the planned sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk business to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP.
Thomson Reuters agreed in January to sell a 55 percent stake in the Financial & Risk unit, which sells data and news primarily to financial customers, to Blackstone. It expects the deal to close early in the fourth quarter. 
Blackstone is making its biggest bet since the financial crisis with the $20-billion deal, which pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
In the quarter, the Financial & Risk business - now counted as a discontinued operation - grew revenues by 2 percent in constant currency to $1.55 billion. 
The company's legal business reported revenue of $882 million in the second quarter, up 2 percent when factoring out currency. The Tax & Accounting unit reported revenue of $359 million, up 4 percent when factoring out currency.
Reuters News reported $72 million in revenues, down 5 percent from a year earlier in constant currency.
Shares in Thomson Reuters have risen 12 percent since May, when they were trading at their lowest level since July 2015.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:42AM ET</span>",Ford to launch new basic SUV as part of China revival effort,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor (N:F) said on Wednesday it will launch in China early next year a new “entry-level” sport utility vehicle developed jointly with a local partner, as the U.S. automaker attempts to revive its slumping business in the world’s biggest auto market. 
The Ford Territory, developed with Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (SZ:000550) and available in three powertrain choices including a plug-in hybrid version, is intended to close a gap in its China strategy.
The new SUV is one of the 50 new or redesigned vehicles Ford has said it plans to launch in China starting this year and through 2025, which include the redesigned Ford Focus car due to hit showrooms later this year. 
It will make it possible for Ford to compete with indigenous Chinese automakers such as Geely [GEELY.UL] and Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) that are pumping out hot-selling compact SUVs with competitive quality and lower price tags.
Ford did not discuss on Wednesday a specific pricing strategy for the Territory, but two individuals familiar with the new car said it will likely have a price tag of around 150,000 yuan ($21,990.27).
The car puts the company in a segment it has never competed in before and which is witnessing surging demand from smaller, but fast-growing interior cities across China that indigenous Chinese automakers have capitalized on to grow rapidly. 
“Clearly this’s been a difficult year for Ford in China. But this new vehicle is part of our growth plan that will improve our business in China and return us to profitability and set us on a growth trajectory again in China,” Ford’s Asia-Pacific and China chief Peter Fleet told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. 
“This isn’t going to be an instantaneous turnaround of our business in China, but you’re going to see a series of actions, a series of products and a series of moves that will return us to being a very successful growth business in China.” 
SALES SLUMP
Ford’s business in China has been faltering since last year. Its vehicle sales tumbled 25 percent in the first half of 2018 from the same period a year ago to 400,443 vehicles, which led to a second-quarter pre-tax loss of $483 million for its China operations.
According to consultancy LMC Automotive, it was Ford’s biggest first-half percentage decline in sales volume since starting operations in China in 2001.
Ford blames its weak China business on an ageing model lineup that is awaiting an overhaul. 
The sales slump is also exacerbated by the impact of China’s trade tensions with the United States, a problem that has hit Ford's premium brand Lincoln hard since all Lincoln cars sold now in China are imported from the United States and face a 40 percent tariff Beijing levies on U.S.-made cars in retaliation for U.S. trade actions.
PROFITABILITY BOOST
Fleet said the new SUV, which will be available in gasoline, so-called mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions, has been designed as an entry vehicle “for younger families in emerging cities” of China. 
The Dearborn Michigan-based car maker needs a product such as the low-priced Territory because the company is “running a scale business” and needs to expand its market share and revenue base, he said.
Ford officials indicated late last month that an array of sport utility vehicles it plans to launch in China next year and in 2020 will give the company what one described as a ""real boost"" in China.
""In terms of pricing, the new SUV appears to be positioned in between its sub-compact SUV and compact SUV. Given the styling and its positioning, it should be able to generate some good volume,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""It should contribute to the company’s effort to turnaround sales."" 
To compete in the market for low-priced, no-frills cars, Ford’s competitors such as General Motors (N:GM) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) have created local China-only brands of their own, such as Baojun and Venucia, respectively. Those brands complete head on with the likes of Geely and Great Wall's Haval. 
Ford is now coming up with such entry-level cars within the Ford brand and is likely to offer more models in the future to meet demand for no-frills cars.
“This vehicle has been engineered to Ford DNA standards. You are going to see that in the quality of the ride, the technologies offered, and the vehicle’s design,” Fleet said. 

Ford has ""no need or desire"" to offer the Territory as part of ""some other new brand”, Fleet said.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Fox's formal bid opens final chapter of Sky battle with Comcast,"By Ben Martin, Carl O'Donnell and Shashwat Awasthi
(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) has triggered a 46 day deadline to raise its bid for Sky (L:SKYB) in a battle with Comcast (L:CMCSA) for control of the British pay-TV group.
Under British takeover rules, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox now has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast's 14.75 pound per share offer for Sky, which values the broadcaster 25.9 billion pounds ($33 billion), after it formalized its own 14 pounds per share bid.
Comcast gatecrashed Fox's attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own earlier this year and the U.S. cable giant's latest, higher offer, which it submitted in July, has been recommended to shareholders by the broadcaster's independent directors.
Fox posted its formal offer document, without improving its price, on Tuesday, setting in motion a timetable to end the uncertainty over Sky's future by triggering a 46-day period during which both Fox and Comcast can lift their offers. 
If the situation is not resolved by then, Britain's Takeover Panel can run an auction to bring the complex and long-winded transatlantic takeover battle for Sky to an end.
However, Fox may opt to walk away from the Sky deal rather than taking on Comcast, people familiar with the matter said.
Sky shares were up 1 percent at 15.355 pounds on Wednesday, signaling that investors expect the bidding war to continue.
In the document, Fox said it was switching from a scheme of arrangement to an offer. That means it can choose to lower its acceptance threshold from 75 percent of Sky's minority shareholders to a simple majority of all the broadcaster's shares, including its own 39 percent stake. 
""Flipping to an offer affords Fox more flexibility should they wish to come back with a higher number,"" analysts at Olivetree Financial said. ""A scheme is cumbersome as you would constantly need to co-ordinate your actions and intentions with the Sky board.""
ADVISER PAY
Fox also said it expects to pay its advisers, which include  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Centerview Partners, about 242 million pounds if its Sky bid succeeds.
Since submitting its first 10.75 pound per share bid for Sky in December 2016, Fox has agreed to sell the bulk of its TV and film assets, including its Sky stake, to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS).
Comcast had been vying with Disney for the Fox assets but last month dropped its pursuit to focus on buying Sky.
In a separate announcement, Sky acknowledged Fox's offer document and said its independent committee would respond to the offer within 14 days.
The Takeover Panel, which regulates merger and acquisitions in Britain, ruled earlier this year that Disney would have to make an offer for the rest of Sky if its deal for the Fox assets completes before either Comcast or Fox acquire the UK broadcaster.
The regulator said last month that the level of any mandatory Disney offer should be 14 pounds a share, the same price as Fox's current offer.

But the Takeover Appeal Board, an independent body, said on Wednesday that ""several interested parties"" had lodged appeals against the ruling and that it would meet to consider their petitions.

Le Monde quoted an unnamed senior Air France-KLM official as saying that no decision had yet been taken and that the final decision lay with the company's board of directors. 
Air France-KLM has been hunting for a new boss since the abrupt departure of chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac in May after staff rejected a pay offer aimed at ending costly strikes.
Asked to comment on the report in Le Monde, an Air France-KLM spokeswoman said: ""The appointment process for the new Air France-KLM governance is underway and is continuing. No decision has been made.""
The French state is the biggest shareholder in Air France-KLM with a stake of about 14 percent. Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.
Senior French officials familiar with President Emmanuel Macron's thinking have said he is open to considering a non-French national to lead the group for the first time.
The appointment is seen as a test of Macron's resolve regarding the state taking a lighter touch on the economy.
Anne-Marie Couderc, the interim chairman of Air France KLM, said in a memorandum last month seen by Reuters that the airline hoped to have a new leadership team up and running by September.

Air France KLM on Wednesday reported higher traffic figures for July.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>","Bumper U.S. earnings, China stimulus hopes keep world shares at one-week high","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares held near one-week highs on Wednesday, supported by robust U.S. earnings and expectations of additional stimulus from Beijing that could temper the impact of China's simmering trade dispute with the United States.
U.S. equities now stand less than half a percent off record highs hit in January, testifying to the strength of the world's biggest economy and corporate sector, which has seen average earnings grow 23 percent in the second quarter. 
The picture in the rest of the world is less rosy, given slower economic momentum and the greater vulnerability of other big economies - from China to Germany - to U.S. trade levies. Washington is preparing to start collecting tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods.
But for now many markets, especially in Asia, are supported by the U.S. tech rally that recently saw iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) become the world's first $1 trillion company.
MSCI's index of stocks from 47 countries was marginally higher while Asian equities (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.3 percent, led by tech-heavy Taiwan <.MITW00000PUS>. Japan's Nikkei ticked up 0.4 percent.
""Everyone is just focusing on U.S. earnings... and feeling the U.S. market will remain robust despite trade uncertainties, and that's the main driver right now,"" said Christophe Barraud, a strategist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. 
Barraud said autumn could bring a reality check in the form of slower U.S. growth indicators, Italian politics, Britain's Brexit negotiations with the European Union, U.S. mid-term elections and - above all - the risk of trade war escalation.
""Support from U.S. earnings could last until the end of August and when people are back in September they will focus more on other events....(The trade war) is not a short-term conflict about a trade deficit but a longer-term story."" 
Indeed, support from company earnings is less evident elsewhere -- a raft of weak results pushed European shares to trade just below flat. 
Average European second quarter earnings growth is running at 9.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, healthy but significantly lagging Wall Street.
Chinese equities meanwhile fell 0.4 percent as news of the additional U.S. tariffs overshadowed strong trade data that showed exports rose more than expected in July. A rise in imports also suggested Chinese domestic demand remains resilient.
Trade fears were tempered somewhat by signs Beijing is unveiling further measures to support growth, such as increasing infrastructure spending and tweaking its monetary policy stance.. That lifted the yuan further off recent 15-month lows to the dollar.
Chotaro Morita, a strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said Beijing's policy support was ""starting to give some support to other major markets"". 
But he predicted the impact would be limited. ""The reason they have to do so is escalating trade tensions so you can't expect much upside.""
S&P500 equity futures indicated a flat Wall Street opening.
BREXIT AND STERLING
While most currency markets were relatively calm, sterling came under renewed pressure, falling to 11-month lows against the euro, dollar and yen.
Its woes stem from mounting concerns that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a trade deal in place, raising fears of a serious hit to the economy. With the government still far off agreeing an exit deal with Brussels, currency traders are increasingly edgy.
Market players said they were seeing increasing moves by investors to hedge sterling risks.
""A lot of companies can't wait until the (Brexit) outcome is clear... Many of them are trying to hedge against a drop in sterling,"" Barraud of Market Securities said. 
Elsewhere the dollar's recent mini-rally appeared to have run out of steam, offering some respite to most emerging currencies including the yuan. The Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, fell another 0.7 percent, though it stayed well off recent record lows 
On oil markets, Brent futures held firm around $75 a barrel as U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns of looming crude supply shortages.

Brent is up 2 percent this week.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 04:56AM ET</span>","Seeking new growth drivers, Samsung plans $22 billion spending on new tech","SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Group will invest 25 trillion won ($22 billion) in artificial intelligence, 5G mobile technology, electronic components for autos, and the biopharmaceutical business in pursuit of new growth areas, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said on Wednesday.
In flagging specific areas of investment, the plan is the first of its kind for the conglomerate and suggests more emphasis than usual on expanding into new segments as its core semiconductor and smartphone businesses show signs of weakness.
The investment is also part of a bigger 180 trillion won three-year plan to create jobs and secure fresh revenue streams, providing the first hint of direction for Samsung since group heir Jay Y. Lee was released from jail in February on a suspended sentence following a conviction for bribery. He is appealing the conviction.
""The total investment size is not surprising. But Samsung can be more active in M&As to do better at AI or 5G, when Lee is fully back to his business,"" Greg Roh, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities, said.
Samsung Electronics said the announcement followed ""many months of deliberations and review"" by the group.
Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones and the group's flagship company, did not provide a breakdown of the figures but said it will provide the funds for most of the investment.
It said the group plans to significantly expand artificial intelligence (AI) research capability, increasing the number of advanced AI researchers to 1,000 across its global AI centers, and heavily invest in biopharmaceuticals.
""Samsung has seen strong growth from both its contract manufacturing and biosimilar businesses. It will continue to invest heavily in the businesses, including developing and manufacturing biosimilars,"" the statement said.
The announcement sent shares in contract drugmaker Samsung BioLogics (KS:207940) up 7 percent. Shares in the group's information technology services affiliate Samsung SDS (KS:018260) rose nearly 6 percent.
Samsung Electronics shares were little changed.
The 180 trillion won plan includes capital spending as well as research and development in chips and displays and marks a 6 percent increase from its spending over the past three years.
Of the total, 130 trillion won will be spent in South Korea, and is expected to create 40,000 jobs, or 20,000 more than its previous hiring plans, Samsung said.
The announcement comes after South Korea's finance minister met Jay Y. Lee on Monday and called for help in job creation, a priority for the country's President Moon Jae-in.
Lee has sought to expand Samsung's business into automotive electronics components. He signed off on an $8 billion purchase of U.S.-based Harman International in 2016.
But the expansion drive has since stalled after the political scandal that led to Lee's conviction and a shake up of top management.
Samsung Group has 62 affiliates, with total assets of 399 trillion won, according to the country's Fair Trade Commission.

Seemingly out of the blue, Elon Musk proclaimed that he might pull his money-losing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. off the market. Taking the electric-car company private at the price he touted would amount to an $82 billion valuation, a monumental sum that left many investors wondering: Is this a joke?
It wasn’t.
Musk, the enfant terrible of Tesla and SpaceX, has defied the odds before. But Tuesday’s gambit -- unleashed in tweet after tweet over the next 2 hours and 40 minutes -- opened a new chapter in one of the most tempestuous business stories of our time.
Even fans seemed unsure whether Musk could pull this off -- or, if he does, where that will leave Tesla. Only a week ago, the company with a seemingly unshakable base of firm believers and equally fierce legion of detractors recorded another huge loss after burning through hundreds of millions of dollars.
‘Better Environment’
Indeed, Musk’s initial tweet, sent roughly half an hour after news emerged that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had built a stake in Tesla worth about $2 billion, was the latest in a series of unusual maneuvers that have thrust the executive into the public spotlight.
He’s made no secret that he has little patience for his naysayers. In a May conference call, the CEO blithely said that if investors were concerned about the volatility of Tesla’s stock, they shouldn’t own the shares.
“The reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best,” Musk, 47, wrote in an email to employees. He said wild swings in the carmaker’s stock price are a “major distraction” to Tesla workers, who are all shareholders. And he said that being public “puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term.”
Separately, Tesla, which has picked Shanghai as the location of its new gigafactory, is counting on the city’s government to help obtain loans from some of the biggest Chinese banks to fund the planned facility, according to people familiar with the matter.
At least four lenders have begun the appraisal process on the loans, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Some banks have signed confidentiality agreements with the Shanghai government and Tesla, and are in advanced negotiations, they said.
Biggest Buyout
To take Tesla private, Musk would have to pull off the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing Texas electric utility TXU’s in 2007. And Tesla doesn’t fit the typical profile of a company that can raise tens of billions of dollars of debt to fund such a deal.
It’s lost money on an operating basis every year since going public and has been burning through billions of dollars amid the struggle to iron out production issues with its Model 3 sedan. Neither Musk’s tweets nor his blog post make mention of how the company would pay for it.
Tesla closed at $379.57, up 11 percent from Monday. Viewed differently, though, the stock ended the day about 10 percent below the $420 price Musk said he’d pay to take the company private, highlighting the doubts traders have about his ability to pull the deal off.
“The market doesn’t believe him,” said David Kudla, the CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which is betting against Tesla. “His credibility has come into question over a number of things. If this were real, you’d expect the stock to go closer to $420 a share than it has.”
Most major buyouts also require a trip to the junk bond markets, where Tesla has fallen out of favor. Its inaugural offering of the notes last year fell below par almost immediately and never recovered. The bonds rallied Tuesday, but at just 92.4 cents on the dollar, they too reflect investor skepticism. If the deal were to actually go through, creditors would reap -- thanks to a clause in the bond contract -- a price of 101 cents on the dollar.
“Funding $50 billion-plus for a negative free cash flow business would be difficult, if not extraordinary,” said Joel Levington, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
‘Lot of Noise’
Musk has a long history of bristling at the amount of scrutiny Tesla endures from investors and the media.
In an interview with Bloomberg News in January 2015, he spoke of the benefits of running his closely held rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and his frustrations with having taken Tesla public in June 2010.
“There’s a lot of noise that surrounds a public company and people are constantly commenting on the share price and value,” he said in 2015. “Being public definitely increases the management overhead for any given enterprise.”
SpaceX Model
Musk pointed to SpaceX as a model for how Tesla could be privately held. He said in a tweet his hope is that all current investors in the electric-car company would stick with it by buying into a “special purpose fund,” and said that this has been done through a Fidelity investment in the rocket manufacturer.
Taking Tesla private “makes a ton of sense” from Musk’s perspective, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures. Though even he -- one of Tesla’s biggest bulls -- assigns long odds to the CEO pulling off this deal.
“Musk does not want to run a public company,” Munster said. “Our guess is there is a 1 in 3 chance he can actually pull this off.”

Many mining stocks have lost steam this year as metals markets weakened in response to concerns about trade tensions and uncertainty about Chinese demand. (FTNMX1770)
Other producers have also warned of the impact of cost inflation, while Glencore's share price has come under additional pressure from its exposure to political risk in Democratic Republic of Congo and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.
Glencore's first-half core profits of $8.3 billion, up 23 percent, just missed a consensus forecast of $8.5 billion.
Adjusted earnings before interest and tax from its marketing division of $1.5 billion were in line.
Glencore shares were down around 2 percent in early trade.
CEO Ivan Glasenberg said in a statement market conditions were likely to remain volatile and the focus remained on ""creating value for shareholders through the disciplined allocation of long-term capital"".
Glencore had recovered strongly from the commodity crash of 2015-16 as the market anticipated it would lead the pack in deal-making and increasing its exposure to metals used in electric vehicles.
The focus this year has shifted.
In July, Glencore announced it would buy back shares worth $1 billion days after an announcement that the United States had demanded Glencore hand over documents about its business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria as part of a corruption investigation.
Many analysts still regard the stock as undervalued.

ABN said it would focus its Corporate and Institutional Banking (CIB) division to higher-yielding activities, such as lending to Dutch corporations, clearing and private equity.
""To improve profitability, capital allocated to CIB will be reduced. This will predominantly be in global sectors, mainly in trade and commodity finance,"" Chief Executive Kees van Dijkhuizen said in a statement.
ABN in December last year said it would weigh the future of its corporate bank, as new regulations hurt profitability by requiring banks to hold more capital for assets with a relatively high risk.
The cut in corporate activities will reduce the risk-weighted assets on ABN's balance sheet by 5 billion euros ($5.81 billion) by 2020, the bank said, to 34 billion euros.
The division had around 2,600 employees at the end of June and delivered 11 percent of ABN's total net profit in the second quarter.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>",China shares resume skid as fresh U.S. tariffs overshadow stimulus pledges,"By Andrew Galbraith and Winni Zhou
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's stock markets sank on Wednesday as the U.S. said it would slap tariffs on more Chinese goods before month end, overshadowing Beijing's pledges to spur growth and cushion the economy from what is shaping up to be a protracted trade war.
The Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) fell 0.3 percent, and the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) was 0.6 percent lower. 
Both indexes posted their biggest daily gains since 2016 on Tuesday, rebounding from four days of heavy losses and raising hopes that their dizzying trade-induced slide into correction territory may be easing up.
Stocks remained in the red despite stronger-than-expected July export data which appeared to show that an earlier round of U.S. tariffs has yet to have a significant impact on global demand for China's goods. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index (HSI) gained 0.3 percent and the China Enterprises index (HSCE) was up 0.5 percent.
Attention in Hong Kong was on the market debut of China Tower Corp Ltd (HK:0788), the world's largest initial public offering in two years. The company's shares were little changed as trade war fears weighed on sentiment.
Chinese stock markets are highly sensitive to changes in liquidity and have generally been quick to respond to even vague pledges of government pump priming in the past.
But the flurry of punitive trade blows from the Trump administration and little sign of compromise from either side has left many investors doubtful of a sustained turnaround for shares in the near term.
""China’s monetary and fiscal policies have shifted from prudent to growth supportive. The ongoing and protracted trade tension has elevated uncertainties which prompted more concerns over downside risks to growth,"" Christy Tan, head of markets strategy and research, Asia, at National Australia Bank, said in a note.
Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. said it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods from Aug. 23, and Chinese media have resorted to personal attacks against President Donald Trump. 
The measures come after Washington slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month. 
Escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war has threatened to put more pressure on the already cooling Chinese economy, and has prompted a series of growth boosting measures from Beijing.
Last week, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party promised more flexible and effective policy to boost growth, and authorities are taking steps to offer more credit at cheaper interest rates to small and medium-sized firms which are seen as most vulnerable.
The plans appear to be offering respite for some investment-intensive companies that were badly mauled in the broad based market selloff in recent weeks.
Shares in China Railway Construction Corp Ltd (SS:601186) rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday, a day after jumping the daily 10 percent limit on news that China would boost its fixed asset investment in railways to 800 billion yuan ($116.85 billion) in 2018, an increase of 9.3 percent over its original plan.
Beijing is also taking steps to ease financing constraints on borrowers, which have been fueled in part by a multi-year campaign to reduce excessive financial risks and slow a rapid build-up in debt. 
On Wednesday, the state planner said that China would use monetary policy such as targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks to support debt-to-equity swaps this year as it looks to lower corporate leverage ratios.
STRONGER YUAN
While China's stock markets remain fragile, there are hopes among global investors that Beijing is moving to stabilize the yuan currency.
After allowing the yuan to fall for eight straight weeks against the U.S. dollar, triggering global fears China may be embarking on a ""stealth devaluation"", there are signs that authorities are now attempting to put a floor under the currency and discourage bets on further losses that could trigger capital outflows.
The yuan strengthened on Wednesday, as the central bank guided the currency higher with its daily fixing. The upbeat trade data appeared to have little impact.
A Bloomberg report, citing unnamed sources, said that China's central bank on Monday urged some banks to prevent ""herd behavior"" and momentum-chasing moves in the foreign-exchange market.
On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint of the yuan's daily trading band  at 6.8313 per dollar, 118 pips firmer than the previous fixing of 6.8431.
The currency opened at 6.8140 per dollar on the spot market  and was changing hands at 6.8217 as of 0336 GMT, 61 pips firmer than the previous late session close of 6.8278.
The central bank set a reserve requirement ratio of 20 percent from Monday for financial institutions settling foreign exchange forward dollar sales to clients, effectively raising the cost for investors shorting the yuan.
While many analysts still expect the currency to test the level of 7 to the U.S. dollar, Ken Hu, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco in Hong Kong said he maintained a more positive outlook in the longer term.
""We see limited depreciation pressure on the RMB in the near future and are confident that Chinese regulatory authorities have sufficient tools to manage any exaggerated one-way market move,"" he said in a note.
""We believe that strong domestic demand in China provides enough buffer to counter potential impact from rising trade tariffs,"" he added.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>","Undeterred by taxes, IKEA puts together cheap India pricing","By Subrat Patnaik
HYDERABAD (Reuters) - IKEA will do things differently in India after it opens its first store in the nation on Thursday, as it deals with higher taxes on imported goods and looks to woo cost-conscious shoppers unaccustomed to the company's DIY furniture assembly style.
The Swedish furniture retailer is pushing into new countries in South America and Asia as growth slows in its traditional strongholds, including Europe. It is betting on India with its growing middle class, likely aiming to avoid a repeat of the high pricing that initially hit sales in China and Australia.
The company, which has flagged import duties in India as a big challenge as it tries to keep prices low, has to source at least 30 percent of its raw materials locally within five years of operations in the country as per Indian regulation. IKEA already sources about a fifth of its global supplies from India.
Nevertheless, IKEA still needed to tweak its playbook.
The 400,000 square feet (37,160 square meter) store in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad will offer 1,000 products including cutlery, stuffed toys, hangers and container boxes priced under 200 Indian rupees ($2.91) - cheaper than in most countries.
A quick check on IKEA's newly launched India website showed popular products looked cheaper than in the United States. For instance, in India, the white variation of the company's best-selling Billy bookcase is cheaper by a fifth than in the United States and the dark-grey Ektorp sofa is priced 30 percent lower.
""IKEA seems to have managed to understand the Indian consumer and price its products accordingly,"" said Sowmya Adiraju, an analyst at research firm Euromonitor International.
But she added that the target audience for many IKEA products right now, especially for big-ticket items, seemed to be the wealthier end of middle class.
""It would be interesting to see how IKEA does justice to its vision of 'furniture for all',"" she said.
To satisfy the Indian penchant for ready-made furniture, IKEA has set up a 150 member task force to help customers assemble furniture and is also partnering with UrbanClap, an app that connects people with a variety of service providers, including carpenters.
UrbanClap charges customers about 250 rupees ($3.64) for a 30-minute carpentry job. In comparison, TaskRabbit, the services platform acquired by IKEA in 2017, charges U.S. shoppers a minimum of $36 for any installation job.
IKEA has so far only said it will charge more than UrbanClap if its in-house assemblers do the job.
NAMASTE!
IKEA's debut in India has been a long time coming. The company hit snags a few years ago after the government rejected its request to relax rules on buying goods locally.
Meanwhile, competition for IKEA in the country has increased as online furniture startups such as Pepperfry and UrbanLadder have become popular in large cities. The overall furniture market, though, remains largely dominated by unorganized retail and local vendors.
IKEA had initially planned to open 25 stores across the nation by 2025. In June, the company said it was likely to open more stores, possibly some smaller stores in cities to complement their typically larger showrooms in suburbs.
The company has bought land in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurugram, and is also looking to expand into Surat, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Pune.
Retail sales at IKEA Group's company-owned stores increased by 4 percent last year. In comparison, sales in India's homeware and home furnishing stores grew about 9 percent, according to Euromonitor.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",China Tower ends flat in HK debut morning as weak mood weighs on biggest IPO in two years,"By Julie Zhu and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Tower Corp Ltd's (HK:0788) shares were little changed on their debut in Hong Kong on Wednesday, with escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions weighing on investor sentiment toward the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in two years.
Coming after a string of weak IPO debuts in Hong Kong, China Tower's performance could influence upcoming listings such as Sinochem Energy. It may also weigh on the city's attempts to sustain its record fundraising from stock floats.
Shares of China Tower, the world's largest mobile telecommunications tower operator, only edged as high as HK$1.29 before ending unchanged from their IPO price at HK$1.26 by the city's lunchtime trading break. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) was trading 0.42 percent higher at noon.
Analysts said China Tower holding above its issue price would bode well for the wider market.
""Long term institutions will park their funds in firms like China Tower - its the sort of stock you wouldn't expect to see any explosive jump in and it won't attract much retail speculative interest,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist of First Shanghai Securities.
Also debuting on Wednesday was Nasdaq-listed  BeiGene Ltd  (HK:6160), the second firm to float under new rules in Hong Kong designed to attract biotechs. Shares in the firm, which raised $903 million after pricing its shares at HK$108 each, slipped to HK$105, down 2.7 percent, in morning trade and ended at HK$106.8 at noon.
Under rules introduced earlier this year, biotech firms without revenue or profit can apply to list.  Ascletis Pharma Inc  (HK:1672), a maker of anti-viral and cancer drugs, last week became this first to list under the new regime, but has seen its shares fall 16.1 percent below their IPO price since debut day.
Companies have now raised $22.4 billion in Hong Kong through listings this year, the city's best-ever seven-month performance, data from Thomson Reuters showed.
But the Hang Seng Index has dropped almost 16 percent from its January peak amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions, and several recent listings, such as that of Chinese smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), have struggled to maintain their IPO prices.
""Investors are becoming more cautious and selective toward new listings,"" said Ben Kwong, head of research and executive director at KGI Asia. ""The overall pace of the IPO market will slow down a bit and listing candidates may try to avoid this weak sentiment when they can't demand higher valuations.""
MOBILE GIANT
China Tower priced its IPO last week at the bottom of an indicative range, raising $6.9 billion in the world's biggest listing since  Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd 's (HK:1658) $7.63 billion Hong Kong float in 2016.
The company operates 1.9 million tower sites and had 2.8 million tenants at the end of June, its IPO prospectus showed. It was formed in 2014 from the tower operations of China's three state-backed telecoms providers - China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom - to reduce duplication.
China Tower Chairman Tong Jilu, speaking at the open of trading in Hong Kong, said the fact that the company could go public after just three years of operation showed its quality was recognized by investors.
""I'm very happy that the international offering of our IPO has attracted global long-long funds, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds as well as high-quality Chinese investors,"" he said.
China Tower's operating revenue in 2017 rose nearly 23 percent to 68.7 billion yuan ($10.07 billion), while profit rose more than 25 times to 1.9 billion yuan. Its three telecoms shareholders accounted for almost all its revenue last year.
China Tower's float is the latest move in a government push to inject new life into bloated state-owned enterprises by encouraging greater private capital investment.
Sinochem Energy, a unit of state-owned Sinochem Group, has filed for a $2 billion Hong Kong IPO as the group seeks to raise capital for a shift to higher-value businesses.

Gump's Corp, which was founded in 1861 near Union square in San Francisco, said it had been navigating an overwhelmingly difficult retail environment. More recently, the company established Gump's By Mail to sell goods online.
Gump's Holdings LLC, which owns Gump's Corp and Gump's By Mail, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 on Aug. 3, the parent company said in a statement on Tuesday.
The company said it would continue its efforts to sell all or part of its business as a going concern.
The U.S. retail scene has been swept up in a wave of bankruptcies, with more than 10 filings last year, as the sector faces mounting competition from online marketplaces.
""The Gump's store is an institution beloved of generations of San Franciscans, and customers around the country are captivated by its distinctive, elegant products from around the world. We will continue to seek a source of capital to enable this storied brand to continue to serve its devoted customers,"" Chief Operating Officer Tony Lopez said.
The company expects its cash on hand and debtor-in-possession financing to provide it with liquidity to maintain value in its assets.
Gump's Holdings listed assets and liabilities in the range of $10 million to $50 million, according to a filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada.
Hilco and Gordon Brothers have joint ventured to act as liquidators for Gump's merchandise while Garman Turner Gordon LLP is the legal adviser to the company.

Customers can place orders via Amazon's Prime Now app and ask to have groceries loaded into their car upon arrival at a store, the company said in a statement. The service is now available in Sacramento, California, and in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with plans to launch in other cities this year.
The world's largest online retailer is working to crack the $800 billion market for U.S. groceries by popularizing delivery from Whole Foods stores, and now pickup. Cheaper than delivery, pickup has long been touted by far larger grocery companies Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which have been rolling out the service to thousands of stores.
Whole Foods has 467 U.S. stores and roughly 1 percent share of the fragmented U.S. grocery market. Amazon bought the chain last year in a $13.7 billion deal, and since then it has lowered prices and added delivery services so it could begin capturing shoppers' weekly spending on groceries.
Customers of the new pickup service will get designated parking spots at stores, Amazon said. They must be members of Amazon's subscription club Prime to use the service.
Amazon said pickup in an hour is free for orders of at least $35, while pickup in 30 minutes costs $4.99.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","Toshiba posts record quarterly profit on chip sale, outlook unclear","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502) reported a record quarterly net profit on Wednesday, thanks to the $18 billion sale of its flash memory chip business earlier this year to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.
But the conglomerate did not say where its future growth will come from without full ownership of the prized chip business. Its remaining main businesses such as energy and social infrastructure are struggling to fill the void left by the chips unit that accounted for 90 percent of its operating profit last year.
Toshiba posted a net profit of 1.02 trillion yen ($9.16 billion) for the April-June quarter, up from 50.33 billion yen a year before, as it booked 966 billion yen in gains from the deal to sell the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips.
That was above a consensus estimate of 570.29 billion yen from four analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Toshiba maintained its profit forecast for the year ending March at 1.07 trillion yen, versus a consensus estimate of 1.11 trillion yen from 12 analysts.
The chip unit sale helped save Toshiba from years of financial crisis brought about by accounting scandals and billions of dollars in cost-overruns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.
Under the deal with the Bain consortium, Toshiba repurchased 40 percent of the unit.
Toshiba had promised to share proceeds from the chip sale, addressing calls for larger returns from activist shareholders who participated in a $5.4 billion share issue late last year that helped the company to avoid a delisting.
Following up on the pledge, the company unveiled a higher-than-expected $6.3 billion stock buyback in June.

As of end-March, more than 70 percent of Toshiba shareholders were overseas institutions, regarded as more vocal than their Japanese counterparts in making demands of management.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that its iPhones do not listen to users without their consent and do not allow third-party apps to do so either, after lawmakers asked the company if its devices were invading users' privacy.
Representatives Greg Walden, Marsha Blackburn, Gregg Harper and Robert Latta wrote to Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc chief executive Larry Page in July, citing concerns about reports that smartphones could “collect ‘non-triggered’ audio data from users’ conversations near a smartphone in order to hear a ‘trigger’ phrase, such as ‘Okay Google’ or ‘Hey Siri.’”
In a letter to Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Apple said iPhones do not record audio while listening for Siri wakeup commands and Siri does not share spoken words. Apple said it requires users to explicitly approve microphone access and that apps must display a clear signal that they are listening.
The letters, in which lawmakers cited reports suggesting third-party applications had access to and used ‘non-triggered’ data without users' knowledge, followed congressional hearings in April into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc’s privacy practices, which included testimony by its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 
Alphabet did not respond to questions about whether it had replied to lawmakers. Apple declined to comment beyond its letter, which was seen by Reuters.
A spokeswoman for the Republican majority on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said “both companies have been cooperative thus far. The Committee looks forward to reviewing and analyzing the responses as we consider next steps.""
Apple wrote that it had removed apps from its App Store over privacy violations but declined to say whether it had ever banned a developer. It also said it was up to developers to notify users when an app was removed for privacy reasons.
""Apple does not and cannot monitor what developers do with the customer data they have collected, or prevent the onward transfer of that data, nor do we have the ability to ensure a developer's compliance with their own privacy policies or local law,"" Apple wrote. 

The iPhone maker's App Store has generated $100 billion in revenue for developers over the past decade. Apple told lawmakers in its letter that it rejected about 36,000 apps from among the 100,000 submitted each week for violations of its guidelines.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 08:36PM ET</span>","Elon Musk says taking Tesla private is 'best path,' shares jump","By Alexandria Sage and Sonam Rai
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday he is considering taking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc private in what would be the largest deal of its type, moving the electric car maker out of the glare of Wall Street as it goes through a period of rapid growth under tight financial constraints.
""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk said on Twitter. At $420 per share, a deal would be worth $72 billion overall. 
In a letter to Tesla employees published more than an hour later on the company's blog, Musk explained that going private would be ""the best path forward."" Such a move - over which no final decision had been made - would let Tesla ""operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,"" he wrote.
Tesla shares closed up 11 percent at $379.57, slightly below their all-time high.
Asked on Twitter whether Musk would continue to be CEO under such a scenario, he replied there would be ""no change."" 
Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his money-losing, debt-laden company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla's valuation higher than that of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
The company is still working its way out of what Musk called ""production hell"" at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company's profitability rests. 
The Silicon Valley company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals to follow suit next year.
Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown. 
Going private is one way to avoid close scrutiny by the public market as Musk and the company face those challenges. Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk.
""Musk does not want to run a public company,"" said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, as Tesla's ambitious mission makes it ""difficult to accommodate investors' quarterly expectations."" 
Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company. He said in his letter to employees he did not seek to expand his ownership. 
A price of $420 per share would represent a nearly 23 percent premium to Tesla's closing price on Monday, which gave the company a market value of about $58 billion. 
In his letter, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla. He said he hoped all current investors would remain were the company to go private.
He made no mention in his tweets nor his letter where the funding for a deal would come from, and the letter did not discuss funding for the plan.
Like any other investor, Musk is beholden to securities laws and several securities attorneys told Reuters he potentially could face lawsuits if it was proven he did not have secure financing at the time of his tweet.
The stock move could give Tesla some debt relief. It drove $2.3 billion of convertible debt past the level at which investors can swap it for stock at a profit; if that happens Tesla will not have to pay back the debt with cash.
(GRAPHIC-Market value of Tesla, Ford, GM: http://tmsnrt.rs/2n4mFjh)
BIGGEST GO-PRIVATE DEAL 
If Musk were to succeed in taking Tesla private, it would be the largest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the record set by the $45 billion deal for Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy in 2014.
Raising both the debt and equity required for such a deal would be a challenge. Many major Wall Street bankers contacted by Reuters said on condition of anonymity they were not aware of Musk's plans ahead of his tweets, and several expressed skepticism that a leveraged buyout of Tesla could be financed given the company's negative cash flow.
""It's unfathomable to me that anyone would finance the acquisition of such a liability-laden company that is losing so much money and have massive capex requirements going forward,"" said Mark Spiegel, portfolio manager of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, who holds a short position in Tesla and has been a vocal critic of Musk on Twitter.
The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) or major technology investment funds such as SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund, bankers said. 
China's Tencent Holdings, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner.
Such foreign sources of capital would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which looks closely at deals for potential national security risks.
Earlier on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia's PIF had bought a minority stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla.
UNORTHODOX ANNOUNCEMENT
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on Musk's tweet, but the agency allows companies to use social media outlets like Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules if investors are alerted about which social media outlets will be used.
Tesla alerted investors in a 2013 SEC filing that they should follow Musk's Twitter feed for ""additional information"" about the company. There is no reference to Musk's Twitter account on the company's investor relations page under ""investor communication,"" although Tesla's Twitter feed is included.
In his letter to employees, Musk wrote that, ""as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.""
A short squeeze is a trading scenario that occurs from time to time in heavily shorted stocks, when bearish traders are forced to buy shares to avoid big losses - something that ends up pushing the stock only higher.
Short interest in Tesla on Tuesday stood at nearly $13 billion, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) on Tuesday posted a second-quarter comparable sales decline of 6.1 percent in North America and cut its forecast for the coming months, as a heated spat between the pizza chain and its founder dragged on profits.
Papa John's estimated its full-year comparable sales will slip between 7 and 10 percent and lowered profit expectations, citing fallout from the company's acrimonious split with former Chairman John Schnatter.
Schnatter, the public face of the company and its largest shareholder, was ousted last month following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call.
Negative publicity surrounding the incident depressed July traffic in North America, the company said in a statement, noting that it was hard to predict how long and how badly that would affect sales.
Shares of Papa John's closed down nearly 3 percent, and slumped an additional 10 percent after the bell. The stock has lost 48.2 percent of its value over the last 12 months.
The company said it now expected to earn $1.30 to $1.80 per share, down from its previous estimate of $2.40 to $2.60.
In a statement following the chain's results, Schnatter blasted Chief Executive Steve Ritchie for the company's declining performance and vowed to continue to fight for the company he had founded.
""Instead of addressing the real and fundamental issues ... the company is trying to deflect attention from the source of the problem — management's ongoing failures with regard to financial performance – and blame me for its problems,"" Schnatter said.

Schnatter's image has been removed from Papa John's promotional material and the company launched a third-party audit into the brand's culture. In its Tuesday quarterly filing, Papa John's estimated the costs of these measures at $30 million to $50 million for the rest of the year.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 08:34PM ET</span>",Snap's strategy shifts win over advertisers more than users,"By Paresh Dave and Munsif Vengattil
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) on Tuesday received a vote of confidence from a billionaire investor and reported record revenue from outside North America, factors that helped soften the blow of its first-ever drop in daily users.
The social media company said its shift toward a self-serve model for advertisers was paying off and blamed a redesign of its app for denting user numbers. Still, analysts expressed concern that advertisers and users prefer Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's Instagram app over Snapchat. 
Snap picked up a big backer in Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who announced soon after the second-quarter results he had bought a 2.3 percent stake for $250 million in May. He said in a statement Snap had just begun to ""scratch the surface of its true potential.""
Shares in Snap were flat in after-hours trading following volatility that saw them fall briefly before surging more than 12 percent. 
The company has shifted over the last year to primarily selling ads through self-service, automated auctions rather than direct sales. That has come at the cost of the premium feel Snap had tried to ascribe to its ads, but given overall sales a jolt by attracting more advertisers.
Snap has been able to boost sales volumes by competing with bigger services on price. Prices fell 9 percent in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter and 52 percent from a year ago.
""It gives an incredible opportunity for advertisers to come and win on our platform,"" Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan told analysts on a webcast on Tuesday. 
With self-service ads, Snap has been able to grow revenue in regions such as Australia and the Middle East, where direct sales efforts are more limited and advertisers have few other options to market to its mainly 18-34-year-old users.
Snap also has been redesigning its app to encourage users to interact with more of its ad-supported videos.
Its global revenue was $262 million in the second quarter, beating the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate of $250.43 million, as average revenue per user surged to $1.40 from $1.05 a year ago.
Snap forecast third-quarter sales of $265 million to $290 million, up 27 percent to 39 percent from a year earlier, compared with 44 percent revenue growth in the second quarter.
Daily Snapchat users fell to 188 million in the second quarter from 191 million in the prior quarter. Snap had never before logged a quarterly drop in daily users, according to data it has released going back to 2014. 
Snap lost about 1 million users in each of its three geographic reporting regions: North America, Europe and rest of world.
Analysts on average expected Snap to gain nearly 2 million users in the second quarter from the first. 
The company cautioned that usage tends to slow in the third quarter, but did not make a specific forecast.
Earnings from Facebook and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in recent weeks spooked social media investors by showing issues around data privacy, abusive content and phony accounts were weighing on user growth. Both companies shed some 19 percent in market value after reporting.
But some analysts on Tuesday brushed off Snap's user drop, saying that Snapchat always had more limited appeal than larger rivals. 
""It’s always going to be a niche platform, so the modest change isn’t very remarkable,"" said Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser.
Snap executives told analysts that the redesign was the primary reason for usage slipping and that a European Union data protection law that spurred changes to user privacy terms had no material effect. 
Users on average continue to spend more than 30 minutes on Snapchat each day, executives said.
Snap said ending leases in Venice, California, to consolidate offices a few miles north in Santa Monica cost it $3.9 million in the second quarter and would result in total expenses of $25 million to $45 million in 2018, mostly in the current quarter.

Employees had griped about Snap's network of small, spread out offices in Venice.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) missed Wall Street profit targets as new technology costs rose during the quarter ended June 30, but Chief Executive Bob Iger said an exodus of consumers from its television channels was slowing.
Shares of Disney, which have climbed nearly 9 percent so far this year, slipped 1.1 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday to $115.45.
Disney is trying to transform itself into a broad-based digital entertainment company as ESPN and its other networks lose viewers to Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and other streaming options. It is on the verge of gaining new film, television and international properties in a $71 billion purchase of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA).
Iger, on a post-earnings webcast, said growth of smaller channel bundles delivered online had helped make up for customers dumping larger cable packages. Disney has seen ""noticeable improvement in the rate of (subscriber) loss in each of the last four quarters,"" he said.
The company plans to launch its own streaming service for family entertainment in late 2019. The service will not, however, carry the volume of content found on Netflix, Iger added.
The cost to build streaming services contributed to a profit decline at Disney's media networks, the company's largest unit, in the quarter. Operating income at the division dropped 1 percent to $1.8 billion, the company said.
Subscription growth for ESPN+, a pay streaming service launched in April, is ""exceeding our expectations,"" Iger said.
Overall, Disney posted earnings of $1.87 per share excluding certain items, an increase from a year earlier, but below Wall Street's average forecast of $1.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Disney's movie studio enjoyed blockbuster success with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""The Incredibles 2."" Operating income at the studio rose 11 percent to $708 million, but it also recorded a $100 million film impairment charge, primarily related to work on two animated films it decided not to release.
The company's theme parks division reported a 15-percent rise in profit to $1.3 billion with increases at domestic and international resorts. 
In consumer products, operating income declined 10 percent to $324 million. 
Net income attributable to Disney rose to $2.92 billion, or $1.95 per share, in the quarter, compared with $2.37 billion, or $1.51 per share, a year ago.

Total revenue rose 7 percent to $15.23 billion, but missed analysts' average forecast of $15.34 billion.

1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) is at the center of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. 
An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.
The investigation into how $4 billion disappeared from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, has involved U.S. attorneys' offices in Los Angeles and New York, but the U.S. Department of Justice gave control to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn who are ""intensively focused"" on Goldman's role, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the probes.
Goldman, which generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said it is fully cooperating with authorities. 
Spokesman Michael DuVally directed Reuters on Tuesday to the bank's disclosures about 1MDB probes in a quarterly filing which said the bank has received subpoenas and information requests from a number of government bodies and regulators.
Brooklyn prosecutors are also considering criminal charges against former Goldman investment banker Tim Leissner, who worked closely with 1MDB, the Times said.
Leissner's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman declined to comment.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",U.S. to boost drug price negotiation in Medicare Advantage health plans,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Tuesday it would give Medicare Advantage health plans for the elderly new tools to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said Medicare Advantage plans will be allowed to require that patients first try certain lower-cost drugs before moving to a more expensive alternative if the first treatment is not effective. 
Medicare Advantage plans are administered by private health insurers, such as  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) and  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), and cover medical benefits for some 20 million seniors.
Until now, such requirements could not be made on drugs covered by Medicare Part B, which are administered in a hospital or doctor's office.
The changes also affect Medicare Part D drugs that patients get at the pharmacy. The Medicare Advantage plans would be allowed to require patients try alternatives covered within Part D before moving on to physician administered drugs, that are typically much more expensive.
In 2017, Medicare Advantage plans spent $11.9 billion on Medicare Part B drugs. These types of changes in the private market have generally resulted in savings of about 15 percent to 20 percent, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
More than half of the savings will be required to be passed on to patients, CMS said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers a top priority. He announced a blueprint for lower healthcare costs in May and his administration has been announcing new initiatives this summer.
The changes announced on Tuesday can take effect as early as 2019.
Medicare Advantage plans that choose to implement the so-called step therapy will be required to disclose the change to patients. They would be allowed to switch to another Medicare Advantage plan or to fee-for-service by March 31.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico bankruptcy judge upholds oversight board powers over government,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Puerto Rico's federal oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline on the bankrupt island's government through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in law.
Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico's legislature filed lawsuits in July claiming the board, which was created by the U.S. Congress under the so-called PROMESA Act in 2016, overstepped its power by imposing a belt-tightening fiscal plan and budget on the government that require public policy actions.
The board, which sought to dismiss the litigation, argued that if it cannot impose reforms through a fiscal plan over the objections of the governor, ""then PROMESA created a toothless oversight board.""
Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the PROMESA Act gives the board the power to make ""binding policy choices"" for the U.S. commonwealth despite the governor's objection. 
However, when it comes to policy measures dependent on the adoption of new laws or the modification or repeal of existing laws, the board ""has only budgetary tools and negotiations to use to elicit any necessary buy-in from the elected officials and legislators,"" the ruling stated.
While the ruling empowered the board in fiscal matters, it also noted that only the Puerto Rico government can pass laws necessary to implement new fiscal policies.
Swain noted that the PROMESA Act is ""an awkward power-sharing arrangement"" because Puerto Rico officials have the ability ""to obstruct implementation altogether or complicate it in such a way as to cripple Puerto Rico's ability to use it to promote the needed return to fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets.""
With Puerto Rico sinking under roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, the board in May 2017 sought a form of bankruptcy restructuring in U.S. court.
Rossello blasted the ruling for giving ""total budgetary authority to the unelected members of the oversight board, which supersede that of the elected officials of the Government of Puerto Rico and its legislature."" 
""While we analyze the possibility of appealing the court's decision, we will keep looking for ways to work with the oversight board so that we avoid harsh, draconian measures that would be detrimental to our people,” he said in a statement.
The oversight board said the ruling upholds its authority and urged the Puerto Rico government to fully implement the fiscal plans and budgets it certified.
""There can be no doubt that the fiscal year 2019 budget certified by the oversight board is the only one and must be enforced,"" said Board Chairman José Carrión in a statement.
""We call on all stakeholders to get back to work in the interests of Puerto Rico, in order to end decades of mismanagement and rebuild our island.”

While the judge dismissed several counts in the governor's lawsuit largely on technical grounds, she kept other parts alive, rejecting the board's argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Swain dismissed the legislators' lawsuit in its entirety.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It would be the ultimate black eye for short sellers. 
A buyout of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., led by entrepreneur CEO Elon Musk, would cap a painful ride for short sellers, who have amassed more than $13 billion in bets that the company will founder and deliver them a huge windfall. 
Instead, Tesla's stock has surged more than 900 percent in five years, and this year alone losses have now topped $3 billion.
Short sellers have had a painful year as stock prices have risen broadly, leaving fewer opportunities for profits as heavily-shorted stocks have risen also.
Just 69 out of the 500 companies in the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index have declined by 10 percent or more for the year to date, while 164 companies have gained more than 10 percent over the same time, according to a Reuters analysis. 
""I've got guys pitching me all the time on short ideas and I love to hear them, but in this environment I've been burned too many times and I'm gun shy about shorting anything that has any viability,"" said Mark Spiegel, portfolio manager of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners. 
Shares of Tesla rallied 11 percent on Thursday as Musk said in a tweet that he was considering taking the company private. Those gains follow a 16 percent jump last Thursday after its August 1 earnings announcement.
Short sellers in Tesla have lost $3.03 billion this year in mark to market-losses, according to research firm S3 Partners https://www.s3partners.net. 
Spiegel, whose fund is short Tesla by holding puts that expire in January 2020, said it was “unfathomable to me"" that anyone would finance a Tesla leveraged buyout. 
Some of the industry’s most prominent players are suffering heavy losses amid soured short bets. 
David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital fund is down 19 percent, posting some of the industry’s worst returns, as Tesla was the fund’s second largest loser in the second quarter, the fund manager told investors in late July. 
Musk has been in a vocal war with short sellers, needling prominent investors who bet against Tesla, which is one of the most heavily-shorted stocks. Musk on Tuesday tweeted that going private would end ""negative propaganda from shorts."" 
The average long-short hedge fund is up just 0.7 percent for the year to date, according to Hedge Fund Research, while the average short-focused mutual fund or exchanged traded fund is down nearly 6 percent for the year, according to Lipper. The benchmark S&P 500 index by comparison is up 7 percent for the year. 
""The major shorts have remained steadfast to their convictions,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.
Yet short-sellers say that rising interest rates may soon make betting against rising prices once again profitable as companies find it more expensive to borrow.
""One of the challenges we've been facing is that some of the business models which are really bad in our opinion keep thriving because they get acquired or they can still get debt financing,"" said Bimal Shah, an associate portfolio manager of the Thornburg Long/Short Equity fund. 
Shah's fund has been increasing its short exposure as interest rates rise, he said, and has been adding to its bets in sectors including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary companies. 
""We are starting to see some really juicy shorting opportunities now,"" Shah said.
Overall, short interest - a measure of how many shares of a given company are held by short-sellers - has been increasing yearly since 2016, and is up 6.1 percent for the year so far, according to S3 Partners. 
The total value of short interest topped $1 trillion for the first time on record this year, S3 Partners said, pushed higher in part by large short bets on companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Brian Culpepper, a portfolio manager of the James Long-Short Fund, said that the breadth of gains in the stock market has made it difficult to find profitable shorts. 
The U.S. tax cuts passed by Congress last December has helped earnings among S&P 500 index companies who have reported their second quarter results rise by an average of 24.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, nearly double the 12.3 percent earnings growth rate during the same quarter last year. 
The broad gains in the stock market will likely slow as the effects of the tax cut are more fully priced into the market, Culpepper said. 
""As the stock market becomes more condensed into a few overall names, our percentage of shorts will increase,"" he said.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 05:27PM ET</span>",Canada to ask allies to help cool Saudi dispute; U.S. offers no aid,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada plans to seek help from the United Arab Emirates and Britain to defuse an escalating dispute with Saudi Arabia, sources said on Tuesday, but close ally the United States made clear it would not get involved.
The Saudi government on Sunday recalled its ambassador to Ottawa, barred Canada's envoy from returning and placed a ban on new trade, denouncing Canada for urging the release of jailed rights activists. Riyadh accused Ottawa on Tuesday of interfering in its internal affairs.
One well placed source said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - which stresses the importance of human rights - planned to reach out to the United Arab Emirates.
""The key is to work with allies and friends in the region to cool things down, which can happen quickly,"" said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Another source said Canada would also seek help from Britain. The British government on Tuesday urged the two nations to show restraint.
The United States, traditionally one of Canada's most important friends, stayed on the sidelines. U.S. President Donald Trump - who criticized Trudeau after a Group of Seven summit in June - has forged tighter ties with Riyadh.
""Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can't do it for them; they need to resolve it together,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing.
The first Canadian source said Ottawa shared the view of foreign policy experts who believe the Saudi reaction reflected internal strains inside the kingdom, where 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to push through domestic reforms. 
The office of Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland did not respond to requests for comment.
The dispute looks set to damage what is a modest bilateral trade relationship worth nearly $4 billion a year. Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia totaled about $1.12 billion in 2017, or 0.2 percent of the total value of Canadian exports. 
Canada says it does not know what will happen to a $13 billion defense contract to sell Canadian-made General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia.
European traders said the main Saudi wheat-buying agency had told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin wheat and barley.
Saudi Arabia has also ordered roughly 15,000 Saudis studying in Canada to leave. 
Canada's previous Conservative government, which lost power to the Liberals in 2015, also had challenges with Riyadh over human rights.
Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa, said Saudi irritation at the way the General Dynamics contract was handled also helped explain Riyadh's response.
The deal was agreed in 2014 by the Conservatives, who shared the Saudi desire for deeper relations, he said. But the task of approving the export permits fell to the Liberals, who were lobbied by human rights activists to say no.
The Liberals granted the permits but showed little interest in deepening ties with Riyadh amid growing civil society and media attacks on the agreement, Juneau added.
""That for Saudi Arabia was the source of growing frustration,"" he said in a phone interview. ""(The ambassador) was very clear in saying he was irritated by what he saw as passivity by the Canadian government, which in his view was not resisting that criticism.""
The first Canadian source said Ottawa had no regrets about speaking out on human rights in Saudi Arabia. Canada's ambassador, Dennis Horak, is not in Riyadh. The source said Saudi authorities were aware Horak was due to start a new posting next month.

1143,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Snap Jumps and  Disney  Slumps
Shares of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) bounced around sharply in after-hours trading Tuesday. After disappointing quarters from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap gave mixed signals to social media investors.
Snap’s quarterly loss was narrower than expected and the company beat revenue forecasts. But daily active users were down in the second quarter, compared with the first, and missed estimates.
In addition, after the numbers it was disclosed that Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal acquired a 2.3% stake in Snap.
The bulls seemed to take control following the release and shares rose about 7%.
Also after hours, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock fell about 2.5%. The company’s quarterly numbers missed on the top and bottom lines.
Operating income at its cable networks fell 5% from the year-ago period.
2. Can Musk’s Plan to Possibly Take Tesla Private Work?
There will still be talk among traders tomorrow about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk saying he was considering taking the company private.
Musk tweeted out of the blue he had funding to buy the automaker at $420 per share.



Many market watchers wondered about the intent of the tweet at the time. Musk has had an antagonistic relationship with short-sellers and his tweet and the subsequent stock rise would have certainly shaken the confidence of those betting on shares falling. The use of $420 as a price, a number well know in marijuana-smoking circles, also raised questions about whether this was tweeted more as a gag than a business strategy.
Now, with the official statement, there will be more focus on whether Musk could pull off a $71 billion leveraged buyout.
Musk’s plan to give shareholders the option of being bought out at $420 or staying on as shareholders of a private company will be a tricky road to navigate.
The stock finished the day up about 11%.
3. Drawdown in Crude Inventories Forecast
Oil inventory numbers will probably have the most market impact when they are released at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT) tomorrow.
Crude oil futures have been rising after the first wave of U.S. sanctions on Iran came into effect first thing Tuesday.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Tuesday, estimated domestic oil production will grow at a slower rate than previously forecast.
The EIA cut its 2018 crude output estimate to 10.68 million bpd from 10.79 million bpd and its 2019 output estimate to 11.7 million bpd from 11.8 million bpd, citing lower crude prices are expected to curb U.S. shale oil output.
For Wednesday, analysts are predicting that U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 3.333 million barrels last week, compared with a surprise build in inventories the week before.
A small rise is expected in distillate stocks, while a drawdown in gasoline inventories is forecast.
Economic data heats up later in the week with the measure of wholesale and consumer inflation on the calendar."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 inched nearer to a record high on Tuesday, lifted by Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, and by a strong second-quarter earnings season that fueled optimism about the U.S. economy's strength.
The S&P 500 last closed at a record high on Jan. 26, and a new peak would reassure investors who have worried in recent months that almost a decade of gains on Wall Street might be ending. After a 0.28 percent rise on Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up almost 7 percent in 2018.
A sharp rally in tech stocks has already helped the Nasdaq recover much faster than the broader markets from a sell-off in February, hitting a record high late last month. 
""We might hit the record and blow through it. As long as there are still strong earnings and there are no corporate blowups, there's nothing that says we have to stop. Momentum can go on for a long time,"" said Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.
The financial sector (SPSY) rose 0.48 percent as higher yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) buoyed bank stocks.
""Financials really have been trading a lot with the bond market. To the extent that bond yields go higher, specifically on the 10-year Treasury note you seem to see rallies in financials,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) gained 0.72 percent after U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns about supply.
Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) rose 1.47 percent and Microsoft (O:MSFT) moved up 0.69 percent, driving a 0.33 percent gain in the S&P information and technology index (SPLRCT).
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) added 0.80 percent. The Internet retail and infrastructure heavyweight provided the greatest lift to the S&P 500, followed by Alphabet and Microsoft.
Tesla (O:TSLA) jumped 10.99 percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was considering taking the electric car maker private.
A strong earnings season has helped U.S. stocks cushion some of the impact from the simmering trade issues.
With the second-quarter reporting season winding down, 79 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped estimates. If the beat rate holds, it will be the highest on record, dating back to the first quarter of 1994, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.5 percent to end the day at 25,628.91 points.
The S&P 500 (SPX) ended the session at 2,858.45, just short of its January record of 2,872.87. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.31 percent to 7,883.66.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" dropped to 10.93 points, its lowest since January.
Broadridge Financial (N:BR) rose 11.16 percent and Mosaic (N:MOS) climbed 5 percent after reporting quarterly results.
Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) added 0.53 percent ahead of its results, which were released after markets closed.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 70 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.2 billion shares, compared with the 6.3 billion-share average for the last 20 trading days.

Sales at Wendy's restaurants in North America open at least for a year rose 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2018. Analysts on average had expected a 1.29 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Wendy's, like other fast-food chains, has been offering discounts on limited-time items and beverages as well as freshly prepared meals to attract more diners in a fiercely competitive industry.
The burger chain now has a $1 Double Stack cheeseburger and in January it launched a ""4 for $4"" offer as well as discounted Baconator Fries - promotions that have weighed on its profit margins.
The company reported second-quarter net income of $29.9 million, compared with a loss of $1.9 million a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Wendy's earned 14 cents per share, missing financial analysts' average estimate of 16 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Overall revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $411 million, topping analysts' estimates of $407.7 million.

Strong corporate earnings stoked investor appetite for riskier assets, casting aside trade-war concerns and paving the way for the broader market to extend gains.
Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock closed about 19% higher as the company said a day earlier that both revenue and earnings topped Wall Street estimates.
Energen (NYSE:EGN) also delivered above-consensus earnings, while Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) earnings came in above estimates, but revenue fell just short.
Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) stock tanked more than 16%, meanwhile, after the company reported below-consensus earnings and announced the acquisition of a mortgage lender.
A string of mostly bullish corporate earnings in the second quarter has helped divert investor attention away from the U.S. and China trade war that so far has shown no signs of abating amid weeks of stalled negotiations.
About 80% S&P 500 companies delivered earnings reports that beat Wall Street estimates, FactSet reported.
Investor appetite for stocks has also been bolstered by expectations that share buybacks will rise 46% to $1 trillion in 2018 compared to last year as extra cash from tax reform and strong corporate cash flows are returned to shareholders, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

1151,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","Argentine Issuers to Sell $5 Billion of Debt by March, Itau Says","(Bloomberg) -- Argentine companies will sell at least $5 billion of overseas bonds by March, reopening a window that has been closed for the past three months amid economic volatility, according to the head of Itau Unibanco Holding SA’s international fixed-income unit.
Between $3 billion and $4 billion will be sold by a group of firms recently awarded public-private contracts to build roads, while the remainder will come from blue-chip companies, according to Baruc Saez. He doesn’t expect the federal government or provinces to issue debt before the end of the first quarter, helping boost demand for the corporate notes.
“Argentine issuers will start selling international debt in September,” Saez, who is based in New York, said in an interview during a visit to Buenos Aires. “The market will be able to easily digest $5 billion of bonds.”
A return to capital markets will test appetite for debt from the country following a currency wipeout earlier this year that compelled the government to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The bonds from the public-private projects will be treated as quasi-sovereigns and gauge investors’ tolerance for taking on government debt in particular. The cost to insure the country’s international debt with credit-default swaps is now almost twice as high as it was in January.
Argentine governments and companies issued $26 billion of overseas debt last year. So far this year, the Argentine government has sold $9 billion, while corporates and sub-sovereigns have sold $2 billion. Telecom Argentina SA had to pull a $1 billion bond sale in April amid market turmoil, and no company has issued since then.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. think tank's tiny lab helps Facebook battle fake social media,"By Joseph Menn
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day before Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced that it had discovered and disabled a propaganda campaign designed to sow dissension among U.S. voters, it exclusively shared some of the suspicious pages with an online forensics team so busy it hasn't put a nameplate on the door. 
The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab is based in a 12-foot-by-12-foot office in the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the nearly 60-year-old Council http://www.atlanticcouncil.org, a think tank devoted to studying serious and at times obscure international issues.
Facebook is using the group to enhance its investigations of foreign interference. Last week, the company said it took down 32 suspicious pages and accounts that purported to be run by leftists and minority activists. While some U.S. officials said they were likely the work of Russian agents, Facebook said it did not know for sure.
It fell to the lab to point out similarities to fake Russian pages from 2016 during Facebook's news conference last week. 
Facebook began looking for outside help amid criticism for failing to rein in Russian propaganda ahead of the 2016 presidential elections. The U.S. Justice Department won indictments against 13 Russians and three companies for using social media in that election to influence voters. U.S. President Donald Trump's national security team warned last week of persistent attempts by Russia to use social media against the 2018 congressional elections as well.
OUTSIDE HELP 
With scores of its own cybersecurity professionals and $40 billion in annual revenue in 2017, Facebook might not seem in need of outside help. 
But the lab and Atlantic Council bring geopolitical expertise and allow Facebook to distance itself from sensitive pronouncements. On last week's call with reporters, Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, said the company should not be expected to identify or blame specific governments for all the campaigns it detects.
""Companies like ours don’t have the necessary information to evaluate the relationship between political motivations that we infer about an adversary and the political goals of a nation-state,"" said Stamos, who is leaving the company this month for a post at Stanford University. Instead, he said Facebook would stick to amassing digital evidence and turning it over to authorities and researchers.
It would also be awkward for Facebook to accuse a government of wrongdoing when the company is trying to enter or expand in a market under that government’s control. 
Facebook donated an undisclosed amount to the lab in May that was enough, said Graham Brookie, who runs the lab, to vault the company to the top of the Atlantic Council’s donor list, alongside the British government. 
Facebook employees said privately over the past several months that Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wants to outsource many of the most sensitive political decisions, leaving fact-checking to media groups and geopolitics to think tanks. The more he succeeds, the fewer complications for Facebook’s expansion, the smaller its payroll, and the more plausible its positioning as a neutral platform. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. 
EXPOSING DISINFORMATION
The lab was founded by Brookie, a National Security Council advisor in the last four years of the Obama administration. Ben Nimmo is a co-founder. He joined after stints as a journalist covering the Baltic states as they sparred with Russia a decade ago and as a spokesman for NATO on Russia and Ukraine.
On a recent visit to the head office, the often-traveling Washington staff of four were packed around three desks pushed to the center of the room.
Aloud and on Slack, the workplace chat room app, they discussed pending articles they were publishing on the news and opinion website Medium about disinformation operations in Brazil, the United States and Pakistan.
Using its own software and other tools, the team sorts through social media postings for patterns. Then it adds geopolitical context to tell stories on Medium about misinformation campaigns early, before they play out.
The combination of urgency and analysis has pushed the young lab to the front line of deciphering state-sponsored and domestically generated misinformation. Even before the Atlantic Council created it 2016, the team drew attention in Washington policy circles and beyond for using crowdsourcing and technology to challenge the claims of nation-states. It first got attention using geo-tagged selfies to show Russian soldiers were in Ukraine, which added to evidence there was no populist uprising there.
During the recent Mexican presidential election, the lab worked with a media consortium, Verificado, that included Al Jazeera and Mexico's Animal Politico, to debunk wild rumors about candidates' illicit foreign support, Nazi relatives and plans to ban junk food. On its own, the lab also rooted out a paid influence campaigner relying on automated accounts.

""If you wait for something to happen, it's going to be too late,"" Nimmo said. ""You have to put verified information into the environment first.""

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said there were five complaints alleging fires following the activation of seat-belt pretensioners made by ZF TRW [ZFF.UL] or Takata Corp during a crash involving the vehicles.
Pretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags.
While there were no injuries or fatalities, three of the vehicles were completely destroyed by the fire, the NHTSA said.

An estimated 1.4 million vehicles made between 2015 and 2018 could be affected in the investigation, the NHTSA said.

The website showed the automaker was looking to fill 14 roles, including architectural designer and senior finance manager for its Shanghai Gigafactory, which is expected to produce both electric vehicles and their batteries. 
Most of the positions are senior in level and require at least six years' experience, the job descriptions showed. 
Tesla did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
The 21st Century Herald, a Chinese business newspaper that reported the job postings on Tuesday, said Tesla began advertising the roles on Sunday.
Tesla signed agreements with Shanghai authorities last month to build its first factory outside the United States, which would double the size of its global manufacturing.
The automaker planned to produce the first cars about two years after construction began on the factory, ramping up to as many as 500,000 vehicles a year about two to three years later. 
Those agreements followed the May hiring of James Zhou as Tesla's chief financial officer for China. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk said on an earnings call this month the factory would cost around $2 billion and Tesla planned to fund the project with local debt.
Last week, in a letter to investors, the company said the first cars would begin to be built in about three years, or 2021. But during a call with analysts, Musk gave a timeframe that did not match the letter to investors, saying the Shanghai plant would be key to its goal of producing 1 million vehicles per year by 2020. Many analysts say that goal is unfeasible.
Tesla also posted the 14 job listings for the Shanghai Gigafactory on its U.S. website in English, suggesting some hires may come from outside China.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's HNA Group Co Ltd is in advanced talks to sell a 30 percent stake in aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd to Japan's Orix Corp (T:8591), two sources said, as the company attempts to restructure and trim stakes even in its core assets.
The aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, which has racked up massive debt from acquisitions in recent years, is nearing a deal to sell the stake in Dublin-based Avolon for about $2.2 billion, the sources, who were familiar with the matter, told Reuters.
One of the sources said the parties could announce a deal as early as Wednesday.
""HNA's liquidity problems are well documented. This is one way to ease pressure on the group,"" another source said.
All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. HNA, Avolon and Orix declined to comment.
HNA bought Avolon for $2.5 billion in 2015 via Bohai Capital Holding (SZ:000415), which HNA controls.
Avolon then agreed to acquire the aircraft-leasing arm of CIT Group (N:CIT) for $10.4 billion in late 2016, creating the world's No.3 aircraft lessor after General Electric's GE Capital Aviation Services and U.S.-listed AerCap (N:AER).
HNA accumulated assets ranging from a stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to high-profile overseas properties during its $50 billion shopping spree in 2016 and 2017.
It says it has now shifted focus to its core aviation, tourism and logistics businesses as it tries to slash its debt pile, but it has also been selling down aviation-related assets.
HNA has agreed to sell $10 billion in real estate, has sold a stake in  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and trimmed its Deutsche Bank stake as part of a wider reorganization.
Last month, HNA sold part of its holdings in Swiss-based airline caterer Gategroup Holding, weeks after investors including a unit of Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd bought stakes in Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd (SS:600221).
Hainan Airlines, China's fourth-largest airline, is considered HNA's crown jewel.
HNA is keen to get a full price for a stake sale in Avolon, sources said earlier this month.
Avolon has a fleet of 890 aircraft and counts 156 airlines among its clients.
The stake purchase by Orix will help its fully-owned unit Orix Aviation, which is already among the world's leading lessors, to expand its market share at a time when a flood of Chinese money has been shaping the $280 billion-strong leasing industry as a significant new asset class.
Japanese lessors are also large players in the sector.

Bloomberg first reported news of the HNA-Orix talks.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Icahn urges Cigna shareholders to vote against Express Scripts deal,"By Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday urged  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) shareholders to vote against the health insurer's $52 billion purchase of Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), citing regulatory hurdles and the growing threat of Amazon.
The Cigna-Express Scripts deal has drawn investor skepticism over concerns that Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) entry into healthcare will upend the sector at a time when President Donald Trump has made a push to lower drug prices.
The Trump administration has proposed a rule that will scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs).
Icahn said the proposed rule, which came after the Cigna-Express Scripts deal agreement, is a clear shot across the bow for the PBM industry.
""We believe this is the start of a concentrated effort to reform drug pricing and eliminate the highly flawed rebate system,"" Icahn wrote in a letter to Cigna shareholders, adding that the industry will likely move to an entirely fee-based model over time.
Icahn also highlighted the rising threat of Amazon, which in June bought small online pharmacy PillPack, putting the world's biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and PBMs.
""When Amazon starts to compete as we believe they will, with their 100 million Prime users and scale distribution system, they will have no trouble breaking into the so-called ecosystem,"" Icahn said.
The billionaire investor, who has a long position on Cigna and a short position on Express Scripts, said in the letter titled ""Cigna's $60 billion folly https://carlicahn.com/open-letter-to-cigna-stockholders"" that the insurer was overpaying for Express Scripts.
Icahn said Cigna should instead repurchase its shares and pursue partnership with existing pharmacy benefit managers, including Express Scripts.
Icahn owns 1.36 million shares, representing about 0.56 percent of the outstanding shares of Cigna.
Express Scripts' shares fell last week after the news of Icahn's stake and his opposition to the deal first emerged. Cigna on Thursday said it was confident of winning shareholder approval for its Express Scripts deal. The shareholder vote is due on Aug. 24.
Express Scripts' shares were up 1 percent in early trading, while Cigna shares were up 0.34 percent.
""We believe we are well positioned for growth and remain confident in the deal,"" Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said. Cigna was not immediately available for comment.
Analysts do not expect shareholders to support Icahn, noting that few shareholders have questioned the strategic rationale of the deal.

Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said a majority of current shareholders are likely to vote in favor of the deal, given a large shareholder overlap between the two companies.

Trump is hosting the chief executives for dinner at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. Expected attendees include the heads of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA),  Boeing Co  (N:BA), FedEx Corp (N:FDX), and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said. 
""This is an opportunity for the president to hear how the economy is doing from their perspective and what their priorities and thoughts are for the year ahead,"" Walters said in a statement. 
Chief executives of Boston Beer Company Inc (N:SAM), PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP),  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR), International Paper Co (N:IP), and Mastercard Inc (N:MA) were also invited, along with the top executives of privately-held EY and Red Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Group, and New York-based Trump advisor Richard LeFrak.
On Tuesday, Trump will face a test of his political influence in a special congressional election in Ohio that has become a referendum on his leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of the Nov. 6 election. 
Voters will also cast ballots in primary contests in Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington.
Reuters/Ipsos opinion polling has shown that the economy is a top issue for Americans.
U.S. job growth has been strong with low unemployment even as trade tensions loom large over the economy and American workers' wage growth remained moderate.
Trump has sparred with a number of companies, particularly on Twitter, but his agenda has included a number of business-friendly items that have also appeased Republicans in the U.S. Congress, who are seeking to maintain their control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Under Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star, Republicans last year passed a massive $1.5 trillion tax law that included a permanent cut for corporations and a temporary one for individuals that the White House wants to now make permanent. 
The White House has also floated the idea of sidestepping lawmakers to pursue another tax cut for investors. 
Trump's administration has moved to eliminate a number of regulations that it has argued were burdensome to companies, even as Democrats and other critics argue that lifting environmental and other restrictions threaten the public. 

Trump has threatened to shut down the government ahead of the Nov. 6 election if Democrats do not fund his border wall and support changes to immigration law, betting that maintaining a hard line will work in Republicans' favor in the vote, even as some conservatives and others have warned against such a disruption.

1188,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",FAANGs Are More Solo Acts Than a Tech Supergroup,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s time for FAANG stocks to break up, at least in investors’ minds.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can’t get away from one another. Every time one grabs the spotlight — as Apple did last week when it became the first U.S. company with a $1 trillion market value — it brings along the other four.
They’re alternately hailed as the hot stocks, technology’s brightest lights and indispensable growth companies, and jeered as a worrisome sign of a frothy and top-heavy market. But look closely and it’s no longer clear why they should be lumped together at all.
Let’s start with the technology moniker. Amazon is a retailer and Netflix is an entertainment company, which is why, contrary to popular perception, the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, tags them as consumer discretionary companies, not tech. And as of the next GICS reclassification in September, Facebook will move from the tech sector to telecommunications, where it belongs. Only two of the five FAANGs, in other words, are true technology companies.
Another questionable claim is that the FAANGs have hijacked the market. Yes, the FAANGs are giants, four of the five biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization in the S&P 500 Index (Netflix ranks a lowly 34). But they don’t take up an unusually large slice of the market. The five biggest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for an average of 12.3 percent of the index since 1990, the earliest year for which numbers available. By comparison, the index’s allocation to the five FAANGs is 12.8 percent.
It’s also a mistake to assume that the FAANGs are interchangeable bets. Index provider MSCI Inc. analyzed the five companies using its Factor Classification System, or FaCS. It looks at how each stock compares with the broader global stock market based on various attributes — or factors — that drive returns, such as value, growth, momentum, quality and volatility. The factor scores range from a negative 3 to a positive 3, with a positive number indicating a greater than average exposure to that factor, and vice versa.
There are lots of surprises. First, not all FAANGs are growth stocks, as measured by historical earnings and revenue growth and predicted earnings growth. Apple, for example, scores a negative 0.1 for growth. Google’s growth score is a modest 0.4.
Second, they’re not all wildly expensive, based on stock price relative to book value, earnings, cash flow and other measures. Apple is slightly more expensive than average, with a value score of 0.05. Google and Facebook score a negative 0.45 and 0.39 for value, respectively — not cheap but far from the richest.
Third, some are higher quality than others, as measured by profitability, leverage and stability of operating results, and not in the order investors might think. Apple has a reputation for sky-high profits and reliable revenue, and yet it scores 0.15 for quality. Meanwhile, Netflix spends lavishly on programming and has negative cash flow, and its quality score is 0.63 — second only to Google’s score of 0.68.
Lastly, not all FAANG stocks are leading the market higher. Google has a momentum score of just 0.05, as measured by price performance over the last 12 months excluding the most recent month. Apple and Facebook score 0.49 and 0.41 for momentum, respectively, or modestly higher than the average stock.
Nor is it likely that the FAANGs will ever have much in common because their attributes are constantly changing. Apple, for example, was a much different bet five years ago, scoring high for growth and low for quality and momentum. The probability that all five stocks will be similarly situated at any given time is exceedingly low.
There are two obvious lessons here. One, whether investors love or hate this market, the FAANGs have little to do with it. And two, a catchy acronym is no substitute for diligent analysis.

1206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Turkey’s Cratering Markets Stoke Speculation Over Extreme Measures,"(Bloomberg) -- Desperate measures are in the air in Turkey: trading rooms are awash with talk of a bailout by the International Monetary Fund and potential capital controls. But there’s a vacuum at the core.
The central bank and government have been largely silent as the currency plummeted to record lows and the U.S. imposed sanctions and threatened more. The lira slipped for a seventh day against the dollar after falling by the most in a decade on Monday, while the yield on 10-year bonds surged above 20 percent to an all-time high.
“It will remain like this until the central bank commits unconditionally to hike rates and keep them high until inflation has turned,” Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Nomura International Plc, said by email. “The market needs that sort of hard commitment.”
Yet the radio silence from Ankara -- a result of June elections that gave President Recep Tayyip Erdogan almost absolute power in policy making -- is deafening. Erdogan is a staunch critic of higher rates and investors worry that he may be standing in the way of any further rate increases.
“It is very difficult to foresee an about-face by the authorities,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging-market strategist at SEB in Stockholm. “The moment when Turkey will be forced to go to the IMF for support is drawing closer.”
Buckling Lira
The lira is buckling under the weight of one of the widest current-account deficits in emerging markets and inflation is spiraling ever higher. As of July it was running at more than three times the central bank’s target, driving the real policy rate to below 2 percent, the lowest since December.
The lira weakened 0.5 percent to 5.3548 per dollar as of 13:21 p.m. in Istanbul after sinking as much as 6.7 percent to the dollar Monday, taking the currency’s slide to 29 percent so far this year. Ten year yields surged 42 basis points to 20.09 percent, while the benchmark stock index was up less than 1 percent, narrowing its year-to-date loss in dollar terms to about 40 percent.
Although investors are pushing for a significant rate increase from the central bank, there is growing consensus it is going to take lot more than monetary policy to reverse the tide.
“It’s going to be a shock of one type or another: either a policy shock or a macro shock or some combination of the two,” said Christopher Granville, managing director for EMEA and global political research at TS Lombard in London. “But the way to sugar that pill,” he said, would be a “political accommodation with the West. That would make the pain much less.""
Sugar Pill
On Monday the central bank boosted banks’ access to dollar liquidity by $2.2 billion, an effort to take some pressure off the lira. The currency trimmed its losses briefly, only to plunge to successive record lows through the night as investors saw the move as evidence that the bank’s hands were tied.
The lira’s meltdown is not only hurting consumers’ sentiment and wallets, but it’s pushing corporate balance sheets closer to the abyss. Companies that borrowed heavily in foreign currencies now face a growing burden due to the tanking lira.
Companies sit on $337 billion of foreign-exchange liabilities, with a shortfall of $217.3 billion net against assets, according to central bank data. Bank borrowing costs are also rising ahead of more than $100 billion in debt payments coming due over the course of a year.
Capital controls have “become more than a tail-risk scenario now as the authorities show no signs of reverting to more orthodox policies,” said Shamaila Khan, AllianceBernstein’s director of emerging-market debt in New York. But what the lira really needs is “independence of the central bank, tighter fiscal policies and an IMF program.”

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Overseas costs drag on profits at Domino's Pizza; shares slide,"(Reuters) - Rising overseas costs, particularly in Norway, overshadowed an improvement in sales at Domino's Pizza Group (L:DOM), pushing first-half pre-tax profit down almost 10 percent and sending the company's shares to an 11-month low. 
Domino's has been focusing on its online and overseas businesses but has struggled to control in-store costs, especially in Norway where it has 34 own-brand stores and is converting the Dolly Dimple stores it acquired in 2017. 
""Whilst our international businesses continue to make good progress with customers and sales, it has taken us some time to refine the operating model and cost base at store level, particularly in Norway,"" said Chief Executive Officer David Wild. 
Although sales rose more than 180 percent in Norway, losses climbed because of increased labor costs, but Wild indicated that performance would improve in the second half of the year.
Statutory pretax profit fell 9.7 percent to 41.7 million pounds from 46.2 million pounds a year ago.
Overseas costs also contributed to a rise in net debt to 182.1 million pounds from 61 million pounds last year, along with share repurchases and dividend distributions.
Shares were down almost 10 pct at 287 pence at 0955 GMT (5.55 a.m. ET).
A strong performance in the UK, the company's home base where it controls about 46 percent of the pizza delivery market, helped offset the international results. 
The UK's biggest pizza delivery firm sold 8.2 million pizzas during the FIFA World Cup. UK sales rose 8.3 percent in the six months ended July 1, contributing to an overall rise in sales of 12.8 percent to 616.6 million pounds.
Online sales in the UK, which account for 79 percent of total sales in the country, rose 14 percent. 
Domino's is banking on technology which allows customers to track their orders, with a complete rollout targeted for the third quarter of 2018. 

The company said it is in the advanced stages of naming an interim chief financial officer after former CFO Rachel Osborne stepped down in June in a shock departure. Wild said the person would definitely be from outside the company.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mattress Firm explores U.S. bankruptcy to close stores,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Mattress Firm Inc, the largest U.S. mattress retailer, is considering a potential bankruptcy filing as it seeks ways to get out of costly store leases and shut some of its 3,000 locations that are losing money, people familiar with the matter said.
Mattress Firm's deliberations offer the latest example of a U.S. brick-and-mortar retailer struggling financially amid competition from e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). Shares of Mattress Firm competitor Tempur Sealy International Inc (N:TPX) jumped on the news and ended trading on Monday up 5.2 percent at $52.64.
Mattress Firm's South African parent, Steinhoff International Holdings NV (J:SNHJ), has been working on a deal to restructure the debt of some subsidiaries with its creditors, following an accounting scandal. Creditors agreed last month to hold off on their debt claims for three years. 
Steinhoff acquired Mattress Firm for $3.8 billion in 2016. 
Both Houston-headquartered Mattress Firm and Steinhoff are working with consulting firm AlixPartners LLP, the two sources said this week. AlixPartners helps companies plan and execute turnaround strategies, and is often brought in to lay the ground for bankruptcy.
The sources, who requested not to be identified because the plans are private, cautioned that Mattress Firm has not made any final decisions and its plans could change.
Representatives for Mattress Firm and AlixPartners declined to comment. Steinhoff did not respond to requests for comment. 
Filing for bankruptcy would allow Mattress Firm to clean up its real estate portfolio and improve cash flow and profitability, analysts at Piper Jaffray Companies (N:PJC) wrote in a research note last week.
Many retailers pursue bankruptcy to reject leases, a move to slim their store count, cut their costs and reorganize to continue their business. U.S. discount footwear retailer Payless ShoeSource Inc, for example, closed roughly 700 mall-based stores in bankruptcy last year, while children's clothing shop Gymboree Corp closed about 300.
To be sure, some retailers shut huge swaths of their store base outside of bankruptcy. Bebe stores Inc (PK:BEBE) closed nearly all its retail locations without filing for bankruptcy last year, negotiating a deal with its landlords instead.
Mattress Firm lost Tempur Sealy International Inc (N:TPX), the maker of popular mattress brand Tempur-Pedic, as a supplier last year, limiting its offerings. Mattress Firm secured a $225 million asset-backed revolving loan last year. 
Steinhoff booked a $12 billion write-down earlier this year relating to accounting irregularities.
Steinhoff also owns discount chains Poundland in the United Kingdom and Ackermans in South Africa.

Mattress Firm acquired HMK Mattress Holdings LLC, the parent company of competitor Sleepy's, in 2016 for $780 million and then rebranded the shops. Sleepy's had over 1,050 stores on the U.S. East Coast and Illinois.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares edged toward a six-month high on Tuesday, as the biggest jump in Chinese stocks for over two years and an upbeat start for Europe followed Wall Street's best close since January.
The moves came despite a host of simmering global feuds. Oil prices ticked higher as the United States reimposed some sanctions on Iran, while the Turkish lira  bounced back almost 2 percent from its worst day in a decade on Monday that had been prompted by a row with Washington. (IS)
The mood lifted overnight as Chinese stocks rebounded 2.7 percent on hopes of fresh government spending, following a four-day selloff that had knocked them down about 6 percent. (SS)
London (FTSE), Paris (FCHI) and Frankfurt (GDAXI) followed by rising 0.6 to 0.9 percent as Europe's investors cheered results from Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (EU) and oil firms and miners gained on the rise in crude prices. (SXPP) (SXEP)
""The Chinese have stabilized the yuan, the lira hasn't been annihilated this morning so once the sharp FX moves have calmed down and as long as the (company) earnings are good, you have a more risk friendly environment,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes.
Currency markets remained volatile although less so than in recent sessions as the dollar dipped. 
The euro bounced to $1.1583 (EUR=) from a near six-week low despite a second day of disappointing German economic data, while Britain's pound  made back some ground after Brexit worries had pushed it to an 11-month low. [/FRX]
Turkey’s lira recovered 1.7 percent from Monday's losses of more than 5 percent after Washington had moved to end duty-free access to U.S. markets for some Turkish exports. A report by CNN Turk that Turkish officials would go to Washington to discuss the strained relations helped the rise, although the lira remains close to a record low.
Already struggling with inflation at 14-year highs near 16 percent and political pressure on the central bank not to raise interest rates, the lira’s year-to-date losses are nearing 30 percent as jitters about foreign currency debt payments rise. 
""Currently the impact of the lira's slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating,"" said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""Such a development could affect some European financial institutions,"" he added.
WALL STREET WHOOSH 
An impressive global earnings picture and upgrades to the U.S. profit growth horizon outweighed the global trade tensions and the various emerging market dislocations. 
Wall Street’s S&P 500 closed at its highest level since Jan. 29 overnight, less than 1 percent from its record high hit earlier that month. 
The Vix volatility gauge closed at its lowest since Jan. 26. A surge in U.S. corporate earnings driven by tax cuts - they achieved an annual aggregate growth rate of about 25 percent in the second quarter - has prompted the likes of Citi to upgrade their end-2018 and 2019 earnings forecasts.
Wall Street buoyed market sentiment around the world, with Tokyo and Seoul both up 0.6 percent and Hong Kong closing up more than 1 percent along with Shanghai's big bounce.
In commodities, oil extended the previous day's rally after the imposition of U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran took effect on Tuesday. [O/R]
Benchmark Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) shook off earlier weakness and were 0.33 percent higher at $73.99 a barrel. They had gained 0.75 percent on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi production had unexpectedly fallen in July.
On bond markets, borrowing costs for euro zone benchmark issuer Germany were pinned near their lowest levels in almost two weeks as concerns about global trade and turbulence in Italy continued to support demand for the least risky assets. [GVD/EUR]

The softer dollar helped metals. Copper  was up 0.5 percent at $6,161.50 a tonne after retreating more than 1 percent the previous day. Gold, which is stuck near a one-year low, crawled 0.2 percent higher to $1,208.06 an ounce [MET/L]

1212,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",UniCredit Bears Down on Costs to Beat Earnings Estimates,"(Bloomberg) -- UniCredit SpA (SIX:CRDI) rode cost reductions to a report a second quarter profit that beat estimates as Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier executes parts of his turnaround plan ahead of schedule.
Mustier is ramping up savings and improving asset quality to keep his promise of building a leading pan-European bank. The bank is selling billions of euros of bad loans as part of the clean-up as the CEO pursues a target of 4.7 billion euros of annual net income in 2019.
The bank expects to reach its target for cutting branches and staff ahead of schedule, Milan-based UniCredit said in a statement on Tuesday. Lower costs and reduced provisions for bad loans boosted net income to 1.02 billion euros, ($1.2 billion) beating the 930.6 million-euro average of 5 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
“UniCredit reported a solid beat to consensus, the market will like the net interest income and cost beat as well as the fast improving asset quality,” Andrea Filtri, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA, wrote in a report.
The lender is speeding up the reduction of its soured debt as Mustier has made cleaning up the balance sheet a pillar of his tenure. UniCredit expects its non-performing exposures to be down by the end of the year with a target of 2 billion euros of NPE disposals.
“UniCredit delivered strong results in a challenging market during the second quarter,” Mustier said during a conference call with reporters. “By the end of this year, we expect to be close to finalizing the announced Transform 2019 branch closures in Western Europe,” as well as the planned staff reductions.
UniCredit rose as much as 2.6 percent in Milan trading and was up 2.3 percent at 14.71 euros as of 11:47 a.m., giving the bank a market value of 32.5 billion euros. UniCredit is trading at about 0.60 times its tangible book value compared with 0.94 times at Italian rival  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) SpA.
While operating costs and loan-loss provisions fell, analysts point out that the results also show show that revenue pressure at UniCredit is easing.
“The profit beat was supported by strong core revenues,” Jefferies analysts Benjie Creelan-Sandford and Marco Nicolai wrote in a note, highlighting higher volumes and lower funding costs.
UniCredit is among the biggest banks in central and eastern Europe, serving 25 million clients in 14 countries including Russia and Turkey. The central and eastern Europe division was the largest contributor to second-quarter profit, with net income up 2.3 percent to 472 million euros.
Concerns about the direction of Italy’s populist government drove up Italian bond yields in the quarter, hitting the capital buffers of banks holding the debt. UniCredit’s common equity tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength. fell to 12.51 percent from 13.06 percent at the end of March.
UniCredit is confident that it will reach an agreement with U.S. authorities this year over an ongoing investigation involving possible violations of sanctions against Iran, Mustier said on a conference call.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares bounced back strongly on Tuesday as investors cheered UniCredit results but gave Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) a damp reception, while a profit warning sank Pandora's stock.
Europe's gains came on the heels of a stronger trading session in Asia as investors' focus shifts from a murky, complex trade war to company earnings which they can more easily pin down and price in to markets. 
UniCredit shares rose after Italy's biggest lender by assets reported second-quarter profits fell less than expected.
""Trend of under-promising and over-delivering continues,"" wrote Jefferies analysts. 
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) traded 1.8 percent higher by 0830 GMT as investors also digested the bank's weaker capital buffer. Its CET1 ratio fell due to the sharp sell-off in Italian government bonds on political upheaval.
The Italian index rose 1 percent, out-doing the pan-European STOXX 600 which gained 0.4 percent. 
Commerzbank shares fell 1.8 percent to the bottom of Germany's DAX, however, as investors reacted badly to a weaker-than-expected capital buffer, and its forecast of higher costs for its full year of 2018.
""We think investors will be disappointed by the revised cost guidance, as this is the main element in management’s control, but note that expectations are already incredibly low for Commerzbank,"" said Citi analysts.
Overall bank earnings have surprised positively against relatively pessimistic expectations.
The biggest disappointment came from Danish jewelry maker Pandora, which sank 19 percent to a four-year low after cutting its sales and profit margin guidance for this year and announcing nearly 400 job cuts.
""Another profit warning just a few months after the updated mid-term targets may put the credibility of the current strategy and management team in question,"" said Berenberg analysts, warning of a likely ""free-fall"" in the stock today. 
Pandora is suffering from fewer people visiting shopping malls in its key U.S. market.
Industrial machinery and equipment maker Oerlikon jumped 9.2 percent after reporting orders, sales and earnings beats and hiking its order outlook. 
""European results have generally been good and reflect good underlying demand,"" said Christopher Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance. 
""Sales in particular have been very healthy - beating estimates - while earnings per share has not quite kept up with sales growth."" 
Schaeffler shares climbed 6.6 percent after the car parts maker raised sales guidance for its industrial division.
It helped boost the autos sector up 1.4 percent, among top gainers. Germany's DAX also jumped 1 percent thanks to its carmakers. 
Daimler shares rose 1.7 percent after the carmaker said it has dropped plans to expand its Iran business in reaction to renewed U.S. sanctions.
Meanwhile Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer Zalando fell 6.2 percent after it trimmed its sales and profit outlook for the year, following results that missed expectations. 
A downgrade by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to ""underperform"" bruised shares in French IT services firm Atos, down 7.4 percent.

Analysts at the Swiss broker said ""financial arrangements"" account for around 30 percent of recent free cash flow and the majority of the recent improvement in cash flow.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 04:21AM ET</span>",GlaxoSmithKline appoints HSBC's Iain Mackay as new CFO,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) has named Iain Mackay from global bank HSBC (L:HSBA) as its new chief financial officer, marking another key appointment by Chief Executive Emma Walmsley as she reshapes the top team at Britain's biggest drugmaker.
Mackay, 56, will leave HSBC at the end of the year and join GSK on Jan. 14, 2019, when he will become CFO designate, the pharmaceuticals group said on Tuesday.
The phased move allows for a transition period from January and the end of March 2019, during which GSK's current finance chief, Simon Dingemans, will hand over the ropes before Mackay takes on full responsibility from April 1.
GSK previously announced in May that Dingemans, a former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) investment banker who joined in 2011, would be retiring next year. Since Dingemans will only leave at the end of March 2019, he will continue to be responsible for delivering on 2018 financial results.
Dingemans will not receive any severance payment and Mackay will similarly not get any special payment to mark his arrival, a company spokesman said.
The change provides a further opportunity for Walmsley to stamp her imprint on GSK as she tries to boost sales and improve productivity, especially in the core pharmaceuticals division.
Walmsley, who took over in April 2017, has already appointed a new head of pharmaceuticals in Luke Miels and a new head of drug research in Hal Barron, as well as making Karenann Terrell head of digital operations.
While banking is very different to pharmaceuticals, Walmsley said Mackay would bring valuable experience as the finance head of another complex global organization within a highly regulated industry.
""He is a strong leader with a track record of driving cost, cash and capital allocation discipline to deliver strategy. These capabilities will be vital as we continue to implement our innovation, performance and trust priorities for the benefit of patients and shareholders,"" she added.
He also has some experience in healthcare as a trustee of the British Heart Foundation. Before HSBC he was at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Schlumberger Dowell and Price Waterhouse.

Mackay will be replaced at HSBC by Ewen Stevenson, currently chief financial officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS).

1216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Turkish Bond Yields Surge to a Record as Lira Gets a Respite,"(Bloomberg) -- After the lira, it’s the turn of Turkish government bonds.
The nation’s benchmark 10-year notes slid, sending yields to a record high, as investors increasingly concerned by a lack of central bank moves to backstop the nation’s assets sought higher risk premiums. The lira won a brief respite after slumping the most since an attempted military coup in 2016.
Turkish assets have come under fire amid heightened concern over a diplomatic spat with the U.S., and the central bank’s inability to support the currency against accelerating inflation as well as one of the widest current-account deficits in emerging markets. The lira has weakened around 27 percent this year and the yield on 10-year bonds has surged more than 800 basis points.
“It’s getting nastier,” Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Nomura Plc., said by email. “And it will remain like this until the central bank commits unconditionally to hike rates and keep them high until inflation has turned. The market needs that sort of hard commitment.”
The 10-year bond yield jumped 24 basis points to 19.91 percent Tuesday, the highest since Turkey first issued debt of this maturity in 2010. The lira strengthened 2.4 percent to 5.2127 per dollar. It slumped 4.6 percent on Monday, the most since 2016, after reaching 5.4222, the weakest on record.
The market rout comes as Turkey prepares to auction five-year fixed-coupon and 10-year inflation-linked bonds later Tuesday. The Treasury lowered its planned borrowing targets for August and September after months of loose fiscal policy and heavy bond supply that have weighed on demand. It plans to borrow a total 10.8 billion liras ($2.1 billion) in August, down from a 12.2 billion liras, according to the Treasury’s latest borrowing strategy.
For the rot in the nation’s assets to stop, the central bank needs to do more than just raise rates, according to Nomura.
“So bottom line is the central bank needs to hike rates to 20 percent or above, and tell markets that we will not be afraid of hiking further and keeping real rates high until inflation has clearly turned,” Gullberg said. “Anything but that sort of hard commitment will not be effective.”

Russia’s largest crude producer also posted the highest net income in almost five years and curbed its dollar-denominated debt, underpinning the share buybacks that helped lift it to the highest level since January 2017.
Rosneft has for years been Russia’s most indebted company after making multibillion dollar acquisitions at home and abroad. Now the state-run giant is promising better returns to investors through dividends and a buyback program. That helped to push the stock price up 45 percent this year, beating returns from other major oil companies for those investors willing to stomach the political risk.
Net income jumped to 228 billion rubles ($3.6 billion), according to a company statement on Tuesday. That exceeded Rosneft’s profit for the whole 2017 and beat analysts’ estimates. Free cash flow rose to 221 billion rubles, while dollar-denominated net debt shrank 12 percent.
On Monday, Rosneft started a share-repurchase plan totaling $2 billion through to the end of 2020. In the statement on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin reiterated that its priority now is “organic growth and monetization of synergies from the acquisitions"" to enhance shareholder returns.
Most major global oil companies are using the extra cash from rebounding crude prices to reward shareholders, but there’s still some pressure to keep a lid on spending. Global trade tensions and rising output from OPEC and its allies, including Russia, have stoked concerns that markets could weaken again.
Since June, Moscow-based Rosneft has been rolling back its share of the production cuts Russia agreed with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The company said it increased second-quarter oil production to 4.6 million barrels a day. It has the capacity to add another 200,000 barrels a day in this quarter, of which it has already utilized 120,000.
Rosneft may deliver record results for the full year and average dividend growth of 15 percent through 2020, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Other European and U.S. firms delivered a mixed bag of results in the second quarter. Some were perfectly poised to rocket out of the worst industry downturn in a generation by boosting production just as oil prices soared.

The measures would take effect on Aug. 7.
China said it would not join any global embargo of oil from Iran, although it would not increase their purchase of it.
“A lot of people think China can just buy all of the Iranian oil but they came out and said: 'Yes, we may not reduce but we are not going to increase our intake either.' So, you could see a significant crunch in terms of lost supplies into the market and then that obviously means higher prices,” Sen added."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Tuesday granted the corporate watchdog invasive new power to position supervisors inside financial firms after a public inquiry exposed systemic wrongdoing at some of the country's top institutions.
The new powers for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) add to the regulatory pressure that has already driven banks to tighten lending standards in the wake of the Royal Commission inquiry into financial-sector misconduct.
""We will be going on-site,"" ASIC Chairman James Shipton told reporters in Melbourne.
""We will have supervisory officers embedded for significant periods of time inside these large financial institutions because I know it makes a difference to the way that they behave (and) to the way decisions are made.""
An extra A$70 million in federal government funding over two years will help build a team of about 20 staff based in bank offices, as well as into scandal-ridden wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP).
""That may be days, may be weeks, may be months. Depending on the project at hand, depending on the task at hand and depending on the harm that we're trying to solve for,"" Shipton said.
The move is an about-face for a business-friendly, center-right government that initially opposed the establishment of the quasi-judicial commission of inquiry despite mounting evidence of wrongdoing in the financial sector.
The ongoing inquiry has exposed misconduct including deception of the regulator and the routine charging of fees for financial advice that was not provided.
The revelations have rattled the banking, funds-management and pension fund sectors, raising their compliance costs and triggering stricter regulation.
Investors have wiped more than A$26 billion off the combined values of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and AMP since hearings began in February.
The move to allow regulators inside banks would bring the watchdog's powers in line with its peers in Britain, Hong Kong and the United States, Treasurer Scott Morrison said.
""Having ASIC embedded in these financial institutions ... brings us into line with regulators overseas,"" he told reporters.
It follows proposals to double maximum prison terms for corporate crimes to 10 years and dramatically increase potential financial penalties from A$10 million ($7.4 million) to up to A$210 million or 10 percent of revenue.
ASIC also would increase its scrutiny of the A$2.6 trillion retirement funds sector, called superannuation in Australia, Morrison said.
The inquiry started hearings on the pension sector on Monday, and heard NAB had misappropriated millions of dollars from customers of its retirement products.

The proposed restrictions would limit investors’ ability to swap a dual-listed company’s shares in one market with those in the other, a feature known as fungibility, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential and no final decisions have been made. Fungibility was a key selling point in a  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc presentation outlining plans for the connect in May.
While other countries have similar restrictions and there’s no indication that China’s proposal will derail plans for the connect to start this year, limits on fungibility would likely dampen interest in the project. The rules would, under certain circumstances, make it harder for investors and arbitragers to react when prices in one market drift too far away from those in the other. A lack of fungibility is one reason why dual-listed stocks often trade at wildly different valuations on exchanges in Hong Kong and mainland China.
China’s proposal highlights the balancing act faced by authorities as they try to boost the country’s integration with global financial markets without giving up control over cross-border money flows. While a government clampdown has helped stem three years of capital flight, China’s slowing economy and trade war with the U.S. have fueled concerns of a renewed exodus in recent weeks.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Shanghai Stock Exchange didn’t reply to requests for comment. LSE Group declined to comment.
In the works since at least September 2015, the London-Shanghai connect will allow companies from China to sell global depository receipts in the U.K. and enable London-traded firms to list similar securities in Shanghai, according to an LSE presentation seen by Bloomberg News.
The main beneficiaries of the proposed link will be fund mangers whose mandates restrict them to investing in London-traded securities, said Danny Dolan, a managing director at China Post Global, the international asset-management unit of China Post & Capital Fund Management Co.
Read more here about LSE’s plan for a Shanghai Board in London
The CSRC wants to be able to suspend share swaps between the two markets if the depository receipts of a London-listed Chinese firm move outside a certain price range relative to the company’s Shanghai shares, the people said. The regulator is also pushing for a quota system that caps the amount of shares traders can exchange between the two markets over a set period, they said, adding that talks on the rules are still ongoing.
For Shanghai and Shenzhen’s trading links with Hong Kong, capital outflows aren’t an issue because the systems employ a “closed loop” architecture where trades are closed out in the currency where the investor account is held. For example, a trader in Shanghai who sells a Hong Kong-listed stock would collect the proceeds in yuan.

Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry told Reuters on Monday that the company remained confident in the deal. Cigna and a representative for Icahn did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 

Investors have expressed concern over the Cigna-Express Scripts deal because of the growing presence of Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in the healthcare sector and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to cut rebates from drugmakers to pharmacy benefit managers.

The company is facing a U.S. corruption probe, got mired in a dispute with its billionaire former partner in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has been caught in the fallout from new U.S. sanctions on Russia -- among other issues. Yet despite all the bad news, Glencore is expected to report its most profitable six months ever when the company publishes first-half results Wednesday.
While some of the issues have since been resolved, the company’s shares are down about 20 percent this year, compared with gains by rivals like BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc. Analysts are more optimistic, meaning that Glencore’s share discount to the average target price is near its widest in half a decade.
“Glencore has always had reputational issues, but even by their standards this has been a particularly horrific six months,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. “Glencore is showing that it’s a riskier beast than its rivals and it trades at a discount because of that.”
Here’s what’s gone wrong for Glencore this year:
Despite all that, Glencore is expected to report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $8.5 billion in the first half, its biggest ever.
Those earnings are likely to be driven by bumper profits from coal -- Glencore is the world’s biggest shipper -- where prices have surged, along with increased copper and cobalt production. The company has already forecast that profits from its hallowed trading business will be close to an all-time high.
Glencore is the last of the big miners to report first-half earnings -- BHP Billiton runs on a different financial calendar and will post full-year results later this month -- with  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group and Anglo already reporting big profits. The companies’ use of extra cash has diverged, with Rio saying it would funnel $7 billion back to shareholders, while Anglo approved a $5 billion new copper mine.
Glencore has favored building a war chest for deals in recent years rather than giving money back to shareholders. Yet last month, just days after being hit by the U.S. probe, it announced it was buying back $1 billion of shares. The repurchase amount could be increased this week, Liberum and Macquarie Group Ltd. suggested.
“I expect an increase in the buyback but management might be reticent, especially if they want the firepower to go out and do other things,” said Davis from Liberum.

Speaking on a conference call after the San Diego-based firm released its second-quarter earnings, Martin said three of Sempra's directors visited Elliott's offices in New York to meet with the hedge fund and Bluescape Resources Co, a private investment fund founded by former utility executive John Wilder.
In response to an analyst's question about how the talks with Elliott were going, Martin said he was ""actually quite optimistic with the tone of the conversations ... All the right people are engaged and I remain very optimistic about it.""
A source close to the talks said the discussions about a potential settlement were moving slower than Elliott wanted, however. Elliott declined to comment.
Utilities based in California are already under pressure from the impact of devastating wildfires that have hit the state in the last two summers, with talk of possible legislation that could impose significant liabilities on them for damage caused by the blazes.
Fellow utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) has hired restructuring advisers and is considering putting one of its units in bankruptcy, Reuters reported.
Sempra has insisted since Elliott and Bluescape revealed their position in the company that while it was open to engagement, it believed its current strategy was best for creating long-term shareholder value and it remained focused on executing it. Martin repeated that sentiment on Monday.
Elliott and Bluescape, which have joined forces to influence other U.S. utilities in the last two years, disclosed a position in Sempra on June 11 and called for new directors and for the company to pursue a strategic review. 
In a 50-page presentation, the investors called for selling international business lines and to split its existing business into two companies through a tax-free spinoff - one focused on utilities and the other on natural gas infrastructure. 
Since then, Sempra has said it planned to sell some of its natural gas storage assets and its U.S. wind and solar power portfolio, although this decision was part of its annual review and not related to the activists.

A spokeswoman for Sempra said on Monday ""we will continue to welcome shareholder input as we evaluate our portfolio and, at the appropriate time and under conducive market conditions, pursue additional opportunities to create long-term value for all shareholders.""

1247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","China Stocks Are About to Get Cheaper, Analysts Say","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks haven’t been this cheap relative to bonds in more than two years, and analysts say they’re about to get cheaper.
The equity selloff in the world’s second-largest economy has left the Shanghai Composite Index’s earnings yield -- the inverse of the more commonly used price-earnings ratio -- at 7.6 percent, widening the gap with the yield available on five-year AAA rated corporate notes by the most since March 2016. Analysts aren’t rushing to call a reversal anytime soon, as investors continue snapping up bonds as China shifts toward easing, while stocks are shunned amid dwindling risk appetite and concern over an economic slowdown.
“There’s a lack of positive factors for stocks in general, so the trend is likely to continue,” said Xiong Yun, founding partner at Lingwang (Shenzhen) Investment Management Co. “Among bonds, corporate debt is likely to outperform sovereign and quasi-sovereign notes, as the latter have already rallied quite a lot this year.”
The Shanghai Composite Index has slid 18 percent year-to-date, becoming the worst performer in the world. Bonds meanwhile extended a two-quarter advance, with corporate debt catching up with sovereign over the past month on a slew of stimulus measures. The spread between Shanghai Composite’s earnings yield and corporate notes stood at 3.43 percentage points on Monday.
The shift from stocks to bonds is doing the People’s Bank of China a favor, as it is weighing down bond yields without the central bank needing to cut policy rates. With deleveraging measures and higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods posing challenges to the economy, asset managers predict a further shift into bonds.
Stimulus Package
The latest stimulus package aimed at boosting demand for corporate bonds and ensuring reasonable financing of local government financing vehicles is also accelerating that move. Sovereign bonds have returned 5.1 percent this year, while corporate debt returned 3.9 percent, according to ICE BofAML indexes.
Read more about traders adding leverage on bonds.
Even relative to its own history, the Shanghai Composite Index looks cheap. The measure trades at 13 times reported earnings, the lowest in three-and-a-half years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That didn’t prevent the gauge from falling for a fourth day on Monday, pushing it to the lowest since February 2016.
“Calling a market bottom based solely on the widely used valuation multiples tends to be hasty,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong. “Buy-side still has a high level of stock holdings and little cash to deploy for bottom-fishing.”
Clarity Needed
For markets to turn around, trade tensions with the U.S. have to cool down and more clarity is needed on domestic policy, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management wrote in a note last week. Listed companies tend to be more susceptible to tariffs than the overall Chinese economy as they’re more globally exposed, according to the note.
A Politburo meeting on July 31 signaled top policy makers will focus more on supporting growth, while continuing deleveraging efforts at measured pace. Data released the same day showed China’s official factory gauge cooled last month as the impact of trade tensions began to bite.
“Policy fine-tuning, especially the initial steps, is unlikely to reverse the course of a cyclical downtrend,” said Hong. “The confirmation signal of a slowdown from the central bank will initially accelerate asset price changes along their existing trends, rather than reversing it.”

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>","Marriott sees revenue weakness in third quarter, shares fall","(Reuters) - Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) on Monday signaled weakness in revenue per available room (revPAR) in North America, its largest market, for the third quarter, sending shares of the world's largest hotel chain down about 4 percent. 
The company expects revPAR, an important metric that measures a hotel chain's health, to increase by 1.5 percent to 2 percent in the region due to Independence Day holiday falling in the middle of the week and tough comparisons to last year's numbers that included the impact of hurricane relief efforts. 
However, Marriott, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, kept its forecast for worldwide revPAR for the full year unchanged at 3-4 percent.
The company also raised its forecast of full-year adjusted profit to $5.81 to $5.91 per share from $5.43 to $5.55 per share. 
Net income rose to $610 million, or $1.71 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $489 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.47 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose to $5.35 billion but missed Wall Street estimate of $5.84 billion due to a drop 5.6 percent in fee received from the properties that the company owns or leases.

The company's shares was down at $124.45 in extended trading.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) is scouting for a partner with a manufacturing and distribution footprint to make lightweight motorcycles for use in India and other Asian markets, a top company executive said.
The Milwaukee-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, said last week it would launch a 250cc to 500cc motorcycle in India to boost sales in the world's largest two-wheeler market as it grapples with an aging customer base and falling sales in the United States.
Industry sales are projected to grow 25 percent a year in Asia's third-largest economy in the 250cc to 500cc segment through 2021. 
""We realize that we as a company have been very focused on large heavyweight motorcycles and our expertise in the 250-500cc space needs to grow,"" Marc McAllister, vice president of product portfolio at Harley-Davidson, told Reuters in an telephone interview on Friday.
""We are looking for a strategic alliance that can help us grow through understanding the product, understanding the consumer, understanding the assembly,"" he said.
That could mean Harley will not necessarily make the new motorcycles at its own facility in India, and may instead use a local partner, McAllister said. He declined to discuss names or details of potential partners.
Helped by rising discretionary spending, motorcycles sales in India are experiencing double-digit percentage growth, compared with tepid recent consumer demand in the United States.
Lured by the enticing growth prospects, British motorcycle maker Triumph and Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) have partnered with Indian companies  Bajaj Auto  (NS:BAJA) and TVS Motor (NS:TVSM), respectively.
Harley expects the lightweight segment to act as a ""bridge"" to its brand, said McAllister, giving it a chance to make deeper inroads into a market where over 20 million two-wheelers are sold annually.
The company had been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump over a plan move production for European customers overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs in a trade dispute between the United States and European Union. 
Harley is hoping a foray into the lightweight segment, along with other new product launches, will expand its operating margins and add up to $250 million in operating profit in 2022.
Analysts are skeptical of the profit targets as India is a highly cost-competitive market and lightweight bikes are historically lower-margin products.
McAllister said the new bike will a premium product, but declined to reveal a price range.

As part of its drive to increase market share in India, Harley said it will increase its number of dealers there from the current 30, McAllister said.

1251,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Risks From China, U.S. Drive South Korea to Diversify Markets","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea will continue efforts to diversify its export markets as the U.S.-China trade war escalates, according to a key new member of President Moon Jae-in’s economic team.
The government will also take a ""flexible"" approach raising the nation’s minimum wage to Moon’s target of 10,000 won ($9) per hour, said Yoon Jong-won, new senior secretary to the president for economic affairs.
""If the conflict intensifies and increases uncertainty over global trade growth, it will certainly have an impact on Korea’s exports and investment,"" Yoon told reporters on Aug. 3. Yet he also sought to calm concern about how much Korea could be hurt by a decline in demand for parts and components from China, which uses these intermediate goods in products it assembles and then sells in markets such as the U.S.
Yoon, who was a Korean representative at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development before he joined Moon’s team in June said about 75 percent of the nation’s exports to its neighbor were for domestic Chinese consumption and that perhaps little more than 5 percent were ultimately headed for the U.S.
As part of Moon’s efforts to diversify markets for exports, he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi outside New Delhi last month to celebrate the inauguration of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.’s new mobile phone factory.
Amid concern Korean export growth may lose steam and that inflation is still short of the central bank’s 2 percent target, Yoon said: ""The quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.7 percent of economic growth is the level around the potential growth rate and I don’t see any economic indicators yet that show that growth will slow further.""
While Yoon didn’t elaborate in detail on his comment about taking a more ""flexible"" approach of raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won, it could indicate that the government may not rush to achieve this by 2020, as originally planned.
Minimum pay for workers is set to rise by 10.9 percent to 8,350 won per hour in 2019, slower than a 16 percent jump to 7,530 won for this year, the Minimum Wage Commission said in July.
Yoon has also been tasked with fostering a more innovation-friendly environment for businesses. He said this would help boost investment and jobs to spur growth in the longer term.
Still, the government has no plans to roll back higher company taxes following an increase last year, he said. It will continue pursue deregulation for companies that are seeking growth, while making competition fair and providing relief for people with insufficient income.
""China is catching up fast so we need to keep on innovating and upgrading our technologies, which will bring in more jobs and help the economy to grow,"" Yoon said.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>",U.S. argues judge failed to take its arguments into account in AT&T trial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Monday the judge in the trial to stop AT&T Inc's (N:T) purchase of Time Warner failed to take into account how companies negotiate with each other and seek to maximize profits in considering the Justice Department's arguments about how the deal would decrease competition.
In the brief for its appeal to the U.S. District Court decision in June, the government also argued the court should have concluded that the merger would give Time Warner more clout at the bargaining table.
Judge Richard Leon ruled in June that the Justice Department was wrong to ask that the $85.4 billion merger be blocked. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.
In writing that ruling, Leon, the government said in its brief, ignored evidence regarding how companies use leverage to bargain with each other and failed to take into account corporate efforts to increase their revenues.
The court's errors ""colored the court’s view of the facts, leading to a decision that is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented at trial,"" the Justice Department said.
The core of the Justice Department's concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner's content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.
""The district court erroneously concluded that the merger will not give Time Warner any increased bargaining leverage. The reasons the district court gave for finding zero increase in leverage are implausible and internally inconsistent,"" the government said in its brief. 
AT&T's General Counsel David McAtee disagreed with the Justice Department's assessment, saying that the government's case had ""many holes.""
""Appeals aren't 'do-overs.' There is nothing in DOJ's brief today that should disturb that decision,"" he said, using the acronym for the Department of Justice.
The Justice Department has appealed but no date has been set for when the appeals court will hear the case. The deal closed on June 14.
AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.

The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump's ire.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>",Wall Street closes higher as strong earnings cheer investors,"By James Thorne and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday as investors applauded a strong U.S. earnings season with results from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) impressing and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lifting Nasdaq after a report it was planning new services.
The S&P edged closer to a record hit on Jan. 26, closing within a percentage point of the all-time high for the first time since the current correction began. 
Investors were focused on robust corporate earnings and shrugged off worries about U.S. tensions with countries including China and Iran.
""The earnings news has been powerful and it's allowed investors to focus on what's most important but with earnings winding down then investors tend to react to the latest shiny object or geopolitical news headline,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
For example Ablin said U.S. President Donald Trump's stand-off with Iran could put pressure on stocks. 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed a U.S. call for talks on Monday, hours before Washington was due to impose new sanctions following Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program.
Also Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco in New York, said there were some signs China is ""hunkering down and getting ready for a significant trade war” and that the impact ""could be more far-reaching than previously assumed.”
Chinese state media on Monday lambasted U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies in an unusually personal attack, and sought to reassure investors anxious about China's economy as growth concerns battered its financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.6 points, or 0.16 percent, to 25,502.18, the S&P 500 gained 10.05 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,850.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.66 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,859.68.
The Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term gyrations for the S&P 500, closed down 0.37 point at 11.27, its lowest close since late January.
Nine of the S&P's 11 major industry sectors advanced, with the technology index, which rose 0.6 percent and the financial sector, which gained 0.4 percent, providing the biggest boosts to the benchmark.
Of the 413 S&P 500 companies that have reported second-quarter results so far, 79.2 percent have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the 72 percent average for the past four quarters.
“We still have a good amount of positive sentiment coming from a strong earnings season. ... That’s certainly providing a significant amount of positive force to stocks today,” said Invesco's Hooper.
The finance sector's biggest contributor was  Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which rose 2.3 percent after the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate reported a 67 percent surge in quarterly operating profit.
Technology's biggest boost came from Facebook, which gained 4.4 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported it had asked large U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about customers as part of an effort to offer new services.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 76 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.95 billion shares, compared to the 6.29 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

1259,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Oil Faces More Supply Worries as Iran Sanctions Start
Oil prices will be closely watched tomorrow as the first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran go into effect.
Crude futures finished higher Monday as Washington confirmed financials sanctions on Iran would come into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET (04:00 GMT).
The sanctions, which pale in comparison to the second round of sanctions slated for early November, aim to curb Iran's purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and other precious metals, and its buying of coal and industrial-related software.
The second round of sanctions, due three months from now, are expected to cripple Iran's energy infrastructure and oil exports, raising the risk of a global supply shortage, underpinning oil prices.
Morgan Stanley said it expected Iranian output to drop to 2.7 million barrels a day (bpd) by the fourth quarter, with more than 1 million barrels taken offline.
2. Dean Foods Could Give Some Trade Insight; Snap,  Disney  Report
As earnings season continues, albeit with fewer names reporting, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) could be active when it issues numbers before the bell, as investors look for any more guidance on how trade battles are affecting companies.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) rose Monday on a strong quarterly profit, bouncing back from weakness last week when it cut its full-year profit outlook on trade concerns. The company reiterated those risks remain on its conference call.
After trading ends, the market will get results from Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Following two big social media disappointments from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap’s active users will be the key to the stock movement. The company hasn’t managed to instill much confidence in Wall Street since its IPO.
Also reporting is Disney (NYSE:DIS), which is close to wrapping up its deal for 21 Century Fox’s media assets.
Investors will be looking, again, for big box office numbers to offset weakness in TV as it competes with streaming services.
3. Small Business Optimism, JOLTS Data Arrive
The economic calendar is fairly light. The market will have plenty of time before the open to digest the latest measure on small business sentiment when it arrives at 6:00 AM ET (10:00 GMT).
The NFIB will report its small business optimism index for July. The index came in at 107.2 for June, near the highs for the year.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) data on job openings from June.
On average, economists expect that job openings rose to 6.74 million, although it’s unlikely a miss or beat will move stocks much given the reaction to the employment report on Friday.
The market appears satisfied for now that the economy is strong, but not hot enough to increase the pace of interest rate rises."
1260,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:27PM ET</span>","Sprint, T-Mobile in early stages of regulatory review, no decisions yet: source","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust enforcers are in the early stages of reviewing T-Mobile US Inc's (O:TMUS) plan to buy Sprint Corp (N:S) for $26 billion, and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday.
Sprint shares were up 8.7 percent at $6.11 and T-Mobile rose 6.7 percent to $65.65 in late-afternoon trading, after the New York Post reported that U.S. regulators believed that just three national providers were needed, removing an obstacle to the deal.
The two companies compete against AT&T (N:T) and Verizon (N:VZ) to provide U.S. wireless service.
The source, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said ""at least"" three carriers were needed, and that the report's assertion that regulators have decided on just three carriers was not entirely accurate.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. T-Mobile and Sprint declined to comment.
The deal, announced in late April, faces a review from the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission that will likely last more than a year. 
The two companies are the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, respectively, and have defended their deal by saying they need to merge to build the next generation of 5G wireless technology in a ""robust"" nationwide network.

The Obama administration had taken at least twice to ensure that the United States had four wireless carriers. The head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has declined to endorse that and said in June: ""I don't think there's any magical number that I'm smart enough to glean.""

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:22PM ET</span>",Analysts stick with CBS as Moonves allegations probed,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street is largely backing CBS Corp (N:CBS), with few analysts changing their ratings or price targets on the media company, even as it looks into allegations of sexual misconduct against Chief Executive Les Moonves. 
The current breakdown of analyst recommendations is 19 ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ratings and 11 ""hold"" ratings with no ""sell"" or ""strong sell"" recommendations, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
CBS shares were down 0.5 percent at $52.87 on Monday. 
The company's shares have lost about 8 percent of their value since July 26, the day before the New Yorker magazine published an article containing allegations of sexual harassment against Moonves by six women ranging from 1985 to 2006. 
Moonves has said that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"" decades ago, which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and had never used his position to harm anyone's career.
Last week CBS hired two law firms to investigate the allegations against Moonves.
Among Wall Street analysts, the mean price target for CBS stock is $65.04, down only slightly from $65.88 on July 6. 
Some analysts cited a ""generally solid"" second quarter after CBS results topped Wall Street estimates Aug. 2. But they also refer to the Moonves investigation as a big overhang on the stock. 
MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, who has a ""neutral"" rating on CBS and a price target of $58, said it is ""uninvestable"" and that ""if these accusations are correct, it would be impossible for Moonves to continue"" as CEO.
B. Riley's Barton Crockett, who rates CBS as a ""buy"" and has a $61 price target on the stock, refers to the Moonves situation as a ""sideshow drama."" 
""Every media company that's lost top execs/talent to #MeToo has continued apace, because of other talent/management stepping up,"" he said. ""CBS, we believe, would, too.""
The investigation of Moonves comes as CBS is locked in a legal battle with its largest shareholder, Shari Redstone's National Amusements Inc. Moonves has opposed Redstone's efforts to merge CBS with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also owned by National Amusements. 
Benchmark Co's Daniel Kurnos, who has a ""buy"" rating and a $90 price target headlined his research note: ""Legal Distractions Aside, Plenty of Intrinsic Fundamental Value for CBS."" 

Kurnos said that while he acknowledges CBS is ""difficult to buy ahead of a resolution of the impending legal challenges"" he also cited it as leading content provider with increasing proportion of recurring or subscription revenue.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Mexico auto exports dip on U.S. sales; production hit by floods,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican automobile exports, excluding those made by Nissan, fell 5.5 percent in July year-on-year on weaker U.S. sales, while output for the month fell 3.7 percent, partially due to flooding at a Honda plant, auto industry association AMIA said on Monday.
Mexico exported 214,984 units in July, down from 227,444 the same month a year earlier, AMIA said, while producing 291,577 units, a fall from 302,716 in July a year before.
AMIA's export data did not include Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), which has stopped providing export figures.
""The trend in the United States is a flattening in sales,"" AMIA's director Fausto Cuevas told reporters on Tuesday, without providing details.
Flooding at a Honda Motor Co (T:7267) facility in Mexico weakened overall production data, Cuevas added, without specifying which plant was affected. Local media reported in early July that a river had spilled into Honda's plant in the state of Guanajuato, halting production.
Production data showed slumps at  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) and Nissan. Cuevas did not have details on the causes. 
Domestic auto sales slipped 6.4 percent to 114,312 vehicles in July compared with the year earlier period, AMIA added.
Uncertainty has dogged Mexico's auto industry for the past year since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada unless it was reworked to send manufacturing jobs to the United States. 
The Trump administration also wants Mexican workers to be paid more and is demanding more North American content in cars and light trucks produced in the NAFTA nations.

Cuevas said that the private sector's position is that ""nothing is resolved until everything is resolved,"" and that no agreements have been reached in talks that resumed in late July between Mexican and U.S. cabinet ministers in Washington.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Berkshire shares surge as U.S. economy fuels broad-based strength,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Shares of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) surged on Monday to their highest level since March after the conglomerate reported strong second-quarter results in several major business lines.
Berkshire on Saturday said operating profit rose 67 percent to $6.89 billion as the Geico car insurer won market share despite raising rates, and faster U.S. economic growth boosted shipping demand at the BNSF railroad.
Analysts expected operating profit of just $5.57 billion. Net income was $12.01 billion, including unrealized gains from a roughly 5 percent stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL) that would now be worth more than $50 billion.
U.S. gross domestic product grew in the second quarter at a 4.1 percent annualized rate, the fastest in nearly four years, the Department of Commerce has estimated.
Berkshire's Class A shares were up $9,619, or 3.2 percent, at $314,290 in Monday afternoon trading.
""Results have reflected a really robust U.S. economy,"" Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said in a phone interview. ""I expect that to continue, and given Berkshire's large domestic footprint it would have relatively limited exposure to a trade war.""
Berkshire's more than 90 businesses also include Marmon and Precision Castparts industrial parts, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.
Its other investments include stocks such as  American Express  (N:AXP), Coca-Cola (N:KO) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC).
Berkshire ended June with $111.1 billion of cash and equivalents, in part reflecting its lack of a major acquisition since Buffett bought Precision Castparts in January 2016.
That may prompt Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger to conduct Berkshire's first stock repurchase since December 2012, under a new policy allowing buybacks when the stock price is below their ""conservative"" view of Berkshire's intrinsic value.
The old policy forbade buybacks when Berkshire traded, as it long has, at more than 20 percent above book value.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Kai Pan, who rates Berkshire ""equal-weight,"" on Monday wrote that the change means Berkshire will ""likely"" return some excess capital to shareholders.
Shanahan is not certain there will be buybacks soon.

""The question is the willingness,"" he said. ""With the results they reported and the stock price moving higher, it makes buybacks less likely.""

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",U.S. banks further eased business loan standards in Q2 2018,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Loan officers at U.S. banks reported easing lending standards for business loans for firms of all sizes while keeping terms for commercial real estate loans almost unchanged in the second quarter, a Federal Reserve survey showed on Monday.
The officers also said they were seeing stronger demand for business loans from small firms and weaker interest in commercial real estate loans.
""Notably, almost all domestic banks that reportedly eased standards or terms on [business] loans over the past three months cited increased competition from other lenders as a reason for easing, "" the U.S. central bank said in its quarterly survey.
Other factors included increased tolerance for risk and increased liquidity in the secondary market, loan officers said.
U.S. banks previously reported easing standards for many business loans and some commercial real estate loans in the first quarter.
The Fed has raised interest rates seven times since it began a tightening cycle in December 2015, including twice so far this year. The Fed is forecasting another two rate rises in 2018, with investors seeing further hikes in September and December.
Financial conditions have remained relatively loose even as policymakers continue to gradually raise rates amid a strong economy.
Banks also reported lending standards for residential real estate loans and auto loans were little changed, according to the survey. A moderate share of banks said they had tightened standards on credit card loans.

The Fed surveyed loan officers at 72 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 01:45PM ET</span>",PepsiCo veteran Ramon Laguarta to replace Indra Nooyi as CEO,"By Siddharth Cavale and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc has appointed Ramon Laguarta to take over as chief executive from Indra Nooyi, handing the reins to a veteran who led the company's fast-growing emerging markets business.
Laguarta, who starts on Oct. 3, will be tasked with managing the company's response as consumer tastes move away from sugary drinks.
Nooyi, 62, is stepping down after 24 years at PepsiCo, where she held a variety of roles, including her most recent 12 years as CEO. Her departure also leaves only one woman of color among Fortune 500 CEOs. 
Laguarta will be PepsiCo's sixth CEO in its 53-year history.
""Ramon Laguarta is exactly the right person to help build on @PepsiCo's strong position and success. He has been a critical partner and friend and I am positive that he will take PepsiCo to new and greater heights in the years to come,"" Nooyi tweeted on Monday. 
A 22-year veteran of PepsiCo, Laguarta oversaw global operations, corporate strategy, public policy and government affairs in his role as president. 
The Spaniard previously headed the company's Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) division - a unit PepsiCo characterized as ""one of the most complex business divisions in the company,"" due to its mix of both developed and emerging markets. 
Laguarta, 54, was named president of the company in September last year and was tipped to succeed Nooyi. He also formerly led PepsiCo's Eastern European operations.
""With a deep understanding of PepsiCo's international operations, and a broader understanding of the total company portfolio in his role as president, we believe that Laguarta is well-placed to continue executing on PepsiCo's current strategy,"" Cowen & Co analysts said.
PepsiCo's shares were up 1.6 percent in morning trading on Monday, touching a seven-month high of $118.21 earlier in the session.
Nooyi is the third female CEO to leave a Fortune 500 company in the last one year after Denise Morrison quit Campbell Soup in May and Irene Rosenfeld stepped down as the head of Oreo-cookie maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in August 2017.
That leaves only 23 female CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, representing less than 5 percent of the total, according to the Fortune magazine. 
RESHAPING PEPSI
In her climb to the top, Nooyi had been at the forefront of several deals that reshaped PepsiCo. While she was chief financial officer, PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats and when she was vice president of corporate strategy, it spun off its interest in Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. 
However, it was after becoming CEO in October 2006, that Nooyi cemented PepsiCo's dominance in the global snacks and drinks market - inking 80 tactical deals, including buying its bottling operations and the Naked juice brand
She has also bolstered its portfolio of healthier offerings, which now account for nearly half of its sales, compared with about 38 percent in 2006, better aligning its portfolio with evolving consumer tastes, according to Morningstar analyst Sonia Vora.
More recently, Nooyi focused on reinvigorating sales of its marquee sodas by stepping up marketing efforts to win market share from Coca-Cola.
As CEO for 12 years, she has boosted sales of the Mountain Dew and Gatorade maker to $63.5 billion, up 80 percent from when she started. The company's share price has risen 78 percent in the same period.
She also saw off billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz's efforts to spin off the company's drinks business from its more successful snacks division by offering his fund, Trian, a board seat in 2015 to make peace. The hedge fund exited its stake in 2016.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog, however, said the change at the top could see PepsiCo considering more strategic options.
""This transition could open a wider door to PEP considering a variety of potential alternatives, including stepped up refranchising or even potentially splitting up the company."" 
Nooyi will remain chairman of the board until early 2019.

PepsiCo said it has not yet entered into any compensation arrangements with Nooyi or Laguarta with respect to changes in their job roles.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",BMW Korea apologizes as 27 vehicles catch fire over January-July,"SEOUL (Reuters) - BMW's (DE:BMWG) South Korean unit apologized over a spate of engine fires, estimated by the country's transport ministry at 27 over January to July, that has prompted a government probe and a major backlash from consumers. 
BMW said it will launch a recall of 106,000 diesel vehicles, including the 520d, starting from Aug. 20, citing defects in the exhaust gas recirculation system as the root cause of the fires. 
""For the recent series of fire incidents happened in the country, we sincerely apologize for causing worry and anxiety among people and government authorities,"" BMW Korea Chairman Kim Hyo-joon said at a press conference on Monday.
BMW, the second-most popular foreign carmaker in South Korea, said it had learned of the problems in 2016, but it identified the root cause of the problem in June this year.
The automaker has announced a ""technical campaign"" in Europe, followed by recalls in South Korea, citing similar failure rates of the system in both regions. 
South Korea's transport ministry said it has urged BMW executives to cooperate in the ongoing probe, saying they were falling short of submitting related documents. The government launched the probe into the affected models on July 16. 
Last week, Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee said the country would investigate the case in a ""thorough and transparent manner"" and take legal action if needed. 
A total of 13 South Korean owners of BMW vehicles filed a class action lawsuit against the German automaker on Friday, claiming compensation worth 5 million won ($4,447.13) each, saying they could not drive their cars out of fear the faulty part could catch fire, Yonhap News Agency reported.
BMW, which trails only Mercedes in imported car sales in South Korea, saw sales more than double to 59,624 vehicles last year, from five years ago.
Driven by South Korea's free trade deals with Europe and the United States, foreign car makers' share of the domestic market had risen to 15 percent last year, from under 1 percent in 2001. 
South Korea is a relatively small market, ranking 11th in global auto sales, but is a major market for lucrative, premium vehicles and is currently dominated by  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270).

""(Satre's) appointment is the result of a collaborative effort ... which I believe will serve as the beginning of a constructive and unified effort by all parties to move the company forward,"" current board chairman Wayson said.
The board had last month decided not to name an outsider as vice-chairman as initially requested by Elaine Wynn, according to the filing.
Satre, with more than 25 years in the gaming industry, was previously CEO of Harrah's Entertainment Inc, now known as  Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR).
The company's settlement with Elaine Wynn comes months after former Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn resigned following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. After his resignation, Steve Wynn disposed his entire 11.8 percent stake in the firm.
In May, Wynn Resorts said John Hagenbuch will not stand for re-election to the board after Elaine Wynn asked shareholders to vote against his re-election.
In 2015, Elaine Wynn launched, and lost, a proxy fight, and at the time, independent directors chose not to nominate her for re-election to the board.
Steve Wynn and ex-wife Elaine had been embroiled in a battle for control of the company following a bitter divorce.

Shares of Wynn Resorts rose 1.3 percent to $151.21 on Monday morning.

The family-owned company founded in 1962 plans to close 74 of its 344 stores, which now employ more than 9,800 people in 22 U.S. states and Puerto Rico.
It blamed the bankruptcy on a negative environment for retailers, costs from its purchase of the 78-store East Coast chain Conway's in 2014, lost revenue from Hurricanes Harvey and Maria in 2017, and a data breach that exposed information for more than 552,000 cards in late 2017.
Chief Executive Michael Fallas said National Stores plans after restructuring to ""compete in an evolving industry"" and continue serving ""communities where we are rooted.""
The Gardena, California-based company said its stores support ""underserved, low-income communities"" where consumers typically shop by price rather than to keep up with fashion trends. Its products sell for an average $5 each.
Store closing sales will begin on Thursday.
Dozens of retailers have filed for bankruptcy in the last two years, including Claire's, Gymboree, hhgregg, Styles For Less, Toys R Us and Wet Seal.
National Stores has between $100 million and $500 million of both assets and liabilities, according to its petition filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.
The company said it lined up $108 million of financing to keep operating while in bankruptcy.
Reuters on Friday reported National Stores' plan to seek court protection.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russia's Gazprom suspends external borrowing amid spat with Naftogaz - sources,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Sandrine Bradley
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) suspended its external borrowing program earlier this year because of a deepening legal dispute with Ukraine's Naftogaz over gas supplies, three banking sources told Reuters. 
A London court in June froze the gas giant's assets in Britain at the request of Naftogaz. The Ukrainian company was seeking to enforce an earlier arbitration ruling from Sweden that ordered Gazprom to pay it $2.6 billion. 
The British verdict is likely to have spooked Western banks that traditionally work with Gazprom because it raises the possibility that any new funds the company might raise via London could also be frozen, one of the sources said. 
Gazprom is still able to raise funds on the Russian market, recently testing investors' appetite with a 40 billion rouble bond ($630 million), but the situation means it faces higher borrowing costs and prolonged regulatory uncertainty, the bankers say. 
Gazprom, which is on the hook to repay $15.2 billion in external debt this year, had planned to start meeting investors to test their appetite for a potential sterling Eurobond in the middle of June, a Russian banker involved in that deal said. 
However, the deal was canceled days before the British court's June 18 announcement, the banker said. 
He said that the decision was made as the relationship between Moscow and the West grew increasingly tense because of U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and a row over former spy Sergei Skripal's assassination attempt on British soil. Russia has denied any involvement. 
Two other London-based bankers said the decision to call off the Eurobond issue was also taken as Gazprom adopted a cautious stance ahead of the London ruling. 
One of the sources, who all declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, said that Gazprom had also planned to sell Eurobonds in euros and Japanese yen in the autumn, but that those plans had stalled too. 
Meanwhile, one of the banks that works with Gazprom put a loan for the Russian firm on hold until the situation around its finances in the West became clearer, the same source said. Gazprom declined to comment. 
""As I understand it, settlements with foreign banks done via London are affected,"" another banker said. A third source, citing a banker who works with Gazprom, said Gazprom had stopped making any payments through banks in Britain. 
However, the London court's ruling does not prevent the company from servicing outstanding debt, a lawyer familiar with the process said. 
CHANGING TACK 
Gazprom's original plan had been to borrow 417 billion roubles ($6.57 billion) externally this year. It is currently building two new pipelines to southern Europe and China, and preparing to start construction of the Nord Stream 2 to Western Europe under a projected investment program of 1.3 trillion roubles this year. 
Gazprom has a sufficient cash cushion to deal with its costs but western financing is a cheaper alternative for the company, the bankers said. In March, prior to the London court ruling, Gazprom raised 750 million Swiss francs via a 5-year Eurobond where UBS (S:UBSG) was the only Western bank involved, and another 750 million euros in an 8-year Eurobond arranged by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) along with three Russian banks. 
In May, Gazprom raised 600 million euros via a loan from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan declined to comment on Gazprom's external borrowing operations. 
Other banks that have worked on Gazprom's external financing programmes, such as Société Générale (PA:SOGN), Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), UniCredit (MI:CRDI), UBS,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, also declined to comment. 
Credit Agricole could not immediately comment. Nomura and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) did not reply to Reuters requests. 

Naftogaz said that Gazprom's failure to comply with the original decision of the Stockholm court was creating problems and it was better for Gazprom to pay the $2.6 billion it owed.

1292,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Rusal's Making Money But Stockpiling Metal as Sanctions Hit,"(Bloomberg) -- United Co. Rusal gave investors the first glimpse into how sanctions are hitting the Russian aluminum giant, showing that it’s still making money despite lower sales.
The top producer outside of China on Monday said adjusted net income in the three months through June fell 31 percent from the previous quarter to $218 million. While the company was for a time shut out of international markets after being sanctioned in April, it benefited from high prices of aluminum and alumina, which it sells to third parties.
Still, the results show that sales of value-added products, a key part of the business, fell in the quarter and inventories rose by more than $460 million since end of December. That was mainly due to the sanctions, as well as higher power, transportation and raw-material costs.
The penalties imposed on Rusal and its largest shareholder En+ Group Plc, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, hurt shipments and prompted the company to switch output in April to a low-grade of aluminum that it can’t sell. That raised questions about Rusal’s future, though production mostly recovered after the U.S. softened its stance and extended the deadline for winding down operations with the company until October.
Rusal produced 1.87 million metric tons of aluminum and alloys in the first half, but sold only 1.75 million tons, it said in a statement. That’s down from 1.99 million tons of sales in the same period a year earlier. Sales of value-added products fell more than 8 percent year-on-year to 869,000 tons.
One benefit was the impact on metal prices, with aluminum spiking to a seven-year high in April as the sanctions hurt the global supply chain.
“Rusal was helped by higher prices and it was working almost normally in recent months,” said Kirill Chuyko, chief of research at BCS Global Markets. Some clients also bought Rusal metal to stockpile amid uncertainty over whether the winding-down period would be extended, he said.
The U.S. Treasury last week gave investors more time to sell their shares and debt in Rusal and En+, but suggested further negotiations are needed before making progress on lifting sanctions. Deripaska sees U.S. demands on Rusal as unacceptable, according to people familiar with his thinking.
With uncertainty over sanctions remaining the chief risk, Rusal is looking for new markets and clients, as well as trying to ramp up domestic consumption, it said. Russia and former Soviet republics accounted for 29 percent of total sales in the first half, up from 24 percent a year earlier.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>","Tyson beats profit estimates, but trade spats threaten sales","By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), the No. 1 U.S. meat processor, beat analysts' quarterly profit estimates on Monday due to strong demand for beef, but executives warned that trade disputes were threatening the company's pork and chicken businesses.
China is importing less U.S. pork after Beijing imposed tariffs on American shipments as part of an escalating trade war with Washington. Mexico and Canada also implemented levies, leading to oversupply and, subsequently, lower prices for meat in the U.S. market.
Lower prices for pork and beef were also reducing demand for Tyson's chicken, according to the company. 
""Tariffs and trade concerns could continue to impact product pricing,"" Stewart Glendinning, Tyson's chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call.
Last week, Tyson cut its full-year profit forecast, citing uncertainty in trade policies and higher tariffs that have hurt domestic and export prices of meat.
Operating income for the chicken business in the third quarter dropped to $189 million, from $294 million a year earlier, according to the company. Operating income for pork was $67 million, down from $136 million last year.
""We are clearly not satisfied with our results, particularly in chicken,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes said on the call.
Sales increased in Tyson's beef business due to higher exports and increased supplies, according to the company. The unit had a record operating income of $318 million in the quarter, up from $147 million a year earlier, Tyson said.
""Our challenge really comes down to pork and chicken,"" Hayes said.
Tyson shares jumped 3 percent to $59.50 in morning trading, after the stock price fell to approach a two-year low last week.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $541 million, or $1.47 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $447 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $10.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.50 per share.

The Springdale, Arkansas-based company said sales rose 2 percent to $10.05 billion.

The Nasdaq Composite has lost as much as 4.2 percent since reaching a record high on July 25 as investors fled the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). following disappointing earnings. And while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). breached the historic $1 trillion value mark last week, Morgan Stanley warns that this could actually be a signal of the rally in tech reaching a top, posing risks for the broader market.
“When we made the call, feedback was fairly lopsided against us. Phones were not ringing and even those who had sympathy for our views of a poor near-term risk reward in tech could only muster an ‘I see your points, but ... good luck,’ ” Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael J. Wilson said in a note. “Given recent moves lower in parts of tech and challenges to growth and momentum, our inbound has picked up considerably as investors consider these risks.”
The bank’s strategists are sticking with their underweight U.S. tech recommendation, citing lower earnings revisions in some parts of the sector, continued leadership of defensives, as well as the fact that fewer stocks are now spurring the market gains.
The main thrust of their bear call is that the nascent selloff in tech -- which at 26 percent has the highest weighting in the S&P 500 Index -- will likely mark the beginning of a bigger drop in U.S. stocks. Morgan Stanley warned last week that the U.S. equity slump is just starting and that growth stocks-focused portfolios could especially get hurt.
“If we are right, and tech gets its turn on the volatility roller coaster, its market weighting, crowded positioning and overweight in growth and momentum strategies mean the pain will likely spread beyond just the tech sector,” Morgan Stanley strategists wrote.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",EU asks WTO to certify it has removed Airbus subsidies,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The European Union has asked the World Trade Organization to certify that it has complied with WTO rulings on its subsidies for planemaker Airbus, attempting to forestall billions of dollars of U.S. sanctions, a document published by the WTO showed on Monday.
The legal move is the latest step in a 14-year-old trade dispute between the EU and the United States over funding for Airbus (PA:AIR) and its U.S. rival Boeing. (N:BA) 
In May the WTO appeals body ruled that the EU had failed to remove subsidized government development loans for the world's largest airliner, the A380, and Europe's newest long-haul jet, the A350, causing losses for Boeing BA.N and U.S. aerospace workers.
That opened the way for U.S. retaliatory trade sanctions, subject only to a decision by a WTO arbitrator about how big those sanctions should be, which is still pending.
Boeing says Airbus received illegal aid worth $22 billion, including $18 billion in loans from governments. Of these, $9 billion is involved in the outstanding A350 and A380 claims.
Airbus disputes those numbers, saying they overstate the amount of support embedded in the contested loans. It has meanwhile leveled significant subsidy claims against Boeing.
In the latest legal move, the EU said it had informed the WTO in May that it had withdrawn all remaining subsidies and taken appropriate steps to remove their adverse effects, and it wanted a legal ruling to that effect. 
Such a legal ruling would remove the basis for U.S. sanctions.
""The legal basis for this request is that... these measures have resulted in the European Union achieving full compliance, by (i) withdrawing the remaining subsidies, and/or (ii) taking appropriate steps to remove their adverse effects,"" the EU said.

""By taking appropriate steps to bring the measures at issue into conformity with the European Union's WTO obligations... (the EU) has consequently eliminated any nullification or impairment attributable to non-compliance with those recommendations and rulings.""

One of the draft’s provisions calls for the U.S. to “prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of one or more of the Russian financial institutions.” It lists some of the country’s largest lenders: Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Promsvyazbank, Rosselkhozbank and Vnesheconombank. The list also includes Bank of Moscow, which was merged into VTB in 2016, while Vnesheconombank is listed twice in the text, without explanation.
The bill was introduced in the Senate last week by a bipartisan group of legislators, aiming to “impose crushing sanctions and other measures against Putin’s Russia until he ceases and desists meddling in the U.S. electoral process,” according to co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham.
Draft Version
The proposal’s call for sanctions on issues of new Russian sovereign debt had drawn investor attention, although the U.S. Treasury in February came out publicly in opposition to that idea, warning it would have broad market impact.
With President Donald Trump calling for closer ties with Russia, the outlook for passage of the bill remains uncertain. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for tough measures against Russia in the wake of last month’s summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Of course, this is just a draft version and it is only reasonable that the arch Russia-hawks in the Congress would start negotiations for new legislation with the harshest possible terms following the recent meeting of Presidents Trump and Putin,” Ermolenko said in an emailed note. “But even so, the document clearly shows the determination to go further than before in order to cause damage for Russia.”
The last round of U.S. sanctions, imposed in April, battered the ruble and prices on government debt. The Bank of Russia has accelerated its preparation to tougher measures from the U.S. after those restrictions were imposed. In the months that followed, Russia drastically cut its holdings of U.S. Treasuries."
1301,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Honda to recall 96,900 SUVs in China, runs checks on two models","BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) on Monday said it will recall 96,900 Avancier sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in China, due to a cold-climate engine problem that has already led to hundreds of thousands of its vehicles being recalled earlier this year.
The midsize Avancier is produced and sold in the world's biggest auto market by one of Honda's two local joint ventures. Honda said it was looking at two other models in China to see if they were facing the same problem.
The recall is linked to a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine's lubricant oil pan. The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car's check-engine light came on, Honda has said.
This does not affect the engine's performance and there have been no reports of accidents because of this particular issue, the automaker added.
Earlier this year, the cold-climate engine issue prompted the Tokyo-headquartered automaker to recall 130,000 of its popular CR-V SUV models and 294,500 Civic cars in China.
The company is currently studying to see if the same issue is affecting the Honda Jade car and the UR-V crossover SUV, Honda spokesman Zhu Linjie said.
""If it is so determined that these models are also being affected by the same engine issue, Honda will announce measures to deal with it,"" Zhu told Reuters.
The quality issue has led to a slump in Honda's business in the country. Its sales fell for a sixth straight month in July, down 7.8 percent from a year earlier to 105,960 vehicles. 

During the first seven months of 2018, Honda's sales volume in China fell 6.6 percent from a year ago to 715,060 vehicles.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Vietnam jails former bankers in graft crackdown,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam handed lengthy prison terms on Wednesday to several former bankers accused of mismanagement, amid a crackdown on corruption in the communist-ruled country.
In the early 2010s, Vietnam's banking system was rocked by a string of mismanagement scandals and under-regulated lending, and is still reeling from nonperforming loans.
Pham Cong Danh, former chairman of Vietnam Construction Bank, privately owned until a central bank takeover, received a 20-year prison sentence, while its former chief executive, Phan Thanh Mai, got 10 years, the Ministry of Public Security said.
They were convicted of ""deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences"" at the end of a two-week trial by a court in Ho Chi Minh City, the ministry said on its official website.
""The violations of Danh and his accomplices caused damage of 6.1 trillion dong to the Vietnam Construction Bank, leaving adverse impacts on the banking system,"" the VnExpress online newspaper cited the jury as saying. The figure is equivalent to nearly $262 million. 
The court also sentenced Tram Be, former deputy chairman of Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank, to four years in prison on the same charges, police said in the statement.
Terms ranging from two years of probation to 10 years in prison were also handed to 43 accomplices, it added. 
Danh, 53, was sentenced in 2016 to 30 years in prison in a separate trial, accused of illegally withdrawing more than $400 million from the bank.
Authorities have since stepped up their graft crackdown, leading to the arrests of dozens of high-profile business figures and officials.
Last month, a former deputy governor of the central bank was jailed for three years, the most senior banking official put on trial in the crackdown.

Dang Thanh Binh, 64, and four accomplices were accused of ""lack of responsibility"", leading to losses at Vietnam Construction Bank.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Shares struggle as trade fears weigh on sentiment,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares struggled on Monday as fears of the escalating U.S.-China trade conflict outweighed the boost to sentiment from Chinese authorities' intervention last week to shore up its currency.
Disappointing corporate earnings in the European banking sector added to the cautious start to the week's trading. 
Chinese state media launched an unusually personal attack against U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies on Monday, saying Trump's trade ""extortion"" would not work. 
It also sought to reassure investors about Chinese economic strength as the months-long dispute rattles financial markets and raises deepening worries about the impact on the real economy. 
After an initial rise, Asian shares earlier succumbed to selling pressure, with Chinese shares sliding into negative territory. 
European shares were also mixed. The pan-European share index (STOXX) dropped 0.06 percent while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.34 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) was virtually flat, down 0.02 percent.
The biggest plunge in German industrial orders in nearly 18-months added to pressure on German stocks.
The weakness in European shares followed a more than 1 percent drop in the Chinese blue-chip index (CSI300) and Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite (SSEC). Japan's Nikkei (N225) and South Korea's Kospi index (KS11) also dropped.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries edged down 0.08 percent. 
""In his latest Twitter tirades and his latest appearances in front of his supporters the U.S. president has indicated something akin to a ""strategy"" behind his trade war policy,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""The trade war will remain in place regardless of how much the Chinese cave in.""
The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict.
At the same time, Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is ""working far better than anyone ever anticipated"", citing losses in China's stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could ""go up dramatically"" once trade deals were renegotiated.
The People's Bank of China's intervention last week to impose a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward contracts had the desired impact of halting the slide in the yuan.
In offshore markets, the Chinese currency fell 0.1 percent against the dollar to 6.8562  on Monday, but was well away from the 6.91 weak point the yuan had plumbed last week. 
The yuan has been one of the main casualties from the trade conflict, with many investors speculating that the PBOC was happy for the renminbi to weaken to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs. 
Traders saw the PBOC effort as an attempt by Chinese authorities to show they wanted stability, and some interpreted it as a conciliatory move to nudge the Americans towards the negotiating table.
Other said the intervention would not stop further yuan weakness with Washington and Beijing at loggerheads over tariffs.
The dollar index, which has benefited as investors rush to safety, rose 0.2 percent to 95.291 (DXY), close to a 2-1/2 week high.
U.S. jobs data on Friday, although weaker than expected, underlined that the world's largest economy is growing robustly, supporting synchronized global growth that had underpinned sentiment towards risk assets before the eruption of the trade dispute. 
Markets are increasingly nervous about whether U.S. growth may have peaked. 
""Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth,"" said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Australia.
The euro (EUR=) inched down to $1.155.
The British pound  slid towards a fresh 10-month low after the UK trade minister warned Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit.
Gold  hovered near 17-month lows and was last at $1,211.89. 

Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 0.5 percent to $73.55, while U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) added 0.7 percent to $68.94 a barrel.

Okada is on bail, said the company, which makes pin-ball style ""pachinko"" machines and operates a casino in the Philippines.
The Japanese billionaire lost his board position at Universal last year after it accused him of misappropriating $20 million. Okada has previously denied this. He was also ousted as a director of Hong Kong investment company Okada Holdings, which controls Universal.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:59AM ET</span>",Rising costs and U.S. settlement crimp HSBC's first-half profit,"By Alun John and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) posted a small increase in first-half pretax profit, as rising expenses from investments in a new growth strategy and a $765 million settlement for alleged mis-selling of U.S. mortgage securities ate into higher revenues.
Shares in Europe's biggest bank dipped in London as investors and analysts await clearer signs of progress in the new HSBC management's strategy of shifting into growth mode after years of shrinking its global empire.
HSBC reported on Monday a pretax profit of $10.7 billion in the six months through June, up 4.6 percent from the year-ago period.
As the bank spent on hiring more frontline staff and expanding digital capabilities, its costs climbed 6 percent to $17.5 billion.
""HSBC is struggling to convince that its current restructuring to pivot the group toward Asia is delivering the hoped for pick-up in growth,"" said Steve Clayton, manager of the  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) UK Income Shares fund. 
HSBC Chief Executive John Flint, who started in the job in February, set out a three-year plan in June to invest $15-17 billion in areas such as technology and in China.
""We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share, and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns,"" Flint said in a statement. 
Flint is part of a new management duo at the top of HSBC after Mark Tucker joined as chairman last October.
ASIA SHINES
The main points of the bank's refreshed strategy came as little surprise to HSBC investors, with the focus squarely on further expansion in China and its prosperous southern Pearl River Delta region in particular.
The bank is also seeking to expand further in the British mortgage market as one of eight new strategic targets.
Pretax profits for the first half from Asia jumped 23 percent to $9.4 billion, representing 88 per cent of the group total.
The bank has not seen any impact yet either on its own performance or that of its customers from rising U.S.-China trade tensions, Flint said, but is concerned about how tit-for-tat tariffs could affect investor confidence.
""I'd be concerned the general rhetoric has a bad impact on investor sentiment and investors go risk-off,"" Flint told Reuters.
HSBC's retail banking and wealth management, and commercial banking divisions performed most strongly in the first half, Flint said, adding both continued to gain from a positive interest rate environment.
U.S. COSTS
The bank's strong performance in its core Asian markets was marred by tumbling profits elsewhere.
HSBC said it has set aside $765 million to resolve a civil claim by the U.S. Justice Department over allegations the bank missold toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007-8 financial crisis.
The settlement wiped out almost all of the bank's profits for the first half of the year in North America, where it is trying to turn around a U.S. business that has for years underperformed.
Part of that plan includes a push into the U.S. credit card and personal loans market, where it faces a battle against heavily entrenched domestic competition.
Flint told Reuters it is too soon to see any results from that new strategy.
HSBC's shares are unlikely to climb significantly until the bank can show its revenues rising above increased costs, analysts and trader said, describing a trend known as 'positive jaws' in city parlance.
""Our business plans do see us get to positive jaws at the end of the year,"" Flint told analysts on a conference call, citing the benefits of rising interest rates on the bank's profits as one contributor to that outlook.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares floundered on Monday in cautious trading as Europe's biggest bank HSBC disappointed investors, while doubts over a planned $87 billion tie-up with Praxair (NYSE:PX) sank shares in German industrial gases group Linde.
Falls in HSBC (L:HSBA) and Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) following their results dragged the banking sector (SX7P) down, while chemicals and industrials shares also weighed on the pan-European STOXX 600, down 0.1 percent by 0830 GMT. 
HSBC shares fell 1.1 percent after it reported disappointing earnings due to rising expenses from investments in a new growth strategy and a $765 million provision against sale of U.S. mortgage securities.
""On revenues, we note on the positive side that loan growth continues to be very strong,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said. ""On the negative side, we note that the group has lowered its expected net interest income sensitivity to U.S.$ rates.""
Banco BPM shares fell 8.6 percent after the Italian lender's earnings missed forecasts due to higher than expected loan loss provisions, and its capital buffer suffered due to sharp falls in Italian government bonds during May's political upheaval.
""CET1 (core equity tier 1) fell 67 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 10.83%, with the expected BTP headwind exacerbated by the lack of room to absorb additional DTAs (deferred tax assets) and reduced thresholds,"" said UBS analysts.
Overall Europe's banks have performed quite well in the second-quarter earnings season, with stronger than expected earnings growth and profitability. 
M&A disappointments hit some shares hard. 
Linde (DE:LIN1) sank 9.1 percent to a 3-1/2 month low after it said regulators may ask it and its U.S. rival Praxair to sell more assets in order to get antitrust approval for their merger.
""The probability for the merger has decreased,"" said Baader Helvea analysts, adding however they still believe it will close successfully.
The heavyweight stock dragged Germany's DAX down to underperform peers, declining 0.2 percent. Linde also pulled the chemicals sector index (SX4P) down 1.3 percent.
Germany also suffered the biggest drop in industrial orders in 1-1/2 years, driving industrial giants  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) down 0.8 to 0.9 percent.
British serviced offices group IWG (L:IWG) also suffered from M&A pain, sinking 21 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after the firm ended takeover talks with private equity firms Terra Firma, TDR and Starwood.
Among gainers, Finnish refiner Neste (HE:NESTE) rose 4 percent, recovering from Friday's fall after results. Brokers Inderes and Kepler Cheuvreux raised their target prices on the stock. 
A target price hike from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also boosted  Galapagos  (AS:GLPG) shares up 4.5 percent. 
A downgrade to ""hold"" from HSBC analysts sent shares in German lighting group Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) down 4.4 percent. The broker cut estimates to reflect lower growth and margins at the firm's Opto and Specialty Lighting.
Overall second-quarter earnings for MSCI Europe firms are expected to grow 7.8 percent year-on-year in euro terms, while they're seen growing 2.5 percent year-on-year for MSCI EMU. 
Europe remains an unpopular region for stocks investors, though some indicated the outflows could turn soon as companies deliver good results and analysts revise their earnings expectations up.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 04:48AM ET</span>",Linde shares drop as Praxair merger hits U.S. antitrust hurdle,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shares in Linde (DE:LIN1) plunged more than 8 percent on Monday after the industrial gases group's planned $87 billion merger with Praxair (N:PX) was put in doubt by demands from U.S. antitrust regulators.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is asking for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and the watchdog also wants prospective buyers to meet certain other requirements, the German industrial gases group said in a statement published just after midnight on Sunday.
""Linde and Praxair are analysing these expectations to assess their scope and to evaluate how they could be implemented to achieve a timely clearance of the business combination,"" it said.
The planned combination in an all-shares merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP).
The companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in sales or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty.
Based on its discussions with the FTC and other antitrust regulators, it said there was now a higher probability that the two companies would need to sell assets exceeding the agreed threshold.
The two companies are now evaluating how the regulators' expectations could be fulfilled in a mutually acceptable manner to achieve a timely clearance, it said, adding they remained in a constructive dialogue with the regulators and with each other.
The companies are running against a Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal, dictated by German financial market rules.
Markus Mayer, analyst at Baader Helvea, said more asset sales would reduce benefits of the merger, and also said a closing before the Oct. 24 had become less likely.
The shares were down 8.3 percent at 192.70 euros at 0718 GMT. 
Laurence Alexander, an analyst at brokerage Jefferies, said the merger parties would now only be able to get a relatively low price for additional divestments, but put the probability of the deal closing at more than 85 percent.
Reuters reported last month that the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth antitrust review and following the agreed sale of Praxair's European gases business to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091).
In addition, Linde has agreed to sell North and South American assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC in a deal that will raise around $3.3 billion.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>","Haier sees costs spike at GE arm amid steel tariffs, U.S.-China trade spat","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Haier Group said rising steel prices amid hefty U.S. import tariffs was driving up costs for its business in America, and warned that consumers stood most to lose from a mounting trade spat between the world's top two economies.
Louisville, Kentucky-headquartered GE Appliances, which Haier bought in 2016 from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), has already raised its prices twice this year to cope with rising costs, said Haier's overseas managing director, Li Pan.
""Currently, the challenge is inflation, not only from steel but also the other commodities,"" he told Reuters.
""It has hit our bottom line, not only inflation but also the whole environment is getting tougher and tougher, so to mitigate that impact, actually, GE Appliances increased their retail price twice this year.""
Haier's comments add to a growing clamor of voices from companies worldwide warning about the impact of U.S. metal tariffs. Home appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) and automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford have all flagged that steel costs have hit, or could impact, their bottom lines.
U.S. steel prices have leapt after President Donald Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports of the metal in March in a bid to protect domestic producers.
Trump has rattled the world trade order this year by seeking to renegotiate the terms of some of the United States' trading relationships, in particular with China.
Washington has recently proposed to slap a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, following an earlier, initial round. China late on Friday unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
Haier's Li said 5 percent of GE Appliances' products sold in the United States were imported from China and added that these items, which include window air conditioners, could face U.S tariffs. The company is hopeful these products could be removed from the U.S. tariff list, Li added.
But consumers would, in the end, have to pay for any tariffs imposed, he said. ""If the tariff is 20 percent we need to increase the price by 20 percent, no other choice.""
GE Appliances accounts for about 30 percent of Haier's revenue, which was 159.2 billion yuan ($23.32 billion) in 2017.
The Chinese firm, which also owns New Zealand's Fisher & Paykel, is ranked by Euromonitor to have the largest share of the global major appliances market.
Haier is also considering acquisitions in Europe where it currently only has a 2.3 percent market share, Li said, adding that the company had already shortlisted some names. He declined to provide any details but said the targets were high-end brands which could include manufacturers of built-in kitchens.

UK stocks have outperformed their euro zone peers by around 3 percent since end-April as investors were attracted by relatively cheap valuations and their strong commodity exposure.
But Credit Suisse said it believes the sterling price of oil has peaked and the boost provided by a weaker currency to internationally-exposed UK-listed firms might be over as the country's economic growth outlook stabilizes and a soft Brexit is likely. 
""The UK market is now overbought: The equity market underperforms 70 percent of the time this happens,"" analysts at the Swiss bank said in a note on Monday. 
Among the possible headwinds to the UK market, they also cited recent gains made by the opposition Labour party in polls, saying there is a 60 percent chance of a Labour government in 2022.

Nevertheless, Credit Suisse said valuations of British equities were still reasonably attractive.

Trade concerns remained in focus after China announced another set of tariffs on U.S. goods while Chinese state media continued to accuse the Trump administration over their recent trade policies.
The latest criticism from the state-owned People's Daily newspaper accused U.S. President Donald Trump and said he was starring in his own ""street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation"".
The newspaper added that Trump's plan to force others to play along with his drama is ""wishful thinking"", arguing that the U.S. had escalated trade friction with China and turned international trade into a ""zero-sum game"".
""Governing a country is not like doing business,"" the paper said, adding that Trump's actions imperiled the national credibility of the United States.

The Chinese yuan received some focus after the People’s Bank of China said on Friday that it would impose a 20% reserve requirement on some trading of foreign-exchange forward contracts, effectively making it more expensive to short the yuan.
China said on Friday that it would impose tariffs, ranging from 5% to 35%, on $60 billion in U.S. goods that include many agriculture-related goods if the U.S. proceeded with placing more tariffs on Chinese imports.
The warnings came after U.S. President Donald Trump urged U.S. Trade Representative to consider raising the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods to 25% from the initial 10% earlier this month.
Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in an interview with Bloomberg over the weekend that Trump would keep adding pressure to China.
“We’ve said many times: no tariffs, no tariff barriers, no subsidies. We want to see trade reforms. China is not delivering, OK?,” Kudlow said on Friday. “Their economy’s weak, their currency is weak, people are leaving the country. Don’t underestimate President Trump’s determination to follow through.”

The JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). chief executive officer said Saturday people should be prepared to deal with the benchmark 10-year bond yield at 5 percent or higher.
“I think rates should be 4 percent today,” Dimon said Saturday at the Aspen Institute’s 25th Annual Summer Celebration Gala. “You better be prepared to deal with rates 5 percent or higher - it’s a higher probability than most people think.”
The 3 percent level is still providing stiff resistance for the 10-year Treasury yield this year. It briefly rose through the mark last week before falling back for the fourth time this year. That’s despite a U.S. jobless rate below 4 percent, economic growth above 4 percent, and a rare surge in late-cycle government borrowing.
The current bull market could “actually go for 2 or 3 more years” because the economy is still doing quite well and markets usually turn right before the economy, Dimon said.
Cyber attacks are “probably the biggest risk” to the U.S. today, though banks are quite well protected, Dimon said.
“We’re very, very protected,” he said.
The JPMorgan CEO reiterated comments made last year on Bitcoin, calling cryptocurrencies a “scam” and saying he had “no interest” in the world’s largest digital currency. He suggested governments may move to shut down the currencies, because of an inability to control them.
Dimon had urged investors to prepare for higher rates in an interview in May, given the possibility growth and inflation could prove fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than anticipated, and the increase in financing by the U.S. Treasury.

Moonves has said that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"" decades ago, which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and had never used his position to harm anyone's career.
CBS hired two law firms and appointed former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White to lead a probe into the allegations and the broader culture at CBS. It also set up a special board committee, recusing Moonves from the investigation but leaving him in his job as CBS chief.
Shares of CBS have fallen 7 percent from their opening price on July 27, closing at $53.16 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
Questions about Moonves and CBS' workplace culture dominated Kahl's session and overshadowed the network's effort to promote its lineup for the fall television season.
Kahl said CBS was ""committed to a collaborative, inclusive and safe workplace.""
""I'm not saying we're perfect, no large company is,"" he said. ""There is always room for improvement.""
Kahl said several female executives approached him after the New Yorker article was published and told him they were ""dismayed"" by what they read because ""it's not their experience.""

""All came to me and said they felt, at least CBS Entertainment, is a nurturing, welcoming environment,"" he said. ""Almost all of our department heads are women. They feel supported.""

""In the individual risk business, where we can see the risks exactly, we will in future in principle no longer insure new coal-fired power plants or mines in industrial countries,"" Joachim Wenning added in a commentary to be published in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Monday.
Policymakers are pushing companies to do more to help meet a target, agreed in Paris in 2015, to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Investors are increasingly using their financial muscle to reward those at the forefront of that transition.
 Swiss Re  (S:SRENH), world number two by share value, said in July it would not reinsure any company for which thermal coal represents more than 30 percent of its business, following French peer  Scor  (PA:SCOR).
Despite being a vocal supporter of the Paris deal, Munich Re had said as recently as last month that it did not plan to copy Swiss Re in limiting its underwriting of coal companies.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2018 07:01PM ET</span>",Linde says regulators likely to demand more divestitures in Praxair deal,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial gases group Linde (DE:LIN1) said it and U.S. rival Praxair (N:PX) may need to sell more assets than anticipated to secure antitrust approval for their planned $87 billion tie-up, which could scupper the deal.
The planned combination in an all-shares merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP).
But the companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than $3.7 billion in sales or $1.1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty.
Linde said on Sunday it was informed that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had ""expressed expectations with regards to further divestiture commitments and prospective purchasers which are considered required for a merger clearance,"" it said.
Based on its discussions with the FTC and other antitrust regulators, it said there was now a higher probability that the two companies would need to commit to selling assets exceeding the agreed threshold.
The two companies are now evaluating how the regulators' expectations could be fulfilled in a mutually acceptable manner to achieve a timely clearance of the planned merger, it said, adding they remained in a constructive dialogue with the regulators and with each other.
Reuters reported last month that the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth antitrust review and following the agreed sale of Praxair's European gases business to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091).

In addition, Linde agreed to sell North and South American assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC in a deal that will raise around $3.3 billion.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, on Saturday said quarterly operating profit rose 67 percent, as insurance underwriting rebounded and several business units benefited from a growing economy.
Results easily topped analyst forecasts. Underwriting profit at the Geico auto insurance unit more than quintupled, the BNSF railroad benefited from demand to ship consumer products, grain, petroleum and steel, and the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership financed more vehicle purchases.
""Good results across the board,"" said Doug Kass, who runs the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc in Palm Beach, Florida. He has previously sold Berkshire shares short, betting on a decline, but is not doing so now.
Berkshire also said second-quarter net income nearly tripled, though that reflected a new accounting rule requiring it to report unrealized investment gains with earnings. Buffett says the rule distorts net results and can mislead investors.
Operating profit rose to $6.89 billion, or roughly $4,190 per Class A share, from $4.12 billion, or $2,505 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of $3,387 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income rose to $12.01 billion, or $7,301 per Class A share, from $4.26 billion, or $2,592 per share, a year earlier.
Results also reflected a decline in Berkshire's effective income tax rate to 20 percent from 28.9 percent, following last year's cut in the federal corporate tax rate.
Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, chemicals, energy, food and retail, industrial parts, railroad and other sectors.
Their day-to-day operations are overseen by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, each seen by investors as a possible successor to Buffett, 87, as chief executive. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, handle major capital allocation decisions.
BITING INTO APPLE
Book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and a preferred measure of growth for Buffett, rose 3 percent in the quarter to $217,677.
Berkshire also ended June with $111.1 billion of cash and equivalents, some of which Buffett could use to repurchase stock under a new policy giving him and Munger more freedom to buy back stock they considered undervalued.
The change reflected Buffett's inability to find big acquisitions since January 2016, when Berkshire paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts.
Buffett has not bought back stock in 2018, but has spent money on stocks, and Berkshire said it ended June with a $47.2 billion stake in Apple Inc.
Apple's share price at the time suggests that Berkshire may have bought about 15 million Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the second quarter, on top of 239.6 million it already owned.
The iPhone maker this week became the first U.S.-listed company whose stock market value topped $1 trillion.
Berkshire spent $6.08 billion on equities in the quarter. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at $304,671, or 7 percent below their Jan. 29 peak, while Class B shares closed at $200.24, or 8 percent below their peak the same day.
GEICO, BNSF
Insurance underwriting profit totaled $943 million, compared with a year earlier $22 million loss.
Geico's pre-tax underwriting profit rose to $673 million from $119 million, after it boosted rates in response to rising accident and storm losses.
Float, or insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, ended June at $116 billion.
BNSF profit surged 37 percent to $1.31 billion, as economic growth led to more shipments of consumer goods, and demand for fertilizer, grain, petroleum products, plastics, sand and steel.
Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing units rose 29 percent, reflecting demand at Precision Castparts, Berkshire Hathaway Automotive and the German motorcycle accessories unit Detlev Louis Motorrad.

Meanwhile, tax credits for wind-powered electricity generation helped boost profit 14 percent at Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

By Valentina Za and Andrea Mandala
MILAN (Reuters) - The head of Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) said on Friday the mid-sized Italian bank will have to solve a governance crisis before it can tap markets to rebuild its capital as demanded by supervisors.
Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino, however, said the bank could lift its total capital close to a minimum regulatory requirement by the end of the year even if it remained unable to issue a hybrid bond.
Boardroom conflicts have thrust Carige, Italy's last remaining large problem bank, into the spotlight, putting at risk a turnaround which was just starting to bear fruit.
The European Central Bank has given Genoa-based Carige until the end of the year to close a capital shortfall, or to start seeking a merger with a stronger peer.
Carige, Italy's 10th largest bank, is betting on asset sales to boost its total capital ratio to 13 percent, up from the current 11.9 percent and close to a 13.125 percent threshold set by the ECB.
""With just a 12 basis point gap I feel we will have done our homework ... and by no longer arguing we can maybe find someone who has confidence in us and buys a 200 million euro bond, which would not surprise me,"" Fiorentino told analysts.
Carige must rebuild its second-tier capital after using its hybrid debt as part of capital raising measures in December. 
But a string of resignations in recent weeks has laid bare a clash between Fiorentino and top shareholder Vittorio Malacalza, who built a 20.6 percent stake in Carige, spending 377 million euros to back three successive cash calls since 2014.
Fiorentino took over as CEO a year ago after Malacalza pushed out his last two predecessors.
Malacalza last month said current top management could not continue to lead Carige, prompting the ECB to take aim at the bank's frequent management changes.
Malacalza, who was Carige's deputy chairman and then its chairman by default when Giuseppe Tesauro stepped down in June, said on Friday he was bringing forward his resignation from the role with immediate effect.
He had previously resigned with effect from a shareholder meeting on Sept. 20 that will appoint a new board.
On that occasion, Malacalza is expected to face off rival investor Raffaele Mincione, an Italian financier who this year bought an initial 5.4 percent stake in Carige.
Mincione backs Fiorentino and is campaigning to win over other investors, sources have said, but it is still unclear who will back his slate of board nominees at the Sept. 20 meeting.
Carige reported a 27 million euro loss for the second quarter on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An appeals court that is hearing the U.S. Justice Department's fight with AT&T (N:T) over its merger with Time Warner agreed on Friday to allow the release of transcripts of bench conferences that the public was unable to listen in on during the trial in a lower court.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said in an order on Friday that the government would be allowed to release transcripts of the conversations that generally occurred between Judge Richard Leon, who tried the case, and one or more lawyers from the Justice Department, AT&T and Time Warner. 
A loud hissing noise was played over the public address system in the court during the conferences to ensure that reporters and others in the courtroom could not hear what was said.
Judge Leon ruled in June that the Justice Department was wrong to ask that a $85.4 billion merger of AT&T, which owns DirecTV, and Time Warner be blocked. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.
The Justice Department has appealed but no date has been set for when the appeals court will hear the case. The deal closed on June 14. 
AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.

The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump.

(Reuters) - National Stores Inc, an off-price U.S. apparel and housewares store operating under banners including Fallas and Factory 2-U, is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
National Stores did not respond to a request for comment.
The move would make National Stores the latest casualty of the bankruptcy wave sweeping the U.S. retail sector, as shoppers increasingly turn to the internet for their purchases. Girls accessories seller Claire's Stores Inc and fashion shoe wholesaler Nine West Holdings Inc are among the brick-and-mortar retailers that have filed for bankruptcy this year.
National Stores plans to shutter at least 70 of its approximately 350 stores in bankruptcy, said the sources, asking not to be named because the family-owned company's plans were not yet public. National Stores may also seek to find a buyer during the bankruptcy process, which will be overseen by a Delaware court, the sources added.
National Stores was founded in downtown Los Angeles in 1962, and sells back-to-school items such as uniforms, hospital scrubs and shoes for as low as $3.99, according to its website. 
An affiliate of National Stores acquired some of the intellectual property assets of Anna's Linens, a home goods seller, during its 2015 bankruptcy, according to court papers. National Stores still runs some Anna's Linens shops, according to its website.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday rejected a claim by the National Rifle Association that his efforts to get banks and insurers to stop doing business with the group threatened its ability to advocate for gun rights.
In an amended version of a lawsuit it had filed on May 11, the NRA said New York's ""blacklisting"" had already cost it insurance coverage, and would ""imminently"" deprive it of basic banking and other financial services ""essential to the NRA's corporate existence and its advocacy mission.""
But in a Friday afternoon filing seeking to dismiss the case, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood downplayed those concerns.
She said the activity by Cuomo and state financial services superintendent Maria Vullo cited by the NRA did not violate the group's constitutional free speech or due process rights.
Underwood acknowledged Cuomo's and the NRA's ""longstanding history of strong disagreement"" on gun control, but said the lawsuit did not allege that New York ""directly inhibited the NRA from expressing its opposition to gun regulation. Instead, it presents a speculative and implausible 'parade of horribles.'""
The NRA had sued Cuomo, Vullo and the state Department of Financial Services after the governor in April ordered that office to urge insurers and state-chartered banks to review their relationships with guns rights groups.
Then in early May, Vullo's office fined insurance broker Lockton Cos $7 million and Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd $1.3 million over their involvement with the NRA-branded ""Carry Guard"" insurance program, which it said unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for ""intentional"" acts of wrongdoing.
William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, said in a statement that there was little question that Cuomo and Vullo engaged in ""pure viewpoint discrimination,"" and called their dismissal request ""a misguided attempt to deflect from the fact that defendants overstepped their legal and regulatory authority.""
Cuomo, a Democrat running for a third term as governor, issued a statement on Friday in which he accused the NRA of trying to ""play the victim."" 
He added, ""If I could have put the NRA out of business, I would have done it 20 years ago.""
The NRA is seeking through its lawsuit to end New York's alleged illegal interference with its rights and operations, and has until Aug. 24 to respond to Friday's filing.
A Sept. 10 hearing is scheduled before U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy in the state capital of Albany.

The case is National Rifle Association of America v Cuomo et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of New York, No. 18-00566.

The new disclosures add to Wells Fargo's numerous regulatory penalties, private lawsuits and remediation efforts. Most stem from a sales practices scandal that has touched on all of the bank's major business units.
The tax inquiries are being conducted by multiple agencies, which Wells Fargo did not name in its 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They focus on how the bank purchased or negotiated the purchase of the credits in connection with financing of low-income housing developments.
Representatives for the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The $8 million accrual is intended for roughly 625 borrowers who should have qualified for a loan modification under a program the Treasury Department set up in 2009 to help Americans who were struggling to make mortgage payments. 
An error in Wells Fargo's underwriting tool improperly excluded those borrowers, 400 of whom eventually had their homes foreclosed upon, the bank said. 

The bank also updated disclosures on issues it has discovered in auto lending, wealth management, fiduciary and custody accounts, foreign exchange trading, mortgage rate-lock extensions, ""add-on"" products like identity theft protection, and frozen or closed bank accounts.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) are locked in a tight race to become the second publicly-listed U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion stock market value after Apple (O:AAPL) became the first to touch the 13-digit milestone.
Wall Street's optimism about last year's 10th anniversary iPhone, coupled with record share buybacks, have propelled Apple's stock 34 percent higher over the past 12 months, pushing the company's stock market value above $1 trillion on Thursday.
The Cupertino, California company's shares added another 0.3 percent on Friday, putting its market capitalization at $1.005 trillion.
Apple's 12-month gain is far better than the S&P 500's 14 percent increase over the past year, but it pales beside Amazon's astounding 85 percent surge, propelled by the online retailer's and cloud computing heavyweight's scorchingly fast revenue and profit growth.
Amazon is now the second-largest publicly-listed U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $889 billion, followed closely by Alphabet and Microsoft, at $856 billion and $830 billion respectively.
Google-owner Alphabet's stock has risen 32 percent over the past 12 months, and is up nearly 18 percent in 2018. 
Together with Facebook (O:FB), the five largest U.S. companies account for 15 percent of the S&P 500. (Graphic: Outsized Market Weight https:// Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan said he owns shares of Amazon mostly because of its dominance of the cloud computing industry, a business that grew 42 percent in the June quarter and provided most of Amazon's operating profits. ""Of the three companies, I'd say Amazon will get to $1 trillion next,"" Morgan said. (Graphic: Alphabet and Microsoft are quickly closing the gap: https:// Average analyst price targets put Apple's stock market value at $1.05 trillion, Amazon at $1.02 trillion, Alphabet at $970 billion and Microsoft at $953 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But Amazon's market capitalization would overtake Apple's later in 2018 if both companies shares were to continue their 12-month growth pace. (Graphic: Beyond $1 Trillion Market Cap: https://

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","China tariffs on LNG, oil aim at U.S. energy dominance agenda","By Scott DiSavino and Chen Aizhu
NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's proposed tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports opens a new front in the trade war between the two countries, at a time when the White House is trumpeting growing U.S. energy export prowess. 
China included LNG for the first time in its list of proposed tariffs on Friday, the same day that its biggest U.S. crude oil buyer, Sinopec, suspended U.S. crude oil imports due to the dispute, according to three sources familiar with the situation.
On Friday, China announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, and warned of further measures, signaling it will not back down in a protracted trade war with Washington.
That could cast a shadow over U.S. President Donald Trump's energy dominance ambitions. The administration has repeatedly said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to global allies, while Washington is rolling back domestic regulations to encourage more oil and gas production. 
“The juxtaposition here is clear: it is hard to become an energy superpower when one of the biggest energy consumers in the world is raising barriers to consume that energy. It makes it very difficult,"" said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
The United States is the world's largest exporter of fuels such as gasoline and diesel, and is poised to become one of the largest exporters of LNG by 2019. U.S. LNG exports were worth $3.3 billion in 2017. China is the world's biggest crude oil importer. 
China had curtailed its imports of U.S. LNG over the last two months, even before its formal inclusion in the list of potential tariffs. It had also become the largest buyer of U.S. crude oil outside of Canada, but Kpler, which tracks worldwide oil shipments, shows crude cargoes to China have also dropped off in recent months.
It comes at a time when the United States has several large-scale LNG export facilities under construction, and after Trump's late 2017 trip to China that included executives from U.S. LNG companies.
China became the world's second-biggest LNG importer in 2017, as it buys more gas in order to wean the country off dirty coal to reduce pollution.
""This will not affect the trade but will simply make gas more expensive to Chinese consumers,"" said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian Inc (O:TELL), one of several companies seeking to build a new LNG export terminal.
China, which purchased almost 14 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped between February 2016 and May 2018, has taken delivery from just one vessel that left the United States in June and none so far in July, compared with 17 in the first five months of the year.
""The U.S. gas industry will be much harder hit by this as China imports only a small volume whereas U.S. suppliers see China as a major future market,"" said Lin Boqiang, professor on energy studies at Xiamen University in China.
(For an interactive graphic on U.S. LNG shipments to China, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2n9bQKn)
Meanwhile, according to Kpler, crude exports to China dropped to an estimated 226,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, after reaching a record 445,000 bpd in March. Sinopec, through its Unipec trading arm, is the largest buyer of U.S. crude.
China would likely hike purchases from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq if the tariffs slowed U.S. flows, said Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets division at the International Energy Agency.
There will be ""others who will be offering barrels to China, so it could find itself able to replace lost volumes from the U.S.,"" Atkinson said. 
With LNG demand expected to skyrocket over the next 12 to 18 months, there are still some two dozen firms seeking to build new LNG export terminals in the United States and tariffs may limit their ability to secure sufficient buyers to finance their proposed projects.
""Cheniere continues to see China as an important growth market and LNG as a ‘win-win’ between the United States and China,"" said Eben Burnham-Snyder, a spokesman at  Cheniere Energy Inc  (A:LNG), which owns one of the two LNG export terminals currently operating in the United States. He added they do not see tariffs as productive.
One project being developed is in Alaska, which would carry natural gas through an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline across the state to a terminal that would convert it to LNG to take it to China. 
The $43 billion project is still in development, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corp said on Friday that it believes the ""current trade tensions between the United States and China will be resolved well in advance of Alaska LNG exports to China.""

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street gains as upbeat earnings trump trade jitters,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Friday as upbeat earnings helped investors shrug off heightened trade anxieties and weaker-than-expected July jobs growth.
For the week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained ground, up 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, while the Dow was essentially flat. The S&P 500 notched its fifth straight weekly gain, its longest such streak of the year.
The second-quarter reporting season nears its final stretch with 406 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 78.6 percent of which came in above Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.
China launched its latest salvo in the ongoing trade spat, unveiling new tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some aircraft.
Earlier this week, Chinese officials promised retribution after the Trump administration proposed hiking tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of goods imported from China.
A report from the Labor Department showed the U.S. economy added 157,000 jobs in July, fewer than the 190,000 economists expected, though the unemployment rate edged down to 3.9 percent.
Other data showed the U.S. trade deficit surged 7.3 percent in June to $46.3 billion, its biggest increase since November 2016. The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened by 0.9 percent to $33.5 billion.
""We have the trade numbers and we have the continuation of the ongoing trade war with China, which is not a good thing, obviously,"" said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group.
""Some of the benefits of the tax cut will be wearing off, in addition we have this trade skirmish, so in my opinion investors will be quite skittish in the second half of the year,"" Geraghty added. 
Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose modestly a day after becoming the first publicly-traded U.S. company to reach $1 trillion in market value.
The S&P consumer staples sector (SPLRCS) rose 1.2 percent. Its advance was led by Kraft Heinz (O:KHC), up 8.6 percent after the packaged foods company topped quarterly profit and revenue estimates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 136.42 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,462.58, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.13 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,840.35 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 9.33 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,812.02.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy (SPNY) was the sole percentage loser. Oil prices (CLc1) gave up gains from the previous session, weighed upon by concerns about trade and demand for crude, while hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish crude bets this week.
Shares of Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) jumped 14.5 percent following its better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.
Executives for American International Group Inc (N:AIG) tried to downplay weak earnings and promised a turnaround, but the insurer's shares dipped 2.7 percent. 
Cyber security firm  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) was among the biggest percentage losers on the S&P, dropping 7.8 percent after announcing a workforce reduction and lowering its yearly revenue forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 70 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.96 billion shares, compared with the 6.29 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

1376,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Apple Makes History and Lifts Tech Gloom
Apple took market attention for a host of reasons this week, including reaching a historic Wall Street milestone by becoming the first U.S. company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock hit the target number of $207.05 (based on the numbers of shares outstanding reported in its 10Q) just before noon on Thursday. Shares closed solidly above that Friday.
Shares moved into trillion-dollar territory following a strong earnings report earlier this week.
On Tuesday, Apple’s fiscal third-quarter results beat on the top and bottom lines, driven by sales of the pricier iPhone X and subscription revenue to services such as Apple Music and its App Store.
Apple also lifted the cloud that was hovering over the tech sector following weak reports from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The S&P Information Technology sector index finished at 1,277.05 Friday, compared with 1,262.27 a week ago.
2. Jobs Report Underscores Fed’s Plan
The July employment report gave the market more evidence that the economy is humming along at a pace that won’t alarm the Federal Reserve (to the relief of many investors hoping to get an early start on the weekend).
Although the rise in nonfarm payrolls was less than expected for July, jobs gains for the two previous months were revised up by 59,000, making the overall rise about in line with forecasts.
And average hourly earnings showed wage inflation at the same year-on-year pace as before.
That leaves the Fed set up to continue its plan of gradually rising rates.
“The economy is growing really strongly and headline inflation set to hit 3% next week, so the case for September and December Fed rate hikes remains strong,” ING Chief International Economist James Knightley said.
Fed fund futures are still pricing in the next rate hike to be at the next September 25-26 meeting. Odds for an additional increase in December remained little changed after the release at around 65%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Fed Reaffirms Its Stance With Inflation Near 2%
The Fed had its say this week as well. The Federal Open Market Committee kept rates unchanged as expected, and also kept the language in its statement substantially the same.
The FOMC said it continues to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with ""sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2% objective over the medium term."" That reaffirmed investor expectations that the central bank remained on track to hike rates twice more this year.
""The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation,"" the Fed said in its statement.
A report on Tuesday showed that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy prices, was up 0.1% and 1.9% on a year-over-year basis. The Fed targets inflation of 2%.
4. Oil Ends Week Lower
Oil settled lower for the day and week Friday, as concerns about a trade war stifling demand hurt sentiment.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery fell 47 cents to settle at $68.49 a barrel.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of U.S. oil drilling rigs in operation fell by 2 to 861, pointing to tightening U.S. output.And the weekly oil inventories numbers showed an unexpected rise in U.S. stockpiles, further weighing on prices.
Concerns also remained about escalating output from the OPEC and Russia. On June 22-23, OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed to return to 100% compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction elsewhere had pushed adherence above 160%.
Even though output continued to decline in Iran, Libya and Venezuela, the survey suggested that compliance had only fallen to 111% in July, suggesting more room for increasing production from the likes of Saudi Arabia or OPEC’s non-member ally Russia.
5. Market Can’t Shake Trade-Related Jitters
Trade worries whipsawed this week, keeping the market on edge, amid conflicting reports of U.S. action and proposed retaliation from China.
Tensions on Wall Street eased significantly on Tuesday on a report from Bloomberg that both sides were trying to restart trade talks. But that was quickly countered by another report that the U.S. was considering raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, which the White House later confirmed was under consideration.
On Friday, China shot back with a potential plan for tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
""The U.S. side has repeatedly escalated the situation against the interests of both enterprises and consumers,"" China said, according to Reuters. ""China has to take necessary countermeasures to defend its dignity and the interests of its people, free trade and the multilateral system.""
White House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned China not to underestimate President Donald Trump."

1379,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Bags Triple-Digit Gains to Eke Out Weekly Win,"Investing.com - The Dow notched triple-digit gains shrugging off data showing the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.54%. The S&P 500 rose 0.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.12%.
A late-surge in the Dow helped the index eke out a weekly win, despite heavy losses from industrials through the week on fears that the latest volley of trade threats between the U.S. and China puts both countries on course for a full-blown trade war.
China said Friday it would impose duties of 25%, 20%, 10% and 5% on U.S. products worth more than $60 billion if the Trump administration followed through on threats to impose harsher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Sentiment on trade was lifted slightly after Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic advisor, told reporters at the White House Friday that there had been some communication ""at the highest level"" on trade between the United States and China in recent days.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) - notable names most sensitive to escalating trade tensions – posted heavy losses for the week.
Energy stocks also kept a lid gains through the week, as oil prices posted a weekly slump on rising U.S. supplies and fears about oil demand as the  U.S.-China trade spat continued.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September fell 47 cents to settle at $68.49 a barrel.
Tech stocks continued their comeback from a rout last week, led by  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the latter added to its $1-trillion valuation that followed an upbeat earnings report seen earlier this week.
Corporate earnings also helped sentiment on the broader market as Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) closed higher after reporting earnings that topped expectations. CBS (NYSE:CBS) rose nearly 1%, despite reporting earnings that undershot forecasts.
On the economic front, traders also mulled data from the U.S. Labor Department showing job hiring cooled and wage growth remained subdued.
The U.S. economy just 157,000 jobs in June, well below forecasts for 193,000 new jobs, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.9% and average hourly earnings grew 0.3% in July, and 2.7% in the 12 months through July, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The Federal Reserve said earlier this week that it would continue to gradually raise rates should the economy continue to show ""sustained expansion,"" supported by a strong labor market and close-to-target inflation.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 03:42PM ET</span>","Wall Street eyes more gains from Apple, its $1 trillion stock","By Sinéad Carew and James Thorne
(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) edged higher on Friday but stayed close to the $1 trillion valuation milestone the iPhone maker reached a day earlier, even as Wall Street predicted more gains.
After becoming the first $1 trillion publicly-listed U.S. company on Thursday, Apple last traded up 0.1 pct at $207.57 after falling as low as $205.48 and as high as $208.74, as it oscillated around the $207.0425 price that marked the record market cap.
Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, said Apple's lukewarm Friday was a temporary pause for the stock rather than a sign it could lose ground. 
""It's like the horse that crosses the finish line and says I'm totally wiped out,"" said Morgan, whose firm holds more than 200,000 shares in Apple. 
""There was a strong earnings report on Tuesday. All the enthusiasm around the $1 trillion market capitalization, both those things have just exhausted the current trading in Apple. And it's Friday. The whole week was engulfed by Apple,"" he said. 
Apple still looks relatively cheap even with a trillion dollar valuation. Its shares trade at less than 16 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Morgan, who said he would be comfortable with a multiple of 18 or 19 for the stock.
""That's a reasonable level so I don't feel there's any risk that people will say its trading at a $1 trillion let's put the brakes on this ... If it was Amazon or Netflix that were hitting a trillion, then we could have that conversation,"" he said. 
(Interactive Graphic - Apple hits $1 trillion stock valuation: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mg6mZ8)
Netflix (O:NFLX) currently trades at 93.8 times estimates for its earnings in the next 12 months while Amazon.Com's (O:AMZN) multiple is 83.74. 
""If Apple trades at 20 times earnings that would be crazy,"" he said, estimating that Apple shares could go as high as $220 by year-end. 
Amazon, Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) are in a tight race to become the second U.S. company to reach the $1 trillion milestone.
Most sell-side analysts also seemed to see $1 trillion as just one milestone on Apple's way to greater gains as the median price target for the stock is $218.50 and the mean price target at $215.46, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
The highest price expectation for the stock is Brian White's $275 target, which would mean a $1.3 trillion valuation, according to the analyst from Monness Crespi Hardt, who says he was first on the Street with a price target that reflected a $1-trillion valuation. 
Despite the record valuation, White said, ""Apple is one of the most under-appreciated stocks in the world.""
Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital LLC in Memphis, said Apple ""should trade much higher.”
“They are so dependent on one product for such a huge part of their revenue that I believe that’s why it gets that discount,” said Miller whose firm also owns Amazon shares.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 02:29PM ET</span>","Dish results beat estimates, shares jump 12 percent","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Friday, as the company lost fewer satellite TV subscribers than expected and said it was on track to build the first phase of its wireless network.
The U.S. satellite TV provider has struggled to stop losses from cord-cutting as viewers move to cheaper online streaming services, and is working to diversify its business by eventually launching a 5G wireless network. 
Shares rose 12.8 percent to $33.67 in afternoon trading.
Dish shed a net 192,000 satellite customers during the second quarter, below analyst expectations for losses of 235,000 customers, according to research firm FactSet.
Dish's pay-TV business is showing signs of stabilization, ""and this should give investors comfort that the runway on this business is perhaps a bit longer than expected,"" Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note.
Dish has been under pressure to build the first phase of its wireless network - a narrowband Internet of Things network - and use its stockpile of spectrum before the licenses expire in 2020.
Dish Chief Executive W. Erik Carlson said during the conference call with analysts that Dish was on track to launch the IoT network by March 2020. 
However, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said during the call the company would not be able to begin building its larger goal of a 5G network until 2020, because it still needs certain spectrum that must be cleared by the Federal Communications Commission.
""There isn't an industry in the next decade that doesn't need what we're going to build,"" Ergen said. 
Dish's streaming service Sling TV added 41,000 subscribers during the quarter, missing analyst estimates of 68,000.
Dish said it may lose more pay-TV subscribers because of a blackout of Spanish-language TV network Univision, due to a dispute over fees. 
Dish's churn rate, or the percentage of subscribers who cancel a service, fell to 1.46 percent from 1.83 percent last year.
Revenue fell 5 percent to $3.46 billion.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $439 million, or 83 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $40 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of 71 cents per share and revenue of $3.44 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",U.S. equity traders to receive bigger bonuses this year: study,"(Reuters) - Equities traders on Wall Street are expected to take home bigger bonuses this year, compared with their industry peers, as a global rally in stocks shows little signs of slowing, according to a report by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.
Bonuses may jump by up to 20 percent for employees in the U.S. equities industry, compared with 10 to 15 percent projected by the firm at the end of the first quarter in May, the report showed.
In the most recent quarter, the top five Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  (N:C), collectively recorded a 10 percent rise in market trading revenue, with much of the rebound driven by equities.
Johnson Associates maintained its target of 5 percent to 10 percent hike in bonuses for employees in fixed income businesses, where money is generated from trading bonds, commodities and currencies.
The asset management sector may see up to a 10 percent hike in incentives this year, the firm said, revising its prior estimate of 5 percent.
Johnson Associates said financial services firms are expected to broadly increase bonuses this year.

""Geo-political uncertainty and market volatility are key 2018 incentive wildcards,"" it added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world’s top DJs are basically demigods of the turntable, packing arenas and wowing electronic dance music (EDM) fans everywhere around the globe.
But for those unfamiliar with their work, featured at parties in Vegas or Dubai or popular music festivals like Coachella or SXSW, these so-called ""electro house musicians"" may be entirely unknown.
For the latest in Reuters’ First Jobs series, a few top-earning DJs sat down to spin tales about their younger selves, before life on the stage.
Hardwell (Robbert van de Corput)
First job: Laser-tag attendant
My first job was working at a laser game center, in Breda in the Netherlands. Besides my love for music, I have always had a passion for gaming, so I found working there a lot of fun – even if it wasn’t the most challenging work.
I was hired as a marshal, and my main role was to welcome the groups and then give them instructions on the rules of the game. The game was played with a lot of dry ice to create a fog environment. When the doors were closed we used to go crazy with the machine, and fill the rooms until you couldn’t even see your hand in front of your face. It was utterly ridiculous. I don’t think the owners ever knew.
Getting into DJing when you’re in your teenage years is not the cheapest hobby. Turntables alone cost a few hundred euros, plus everyone mixed on vinyl back then. I was beginning to make my first steps into production around the same time. A few bits of studio gear, like my first synth, and my first proper studio speakers, I bought using the money I made from the laser center.
I learned that working hard for your goals does eventually reap rewards. Hearing my music through those speakers that very first time is something I’ll never forget.
Afrojack (Nick van de Wall)
First job: Video rental assistant
I rented DVDs in my old hometown back in the Netherlands. I earned about 20 euros per day, which I usually spent on food and video games.
What I learned from that job is that work sucks. Even so, I would definitely do it all over again. Doing something like that was what taught me to focus on doing something fun with my life.
Steve Aoki, two-time Grammy-nominated DJ and producer
First job: Onion peeler
My first job was through my brother. I think I was 15 and he was already 25, and he was following in my father's footsteps. He had already gone to hotel restaurant management school, and he started managing a Benihana in Dallas, Texas.
One summer he said ‘Come out and work for me, you’re going to learn the ropes.’ So I went out to Dallas, and I was so excited. It was my first job and it was working for my brother.
I thought it was going to be so much fun. I thought I was going to be up front, entertaining the people coming in, hosting everyone. And then I got there and he was like, 'Steve, you need to learn from the bottom up, just like I did.’
He hands me an all-white uniform with a white cap and a white apron and he’s like, ‘First thing you have to do, here are six bags of onions. There is a small closet you can sit in, and you gotta peel all these onions by 12 noon.’
And I would peel onions - over 460 onions every morning. So I realized how hard the restaurant business was from peeling onions alone.

I went from peeling onions to dishwashing, then to de-shelling the shrimp, and then I started getting to the fun stuff. I started playing with the knives and cutting things up - but that was only the last two weeks of my three-month time working at Benihana.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Scania says U.S. sanctions put entire Iran truck sales in 'jeopardy',"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Scania's entire sales into Iran could be lost if the United States reinstates sanctions against the country, the Swedish truckmaker's head warned on Friday, a day after first-half results showed the company's Iranian order book was already being hit.
CEO Henrik Henriksson said Scania, which was one of the first truck companies to return to Iran after the EU lifted sanctions in early 2016, had cancelled all orders that it could not deliver by mid August as anything after would have been hit by the new sanctions.
""Looking at the information we have on hand today, of course if nothing is improving, then (our) whole volume will be in jeopardy,"" told Reuters.
Among truckmakers, Scania, which is owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), has one of the larger presences in Iran, selling 5,000-6,000 trucks and buses annually, according to Henriksson. That represents about 5 percent of its global vehicle orders of 109,415 last year. 
Such a move would be another blow to the Iranian car industry, which unlike the energy and banking sectors, had managed to sign contracts with top European firms after the lifting of sanctions in 2016, attracting sizable foreign investment. 
French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) began to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran in June and Germany’s Daimler said it was closely monitoring any further developments and would then evaluate the potential impact on its business.
Despite the efforts of European governments to salvage the nuclear deal and provide guarantees to European firms to protect them against secondary U.S. sanctions, many of them are leaving Iran anyway to avoid any possible U.S. penalties. 
America accounted for 13 percent of Scania's orders for trucks, buses and coaches in 2017. 
Scania declined to comment on how much of an impact the decline in orders from Iran, considered as one of their growth markets, had on first half results. 
The company's factories in Latin America and Europe are used to produce vehicles for Tehran and it distributes trucks and buses through local partners, which also own Scania's production and extensive servicing network in Iran. 
Henriksson said Scania was also pressing for faster payment as sanctions could potentially close financing networks by November.
""As it is right now, it's a wind down window of getting orders out that were in before a certain date and getting payments in as much as you can,"" he said.
However, Henriksson said Scania was working on a contingency plan so that it could continue to deliver spare parts needed to keep its trucks and buses on Iranian roads running, but that nothing was resolved yet.

Disney would only be forced to make such an offer if it completes a deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's TV and film assets, which include a 39 percent stake in Sky, before either Fox or rival suitor Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have managed to take control of the British broadcaster.

The Takeover Panel set the level of a possible mandatory Disney offer for Sky at 14 pounds a share on July 13. But its hearings committee subsequently examined the decision on July 27 after the regulator said that ""various interested parties affected by the ruling"" had asked for a review.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) slid more than three percent in morning trading on Friday after executives tried to downplay another weak earnings report and vowed a turnaround was on the horizon.
The New York-based insurer on Thursday reported a 17 percent fall in quarterly profit as its general insurance business failed to show improvement, missing analysts’ expectations.
""I'm trying to get across to everyone that there is improvement in this book,"" AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said in a call with analysts on Friday. ""It's not a straight line, but the line is an improvement line."" 
Duperrault took charge of AIG more than a year ago, promising to grow the company and boost revenues. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.
But his steps have yet to boost the bottomline and AIG’s shares were trading at $53.84 in morning trading, down 2.4 percent on the day.
Lower alternative investment income also dragged on AIG's results during the quarter.
Duperreault and other executives revealed more details about their turnaround plan during the call, including a two-point improvement to its general insurance unit expense ratio heading into 2019, Duperreault said. The figure is a measurement of a company's efficiency.
But even that level of an improvement ""is nowhere where it needs to be,"" Duperreault said.
The company recently closed on its acquisition of Bermuda reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd, whose business will help boost AIG's profitability, executives said.

Reinsurance and changes to property underwriting limits are other measures that will help improve future results, they said.

However, rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) said last year it would raise surcharges for most residential packages for the 2018 peak season.
FedEx would charge $3.20 at its U.S. express business and U.S. and international ground services for a package that needs additional handling, while the surcharge on an oversized package would be $27.50.
A $150 surcharge will apply to an unauthorized package at the package delivery company's U.S. and international ground business.
The surcharges are from Nov. 19 to Dec. 24.
In June, UPS started charging an extra $150 to handle oversized packages and pallets, along with a new charge for packages with mislabeled dimensions.
FedEx on Friday also updated its surcharges on some U.S. and international packages, effective September and January.

The rise of e-commerce has forced UPS and FedEx to grapple with increased volumes of massive goods such as sofas and televisions that consumers are increasingly buying online.

The S&P 500 rose three points, or 0.10%, to 2,830.13 as of 9:44 AM ET (13:44 GMT), while the Dow increased 34 points, or 0.14%, to 25,361.08 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained five points, or 0.06%, to 7,807.73.
Trade uncertainty continued to weigh on investors minds after reports that the White House plans to propose 25% tariffs, instead of 10%, on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods. China warned it could fire back with tariffs on up to $60 billion of U.S. goods.
Meanwhile, the number of jobs added to the economy was less than expected in June.
Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 157,000 in July, according to official data released on Friday.
That was lower than the consensus estimate for the creation of 193,000 jobs and the 219,000 positions that the ADP report indicated on Wednesday. But the number of jobs added in the previous two months were revised higher and the market seemed to take the figures in stride.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Investors pull money from U.S. large-cap stocks as tech retains crown: BAML,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - A selloff in big U.S. tech shares wasn't enough to pull money away from the sector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday, but U.S. large-cap stocks suffered outflows as investors grew more cautious about an aging bull market.
Overall investors shed risky assets this week, pulling $2 billion from equity funds and plowing $2.2 billion into bond funds, the strategists said, citing flows data from EPFR.
Some $0.9 billion coursed into tech stocks, the 14th consecutive week of inflows, despite hefty falls in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter shares last week causing anxiety about the resilience of the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)). 
U.S. tech has driven the lion's share of the equity market rally so far. Global equities have risen 2.8 percent year-to-date, though BAML strategists calculated that without U.S. tech, they would be 0.8 percent in the red. 
Outflows of $1 billion from U.S. large-cap stocks and $2.1 billion from U.S. growth stocks this week testified to concerns these stocks could see their dominance challenged.
Investors started to turn instead to U.S. small-cap and value funds, though inflows were relatively small with $0.1 billion each.
Healthcare, consumer and real estate sectors also enjoyed inflows this week, suggesting investors are turning towards defensive sectors in more volatile markets. Energy and financials funds saw outflows. 
European equities suffered their 21st straight week of outflows as a good earnings season failed to lure investors back into the region. 
U.S. and Japanese equities also saw outflows of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion respectively, while emerging market stocks enjoyed their first inflows in 11 weeks as investors ventured back into the bruised asset class.
There was a tentative return to risky credit, too, with $0.2 billion inflows for high-yield bonds. Investment-grade corporate bonds saw their sixth straight week of inflows, making the six-week total $13 billion. 
BAML's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator (where 10 is most bullish) rose to 2.8, reflecting a hesitant improvement in investor sentiment. 
""Away from 'extreme bear' as high yield and emerging markets see inflows, global equity market breadth improves,"" wrote BAML strategists. 
This earnings season is driving large share price moves across U.S. and European markets, pushing correlations down and comforting investors who see stocks moving in lock-step, and markets led by just a handful of stocks, as red flags. 
AN AGING BULL
There are just 14 trading days to go until the S&P 500 bull market becomes the longest of all-time, at 3,543 days, the BAML team noted. 
But signs of the market fraying at the seams are multiplying. 
A slowing pace of economic growth - proxied by global purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) - is driving a decline in earnings per share (EPS), strategists argued, labeling this ""peak profits"". 
Central bank asset buying is also falling sharply, removing one of the key supports for asset prices since the 2007-08 financial crisis. At $1.6 trillion in 2016 and $2,.3 trillion in 2017, they estimate the total will be less than $0.17 trillion this year. 

A peak in profits and in accommodative central bank policy point to ""tougher"" returns in 2018, BAML said, but one silver lining is investors' more cautious positioning, which suggests they are aware of these risks.

Sales in the United States, the company's biggest market, fell 1.9 percent to $4.51 billion in the second, but topped the average analyst estimate of $4.43 billion.
This is the company's first better-than-expected U.S. sales performance in at least five quarters.
Kraft Heinz raised prices of its packaged foods and condiments as rising input expenses, including higher transport and commodity costs, weighed on the company's margins.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Amazon reports 1.7 million pound UK tax bill due to share deductions,"LONDON (Reuters) - The main UK subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a tax bill of 1.7 million pounds ($2.21 million) on profits of 72.4 million pounds in 2017 thanks to deductions related to share-based awards to staff, accounts published this week show.
The tax affairs of Amazon, which on Thursday reported its largest ever profit of $2.5 billion in the second quarter, and other tech groups have been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny across Europe in recent years. 
Amazon group books most of its $11.4 billion of UK revenues via a UK branch of Luxembourg-based Amazon EU Sarl, Amazon's main European operating unit. This subsidiary had a tax bill of 54.9 million euros ($63.7 million)last year, despite booking a 876 million euro loss that was partly driven by large inter-group royalty payments, its accounts show. 
Amazon EU Sarl’s UK branch doesn’t publish accounts so it’s unclear how much UK tax Amazon pays in total, but it’s likely that bill was above the reported charge of 1.7 million pounds last year. 
If Amazon UK Services Ltd had paid the prevailing rate of tax of around 19 percent on its profits, its total bill would have been 14 million pounds. 
Unlike some European countries, Britain allows companies to take generous deductions for stock options and share awards and many companies, especially in the technology sector, use the rules to reduce their tax bills significantly.
""We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly-competitive, low margin business,"" it added.
Amazon UK Services Ltd., which operates the internet retailer’s warehouses and distribution network in the UK, reported 2 billion pounds of revenues in 2017 – cash it was paid by Amazon EU Sarl, to fulfill orders placed online.
Amazon has reduced its tax bill by having Amazon EU Sarl pay large royalty fees to a tax exempt partnership, also based in Luxembourg., an arrangement that was challenged, unsuccessfully, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
Lawmakers in the UK and other countries have proposed new forms of taxes including additional taxes on revenues to tackle the tech giants’ tax planning strategies. Such a measure could have more impact on Amazon because it operates on low or negative profit margins in Europe, unlike rivals whose margins can top 30 percent of revenues.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks drifted lower on Friday as the latest exchange of trade threats between the United States and China dampened risk appetite, while Italian bonds and shares in the country's banks sold off on signs of renewed government tensions in Rome.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down by 0.1 percent after the start of European trading, and set to break a four-week streak of gains.
While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent, though it was down over half a percent on the week.
The trade row between the world's top two economies intensified midweek after President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent U.S. tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing vowed to retaliate.
Investors were also cautious before the July U.S. jobs report due later in the day. This will give a reading on the health of the world's largest economy, now in its second longest expansion on record. Economists polled by Reuters expect 190,000 jobs were created in July.
""The stock market trend continues to be characterized by a struggle between trade war distress, growth risks and strong corporate Q2 reports,"" SEB strategists wrote in a note to clients.
According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit its highest in over three weeks, extending sharp gains made the previous day, while the euro fell to its lowest level since the end of June. Investors said the greenback was benefiting from safe haven flows.
Italian two-year and five-year government bond yields rose about 22 to 25 basis points to 1.27 percent and 2.32 percent in early trade, hitting their highest levels since early June. Italian bank stocks fell 0.8 percent, set for their worst week since early June. 
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is under pressure from within the government to raise spending and challenge European Union budget rules.
The possibility that he might be forced to resign has investors worried that Italy could go on a spending binge, or even that fresh elections could follow. That in turn could strengthen the hand of the eurosceptic League party and its leader, Matteo Salvini. 
The two- and five-year bonds have been most sensitive to concern over the chance of an Italian exit from the euro, which would increase default risk on debt coming due soon. 
""Clearly, this is about the fear that Tria gets kicked out, which could lead to a collapse of the government, new elections, and the League gaining even further,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Christoph Rieger. 
""Or it may mean that they agree on a budget that's at odds with the EU,"" he said, adding that this would imply heavier borrowing and greater bond supply.
Yields on 10-year bonds also rose, by 9 basis points, to hit 3 percent for the first time since June 11, and the closely watched spread over Germany was at its widest since late June at 257 bps,. [GVD/EUR]
With the trade tensions encouraging demand for safe haven assets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield pulled back to 2.9767 percent from a 10-week high above 3 percent brushed midweek. [US/]
The 10-year Treasury yield had hit the peak partly due to a surge in Japanese government bond yields to 1-1/2-year highs this week as the market tested the Bank of Japan's rejigged policy framework, under which it now allows yields to fluctuate in a wider band.
Oil prices eased back slightly after the previous day's rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. [O/R]
Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent at $73.17 a barrel after surging 1.5 percent on Thursday.

Copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped half a percent to $6,107 per tonne. With trade tensions hurting demand, the industrial metal was down 2.8 percent for the week.

1423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Struggles to Master Anti-Money-Laundering Task,"(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) acknowledged that its anti-money laundering processes remain inefficient more than a year after it was fined almost $700 million for helping wealthy Russians move money out of the country.
Responding to a Reuters report Friday that the bank had uncovered shortcomings in its ability to identify clients and the sources of their wealth, Germany’s largest lender said internal reviews showed its processes remain too complex, though they were effective.
“We are not struggling with procedures designed to help prevent criminals from money laundering and other criminal action,” Germany’s biggest lender said in a statement. “What the documents show is that our internal processes are still too complicated. So it is not about effectiveness, but about the efficiency of our processes. We still need to improve in terms of internal processes.”
The disclosure illustrates however, the many difficulties Deutsche is facing in convincing its supervisors that it has its house in order after a series of governance breakdowns. Last year, the Federal Reserve designated the bank’s U.S. business as ‘troubled’ and this year it failed the bank in its annual stress tests on qualitative grounds, citing “widespread and critical deficiencies” in its internal controls.
Deutsche Bank AG was fined by U.K. and U.S. authorities in 2017 for compliance failures that saw the bank help wealthy Russians move about $10 billion out of the country, using methods that the New York Department of Financial Services said could have been deployed to facilitate money laundering.
Steps Taken
According to Reuters, the bank shared its findings in two reports in early June with its supervisor, the European Central Bank. The ECB declined to comment. German financial supervisor BaFin wasn’t immediately able to comment.
The reports showed that the automated ‘Know-Your-Customer’ controls -- which were pushed hard by former Chief Executive John Cryan -- were largely unable to perform key tasks, Reuters said. Those included the identification of so-called ‘Politically Exposed Persons’ who represent a higher money-laundering risk, and the verification of the source of a client’s funds, according to Reuters.
As such, Deutsche’s processes still need a continued high level of human input. Chief Risk Officer Sylvie Matherat said in April that another 400 people would be hired for her compliance department this year, a year in which the bank is trying to cut over 4,000 jobs on a net group-wide basis.
The reports cited by Reuters were filed less than two months after Deutsche Bank replaced Kim Hammonds, who had also overseen technology issues, as chief operating officer. She was succeeded as COO by Frank Kuhnke.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Investors move to cash, anticipating Democratic gains in U.S. November elections","By David Randall
NEW YORK(Reuters) - The likelihood of a Democratic party takeover of at least one house of the U.S. Congress in the midterm elections in November is prompting some portfolio managers to move more money to cash and rotate away from sectors like financials and technology that could see greater regulatory scrutiny. 
Fund managers from Federated Investors, OppenheimerFunds, and BMO Global Asset Management are among those who are repositioning their portfolios and seeing cash as more attractive with the Nov. 6 elections less than 100 days away. 
Chief among their concerns: a so-called Blue Wave of Democratic victories could end the Republican Party's single-party control of the White House and Congress, leading to both more investigations into possible abuses by the Trump administration and more stock market volatility. 
""The reason for our concern very simply is that Democratic voters are very engaged and likely to come out in force, and the party in power typically does not do well in the first midterms,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. 
Such a move would also embolden Democratic presidential candidates to run on a platform in 2020 calling for universal health care, increasing the minimum wage, and repealing the Republican-led corporate tax cuts passed in December, all of which could slow economic growth, he said. 
Concerns about a resounding Democratic victory prompted Orlando to sell some of his U.S. stocks in late June, leaving his equity still overweight toward U.S. equities but down from 8 percent to 5 percent, and move those assets into cash. 
Orlando expects that the U.S. stock market will tumble at least 10 percent between late August and September as the broad market starts to price in Democratic gains in Washington, he said. 
Real Clear Politics, a polling aggregation site, has Democrats leading by 7 percentage points on a generic ballot, but rates the chance of a Democratic takeover of the House as a toss-up. 
Democrats would need to retake 23 seats to gain a majority in the House, and 2 seats to control the Senate. 
Of the 36 Senate seats being contested, only 9 are currently held by Republicans, and 10 Democratic incumbents are running for re-election in states won by President Trump.
There are few signs in financial markets, so far, that Wall Street expects the economy to stall if the Democrats were to regain control of at least one house of Congress. 
The U.S. benchmark S&P stock 500 index is up 5.2 percent for the year, and has gained nearly 9 percent since its lows in early February. 
The U.S. economy grew at an estimated 4.1 percent in the second quarter this year, the Commerce Department said July 27, its fastest growth rate since 2014. 
Yet a victory by more progressive Democrats in the midterm elections could lead to a greater regulatory focus on financial and technology firms that have so far received a pass from the Trump administration, said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management, 
A victory by progressive Democrats may also lessen the likelihood of a bipartisan deal on infrastructure and strengthen calls for reversing corporate tax cuts, he said.
""The Democratic Party is struggling with the same issue that Republicans have dealt with, which is having two parties within one party,"" he said. 
""We think the economic outlook for the next 18 months is still very strong and a lot of that is due to the fiscal stimulus"" of the Republican-led tax cuts, he said. 
Even if Republicans do retain one or both houses of Congress, there is little likelihood that the so-called ""Trump trade"" will come back in force, said Brian Levitt, senior investment strategist at OppenheimerFunds. 
The ""Trump trade"" was a strategy that involved buying financial, industrial and value stocks after Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election in the hope that it would lead to banking de-regulation, infrastructure spending, and tax cuts. 
Instead, he said, growth stocks will likely continue to lead the market, while fiscal stimulus in the U.S. provided by the corporate tax cuts will help push emerging market equities higher by boosting inflation, he said. 

""You typically don't see a style or leadership change"" in the U.S. stock market until the start of an economic recession, he said. Until then, he added, ""cash and short-term government bonds are more attractive than they've been in some time.""

From next month, vehicles need to pass new pollution rules known as the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test procedure, or WLTP. Cars which are registered for sale ahead of this deadline can still be passed on to dealerships after September.
The Ingolstadt-based manufacturer said it had ramped up production ahead of the deadline and therefore does not expect to see a drop in vehicle deliveries this year, even as it faces problems adjusting its portfolio.
""The company expects significant fluctuations during the year in production, inventories and deliveries, as well as in its key financials,"" Audi said in a statement accompanying its latest financial results. 
""In this context, the first half of the year featured a significant increase in production levels for anticipatory stockpiling.""
Several manufacturers including Audi parent Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have said margins may suffer because of delays getting their fleet ready for the new road certification standards.
Audi added it expects its research and development expenditure ratio to be slightly above the long-term target corridor of 6.0 to 6.5 percent of sales. 

Audi also assumes that the capital expenditure ratio will be also be slightly above its target level of 5.0 to 5.5 percent.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 06:59AM ET</span>","Facing U.S. tariff threat, Toyota warns car costs could rise","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Friday said higher U.S. auto tariffs would ramp up the cost of vehicles produced locally along with those imported to the United States from Japan, which would have a ""big impact"" on its bottom line.
Like its global rivals, Toyota is bracing for the possibility of a rise in U.S. auto import tariffs, which could cloud its outlook as it would raise the cost of selling vehicles in the world's second-biggest vehicle market. Such uncertainty took the shine off strong quarterly results announced on Friday.
So far, Japan's biggest automakers and components suppliers said they have seen limited direct impact from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum implemented in June, but they acknowledge they could take a significant hit if Washington delivers on proposals to hike tariffs on autos and auto parts to 25 percent.
""If we see a rise, it would raise the cost of locally produced vehicles by around $1,800 each, and increase costs for (models imported from Japan) by $6,000,"" Toyota senior managing director Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters at a results briefing, referring to U.S.-made Camry sedans, one of the automaker's most iconic models.
""This would be a big impact.""
The United States is a major market for Japan's automakers, where Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) locally produce around half or more of the cars they sell in the country. The remainder are imported from Japan, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.
Based on the roughly 709,000 vehicles Toyota exported to the United States from Japan in 2017, the automaker could take an annual tariff-related hit of $4.25 billion on those vehicles alone. 
Higher tariffs would deliver a major blow to all global automakers as most, including U.S. ones, rely on imports to source the vehicles and parts contained in them which are sold in the United States.
Earlier this week, Denso Corp (T:6902), one of the world's biggest components suppliers, said U.S. auto tariffs, if implemented, could wipe up to $720 million off annual profit.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) last week said tariffs in general could cost it up to $1.6 billion in 2018 in North America. 
Toyota has been a vocal opponent of tariffs, arguing that 25 percent would increase the cost of its U.S.-made Camry sedan by $1,800 and $2,800 for its Tundra pick-up truck.
The automaker operates 10 production plants in the United States, and locally produces just under half of all the cars it sells in the country. Its share of localised production is lower than the 75 percent of Honda and 60 percent of Nissan.
Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors Co (GM) (N:GM) as well as  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) lowered their full-year profit forecasts last week amid worries escalating tariffs would hurt sales and profit margins.
STRONG Q1 PROFIT
Earlier on Friday, Toyota posted a 19 percent jump in April-June operating profit to 683 billion yen ($6 billion), beating estimates and marking its strongest quarterly performance in two-and-a-half years on the back of higher sales and cost reductions in Asia.
Its global retail vehicle sales rose 1 percent to 2.6 million units in the quarter, boosted by a lift in Asia, where demand for the recently remodeled Camry helped to increase sales by 5.4 percent in China, the world's biggest car market, during the first six months of 2018.
In North America, Toyota's biggest regional market, sales rose 3.2 percent due to a rise in demand for its pick-up trucks, including the Tacoma and Tundra. Still, profit in the region fell 29 percent as sales incentives continued to weigh.
The automaker maintained its full-year profit forecast at 2.3 trillion yen, a decline of 4.2 percent, though it now expects the domestic currency to average 106 yen to the U.S. dollar, from an earlier forecast of 105 yen.
Overall, Toyota still expects a stronger yen to offset the benefits of cost-cutting and record-high global vehicle sales in the year through March.

Separately, Toyota and Isuzu Motors Ltd (T:7202) on Friday said they would dissolve their capital tie-up given limited progress made in their development partnership focusing on diesel engines. As a result, Toyota said it would sell off its 5.8 percent stake in the Japanese truck maker.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Heineken toasts $3.1 billion China Resources Beer premium tie-up,"By Donny Kwok and Brenda Goh
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) is taking a $3.1 billion stake in the parent of China Resources Beer (HK:0291), China's top brewer, to tap a growing thirst for premium brands in the world's biggest beer market. 
The world's No. 2 brewer will take a 40 percent holding in  CRH  (LON:CRH) Beer, giving it a strong distribution network in China and greater access to a market it has so far found tough to crack.
For CR Beer, the maker of the locally popular Snow beer, the deal is a way to get into the foreign-dominated premium sector at a time when Chinese demand for lower-end brands is waning.
""This (deal) will help accelerate CR Beer's Snow beer high-end strategy and achieve its goal to take a leading position in the premium market within 5-10 years,"" CR Beer's Chief Executive Hou Xiaohai told reporters on a call on Friday.
Snow accounts for about 90 percent of CR Beer's total beer sales volumes but is almost exclusively sold in China. CR Beer hopes to use Heineken's global network to market it abroad. 
CR Beer shares initially jumped as much as 10 percent but closed down 0.99 percent, while Heineken's rose 2 percent.
""Thanks to the strong position of CR Beer and understanding of the market growth of the Heineken brand should improve in the coming years,"" analysts at Degroof Petercam wrote in a note. 
NOT GOING IT ALONE
Heineken had struggled to compete with the dominant players in China's premium lager market such as  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) and Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) on a national scale. 
The Dutch group had a 0.5 percent share of the China market by volume in 2017, data from research firm Euromonitor International showed, while AB Inbev had 16.1 percent. CR Beer had more than a quarter share. 
Heineken chief executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said the company would have found it hard to replicate good results it had achieved in provinces such as Fujian throughout China.
""(It) is something that would have cost way too much money and we have no time for that,"" van Boxmeer said on a conference call following the announcement of the deal with CRH Beer.
Heineken will inject its three breweries in China into CR Beer and license its Heineken brand in China, Hong Kong and Macau to CR Beer.
China Resources Enterprise will own the remaining 60 percent of CRH Beer and will also buy 5.2 million Heineken shares for 464 million euros ($538 million). 
The combined transactions would result in a net investment of 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) by Heineken, the two firms said in a joint statement.
DISTRIBUTION, EXPANSION PLANS
Heineken sells its premium lagers Heineken, Tiger and Sol in China, along with cheaper local brands Anchor and Hainan Beer.
CR Beer's Hou said the company would use its extensive local distribution network to promote Heineken's brands and was contemplating bringing in other Heineken-owned brands not yet in China, though that was still under discussion. 
Heineken, which noted the deal should boost its profit margins, said it would assist CR Beer to monitor the quality of its Heineken products, marketing efforts and pricing but would otherwise stand back.
""They're great professionals, we wouldn't want to second guess what they are doing at the steering wheel in China,"" van Boxmeer said, adding it was up to the Chinese group to decide on the future of the Dutch company's local brands.
The deal would not impact Heineken's sponsorship of the Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix, which was part of a global sponsorship arrangement, van Boxmeer added.
The Chinese brewer also hopes to eventually expand Snow beer into overseas markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, the United States and Australia through Heineken's network, he said. 
The companies are conducting due diligence and will need anti-trust approval from China, a person with direct knowledge said, adding the deal is expected to be completed by year-end.
JP Morgan is advising Heineken, while China Resources has enlisted Nomura and UBS as advisers. The banks did not immediately comment.
Reuters reported in March that China Resources Beer was in talks to acquire Heineken's China business.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","ADM takes early lead in fight for trade war spoils, Bunge stumbles","By Karl Plume and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) has so far weathered the U.S.-China trade war better than rival  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) with a more conservative trading strategy, diversified crop sales and limited exposure to Brazil's currency swings.
The companies perform similar functions: buying, selling, transporting and processing crops around the world. However their starkly different second-quarter earnings show how varying strategies can produce drastically different results, providing lessons for other global grain traders.
ADM on Tuesday reported a doubling of quarterly profit from a year earlier, as higher volumes and margins for U.S. grain and soy exports put it in a strong position for trade gains through the rest of the year.
A day later, Bunge stumbled to a surprise loss it blamed partly on wrong-sided bets that a prompt trade truce would push up soybean futures. Instead, the trade war escalated and prices fell sharply, piling pressure on the company to reverse losing positions.
ADM, which is more focused on U.S. operations than Bunge, cashed in as China shifted its soybean purchases to Brazil because of the trade war, prompting other countries to buy more U.S. soy, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on an earnings call.
Bunge reported a $125 million mark-to-market loss tied to soybean crush contracts in the April-to-June quarter and confirmed losses from hedges in the soy futures market that could have been profitable with a trade resolution. It also took a $24 million hit from currency hedges in Brazil.
Bunge traders are known for taking more risk than those at ADM and they did not pay off this time, said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, a shareholder of both companies.
""With Bunge, it was the commodity as well as the currency exposure that showed up and was reflected in their lower earnings,"" he said.
The company defended its bet, saying it will recover those losses in the second half of the year as it cashes in on the robust soy processing margins locked in during the second quarter.
ADM offset some of its mark-to-market losses in soy with gains on canola for an overall net mark-to-market loss of about $40 million.
Bunge said it does not encourage traders to take more risks. ADM declined to comment on trading and hedging strategies.
Both companies had said the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies was an opportunity to increase returns after a global oversupply of food commodities limited trading opportunities in recent years.
""ADM has been able to deliver some of their improved results earlier than we have, and some of that is timing. But, in the case of Bunge, it's coming,"" Bunge Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder said in an interview.
As the trade war drags on, Schroder said Bunge will continue with a strategy to lock in profit when it can because trade policies could quickly shift. 
""You have to be prepared for pretty much anything so our posture has been to lock down as much as we can, to secure as much of the future profitability as we can. That's an approach that we'll continue to take,"" he told Reuters.
TAKEOVER TARGET
Bunge's prized South American grain handling and processing infrastructure, which has made it a takeover target over the past year, also proved a hindrance last quarter. 
While Chinese buying of Brazilian soy soared, Bunge's grain origination business in the country was hurt by a trucker strike. It is under pressure to deliver better results after fending off takeover approaches from ADM and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN).
""If they don't deliver on the second half of this year, if I'm a board member I'm certainly more open to hearing talks of a takeover,"" said Seth Goldstein, Morningstar analyst in Chicago.
Analysts were divided on whether Bunge would be able to fully reverse its losses in the second half.
CFRA lowered its price target by $5 to $78 per share but maintained its ""buy"" rating on Bunge shares, while J.P. Morgan downgraded its Bunge rating to neutral.

Bunge has set a ""high bar"" for a second-half turnaround amid ""uncertain trade policy and unresolved freight challenges in Brazil that may drive further earnings volatility in 2018,"" said J.P Morgan analyst Ann Duignan.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 06:06AM ET</span>","Bezos throws cash, engineers at rocket program as space race accelerates","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is racing to pull his private space company out of start-up mode and move into production amid signals that his firm's heavy rocket set for lift-off in 2020 may slip behind schedule, according to people familiar with the project.
Blue Origin has added hundreds of engineers over the past three years and continues to ramp up in an expansion that one employee described as ""hyperbolic."" The Kent, Washington-based company is looking to double its current workforce to around 3,000 employees over the next two to three years, a top customer told Reuters.
The urgency centers on a rocket dubbed New Glenn. The heavy-launch vehicle, which Bezos promises will be able to haul satellites and, eventually, people into orbit, is central to the company's hopes of winning lucrative military and commercial contracts.
New Glenn's first-stage booster will be reusable, a key piece of Bezos' strategy to lower costs and increase the frequency of launches. Blue Origin executives have stated publicly that test flights will begin within two years. 
But whether Blue Origin can hit that mark remains to be seen.
With the clock ticking on 2020, company engineers are still finalizing details on New Glenn's design and just beginning to build model components that must be put through extreme testing, people familiar with the project said. They requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
Blue Origin has privately acknowledged in conversations with French satellite firm Eutelsat SA [ETLXCE.UL] - its first New Glenn customer - that its 2020 time frame is ""very aggressive,"" a person with direct knowledge of talks between the companies said.
The firms have padded their contract, which covers the launch of a geostationary satellite in the period 2021-2022, so that Blue Origin will incur no penalties if it is late, the person added. 
Yohann Leroy, Eutelsat's Deputy Chief Executive Officer, declined to discuss details of his company's contract with Blue Origin, but said he was optimistic New Glenn will be ready to carry his firm's satellite by the end of 2022. 
""Of course, I cannot guarantee that they will respect their initial timeline, but we are confident that they will not be very far from it,"" Leroy said.
A Blue Origin spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about the company's hiring practices, strategy or competitive challenges. The private firm has been tight-lipped on New Glenn's production status and plans for bringing it to market. 
Mounting a successful test in 2020 would give Blue Origin its best shot at fending off competing rockets and new ones expected to enter the market in the next few years, analysts said.
Rivals include aerospace stalwarts United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT); and France's ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF). Japan and China are likewise designing reusable rockets. 
But 18 years after its founding, Blue Origin has found itself lagging a competitor closer to home: SpaceX. 
Founded by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, the Hawthorne, California-based company has upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars' worth of contracts, including deals with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense.
SpaceX in February transfixed a global audience with the successful test launch of its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.
Musk had predicted ""game over"" for other makers of heavy rockets if his launch succeeded. 
The good news for Blue Origin is that demand for satellite launch services is projected to soar.
Around 800 small satellites are expected to launch annually beginning around 2020, more than double the annual average over the past decade, according to Marco Caceres, senior space analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group.
""If New Glenn can be ready in the next two years (Blue Origin) may be able to seize that window of opportunity,"" he said. 
ROCKET SCIENCE 
Like Musk, Bezos is passionate about the prospect of humans living and working in space. 
Now the world's richest man, thanks to the success of online retailer Amazon, Bezos has been liquidating $1 billion of its stock annually to fund his interplanetary dreams.
He set up Blue Origin in a warehouse some 20 miles (32 km) south of Seattle. The company's Latin motto means ""step by step ferociously,"" a reference to Bezos' belief that success comes through steady, incremental progress.
But after nearly two decades, and with the private space race heating up, Bezos is intent on moving closer to commercialization, three Blue Origin employees told Reuters.
Part of those efforts include selling sightseeing trips to the edge of space aboard another Blue Origin rocket dubbed the New Shepard, with ticket prices in the $200,000-$300,000 range. 
Blue Origin also is vying to supply its BE-4 engine to United Launch Alliance to power its forthcoming Vulcan rocket, ULA said.
The recent hiring binge has focused mainly on throwing talent at the New Glenn, and has included more than 60 engineers who worked previously for SpaceX.
Blue Origin's workforce of more than 1,500 has more than doubled from its early 2016 levels, three employees said. Its ranks are expected to double again by the time New Glenn is flying, Eutelsat's Leroy said. By comparison, SpaceX has more than 6,000 employees.
Bezos' company has also invested more than $200 million in a rocket-making facility near NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Still, Leroy said he expects to see a New Glenn prototype no sooner than mid-2019.
In the meantime, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and satellite companies are directing business to SpaceX.
Matt Desch, Chief Executive Officer of McLean, Virginia-based Iridium Communications Inc, SpaceX's largest commercial customer, told Reuters that Blue Origin ""has been a little less clear"" about its strategy.

""Nobody disputes that with the investment they're making they won't eventually be successful, but how and when they become reliable is still uncertain,"" Desch said.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:56AM ET</span>",Some FT reporters call on CEO Ridding to give back part of $3.4 million pay,"LONDON (Reuters) - A group of Financial Times reporters have complained about the pay of CEO John Ridding, who earned 2.6 million pounds ($3.4 million) in 2017, and called for him to give back some of the money, according to an email seen by Reuters.
The FT's Steve Bird, joint head of the paper's National Union of Journalists group, wrote to FT editors and journalists across the world, saying Ridding's pay was absurdly high and that he should give some back to help those on lower salaries.
FT accounts, filed on July 27, showed that the paper's highest-paid director, Ridding, earned 2.55 million pounds in 2017. The accounts restated his earnings for 2016 at 2.04 million pounds.
""We believe that John Ridding should give back his absurdly large pay increases since 2016 and use the funds to reward all staff, especially those on lower salaries, and to help bridge the gender pay gap,"" Bird wrote in the email dated Aug. 1. 
Ridding did not respond to a request for comment. 
Bird confirmed that the FT's union committee sent the email to all journalist staff expressing outrage at Ridding's salary. 
""We don't comment publicly on individual pay,"" a spokeswoman for the FT said. ""However, reward at the FT is performance related and the FT grew both revenues and profits in 2017 while investing in new products and services.""
In the email, which was signed by over 20 FT journalists, Bird said the paper had suffered years of negligible pay rises, real-terms pay cuts and squeezed resources. 
""The company's decision to pay its chief executive 100 times the salary of a trainee journalist makes a mockery of any concept of fairness and breaks the bounds of corporate integrity,"" Bird wrote. 

Japanese media group Nikkei bought the Financial Times from Britain’s  Pearson  (L:PSON) for $1.3 billion in 2015.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:38AM ET</span>","Tech strength, bank earnings boost European shares","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Tech stocks drove European shares up on Friday at the end of a volatile week, as investors drew encouragement from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company while supportive earnings boosted banks.
Apple was a driver for the broader tech sector (SX8P) in Europe, which climbed 0.9 percent with chipmakers - some of which supply the iPhone maker - the top gainers.
Ams (S:AMS), BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) rose 3.9 to 4.8 percent, while ASML (AS:ASML), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) were also higher.
Analysts' expectations of tech companies' earnings per share have risen to their highest since 2000, when a bubble took sector valuations to excessive levels. 
Tech helped push the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up 0.4 percent by 0830 GMT.
Autos (SXAP) rose 1.1 percent in a relief bounce after two days of selling following a threat by U.S. President Trump to hike tariffs on Chinese imports.
Financials also climbed, after France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and Britain's RBS (L:RBS) added to a slew of positive results from European lenders.
Credit Agricole (PA:CAGR) reported second-quarter profits ahead of estimates, sending its shares up 2 percent, while peer  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) also gained 2 percent after its second-quarter profits rose. 
Shares in RBS climbed 2.8 percent after the recovering state-owned bank announced its first dividend in a decade.
Overall, the banking sector's profitability is up 22 percent year-on-year and credit quality is improving, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said, calling the quarter a healthy one for banks. 
European corporates have delivered 7.8 percent year-on-year earnings growth for the second quarter so far, up on first quarter gains, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""With global growth still robust, corporates reporting generally solid earnings, and inflation and interest rates at unthreatening levels, it’s unsurprising that our portfolios are still biased toward cyclical sectors like materials and industrials,"" said Henna Hemnani, assistant multi-asset fund manager at Miton.
Also reporting on Friday, German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) rose 0.7 percent after it reaffirmed it is on track to meet 2018 profit target.
""The group's key business continues to demonstrate robust operating performance and solvency remains comfortably above the upper end of the group's target range,"" said Goldman Sachs analysts. 
London-listed South African packaging group Mondi (L:MNDI) rose 6 percent to the top of the STOXX after it reported profits up by 25 percent in the first half thanks to higher selling prices and good demand.
Among fallers, Shares in Finnish refiner and biofuel producer Neste (HE:NESTE) were down 4.8 percent after it said a Chinese import tariff on U.S. soybeans could create excess capacity and weigh on the vegetable oil market, overshadowing a stronger 2018 outlook. Bookmaker  William Hill  (L:WMH) tumbled 7.3 percent after the it reported weaker UK retail profits.
Airport retailer Dufry (S:DUFN) fell 5.2 percent to a four-month low after reporting lower-than-expected sales growth.

 Heineken  (AS:HEIN) shares rose 1.8 percent after the firm sealed a $3.1 billion tie-up with the owner of China’s largest brewer, China Resources Beer, to take a 40 percent stake in the company.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 05:29AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank reports show chinks in money laundering armor,"By Edward Taylor, Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has uncovered shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth, internal documents seen by Reuters show, more than a year after it was fined nearly $700 million for allowing money laundering.
In two confidential reviews, dated June 5 and July 9, Germany's biggest lender detailed the results of tests on a sample of investment bank customer files in several countries, including Russia.
Both reviews found gaps in Deutsche's screening process, which aims to meet so-called ""Know Your Customer"" (KYC) requirements that are a cornerstone of global anti-money laundering controls.
Regulators around the world require banks to vet customers so that criminals cannot mask their identity through complex company and ownership structures to launder money or sidestep international sanctions. 
The two recent reviews show how the bank is still grappling with procedures to ensure it knows who it is dealing with, in part because of staff turnover.
In the 13-page June report, which was shared with the European Central Bank (ECB), Deutsche Bank found a pass rate of zero percent in countries such as Russia, Ireland, Spain, Italy and South Africa when it checked how client files had been processed. 
The pass rate measures the percentage of files that meet the bank's own ""Know Your Customer"" standards. Deutsche Bank strives for 95 percent, according to the documents.
Hui Chen, a former compliance expert with the U.S. justice department, said that this target was roughly in line with other global banks. 
The bank told Reuters that the reviews showed its processes were too complex, but said it was making improvements and that overall controls to prevent crimes such as money laundering were effective. 
""We still need to improve in terms of internal processes,"" it said, when presented with the findings of the reviews.
""What the documents show is that our internal processes are still too complicated,"" it said. ""So it is not about effectiveness, but about the efficiency of our processes.""
Deutsche executives met with the ECB, the euro zone's banking supervisor, in late July, to discuss its control procedures, according to one source with knowledge of the matter. The ECB and Germany's regulator BaFin declined to comment.
Banks have been fined billions of dollars for lax oversight, including the failure to identify customers.
In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay U.S. and UK regulators $630 million in fines over artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia.
The U.S. Federal Reserve fined the bank an additional $41 million for failing to ensure its systems would detect money laundering in May 2017.
   
UNDER PRESSURE
Deutsche Bank is under pressure after three consecutive years of losses, and it agreed to pay a $7.2 billion settlement with U.S. authorities last year over its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
The bank has also undergone management changes and a recent strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank.
In Russia, the June report outlined problems including a ""lack of verification of client address and existence"" and a ""lack of verification to be able to make an assessment of the client's source of funds"". 
It also identified a lack of investigation into whether a client was a ""politically exposed person"" (PEP).
Rules to fight financial crime require banks to identify such people because they present a higher risk of bribery or corruption by virtue of their position. These political figures could also be the target of international sanctions.
In their 2017 ruling against Deutsche Bank for 'mirror' trades, New York financial regulators criticized the lender for ""widespread and well-known weaknesses in its KYC processes"", singling out its Russia operations for shoddy standards. 
The issue remains sensitive because an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the case is ongoing.
In a written response to Reuters, Deutsche Bank said: ""We are not struggling with procedures designed to help prevent criminals from money laundering and other criminal action.
""Our procedures to identify potential anti-money laundering and KYC risks are very effective,"" it said of group-wide controls.
The bank has multiple layers of defense to spot crime, such as monitoring fund movements for suspicious transactions, a person close to the matter said.
   
BACKLOG
Christian Sewing, who became the bank's chief executive in April after a management shake-up, has vowed to address weaknesses in the bank's controls.
In June, he said the weaknesses had ""arisen over many years ... We're not yet where we want to be, but we're steadily getting there.""
Deutsche plans to work with regulators on deadlines for improving its procedures, the person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The internal documents show the scale of the challenge and highlight practical difficulties that arise as a result of staff changes in the United States and Ireland.
""This is a new team,"" the June report said, referring to Spain. For the U.S., it wrote: ""U.S. has experienced high attrition rates and teams are still maturing in terms of capability against a backdrop of backlogs.""
Deutsche said it was ""not constrained by headcount"", that it had increased the number of staff involved in KYC and that staff turnover was not above average.
It has also made improvements. The July report showed the pass rate in Russia improving to 67 percent after it hired auditors to help with customer checks.

But additional shortcomings emerged elsewhere. Reviews of the KYC procedures in the document resulted in lower pass rates in six of 14 locations highlighted, including in the Netherlands and the United States.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Cashing in on DNA: race on to unlock value in genetic data,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - How much is your DNA worth? As millions of people pay for home tests to check on ancestry or health risks, genetic data is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for drugmakers, triggering a race to create a DNA marketplace.
GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) decision to invest $300 million in 23andMe and forge an exclusive drug development deal with the Silicon Valley consumer genetics company crystallizes the value locked up in genetic code.
The tie-up is the biggest yet involving home DNA testing, a market dominated by 23andMe and Ancestry.com, which charge under $100 for a saliva-based test, but can also gain voluntary consent from customers for their data to be used by third parties. 
However a number of new start-ups are beginning to offer people the chance to own their genetic information and sell it to data-hungry drug researchers.
Firms like EncrypGen, Nebula Genomics, LunaDNA and Zenome are using blockchain - the technology behind Bitcoin - to secure sensitive DNA records and create a transaction ledger. The new players all have slightly different models, with most simply provide data platforms, where people are rewarded for providing data, although Nebula also plans to offer testing. 
The idea of using genetic factors to hunt for better drugs has been around for more than 20 years - but it is only now becoming possible to gather a large enough sample to spot the rare variants responsible for many diseases.
The number of people who have had their DNA analyzed with the main testing companies has taken off https://tmsnrt.rs/2M6KGyl since 2016 and now stands at around 17 million, according to entrepreneur and co-founder of science website DNAGeeks.com David Mittelman.
By 2021, he thinks the figure could be north of 100 million. 
TESTING TIMES 
For drugmakers like GSK, which announced its 23andMe deal last week, access to this data offers a way to accelerate drug development, since finding a drug target linked to a human genetic variant doubles the chance of producing a new medicine. 
The interest in home DNA tests, which can reveal genetic variants that may influence the chances of developing diseases including Alzheimer's, is part of a wider drive by drugmakers to tap into a range of anonymized patient data.
Roche (S:ROG), for example, has spent $4.3 billion this year buying out two specialists in cancer data, Foundation Medicine and Flatiron Health. 
The trend raises has worries among campaigners about data security and privacy.
In a bid to alleviate concerns, Ancestry.com, 23andMe and other consumer genetic testing companies have now set out a ""best practices"" framework to ensure express consent, strong security and transparency on data use.
Caitlin Curtis, a research fellow at the University of Queensland, estimates 23andMe has made around $130 million from selling access to about a million genotypes, prior to the GSK deal, implying an average price of around $130.
Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe's CEO, believes her customers simply want to help find new treatments for intractable conditions like Parkinson's disease - the focus of the first drug research project with GSK - and her company has no current plans to give customers rebates if their data is sold on. 
""People who have a disease or a family member with a condition are really interested in what they can do to help come up with a solution,"" she said in an interview.
A spokesman for Ancestry.com said his group did not have any current relationships with for-profit organizations, although it is working with some academic institutions. Ancestry.com did have a 2015 deal with U.S. biotech company Calico, the financial terms of which were not disclosed, but this has now ended.
NEWCOMERS
The ability of genetic testing companies to rake in cash twice rankles with some like geneticist George Church - the Harvard University scientist famous for wanting to resurrect the extinct Woolly mammoth - who is one of the founders of Nebula.
Nebula aims to eliminate the personal genetics companies as middlemen between data owners and data buyers, a notion shared by rivals like David Koepsell, chief executive of EncrypGen.
""We think people are going to get savvy about how their data is being sold and they are going to want a piece of that action,"" Koepsell said in an interview. ""Our whole model is about creating a market. People can upload and set a price for their data, and then we will see what the market will bear."" 
People selling data on EncrypGen's system will receive DNA tokens, a cryptocurrency. Other players have different plans, with LunaDNA's community-owned database offering shares that will generate dividends as researchers pay to access data.
Peter Pitts, president of non-profit healthcare research group the U.S. Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, agrees handing over DNA deserves financial recompense when the benefits flow to for-profit companies.
""People need to realize that they are actually paying for companies to monetize their most personal information and they are getting nothing for it,"" he said. 
LunaDNA co-founder Dawn Barry, who used to work at leading gene sequencing company Illumina (O:ILMN), said she didn't expect people to make ""life-changing money"" from selling DNA.
But she added: ""People feel good about the transparency and control and respect that they get by being equitable partners in discovery research.""
SIZE MATTERS
It won't be plain sailing for the new upstart companies.
One of the main attractions for GSK in doing a deal with 23andMe is the fact that the Google-backed Californian company has over 5 million customers, more than 80 percent of whom have consented to participate in research and share their data.
EncrypGen, by contrast, which launched its first storage product earlier this year, has just 1,000 profiled users, of whom around 100 have uploaded DNA data so far.
When it comes to using DNA to understand the links between genetics and disease, scale matters.
""To do the analyses that are required to understand these complex links between genetics and disease you need massive datasets,"" said researcher Curtis.
""It's hard to know how well these kinds of start-up platforms will scale up as research projects aim for millions of participants.""

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Disconnect between fees and performance in focus as Australian pension funds face inquiry,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Just two of Australia's 30 highest fee-charging pension funds are ranked in the country' top 30 performing funds, according to a Reuters analysis, a disconnect likely to come under scrutiny when managers face a powerful inquiry into financial misconduct which restarts on Monday.
Managers of nearly a third of Australia's $2 trillion in retirement savings will have their performance scrutinized at the so-called Royal Commission into financial misconduct, which has already roiled the banking and funds management industry.
Concerns over fees and performance have generated a groundswell of consumer disquiet in Britain and the United States about the vague language retirement funds use to justify lackluster performance.
""There's no real transparency around fees,"" said Xavier O'Halloran, head of policy for nonprofit CHOICE, one of 23 consumer advocates, regulators and pension funds which are scheduled to appear at the commission.
""They seem disinterested altogether and are hoping the spotlight will shift off them quickly."" 
The latest round of hearings may pile more pressure on the shares of the country's four biggest banks and top financial planner AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) - all of which the Royal Commission has called to appear - on top of the collective A$26 billion in market capitalization they have lost since hearings began in February. 
When government economic adviser the Productivity Commission asked pension funds their returns by investment class earlier this year, just five of 108 answered the question in full, the commission said.
Spokespeople for AMP, No. 1 lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), and pension fund giant Mercer Super Trust told Reuters the Royal Commission had asked for information about their pension products without providing details.
Representatives for No. 2 lender Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), third-ranking Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) declined comment.
All the banks but Westpac are quitting, or have quit, the pension fund business. Westpac cut its fees last month.
MONEY FOR NOTHING
Australia is the 14th biggest economy but has the third-largest pension pool in the world, according to OECD data, bigger than Canada or any country in mainland Europe. That's because of laws requiring employers to pay nearly a tenth of every worker's wages into a fund the person can't access until, in most cases, they reach 67 years of age.
But without reliable and directly comparable public data, Australia's 12 million workers often leave their employer to choose between a cheaper industry fund and a higher fee-charging private fund.
While industry funds face criticism for having union representatives without investment experience on their boards, most data suggests the privately run retail funds fare worse when taking into account the fees they charge. 
Among the worst performers, retail fund MLC Fund MySuper, owned by National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), returned 4.5 percent a year, after fees, for the past three years, four percentage points below the top ranking fund, according to researcher Rainmaker Group, and two percentage points below the average. The data showed the MLC fund returned 5.5 percent in the latest one-year period, 5 percentage points less than the top performer. MLC declined to comment on its performance and fees.
The MLC fund charges each of its almost 80,000 members A$1,247 per year, one of the highest fees in the industry, according to the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority. 
The highest fee-charging fund, the Perpetual Super Wrap, charges its customers an average of A$9,771 a year. Not including fee income, its investment return ranked 53rd out of 161 Australian pension funds in fiscal 2017, according to APRA figures. 
A Perpetual spokeswoman said the fees were ""negotiated and agreed between the adviser and the client (and) the amount therefore is individual to each client based on their needs, and the services and advice agreed with their adviser"". 
Perpetual's clients were ""established wealthy, business owners and professionals ... with high balances and often complex needs"" and the fees included ""administration and advice fees across clients with varying needs, objectives, preferences and balances,"" she added.
Jeff Bresnahan, chairman at research house SuperRatings, said disclosure on pension fund fees and performance was now the best it had been and predicted up to a third of funds will close in the next few years as customers switch to better performing rivals.
""Funds that are not engaging and are not providing value to members are losing members because of it,"" he said.
""That would point to a slow and steady empowerment of consumers and that will continue.""

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2018 03:49AM ET</span>",Australia calls on bank outsiders to break up Big Four dominance,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government called for more banks to challenge the industry's oligopoly on Friday, after the country's top economic adviser said the ""Big Four"" lenders' market dominance has been detrimental to customers.
The remarks from Treasurer Scott Morrison demonstrate the increasingly strident tone the conservative government is taking with an industry it has traditionally supported, as a powerful public inquiry airs allegations of fraud, deception and fee-gouging across the finance sector.
""The answer begins, but certainly doesn't end, with more players in the market,"" said Morrison in a speech to construction industry representatives. ""What this means for the customer is simple: cheaper loans, cheaper products.""
Australia's four biggest lenders are Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (AX:NAB). Together, they control about 80 percent of the country's deposit and home loan markets, making them some of the world's most profitable banks.
But revelations during the Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector, now just over halfway through its year-long schedule, have seen the four collectively lose over A$17 billion ($12.53 billion) in market value since the inquiry's February start.
Morrison had resisted calls for the inquiry, saying existing regulations were sufficient, before a series of scandals in the sector prompted a change in stance in late 2017.
""Banks have made this mess for themselves,"" Morrison said in the speech. ""They should play a key role in cleaning shop."" 
Earlier on Friday, the government published a report on the sector compiled by the Productivity Commission (PC), which said banks not disclosing bonuses for mortgage brokers or financial planners for marketing their products resulted in poor outcomes for customers.
""What often is passed off as competition is more accurately described as persistent marketing and brand activity designed to promote a blizzard of barely differentiated products,"" the advisory body said in the 680-page report.
It said the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) had not sufficiently stimulated competition, and recommended measures to lessen the market power of the Big Four.
""The lack of an advocate for competition when financial system regulatory interventions are being determined is a mistake that should now be corrected,"" the commission said.
The government eased banking license requirements in May, after which it awarded a license to an internet-only startup for the first time. On Friday, Morrison said there were now 58 other organizations eligible to call themselves ""banks"".
NAB's chief operating officer Anthony Cahill said the bank was ""fiercely"" competing on price and service.
""The entrance of fintech and global tech giants is changing the dynamic of the Australian financial services landscape,"" said Cahill. ""We welcome the competition because ultimately, customers are the beneficiaries,"" he added. 
A spokeswoman for Westpac said the bank supported government measures to improve competition, while a spokeswoman for ANZ referred Reuters to the banking lobby for comment, which said all banks welcomed competition.

APRA declined to comment, while a spokesman for CBA did not return requests for comment.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and Alibaba's (N:BABA) Ant Financial are in talks with bike-sharing startup Ofo for a joint buyout offer that could value Ofo at up to $2 billion, according to a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.
A deal would mark the latest stage of consolidation in China's once-booming bike-sharing industry, where a series of startups have burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in the fight to dominate key cities, littering the streets with thousands of bikes in the process. 
It would bring Alibaba-backed Ofo even deeper into the e-commerce giant's orbit, just months after Ofo rival Mobike was snapped up in a $2.7 billion deal by Meituan-Dianping, the on-demand online service provider with links to Tencent (HK:0700), a backer of Mobike. [nL4N1RH2AR]
Didi, which already owns a stake in Ofo, has hired a third-party agency to conduct due diligence on the startup's business and finances, the source said. The offer may be lowered or even dropped if Ofo's business turns out to be worse than expected after the due diligence is completed, the source said.
Chinese local media first reported Didi and Ant teaming up to bid for Ofo. 
Spokeswoman for Didi and Ant declined to comment. Ofo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Japanese telecoms and technology giant SoftBank Corp (T:9984) is a shareholder in all three companies.
Besides engaging in tight competition in China, Mobike and Ofo have aggressively expanded abroad, with Beijing-based Ofo saying on its website that it runs more than 10 million bikes in over 20 countries. 
However, media reports in recent weeks have said the company has scaled back or shut down operations in markets such as Australia and India.

In March, Ofo said it raised $866 million in a new funding round led by  Alibaba , which it described as the largest investment garnered in a single round by a bike-sharing startup. [nL3N1QV1X3]

(Reuters) - The U.S. government told a federal court judge on Thursday that volunteers and non-profit groups, rather than government officials, should take the lead in locating more than 400 immigrant parents who were separated from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border and deported from the United States. 
The proposal came in a San Diego Federal Court lawsuit challenging some 2,500 family separations initiated by the Trump administration as part of its ""zero tolerance"" policy to curb illegal immigration. 
In the case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the government to reunify the families by July 26, but that deadline was not fully met. 
While more than 1,900 children have been reunited with their families, or seen their cases resolved in other ways, hundreds remain separated, including the children of more than 400 parents no longer in the United States, according to the government's latest filing.
In its plan for reuniting those families, filed with the court on Thursday, attorneys from the Department of Justice said that the government would supply what information it had about the deported parents to the plaintiffs' attorneys. 
At that point, the filing said, ""plaintiffs' counsel should use their considerable resources and their network of law firms, NGOs, volunteers, and others,"" to establish contact with deported parents and determine their wishes.
The ACLU has repeatedly said that it would assist with efforts to find the deported parents, but the group made clear in Thursday's filing that it expected the U.S. government to bear ultimate responsibility for locating them. 
Most of the removed parents were returned to their home countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
""Not only was it the government’s unconstitutional separation practice that led to this crisis, but the United States Government has far more resources than any group of NGOs,"" the ACLU said in the filing.
The ACLU noted that the government seemed not to have addresses for some 120 of the deported parents. Government lawyers said they would need until Aug. 10 to go through the files of the children of those parents to find information that could help in the search.
Judge Sabraw will hold a hearing on Friday to discuss the ongoing reunification efforts. He is also expected to decide soon when to lift a stay that prohibits rapid deportation of reunited families. 
Government lawyers told Sabraw last week that about 300 children were in family detention centers, and could be deported quickly once the judge allowed it.
The ACLU has argued that the reunified families need time to discuss their options with legal counsel. 
A separate class action lawsuit recently brought in the District of Columbia on behalf of separated children seeks a separate stay on deportations. That lawsuit said that minors should be allowed to remain in the United States to pursue their legal rights apart from their parents.

The Trump Administration ended family separations in June, after weeks of international outcry over the policy.

In a statement on its website, the State Administration for Market Regulation said Pinduoduo should ""strengthen platform management, regulate business activities of third-party vendors, stick to law and maintain a healthy, fast and sustainable development.""
Huang Zheng, Pinduoduo's chief executive officer, vowed to ""thoroughly rectify and reform,"" and cooperate with regulators' investigation, according to the statement. The company is backed by Chinese video and internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd and was valued at $23.8 billion last week in an initial public offering (IPO) in New York.
Authorities said earlier this week they were investigating the company after reports that the platform was selling counterfeit and shoddy goods to its over 300 million users. Shanghai-based Pinduoduo described reports as ""attacks"" on the company.
Pinduoduo's share price has slumped below its IPO price this week following the investigation. Its shares had jumped 44 percent on its trading debut.
The firm is also being taken to a federal court in the United States by a diaper maker, which claimed that Pinduoduo knowingly allowed the sale of counterfeit products bearing the company's name on its site.
After the IPO, Pinduoduo became the subject of media reports and online jokes centered on goods on its marketplace resembling products from firms such as Coca-Cola Co, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd.

Many jokes described the goods using the phrase ""shanzai"", a term often used to refer to look-alike products featuring purposely misspelled names of big brands.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made headlines as it rose 2.9% to close at $207.3 in the U.S. on Thursday and became the first U.S.-based company with a market value of $1 trillion. The company reported strong third-quarter earnings earlier this week.
China-based PetroChina Co Ltd (HK:0857) reached that valuation in 2007 but slumped soon after a financial crisis sent oil prices down.
So far, almost 400 companies listed on the S&P 500 reported earnings this season and about 85% of them beat analysts’ expectations, Bloomberg reported.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.1% and 0.5% by 10:20PM ET (02:20 GMT). Chinese stocks continued to underperform their regional peers as trade concerns returned to focus this week.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged to inflict more pain to China unless it changes its economic system.
“We have to create a situation where it’s more painful for them to continue their bad practices than it is to reform,” Ross said in an interview on Fox Business Network on Thursday. The U.S. will keep turning up the pressure on China for as long as the country refuses to level the economic playing field, said Ross. “The reason for the tariffs to begin with was to try and convince the Chinese to modify their behavior. Instead they have been retaliating. So the president now feels that it’s potentially time to put more pressure on, in order to modify their behavior,” he said.
His comment came after China accused the U.S. of “blackmailing” on Thursday and that it would never surrender to U.S. trade threats.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.2%, and South Korea’s KOSPI also edged up 0.4%.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also tracked higher. Information technology led the advance, with the subindex higher by 2.53% earlier in the morning.
Looking ahead, the U.S. jobs report is due later in the day, and is widely expected to report a healthy labor market, with 193,000 new jobs."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Thursday became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company, crowning a decade-long rise fueled by its ubiquitous iPhone that transformed it from a niche player in personal computers into a global powerhouse spanning entertainment and communications. 
The tech company's stock jumped 2.9 percent to end the day at $207.39, giving it a market capitalization of $1.002 trillion. During the session, Apple's stock market value reached as much as $1.006 trillion.
Apple has rallied about 9 percent since Tuesday, when it reported June-quarter results above expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares. It was Apple's best two-day run since April 2014.
In a memo to Apple's more than 120,000 employees on Thursday that was seen by Reuters, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the $1 trillion valuation was ""a significant milestone"" that gave Apple employees ""much to be proud of."" But he said it was ""not the most important measure"" of the company's success.
""Financial returns are simply the result of Apple’s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,"" Cook said in the memo.
Started in the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976, Apple has pushed its revenue beyond the economic outputs of Portugal, New Zealand and other countries. Along the way, it has changed how consumers connect with one another and how businesses conduct daily commerce.
Apple's stock market value is greater than the combined capitalization of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and AT&T Inc (N:T). It now accounts for 4 percent of the S&P 500. 
The Silicon Valley stalwart's stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&P 500's approximately 2,000 percent increase during the same almost four decades. 
One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. 
He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping ""Computer"" from Apple's name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value.
During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. 
Jobs, who died in 2011, was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, who has doubled the company's profits but struggled to develop a new product to replicate the society-altering success of the iPhone, which has seen sales taper off in recent years.
In 2006, the year before the iPhone launch, Apple generated less than $20 billion in sales and net profit just shy of $2 billion. By last year, its sales had grown more than 11-fold to $229 billion - the fourth highest in the S&P 500 (SPX) - and net income had mushroomed at twice that rate to $48.4 billion, making it the most profitable publicly listed U.S. company. 
'STILL SEE UPSIDE'
Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, has included Apple in his clients' portfolios for about a decade. Recently, some of his older clients have bought Apple shares for their grandchildren.
""We still see upside from it, and as new money gets deposited we continue to buy, preferably on the dip,"" Carbone said.
Apple's stock has risen over 30 percent in the past year, fueled by optimism about the iPhone X, launched a decade after the original. Also propelling Apple higher in recent months was Apple's announcement that it earmarked $100 billion for a new share repurchase program.
In its report on Tuesday, Apple sales led by the iPhone X, which sells for about $1,000, pushed quarterly results far beyond Wall Street targets, with subscriptions from App Store, Apple Music and iCloud services bolstering business. 
""The markets are starting to recognize the value of its platform and services more and more, and that's what is being reflected in the increase in market capitalization,"" said Brad Neuman, director of Market Strategy at Alger, a growth equity asset management firm in New York City.
Even with its $1,000,000,000,000 stock market value, many analysts do not view Apple's shares as expensive. Shares of Apple this week traded at about 15 times expected earnings, compared with Amazon at 82 times earnings and Microsoft at 25 times earnings.
Adjusting for four stock splits over the years, Apple debuted on the stock market for the equivalent of 39 cents a share on Dec. 12, 1980, compared with Thursday's high of $208.38.
In 2015, Apple joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of capitalism's most exclusive clubs. Since 1980,  IBM  Corp (N:IBM), Exxon Mobil (N:XOM),  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Microsoft have also alternated as the largest publicly listed U.S. company. 
In 2007, Chinese government-controlled PetroChina (SS:601857) briefly reached a stock market value of about $1.1 trillion following its public listing in Shanghai. It is now worth about $200 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
One of five U.S. companies since the 1980s to take a turn as Wall Street's largest company by market capitalization, Apple could lose its lead to the likes of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) or Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) if it does not find a major new product or service as global demand for smartphones loses steam.
Hot on Apple's heels is Amazon.com, the second-largest listed U.S. company by market value, at around $880 billion, closely followed by Google-owner Alphabet and by Microsoft.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Thursday that the iPhone maker's $1 trillion market capitalization was ""not the most important measure"" of the company's success but was instead a result of its focus on its products, customers and company values.
In a memo to Apple's more than 120,000 employees that was seen by Reuters, Cook called the valuation a ""significant milestone"" that gave the company ""much to be proud of."" But he said it should not be the Cupertino, California, company's focus.
""Financial returns are simply the result of Apple’s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,"" Cook said in the memo.
With a closing price of $207.39 on Thursday, Apple became the first publicly listed U.S. company to ever reach $1 trillion in market capitalization. Apple's stock market value is greater than the combined capitalization of  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and AT&T (N:T). It now accounts for 4 percent of the S&P 500.
Cook had not previously publicly commented on the company's $1 trillion valuation.
Apple was founded in the late 1970s by Steve Jobs and went public in 1980 after helping usher in the era of the personal computer. One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy.
In the two decades since, Apple has risen to become the most valuable company in the world by helping popularize yet another era in computing, the smart phone. The iPhone, introduced by Jobs in 2007, has sold more than one billion units. In his memo, Cook referred back to Jobs, who died in 2011.
""Steve founded Apple on the belief that the power of human creativity can solve even the biggest challenges — and that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do,"" Cook wrote in the memo. 

""Just as Steve always did in moments like this, we should all look forward to Apple’s bright future and the great work we’ll do together.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China weighed on global stocks and bond yields on Thursday, but a rise in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) took its valuation above a record $1 trillion and helped major U.S. indexes close in positive territory.
In midday trading, Apple Inc became the first publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. That led a rebound in technology stocks that helped key U.S. indexes pare earlier losses to turn positive. 
""They get the blue ribbon,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""If you look at a trillion dollars, that's about 5 percent of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, if you look at the stock relative to the market its (price-to-earnings ratio) is less, it still has a decent growth rate.""
The tech company's stock jumped more than 3.3 percent to as high as $208.38, bringing its gain to about 9 percent since Tuesday when it reported quarterly results that beat expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares.
The Nasdaq, Dow and benchmark S&P indexes had opened lower, but began to turn positive as the advance in Apple shares helped take the focus away from the trade dispute. The Dow, which was the worst performer of the three indexes, was the only one to end lower. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.66 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,326.16, the S&P 500 gained 13.86 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,827.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.40 points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,802.69.
Despite the day's reprieve for Wall Street, concerns remained over the U.S.-China trade spat, which intensified on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
China on Thursday urged the United States to ""calm down,"" but market participants remained unnerved. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.75 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.85 percent.

U.S. yields, however, moved in narrow ranges ahead of Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July.
""The market was pretty much back and forth. We're just waiting for tomorrow's payrolls,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York.
Euro zone government bond yields dipped, and borrowing costs in Germany and France pulled back from seven-week highs.
Gold prices inched downward after Fed's upbeat assessment of the economy on Wednesday to the lowest price in more than a year as the dollar, which typically has an inverse relationship with gold, rose. 
Spot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,208.72 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.87 percent to $1,216.90 an ounce.
The dollar index rose 0.56 percent, with the euro down 0.61 percent to $1.1587.
Oil prices strengthened after an industry report suggested U.S. crude stockpiles would soon begin to decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week.
Traders said prices rallied when industry information provider Genscape reported crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude, dropped 1.1 million barrels since Friday, July 27.

Brent crude futures settled up $1.06, or 1.5 percent at $73.45 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.30, or 1.9 percent, to $68.96 a barrel.

(Reuters) -  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) said on Thursday that delays in new restaurant openings would slow revenue growth this year, disappointing Wall Street which was expecting the company to raise its guidance.
Shares of the burger chain, which have risen 31 percent in the last three months, fell 5.5 percent to $60.50 in extended trading.
The company maintained its full-year revenue forecast of between $446 million and $450 million, which was below analysts' expectation of $452.3 million.
Shake Shack, which started as a single Manhattan hot dog stand in 2001, is now widening its presence in the United States and aims to have a total of 122 to 125 company-operated stores by the end of the year.
However, the company said more than 70 percent of its 32 to 35 new restaurants will open in the second half of the year due to bottlenecks such as a prolonged permitting process as well as shortage of labor and construction equipment. 
""The unfortunate reality for timing is just that way more than we expected Shacks are going to open in the third and fourth quarter,"" Shake Shack CEO Randall Garutti said on a call with analysts. ""So, it will be a big push for us at the end of the year.""
Revenue growth for the New York-based company has been largely driven by its strategy of opening more stores and selling burgers and milkshakes at higher prices to avoid the intense competition of value-driven fast food chains.
The company, whose revenue has beaten Wall Street estimates for at least the last nine quarters, has been enjoying a lofty valuation, with its shares trading at 92.85 times its 12-month forward earnings.
That had led investors to expect a strong beat in same-restaurant sales and a raise in its full-year revenue and comparable sales guidance, Cowen & Co analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a pre-earnings note.
However, sales at Shake Shacks open for at least two years rose 1.1 percent, in line with what analysts had expected.
""Should the results meet or even miss investor expectations, we would expect shares' reaction to be strongly negative,"" Charles wrote.
Total revenue rose 27.3 percent to $116.3 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $111 million. 
Excluding certain items, the company earned 29 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 27, beating the estimate of 18 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

(Reuters) - CBS Corp's (N:CBS) quarterly results topped Wall Street targets and CEO Les Moonves delivered an upbeat message to investors about the media company's future on Thursday, without addressing allegations of sexual misconduct against him reported last week.
At the start of an analysts conference call on CBS earnings that was also broadcast on business television network CNBC, the company said it would not take questions about Moonves' reported behavior or its legal battle with majority shareholder Shari Redstone over control of the U.S. media group.
Shares of CBS were little changed after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Moonves said the company's digital business, which includes Showtime and CBS All Access streaming services, will grow to 16 million domestic subscribers by 2022, up from a prior forecast for 8 million subscribers by 2020.

Moonves said political advertising revenue so far this year is nearly double the amount from this time in 2014, during the previous midterm election.
Overall revenue increased to $3.47 billion from $3.26 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' average estimate of $3.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
CBS said affiliate and subscription fees revenue, which includes revenue from cable, satellite and streaming TV providers, rose to $989 million from $848 million a year before. 
Net income from continuing operations was $400 million, or $1.05 per share in the second quarter ended June 30, up from $397 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusting for restructuring and other charges, CBS earned $1.12 a share, beating the analyst consensus of $1.11. 
INVESTIGATION
Moonves remains CEO of CBS as two law firms conduct an investigation into claims by six women described in an article in the New Yorker magazine last Friday. They said Moonves sexually harassed them in incidents between 1985 and 2006. 
Moonves was quoted in the New Yorker as saying that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"", which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and had never used his position to harm anyone's career.
The CBS board approved the hiring of the law firms on Wednesday and also set up a special board committee to help the probe. Moonves will have no role in the investigation, CBS said.
The investigation will also look at broader corporate cultural issues at CBS.
CBS stock is down more than 9.0 percent since publication of the New Yorker article on July 27. 
Moonves is the latest executive to come under scrutiny by the #MeToo social media movement, which has demanded accountability from business leaders, politicians and entertainers accused of sexual misconduct and has led to resignations in major corporations, Hollywood and among lawmakers in the past year.
The claims about Moonves also come as he is locked in a battle over control of CBS with the company's largest shareholder, National Amusements Inc, which is owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner Redstone. 
Moonves has opposed efforts by Shari Redstone for CBS to merge with media company Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also owned by National Amusements.

Moonves, who has served as CEO of the media company since it was split from Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) in 2006, has resisted a deal to reunite the companies because he believes CBS's prospects are brighter without taking on Viacom's turnaround challenges.

The immigrants said they were being held at a detention center in Karnes, Texas, with no notification from U.S. authorities on their immigration status, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) said.
It was not immediately clear how many fathers have joined the hunger strike, which began on Wednesday.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not comment on whether a hunger strike was taking place. ICE said in a statement it respected the rights of detainees to voice their opinion and would not retaliate in any way.
""We are desperate, we are tired of being incarcerated and we want to be released with our sons,"" read a letter to media from a detainee named ""Jorge"" read out on a conference call hosted by RAICES. The letter said it represented 400 families. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has made a hardline stance on immigration an integral part of his presidency and has promised to keep immigrants targeted for deportation locked up ""pending the outcome of their removal proceedings.""
Some 2,500 children were separated from their parents as part of a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal immigration that began in early May. Many of them had crossed the U.S.-Mexican border illegally, while others had sought asylum. The U.S. government said last week it had reunited just over half of them.
RAICES said some fathers were staging sit-ins at the Karnes County Residential Center, about 51 miles southeast of San Antonio and children were refusing to take part in school activities. Nearly 600 people were involved in protests, it said.
Private contractor GEO Group Inc (N:GEO), which runs the Karnes County Residential Center, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some fathers at the center said they were misled into agreeing to deportation as a condition of seeing their children again, RAICES said. Others said they had not been given the opportunity to apply for asylum.
A federal judge in San Diego has placed an indefinite stay on deportations in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Male immigrants at Karnes, and women and girl immigrants detained in Dilley, Texas, are among migrants who were reunited last week and then detained, RAICES said.

(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) on Thursday reported a 17 percent fall in quarterly profit as its general insurance business failed to show improvement, missing analysts' expectations.
AIG shares fell more than 5.5 percent to $52.15 after hours.
Chief Executive Brian Duperreault, who took charge more than a year ago, has been trying to turn around the company and its commercial insurance business, including by sharpening underwriting practices.
The second-quarter results included a $200 million restructuring charge related to ""efficiency initiatives,"" including compensation.
AIG has been on a hiring spree to bring on new executives to boost profits. On Wednesday, AIG named veteran industry executive David McElroy to head its Lexington Insurance Co unit.
McElroy had been executive chairman of Arch Insurance Group Inc and vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Insurance Group.
Peter Zaffino, former CEO of Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc's (N:MMC) insurance brokerage unit, was named to head AIG's general insurance business. Former Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) executive Tom Bolt was named chief underwriting officer of general insurance.
Adjusted pretax income from AIG's general insurance business dropped 46 percent to $568 million, while underwriting income swung to a loss of $89 million from a $149 million profit a year ago. 
Duperreault has launched an underwriting review of AIG's general insurance business and increased the company's focus on technology to boost its stock.
In May, Duperreault said he expected an underwriting profit by year-end.
The combined ratio in AIG's general insurance business rose to 101.3 percent from 97.7 percent a year ago, as more claims were paid than premiums earned because of severe and catastrophe-related losses.
Duperreault has said his goals include getting the ratio to below 100 percent, a measure of underwriting profitability. Adjusted pretax income from the company's life and retirement business fell 3 percent to $962 million in the quarter. 
Net income fell to $937 million, or $1.02 per share, from $1.13 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter. 

On an adjusted basis, AIG earned $1.05 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 05:59PM ET</span>","Tesla shares spike, dealing short-sellers a $1.7 billion loss","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares soared 16 percent on Thursday, a day after the electric car maker's better-than-expected quarterly report, and financial analytics firm S3 Partners said short-sellers were slammed with $1.7 billion in paper losses on the day.
S3 said the day's losses pushed the aggregate year-to-date performance of short-sellers in Tesla into the red. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. Tesla is the most shorted U.S. stock.
Until Wednesday, Tesla short-sellers had, on paper, been up $276 million for the year. Following Thursday’s stock surge, they now have losses of $1.4 billion for the year, S3 data showed.
""We are not seeing a large amount of buy to covers yet,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York, referring to traders buying shares to close out an existing short position.
""With such a large price move on the open, most short-sellers that are looking to cover are waiting for a retracement before placing buy-to-cover orders,"" he said.
Tesla shares rallied $48.70 to $349.54 a day after the manufacturer said it would produce its new Model 3 sedan at a profit, following several recent weeks in which output had stabilized.
The update buoyed hopes that the company led by Elon Musk will stanch its losses.
Tesla's rapid cash burn and struggles at turning a profit have made it a favorite target for shorts, including big names such as Jim Chanos, head of Kynikos Associates, and billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital fund.
Since the beginning of 2016, Tesla is the fourth-worst performing U.S. short bet, and short-sellers have lost $4.70 billion on a net basis over that period, according to S3 data.
A sharp rally in the electric car maker's shares since early April has hurt short-sellers.

On Tuesday, Einhorn told investors that his bet against the stock had turned into heavy second-quarter losses at his Greenlight Capital fund.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",FCC chairman Pai says Trump has not contacted him on Sinclair deal,"By Kara Carlson
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has not contacted the Federal Communications Commission about its lack of approval for Sinclair Broadcast Group's (O:SBGI) deal to buy  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO), which Trump has called ""disgraceful"" on Twitter, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday.
""No one in the White House has contacted us to express a view about the merger,"" Pai said.
In July, the FCC unanimously voted to refer the merger for an administrative review to determine if the conservative-leaning Sinclair engaged in misrepresentation or displayed a lack of candor about the merger to the commission.
Trump's tweet raised the question of whether he had involved himself in the decision-making progress of an independent regulator.
In its order for administrative review, the FCC said Sinclair ""did not fully disclose facts"" about the $3.9 billion acquisition. Pai had expressed ""serious concerns"" prior to the vote. 
Within days of the FCC action, Trump tweeted: ""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn't approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People."" 
The Republican president said it was ""disgraceful"" that the FCC was standing in the way of the merger, which he compared to a 2011 FCC approved deal in which Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) acquired NBC. 
On Thursday, Pai reiterated previous statements to Congress defending the decision to review. 
""I will simply say what I said to Congress, which is, I stand by our decision. We looked at the facts and applied the law as we do in any transaction."" 
Sinclair owns 192 stations, the largest number of local TV stations in the United States. The company said in May 2017 it planned to acquire 42 new stations from the Tribune. But it had said it would sell 23 of its existing stations to obtain regulatory approval. 

The administrative review hearing could cause significant delays and potentially kill the deal.

1462,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>","Apple, $1 Trillion and Stock Market Bubbles","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Can something worth $1 trillion be cheap? Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). on Thursday became the first U.S. company to reach the hard-to-conceptualize milestone, which is sure to spark a debate about whether the stock market is just one big bubble waiting to burst. After all, Apple’s market capitalization is bigger than the economies of all but 17 countries in the world.
Plus, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). are not far behind; all have stock market values that comfortably exceed $800 billion. But as DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed out in a note to clients, Apple has accomplished this feat in the absence of a sky-high multiple. Its shares trade at about 17.6 times forecasted earnings, compared with 17.5 times for the S&P 500 Index, which is about in line with the average going back to 1990 and far below the peak during that time of more than 25 times in the late 1990s. While it’s true that stocks face a lot of headwinds — the potential for a trade war, a hawkish Federal Reserve, rising federal debt and deficits — valuations are not exactly one of them. Apple’s breakthrough does expose, however, a highly lopsided market for equities.
On one side sits a handful of highflying technology-related shares; everything else is on the other. Bianco Research President Jim Bianco compared it to a zero sum situation in a Bloomberg Opinion commentary last month. He found that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Apple, Amazon, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., Microsoft and Google — collectively known as the FAANMGs — had pushed the S&P 500 up by 2.66 percent since November, while the other 494 stocks in the benchmark pushed it down by a collective 0.4 percent. Adding  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)., Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., Nvidia Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to the FAANMGs group caused the MSCI World Stock Index to rise by 1.61 percent. Every other stock on the planet was collectively down 1.07 percent.
POUND POUNDEDThe Bank of England is hastening the demise of the U.K. economy. That’s one conclusion to draw from the sterling’s reaction to the central bank’s decision on Thursday to raise interest rates. The Bloomberg Pound Index slid as much as 0.63 percent, keeping it at its lowest levels since October and bringing its decline since mid-April to 5.76 percent. The move is surprising because 1) higher rates tend to bolster a currency because they attract foreign capital, and 2) the decision by policy makers was unexpectedly unanimous, suggesting another boost may be in the works before long. What’s puzzling to currency traders is why the BOE felt the need to raise rates when the U.K.’s exit from the European Union is still mired in uncertainty. The U.K. economy is expected to grow just 1.3 percent this year, and 1.5 percent in 2019, Bloomberg data show. “Some fairly optimistic assessments in there — but this is all with rose-tinted glasses of a smooth Brexit adjustment,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, according to Bloomberg News. “That is currently not a view that everyone in the market shares — so expect limited follow-through. The short-term political troubles for the pound remain.”
BREWING DEBT CRISIS?It’s way too soon to say the euro zone faces another debt crisis, but a couple of developments in two bond markets Thursday are causing some concern. First, Italy’s bonds tumbled ahead of a budget meeting between populist political leaders and Financial Minister Giovanni Tria. The meeting is to consider demands by the populists for a flat tax and income support for the poor, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying where it obtained the information. Italy’s finances are already on shaky ground, and any policies that add to its $2.28 trillion debt load are sure to be looked upon unfavorably by bond investors. In a sign that debt investors perceive heightened risks, Italy’s 10-year bonds yield 2.44 percentage points more than German bunds, more than doubling from 1.13 percentage points in April. In France, investors submitted bids for just 1.31 times the amount of 20-year bonds offered by the government, down from 2.14 times at the prior sale of those maturities and marking the lowest so-called bid-to-cover ratio since at least 2007. Some strategists speculated the drop in demand may have been due to Japanese investors, who are big owners of French bonds, choosing to take advantage of suddenly higher yields back home. And how did the currency market react? The Bloomberg Euro Index was headed for its lowest close in almost a month in late trading.
 TRADE WAR LOSERSIn the great debate about whether the U.S., China or the European Union will come out ahead as trade war rhetoric heats up, it’s becoming clear that the biggest loser will be emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities fell as much as 1.99 percent Thursday at one points in the biggest drop since March, while the broader MSCI All-Country World Index declined just 0.91 percent. The sell-off followed reports that the U.S. is weighing whether to impose a 25 percent duty on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate, and China responded by saying it’s ready to retaliate. Of course, China is part of the EM index, and plenty of its constituents have their own problems unrelated to trade, such as Turkey and South Africa. The Institute of International Finance in Washington calculates that net capital flows to EM slowed to about $11 billion last quarter from $118 billion in the first three months of the year. Outside of China, EM counties sold more than $8 billion of their foreign-exchange reserves to bolster their currencies, the IIF noted in a report Thursday. India’s central bank governor raised the prospect of global currency wars as he led policy makers in raising interest rates to the highest in two years to shore up the rupee and tackle inflation pressures. “The trade skirmishes evolved into tariff wars and now we are possibly at the beginning of currency wars,” Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel told reporters.
FOOD PRICES TUMBLEWith all the volatility in commodities markets these days stemming from escalating trade tensions, it’s hard to keep track of what’s up, what’s down and what the impact on consumers will be. Although it may not have much to do with global trade, one key part of the commodities market is proving friendly to consumers. Food costs are starting to buckle under the weight of too much supply, with a gauge of global prices slumping by the most this year, according to Bloomberg News’s Nicholas Larkin. The United Nations’ food price index dropped 3.7 percent in July, a month after trade war tensions helped push prices down for the first time since January. Dairy-product and sugar prices fell the most last month amid better production prospects or ample export supplies. Even concern about wheat output on the back of drought in major growers wasn’t enough to stop grain costs from slipping, Larkin reports. Prices fell across all food groups, with vegetable-oil costs hitting a 2 1/2-year low and a gauge of sugar sliding on improving crop outlooks in key producers such as India and Thailand. That’s good news for consumers who’ve faced higher bills in recent years, as well as central bankers trying to curb inflation.
TEA LEAVESThe U.S. Labor Department will release the monthly jobs report on Friday, and it should be average. Not average in a bad way, just that the median estimate among economists surveyed by Bloomberg show some 192,000 jobs were added in July. That’s in line with the monthly average of 213,000 since the economy started recovering in 2010. The real action happens in the part of the report that provides the data on wages. Investors have come to immediately zero in on this data point because of its implications for inflation. The thinking goes that faster wage gains should translate into faster inflation. But despite a low unemployment rate of about 4 percent, wage gains have been muted, stuck in a band of 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent on a year-over-year basis since mid-2016. The July jobs report is likely to be no different, with the year-over-year increase forecast to be 2.7 percent.

1464,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Another Strong Jobs Report Expected
Trading direction at the start of trading Friday will be dictated by the July employment numbers. But given the recent economic data and assessment from the Federal Reserve, big market swings are unlikely.
The Labor Department will issue the report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 193,000 last month and that the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.9%.
The employment data out so far this week has been positive. Private sector employment rose more than expected, according to ADP, and initial jobless claims rose, but less than forecast.
Wage growth could be the most interesting part of the report. It’s been pretty tame despite the large job gains.
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.3% month on month, up from a 0.2% rise in June. Compared with a year ago period, wage growth is seen steady at 2.7%.
A spike could put the Federal Reserve on notice about inflation as it considers more rate hikes. The Fed said this week it would continue to gradually raise rates should the economy continue to show ""sustained expansion,"" supported by a strong labor market and close-to-target inflation.
Inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, should be at 2% this year and tick up to 2.2% in 2019, according to a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note released this week.
2. Kraft, Groupon Will Report
While the bulk of companies have reported earnings, investors will likely look to a few names expected to release quarterly reports ahead of trading Friday.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is expected to report a quarterly profit of 92 cents per share on sales of about $6.6 billion.
The top line will likely get the most scrutiny as the company has seen softness in sales in recent quarter. Investors will also be looking for signs of cost inflation.
In addition, online coupon company Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will issue results. Analysts expect it to post a profit of 3 cents per share on sales of $632 million. Shares of Groupon are higher in the past three months.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) reports after the bell tomorrow. But the actual results will be overshadowed if the company decides to announce a stock repurchase plan. Berkshire loosened its stock buyback rules in July, but said it would not make a move until after its earnings were released.
3. Slight Drop in Services Activity Forecast
While the jobs report will grab the headlines, there is more economic data to consider.
The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) arrives at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). Economists predict a measure of 58.6 in July services activity, down from 59.1.
In addition, Markit’s measures of July manufacturing and services economic activity come in at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
The Markit composite PMI is seen coming in at 55.9 and the services PMI is forecast at 56.2. That would reflect an unchanged reading for both from the month before."
1465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:48PM ET</span>",Allergan sues Pfizer over costs of opioid litigation,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc on Thursday sued  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) to require its rival to cover any damages it is forced to pay as a result of hundreds of lawsuits claiming Allergan deceptively marketed an opioid it acquired from a company Pfizer bought.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, Allergan said the ""primary basis"" for the claims against it was the alleged improper marketing and sale of Kadian, a form of morphine, in the years before it gained rights to the painkiller in late 2008.
""But now that more than a thousand lawsuits seek to impose liability for that very marketing and sale, Pfizer has rejected any responsibility to indemnify Allergan,"" alleged Allergan Finance LLC, the subsidiary that filed the lawsuit.
Pfizer in a statement said Allergan's claims related to a drug it never sold and arise from a contract with King Pharmaceuticals Inc, which Pfizer acquired in 2010. 
""We will review Allergan's suit and respond accordingly,"" Pfizer said.
Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Drugmakers including Allergan, Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc are facing a wave of lawsuits by state and local governments accusing them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing.
At least 1,021 lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland. The first trial is set for March.
Plaintiffs' lawyers pursuing the cases have compared them to the litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998. 
In its complaint, Allergan said most of the lawsuits it faces seeking to hold it responsible for playing a role in the opioid crisis primarily relate to improper marketing of Kadian and involve allegations dating back to the mid-1990s.
The drug at that time was owned by Alpharma Inc, which King Pharmaceuticals acquired in 2008, the same year King sold the rights to Kadian to  Actavis . In 2016, Actavis acquired Allergan and took on the company's name.
Sale of rights to Kadian was a condition of winning U.S. antitrust approval for King's acquisition of Alpharma.
Allergan argued that Pfizer under the terms of an agreement Actavis signed with King in 2008 was required to indemnify it for any damages arising out of the pre-2009 marketing of Kadian.
But Allergan said Pfizer has rejected its claim for indemnification.

The case is In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, No. 17-md-2804.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology stocks pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher on Thursday, driven by Apple shares as the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded U.S. company worth a trillion dollars.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) extended its post-earnings rally, gaining 2.9 percent and pushing its market value across the trillion-dollar threshold.
""It's a good sign for the market and the economy,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""Because even though today we're talking about the impact of trade or currency war, an issue with China, Apple, who makes most of their products in China, is hitting this.""

The tech sector's gain helped offset escalating trade tensions, as China urged the United States to ""calm down"" after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he had been directed to increase previously proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. At a news briefing, China's foreign ministry spokesman called the United States' tactics ""blackmail.""

""We get a sell-off on some event, and the market comes right back,"" Hellwig added. 
Trade-sensitive industrial companies, including  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), helped drag the blue-chip Dow slightly lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 7.66 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,326.16, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.86 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,827.22 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 95.40 points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,802.69. 
Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) jumped 16.2 percent after quarterly results convinced investors of future profitability and Chief Executive Elon Musk apologized for his behavior on the previous earnings call.
For the second-quarter reporting season, 79.7 percent of the 380 companies in the S&P 500 that reported so far have beaten consensus estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Chemical producer DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP) posted profit that beat consensus estimates for the fourth straight quarter, driven by price increases and strong demand. But its stock fell 2.2 percent after the company warned of rising raw materials costs.
On the deal front, Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) announced it would buy venture capital-backed cyber security firm Duo Security for $2.35 billion in cash. Cisco stock rose 1.6 percent on the news.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 100 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.66 billion shares, compared with the 6.25 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Cisco to buy cyber-security company Duo for $2.35 billion,"By Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) said on Thursday it would buy Duo Security, a venture capital-backed cyber security company, for $2.35 billion in cash, as part of its push to expand into a faster growing area of software than its core business. 
The deal is the biggest acquisition for Cisco since its $3.7-billion purchase of business performance monitoring software company AppDynamics last year, and its largest in the cyber security sector since its $2.7-billion takeover of Sourcefire in 2013.
The deal is an example of ""a move toward software and our shift to more recurring revenue with new subscription-based solutions,"" Robert Salvagno, head of Cisco's corporate development said on a conference call Thursday. 
Many companies are on the hunt for deals to expand their cybersecurity offerings as corporations want to bulk up their defenses against a wave of cyber attacks by criminals, spies and hacker activists. Earlier this month, telecommunications firm AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) bought AlienVault, a cybersecurity provider for small and medium-size businesses.
""Cisco is getting its act together in the cyber security market,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Brad Zelnick said in a research note, noting that Cisco has acquired five security companies over the past three years. 
Cisco shares rose 1.6 percent at $42.54 on Thursday.
The deal represents a rare multi-billion dollar exit for cybersecurity venture investors who have been pouring money at a record pace into a crowded market. There are over 3,000 cyber
security companies with more than 400 being funded per year, according to advisory firm Momentum Cyber.
One venture capital firm, Benchmark, saw a 20 times return on its early investment in the company, according to a source familiar with the matter. Benchmark declined to comment. 
Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Duo had raised $119 million to date from investors such as Lead Edge Capital, Index Ventures, Workday, Redpoint Ventures and True Ventures.
Duo's platform allows users to verify their identity with a two-step authentication process, a product that Cisco executives said was key as more of their customers are trying to securely connect to applications in the cloud.
The deal, reported first by Reuters, is expected to close in the first quarter of Cisco's fiscal 2019.
Cisco has been making efforts to transform itself beyond networking. Besides security, it is also focused on investing in what it calls the Internet of Things and cloud-based applications.

Cisco was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) as well as the law firm Fenwick & West. Duo was advised by Qatalyst Partners and law firm Gunderson Dettmer.

1474,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Venezuela Eases Foreign Exchange Controls Amid Economic Meltdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela repealed portions of laws governing foreign exchange, enabling businesses and individuals to swap money at designated trading houses and increasing access to hard currency after more than a decade of strict controls.
The changes passed by the politically omnipotent constituent assembly Thursday are to take effect Aug. 20, when the government is simultaneously planning to slash five zeroes off denominations of its near-worthless bolivar currency. Inflation that could reach 1 million percent this year and a deep depression have forced President Nicolas Maduro to begin dismantling a Byzantine system that has left citizens desperate for food and medicine.
The government did not say at what rates it would offer to sell currencies at trading houses. In April, Maduro awarded 16 exchange licenses to allow trades between the bolivar and cryptocurrencies.
The late President Hugo Chavez began limiting money-changing in 2003 in a bid to stem capital fight, but in the years that followed, the exchange regime engendered widespread corruption and starved local industries of hard currency needed for imports.
Price Patrol
As dollars have dried up on official exchanges, most Venezuelans rely on a thriving black market that has created massive disparities and distortions. While greenbacks officially sell for 172,800 bolivars -- the current price determined by a weekly central-bank currency auction -- dollars fetch over 3.5 million bolivares on the street.
Venezuelan authorities regularly police prices and force business owners to slash prices to comport with official rates. Diosdado Cabello, president of the constituent assembly, said Thursday’s measure could would ease distortions.
“Who does the criminal dollar ultimately affect? The people,” he said.
Chavez first installed capital controls in early 2003 after surviving an April 2002 coup attempt and a two-month oil strike later that year. He allowed the brokerage-led market to flourish and used government bond sales to alleviate hard-currency demand. He abruptly ended the FX system and jailed executives for supposed economic crimes amid accelerating inflation and a weaker bolivar."

The securities, which have been buffeted over the past few months following the election of a populist government, declined after Il Sole 24 Ore reported that Tria will meet with Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini on Thursday. A sale of 4 billion euros ($4.65 billion) worth of bonds in Spain also weighed, as well as escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
This is a “triple whammy” of factors contributing to the decline in Italian bonds, Martin van Vliet, an interest-rate strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, said in emailed comments.
The yield on Italy’s 10-year note rose as much as 11 basis points to 2.89 percent, the highest since June 27. The spread over that of their German counterparts was at 243 basis points, the highest level since July 5.
Ten-year yields will likely test 3 percent before the government’s budget in September, van Vliet."

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",Patience pays off for decades-long Apple shareholders,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donna Fenn bought shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in the 1980s on the recommendation of a stockbroker a good friend of hers was dating. She'd heard of the company because its co-founder Steve Jobs had appeared on the cover of the magazine she worked for.
At the end of 1985, not long after Fenn, now 59, made her investment, shares of Apple were trading at the equivalent of 39 cents each, adjusting for subsequent stock splits. Little could she imagine that the value of Apple shares bought then would climb more than 50,000 percent. 
On Thursday, the market capitalization of Apple hit $1 trillion as its shares rose 2.8 percent to a high of $207.05. Apple, whose initial public offering was in December 1980, is the first U.S. company to reach that milestone.
Fenn and other Apple shareholders who first picked the stock in the 1980s and 1990s said they maintained a strong appreciation for the company, its products and its co-founder Jobs even as Apple teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1990s.
""It's now an iconic American brand,"" said Fenn, who lives in Pelham, New York.
FOR THE LOVE OF MAC
For much of the 1980s, Bruce Pfeffer used an Apple IIe to help run his company, which teaches children to perform circus arts such as juggling and fire-eating. He's owned Apple computers almost exclusively since then and travels in his RV, where he lives and works, with an array of iPads and iPod Touches.
Pfeffer, 59, first bought Apple's stock in 1998, the year after Steve Jobs rejoined the company as chief executive. At the time, Pfeffer wasn't aware of the company's struggles.
""I didn't realize how bad off the company was at the time,"" he said. ""I was just part of that cult that just loved Apple.""
Elliot Levin, on the other hand, was quite aware of Apple's challenges and anxious about its survival. As a teenager in Seattle, he enjoyed tinkering with computers and longed to buy a Mac for college. In 1997, his parents bought him Apple shares for his 15th birthday. Levin specifically requested the gift, in what he viewed as a small gesture to help keep the company alive.
""It almost felt like an act of solidarity,"" Levin, now 36 and living in Portland, Oregon, said.
HOLDING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES
At least one shareholder Reuters contacted anticipated that Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997 would mark a turning point for the company.
John Wallner, 61, a consultant in Portland, Oregon, had seen Jobs' business acumen firsthand. From 1983 to 1992, he worked at Apple, first as a product cost accountant for the original Macintosh and later as a factory manager.
While at Apple, Wallner routinely sold the shares he bought through the company's employee stock purchase plan, because he didn't want both his income and the bulk of his investments to come from a single company. But he kept the shares he acquired in his last few years at Apple. When Jobs returned to Apple, Wallner sensed rosier days ahead.
""I had no motivation to get rid of (the stock),"" Wallner said. ""At the time, I said, 'Well, let's just keep it lying around and watch what he does.'""
A SOLID INVESTMENT
Even since Jobs' death in 2011, long-time Apple shareholders said they have kept confidence in the company under Tim Cook, its current chief executive.
""I see big upside, both for the products they're going to work on as well as the stock price,"" Wallner said.
Robert Emnett, 76, a retired management consultant in Manchester, Missouri, first bought Apple shares in 1996. He keeps nearly his entire investment portfolio in stocks and picks them according to criteria developed by BetterInvesting, a nonprofit that supports investment clubs. The average annual return for his Apple shares has exceeded that of most of his other holdings, Emnett said. 
Those strong returns have come in handy for several long-time shareholders. Emnett and his wife retired earlier than planned and have used their portfolio to supplement their employer-provided pensions. Pfeffer has sold some of his shares in order to fund his circus-arts education company, whose business is seasonal. Wallner used a portion of his stock to pay off loans he and his wife took out to finance their twin sons' college educations.
But even as Apple's market capitalization has breached the $1 trillion mark, they say they don't plan to sell off the entirety of their shares any time soon. Over the years, Emnett and Fenn have even given shares to their children.
""I think I will always hold on to a little bit,"" Fenn said, ""so I can be that old lady who bought it when I was 25 years old.""

(Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc is partnering with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) on a new fixed income exchange-traded fund execution platform to open next year, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday after reporting a rise in quarterly earnings.
The new platform will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE and is aimed at simplifying the creation and redemption process for ETF units, which can then be split up and sold to investors in the secondary market, ICE said. BlackRock will help develop and support the system.
Much of the buying and selling of corporate and municipal bonds is still done over the phone. But fixed income is a fast-growing segment of the $3.4 trillion ETF market and the greater efficiencies and transparency that come with automation will help meet that rising demand, ICE said. 
""Working closely with BlackRock, the world's largest ETF sponsor, and leveraging ICE technology, data and trading infrastructure, we plan to establish a central trading hub that enables seamless connectivity for market participants,"" Jeff Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer, said on a call with analysts. 
ICE has invested heavily in the fixed income space in recent years and the new venture will help the Atlanta-based company bring those investments together, while potentially attracting new business. 
The new platform will connect to BondPoint, the electronic corporate bond trading platform ICE bought from Virtu Financial for $400 million in January, and TMC Bonds, the municipal bond trading platform it acquired for $685 million last month, as well as to third party venues, ICE said.
It will also tap into ICE's fixed income pricing and analytics business, which the company beefed up through its $5.2 billion acquisition of Interactive Data Corp nearly three years ago. 
Participants on the platform will be connected via ICE's instant messenger system. 
The move could bolster revenues at ICE. The exchange operator on Thursday reported a 8 percent rise in second-quarter income, helped by increased revenue in its trading and clearing business as a result of higher rates per contract.
Net income at ICE rose to $455 million, or 78 cents per share, in the period, from $419 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Not including one-time items, such as M&A expenses, ICE earned 90 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 5.6 percent to $1.25 billion.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. derivatives regulator doles out $45 million to whistleblowers,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. financial regulator announced on Thursday it had awarded whistleblowers over $45 million for helping the watchdog identify improper activity.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the high payouts, a dramatic increase from smaller awards granted in prior years, are evidence the regulator is increasingly receiving tips to help hunt down wrongdoing.
James McDonald, director of the agency's enforcement division, said it had been a ""transformative year"" for its whistleblower program, and he expected more to come.
""Whistleblowers have added significant value to our enforcement program by enabling the commission to swiftly identify misconduct and hold wrongdoers accountable,"" he said in a statement. ""I expect this trend to continue as the Commission continues to receive increasing numbers of high-quality whistleblower tips.""
The regulator did not identify how many whistleblowers received the award, or what activity the tips helped the regulators hunt down. Under the program, whistleblowers can receive between 10 and 30 percent of any monetary sanctions that emanate from their tips.
Prior to 2018, the CFTC had issued just four whistleblower awards totaling less than $11 million, according to the agency's website. In the last month, the agency had granted three more totaling over $75 million.
In July, the CFTC announced it had awarded $30 million to a single whistleblower, its largest single award since the program was authorized in 2010. It also announced in July it had granted an award to a whistleblower living in a foreign country for the first time in a separate case.
The derivatives regulator's aggressive courting of whistleblowers comes as its fellow markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, is looking to place new limits on its program. 
In June, the SEC proposed changes to its whistleblower program that would give it more flexibility in determining the size of awards. Like the CFTC's program, awards are set as a percentage of the amount the regulator collects. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said its whistleblower program has been a success, but the agency would be better served being able to increase payouts for smaller cases, and limiting the payments for massive settlements.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>","Tesla shares surge as investors embrace cash comments, Musk apology","By Jasmine I S and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) jumped more than 12 percent on Thursday, after the company convinced investors that it was able to yield positive cash flow and turn a profit, and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk apologized for past incendiary remarks.
The stock added about $6.27 billion in market capitalization and gave the company a valuation of $57.35 billion, vaulting it past General Motors Co (N:GM) to make it the most valuable U.S. automaker.
Musk in a conference call on Wednesday, addressing the company's largest quarterly loss to date, said the electric car maker would not need to raise more cash and that capital expenses would be slightly below $2.5 billion in 2018, lower than most analysts' estimates.
But it was his remorse for prior remarks to analysts that highlighted the call. Previously, he insulted some analysts - turning off investors and shareholders, and knocking $2 billion off the company's market cap.
""I would like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Honestly, I think there is really no excuse for bad manners. I was kind of violating my own rule in that regard,"" he said.
In the previous quarter, Musk called questions posed by two analysts ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"", and refused to answer them.
This quarter, not only was Musk's tone non-confrontational, but he apologized to both analysts.
""Musk displayed a noticeably more muted tone, opening the Q&A with an apology for his behavior last quarter, and answering questions with few fireworks,"" said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who was one of the analysts targeted by Musk.
Shares of the company were up 12.2 percent to $337.68.
Tesla ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts suggested Tesla tapped into the credit line for $458 million, which boosted its end-of-quarter cash reserves.
On Wednesday, Musk reiterated a target of producing 6,000 Model 3 sedans per week by late August. After Tesla produced 5,000 per week in July following several delays in reaching that target, analysts were concerned whether it could maintain the production rate.
""After three quarters where investors have been in the dark with respect to estimating Model 3 volumes and margins, Q2 felt like there might finally be some light at the end of the tunnel,"" Evercore analysts wrote. ""Come Q3, we may even be able to see the end of the tunnel, or Elon's 'Production Hell'.""
Tesla had a record loss of $718 million in the second quarter, but investors and analysts focused on the positives, and more importantly on Musk's behavior on the conference call.
At least three brokerages raised their price targets and one upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" from ""perform"".

The eccentric billionaire has been a lightning rod for controversies. Most recently he ran into trouble for abusing a British caver who helped rescue 12 boys from a flooded Thailand cave.

The trade fight has pressured U.S. crop prices, which are also weighed down by the prospect of strong harvests. China last month imposed a duty on soybean imports, slowing U.S. purchases.
Crop prices are a major factor in farmer spending on fertilizer and other supplies. But U.S. farmers have continued to buy yield-boosting products as the U.S.-China trade war unfolds, said Nutrien CEO Chuck Magro on a quarterly conference call. 
The fertilizer and farm supply company, the world's largest by capacity, also expects strong fertilizer demand in the autumn, a key sales season, Magro said. 
“However, farmers will be watching crop prices and trade developments closely, particularly post-harvest, and are likely to become more concerned if there is not a resolution on the trade front by that time,"" Magro said. ""Farmers can't afford to have one bad year. That’s where our concerns lie.""
Nutrien raised its profit outlook and posted better-than-expected quarterly profit late on Wednesday, on higher prices for potash and nitrogen.
Its shares rose more than 4 percent in New York and Toronto, as a rosier fertilizer outlook cheered investors. Stock of nitrogen fertilizer maker CF Industries (N:CF) soared more than 10 percent after its quarterly results beat estimates.
Nutrien boosted its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.40 to $2.70, from $2.20 to $2.60. 
It also raised its forecast for potash sales volumes to between 12.3 million and 12.8 million tonnes. This compares with a May projection of 12 million to 12.5 million tonnes.
Global potash sales look to reach a record 65 million to 67 million tonnes in 2018, led by strong demand in Latin America, the company said.

Brookstone is also seeking a buyer for some of its stores while beginning a process to close its roughly 100 mall outlets, it said, confirming a Reuters report that it was exploring restructuring options including shuttering stores.
As shoppers increasingly flock to Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and other e-commerce platforms, brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled to grow demand, leading many household names including Toys 'R' Us and Radioshack to file for bankruptcy protection in recent years.
Brookstone's airport stores, popular for their luggage products, neck pillows and travel gear, will continue operating at 35 locations. Its e-commerce and wholesale businesses will also remain operational.
""Our airport, e-commerce and wholesale business divisions ... should prove attractive to a buyer with the financial resources and vision to carry our company into the future,"" Brookstone Chief Executive Officer Piau Phang Foo said in a statement.
Brookstone filed for bankruptcy and emerged in 2014 under the ownership of a consortium of Chinese investors but its U.S. business has struggled even as the brand has gained traction in Asia.
It retained 240 stores after emerging from the bankruptcy, but has shuttered underperforming locations over the years.
Brookstone has engaged Berkeley Research Group as its financial adviser and GLC Advisors & Co as investment banker.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Four U.S. cities sue over Trump 'sabotage' of Obamacare,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Four major U.S. cities filed a lawsuit on Thursday contending that President Donald Trump's administration is unconstitutionally seeking to undermine Obamacare by failing to faithfully execute the healthcare law.
The complaint in federal court in Baltimore, filed by the cities of Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, alleged that the Republican president is ""waging a relentless campaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to nullify the law.""
The lawsuit argued that because Congress has not repealed the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is legally known, the U.S. Constitution requires Trump to take care that it, like other laws, is ""faithfully executed.""
The cities in Ohio, Maryland and Illinois contended that the administration's actions are forcing them to spend more on uncompensated care for their residents by driving up the rate of uninsured individuals.
The complaint said Trump has defied his obligation to uphold the law by taking executive actions aimed at undercutting it after he failed to get Congress to repeal the law, as he promised to do in his campaign.
""By actively and avowedly wielding executive authority to sabotage the ACA, defendants are not acting in good faith; instead, they have usurped Congress’s lawmaking function, and they are violating the Constitution,"" the complaint said.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010 under Democratic President Barack Obama. The law extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans. 
The lawsuit cited several actions Trump's administration has taken to undercut Obamacare. For instance, it pointed to cuts to funding for groups that help people get insurance through the law.
It also noted that the administration last year said it would halt so-called cost-sharing payments, which offset some out-of-pocket healthcare costs for low-income patients.
In support of its claims that Trump has sabotaged the law, the complaint cites statements by the president like ""we are getting rid of Obamacare"" and ""essentially, we have gotten rid of it.""
The cities also cited a recent rule adopted by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in April that the lawsuit said would increase the cost of health coverage and impose new barriers to enrollment.

The lawsuit said that rule lacked adequate justification and violated the text of the Affordable Care Act itself.

The European Commission in August 2016 ordered Ireland to recover the money from Apple because of an illegal tax deal which gave the company an unfair advantage in breach of the bloc's state aid rules.
The total amount to be repaid was calculated at 13 billion euros plus 1 billion euros in interest.
""As of June 30, 2018, 4.5 billion euros of the recovery amount was funded into escrow. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, the company has funded an additional 4.5 billion euros of the recovery amount into escrow,"" Apple said in its quarterly report.
The money will remain in the escrow account pending appeals by Apple and Ireland against the Commission's ruling, which are expected to take several years.
The EU competition enforcer has said it will drop its lawsuit launched against Ireland in October last year as soon as Apple pays up.

Nearly a year later, Avenue shares are down 36 percent, at about $4.
A few months earlier, Aschoff had waxed equally optimistic about another biotech venture,  Checkpoint Therapeutics  Inc (O:CKPT), with several cancer drugs in various stages of development. He predicted the share price would rise from $10.75 to $18 in a year. It is now around $2.60.

Then in September, he recommended  Mustang Bio  Inc (O:MBIO), which is working on a drug to treat brain cancer. He forecast a 12-month increase in the share price from around $12 to $21. That stock is now at $6.62.

What Aschoff did not mention in any of these bullish notes: His employer, National Securities, is owned by the same company that controls Avenue, Checkpoint and Mustang. That company is Fortress Biotech Inc (N:FBIO), the brainchild of longtime biotech entrepreneurs Dr Lindsay Rosenwald and Michael Weiss.
In September 2016, Fortress acquired a controlling stake in National Securities' parent,  National Holdings  Corp (O:NHLD). The deal solidified an unusual relationship that dates to 2010, when Rosenwald and Weiss, through an investment fund they control, invested $3 million in National Holdings.
Owning National gives Fortress an in-house underwriter and a private sales force of about 700 brokers – nearly a third of whom have been flagged by regulators – to help it raise money for its stable of nine ventures that are developing new drugs or treatments.
If this setup seems like a conflict of interest, that's because it is one: National brokers are required under U.S. regulations to ensure that they promote investments deemed appropriate for their clients – the same clients to whom they are marketing securities in their parent company's ventures in biotech, a notoriously high-risk sector.
""I've never seen a firm that needs to raise a lot of capital acquire a brokerage for that purpose,"" said Benjamin Edwards, an associate professor of securities law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, echoing nearly a dozen other experts in corporate finance and securities law whom Reuters interviewed for this article.
Since coming under Fortress's umbrella, National brokers, with an assist from analysts like Aschoff, have helped raise at least $240 million from thousands of individual investors across the United States to fund Fortress or its related biotech companies, according to data from National. And U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show that Fortress-related deals are in the works to raise as much as an additional $125 million.
OUT IN THE OPEN
While Aschoff did not disclose the relationship in the analyst notes, National discloses the conflict of interest in prospectuses for securities offerings it underwrites for Fortress, in keeping with U.S. regulations.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the watchdog funded by the industry it monitors, approved National's application for ownership change when Fortress acquired it, as required under U.S. regulations. FINRA declined to answer questions about the deal, saying it does not discuss specific firms.
The SEC did not respond to requests for comment. The agency asked Avenue for greater disclosure of its connection to National in the lead up to the biotech firm's initial public offering last year, but ultimately allowed it to raise money through the investment firm, filings show.
Still, ""naïve investors may not even know the connection. Most small investors don’t read the prospectus,"" said Roni Michaely, a professor of finance at Cornell University. ""If you are selling your own company, you want to sell it at the highest possible price. This is a situation that is very troublesome. … Personally, I wouldn't touch (the offerings) with a 9-foot pole.""
In an interview with Reuters, Weiss, executive vice chairman of Fortress, said: ""We over-disclose. We tell everything. We are the most honest management team ever to walk through this biotech business."" Weiss served as chairman of the National Holdings board from shortly after Fortress acquired a controlling stake in the company until he resigned in June. 
A National executive acknowledged on Dec. 4, 2017, that Aschoff's research notes did not disclose the relationships between Fortress and its cash-raising subsidiaries on one hand and National on the other. In an email Weiss forwarded to Reuters, the executive said National republished the notes in September last year to correct the omission.
However, the notes as they appeared on National's website in December did not contain such company-specific disclosures. The notes have since been removed from the site.
National on June 5 this year denied that the notes ever lacked proper disclosure, pointing to nonspecific boilerplate language in them that says: ""One or more directors, officers, and/or employees of NSC (National Securities Corp) and its affiliated companies, or independent contractors affiliated with NSC may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned herein.""
Even with that general disclosure, ""it does not eliminate the conflict of interest,"" said Michael McMillan, director of ethics education at the CFA Institute. 
In most cases, a firm will suspend analyst coverage of a company if a potential conflict of interest arises between the firm and the covered company, McMillan said. Fortress's ownership of National, he said, raises questions about the ability of its analysts to remain independent and objective.
On May 15, more than a year and a half after Fortress acquired its controlling interest in National – and as Reuters continued to make inquiries about the relationship – National posted on its website a page titled ""Meet our Majority Shareholder, Fortress Biotech."" 
In a section on potential conflicts of interest, National says it and Fortress ""have built a unique model that inherently aligns Fortress' business objectives with the financial interest of National's clients."" The company says it is ""proud"" of the Fortress-affiliated deals it has handled since the acquisition. It notes that those are a fraction of the total of $2.835 billion in deals National has closed during the same period.
BROKERS WITH A PAST
In June 2017, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-finra-brokers that 35 percent of National's brokers – more than three times the industry average – had a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties that must be disclosed to investors under FINRA rules, based on a Reuters analysis of the regulator's data. A fresh analysis encompassing disclosures from 2000 through June 2018 found that the proportion still hovered at 30 percent.
National executives said the Reuters analysis did not adequately reflect efforts to implement ""a new culture at National"" – an effort that has included removing 298 brokers since shortly after Fortress bought the company. National also questioned the value of including regulatory disclosures from more than a decade ago, and it pointed out that the firm itself hasn't been hit with any regulatory sanctions since 2015.
""We've worked so hard at changing the culture,"" said Michael Mullen, National Holdings' chief executive officer and a longtime business associate of Rosenwald.
In 2002, FINRA accused analyst Aschoff of falsely claiming to be a medical doctor to obtain inside information about a drug development program at an unidentified publicly traded company. Aschoff, working for B. Riley FBR Inc at the time, agreed to a $10,000 fine and a two-week suspension without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
In a statement provided by National, Aschoff acknowledged the incident and declined to comment on it further.
A former National broker told Reuters he learned he was raising money for the National parent's biotech ventures only after several months of recruiting investors for Mustang Bio. When he asked his supervisor about potential conflicts, he said, ""I was told to stop asking questions and get back to dialing.""
Weiss said he found ""it hard to believe that there is a broker at National who … did not read anything in the prospectus that says that Fortress has a majority interest in National."" He said National brokers recruited mostly accredited investors – individuals who under U.S. law meet certain minimum wealth requirements – for Fortress deals.
National brokers, Weiss said, sell Fortress deals because the investments make money for brokers and clients alike.
UNUSUAL STRUCTURES
For outside investors, Fortress's ventures not only carry the typical risks of a long-shot biotech bet; they also come with unique conditions that can put outsiders at a disadvantage relative to the parent company.
For one thing, the upside potential for outside investors is damped by covenants between Fortress and its offshoots that favor Fortress with equity awards over time.
Fortress also treats the cost of acquiring drug-development rights as debt owed by its startups, and that debt is repaid from money raised from sales of the startups' shares. Fortress ventures have paid at least $5 million under such arrangements across two deals, SEC filings show. The amounts may seem small, biotech analysts and investors said, but they allow Fortress to shift costs onto outside investors.
""It's a very sweet deal for Fortress,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. ""I think someone could see it as either very smart or very tricky.""
Weiss and Rosenwald acknowledged the unusual nature of the equity awards, but said that by pricing stock offerings at low valuations, they mitigate the impact of the dilution. In addition, they said, many investors don't plan to hold the stock long enough for the dilution to hit them very hard.
Rosenwald and Weiss together owned 30.5 percent of Fortress as of March 31. For the past three years combined, each was paid $1.6 million in Fortress-related compensation and $5.6 million in stock awards, according to SEC filings.
As for National, its investment banking revenue surged more than 25 percent to $44.6 million in fiscal 2017 from a year earlier, thanks in part to fees from Fortress-related offerings, according to a Reuters review of SEC filings. And National’s brokerage operation collects commissions on Fortress-related shares sold to investors.
""Retail investors need more protections than institutional investors,” and the complex structures of Fortress deals “do the opposite of that,"" said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. ""That's compounded by the fact that biotech, because it’s so risky, isn't really appropriate for retail investors to begin with.""
In an interview, Rosenwald argued that ""if anybody thinks that Fortress is getting too good of a deal from the (subsidiary) companies … then you can go out and buy Fortress stock."" Those shares are down 35 percent, at $2.25, since April 2015, when publicly listed Coronado Biosciences, a failed venture, was renamed Fortress and became an incubator for Rosenwald and Weiss biotech ventures.
The structure of Fortress's deals, Rosenwald said, doesn't eliminate all risk for the parent company and its executives. Fortress covers overhead costs for its ventures, he noted, including office space, management, human resources and legal advice, amounting to millions of dollars a year. Some of that, however, is repaid to Fortress through fees charged to each company. Fortress said it holds $30 million in direct investments in the ventures, and Rosenwald is an Avenue investor.
However, the biggest risk for Fortress ""is reputational,"" Rosenwald said. ""You're allowed to fail in biotech. If they all fail, that's horrible.""
EASING PAIN
Failure is common in biotech. Lead times are long. Startups burn through cash and usually have no revenue. Treatments that show early promise can blow up in late-stage trials. Nine times out of 10, according to a 2016 study by a group of biotech industry organizations, ventures do not achieve the ultimate goal: U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a new drug or therapy.
But while payoff is rare, it can be huge. That's why the sector typically attracts venture capital funds and other ""smart money"" investors who are willing to take on more risk than most.
Over the past two decades, Rosenwald and Weiss have, together and separately, launched more than 50 separate biotech firms. Most of their ventures have conformed to the industry norm, failing to receive FDA approval.
They've had rare successes, too, such as Cougar Biotechnology Inc, which was developing prostate cancer drug Zytiga when Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) bought the company for $1 billion in 2009. The purchase price represented a 16 percent premium to the company's market value at the time. Zytiga received FDA approval in 2011.
Whether a venture succeeds or fails, Fortress has found a way to boost the benefit and trim the risk for itself relative to the retail investors who help fund its ventures. That innovation was on display recently with Avenue Therapeutics.
In 2015, Fortress, then still known as Coronado Biosciences, created Avenue to develop for the U.S. market an intravenous formulation of the synthetic opioid Tramadol to treat pain in patients after surgery. The drug is already sold worldwide in oral form, and outside the United States for intravenous use.
Avenue, with no revenue and only the one drug in its pipeline, went public last summer. Fortress hired Oppenheimer & Co as lead underwriter for the IPO – a role that includes conducting due diligence on the deal and the issuing company. In an unusual move, two-thirds of the Avenue shares offered were allotted to National.
""The deal from the beginning was designed to be a National-led transaction for our clients,"" Weiss said. ""We hired Oppenheimer … to satisfy the regulatory requirements.""
Oppenheimer declined to comment.
The IPO raised nearly $38 million. That was already much less than the $50 million Fortress had initially hoped to raise, according to SEC filings.
Avenue soon afterward paid out $6.6 million, or 17 percent of the IPO proceeds. More than $3 million went to cover Fortress's debt from buying the rights to IV Tramadol. The rest repaid a line of credit that Fortress had provided to Avenue.
With that debt repaid, outside investors are now bearing most of the cost of developing IV Tramadol and carrying the most risk if Avenue fails.
Typically, biotech companies hold little debt, if any, when going public so that shareholders are protected from undue risk if the company struggles to bring its product to market, several biotech investors told Reuters.
For Fortress, debt is part of the formula. ""We are using debt as Fortress's balance sheet grows. We prefer not to,"" Rosenwald said. ""We will probably stop using debt soon.""
Further, the founders agreement between Fortress and Avenue gives the parent company the equivalent of 2.5 percent of Avenue's outstanding shares each year, plus additional shares equal to 2.5 percent of any equity or debt financing.
That provision would benefit Fortress, relative to outside investors, should Avenue succeed and the shares take off. Over, say, 15 years, the annual transfer alone would dilute the value of outside investors' holdings in Avenue by nearly a third.
Rosenwald told Reuters that over such a 15-year span, he and Weiss would ""add so much value to these companies that the little bit that keeps us interested financially will be a decimal point.""
Avenue's Tramadol formulation is now in late-stage clinical trials, and the company expects to apply for FDA approval by the end of 2019.
""I have never seen a structure like this one before,"" said Funtleyder, the E Squared portfolio manager. ""We would need a really good reason to participate in something like that and probably wouldn't on principle because there are so many other investments that don't have this kind of baggage.""
The founders agreement also calls for Avenue to send Fortress 4.5 percent of net sales each year, if Avenue begins producing revenue.
The annual 2.5 percent equity transfer is contained in the founders agreements between Fortress and nine ventures, according to SEC filings.
One of them is Checkpoint Therapeutics, whose shares began trading on Nasdaq last June, just after Aschoff published his ""buy"" recommendation. Another is Mustang Bio, whose shares began trading on Nasdaq in August last year.
Mustang is in the early stages of developing several immunotherapy products to treat cancer. In a July 2017 appearance on the Fox TV network morning show ""Fox & Friends,"" Rosenwald and Mustang's CEO talked about the potential of one of those drugs to help U.S. Senator John McCain, who had recently been diagnosed with a lethal brain cancer.
""It's early clinical trials,"" Rosenwald said during the broadcast. ""We have to prove the effectiveness.""
A year ago, National completed a private placement of Mustang shares, raising $95 million, according to SEC filings. National's fee came to 10 percent, or $9.5 million. An additional $2 million paid Fortress's debt from licensing fees.
Caelum Biosciences, another company with the same founders agreement, is in the early stages of developing a treatment for a rare immune-system disorder called amyloidosis. National raised $9.9 million for the company through the sale of convertible notes to around 170 investors, earning nearly $1 million in commissions, SEC filings show.
ALL IN THE FAMILY
In 1987, Rosenwald, who holds a medical degree from Temple University, started working at D.H. Blair & Co, a Wall Street boiler room that a New York state judge likened to a criminal enterprise and that was led for decades by Rosenwald's father-in-law, J. Morton ""Morty"" Davis.
In 2000, several executives and employees were charged in New York state court with 173 counts of securities fraud, among other violations. Two years later, the firm and three officers, including two of Rosenwald's brothers-in-law, pleaded guilty to and were convicted of three counts of violating state securities law. (One brother-in-law served time in prison; the other got probation.) Neither Rosenwald nor Davis was charged.
Rosenwald had already left to launch his own small brokerage, Paramount BioCapital, in 1991, he said. Weiss came on board in 1994. Paramount functioned much as National does now, raising money for Rosenwald startups in biotech.
In 2009, FINRA records show, the regulator determined that in two deals for Rosenwald-controlled biotech companies, Paramount had failed to meet the requirement that it hire an independent underwriter ""to protect investors from purchasing shares at an unfair price."" FINRA also found that Paramount had failed to obtain approval to issue initial public offerings.
Paramount paid a fine of $20,000, without admitting wrongdoing.
Rosenwald said that the people involved ""are no longer working with us,"" and that the violations were ""minor technical infractions"" not worth fighting.
The following year, Opus Point Partners, an investment fund controlled by Rosenwald and Weiss, invested $3 million in National. Opus and National then formed OPN Capital Markets, a boutique investment bank focused on the healthcare industry. Rosenwald shuttered Paramount.
National took up where Paramount left off, handling a private placement and later serving as co-lead underwriter for the IPO of Ventrus BioSciences, a Rosenwald venture that was developing treatments for gastrointestinal ailments.
A month after the December 2010 IPO, National analyst Jason Kolbert published a research report with an enthusiastic ""buy"" recommendation. ""Bet the horse, bet the jockey!"" he wrote. The report did not disclose the connection between National, Rosenwald and Ventrus.
Kolbert did not respond to requests for comment.
Representatives for National and Fortress pointed out that the note included boilerplate language stating: ""One or more directors, officers, and/or employees of NSC and its affiliated companies, or independent contractors affiliated with NSC may be a director of the issuer of the securities mentioned herein.""
Ventrus raised $65 million through the private placement, IPO and several follow-on offerings. Over the next two years, Ventrus's stock rose from a $6 initial offering price to as high as $21 as investors awaited news on the hemorrhoid ointment, the anal fissure cream and the incontinence gel the company was developing.
As underwriter, National – including its many brokers with FINRA flags – was key to promoting the shares. In one case Reuters found, 17 separate purchases of Ventrus stock were among 38 unauthorized trades a National broker made on a single client’s account between May 24 and July 26, 2012, according to the complaint filed by FINRA. The broker, Glenn McDowell, was permanently barred from the securities business. National fired McDowell in January 2013.
Reuters was unable to locate McDowell.
On June 25, 2012, Ventrus announced that it would abandon development of what had been its most promising product – the hemorrhoid ointment – after it failed its final clinical trial. The share price plunged more than 50 percent in a day. In February 2014, the anal fissure cream failed a key clinical trial, and the stock plunged 63 percent.
A few months later, Ventrus merged with Assembly Biosciences, a small biotech with no ties to Fortress.
Though Rosenwald said he ""lost millions"" on Ventrus, he, Weiss and other National executives described Ventrus as a success because investors who got out of the stock at the right time made a profit.

1508,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",Tesla's stock has become an 'Elon sentiment gauge'," Tesla on Wednesday  managed to please anxious investors by posting a  smaller-than-expected loss and burning less cash than Wall Street had anticipated.
But also fueling the rise was an apology from CEO Elon Musk himself to analysts he  had previously interrupted for ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" questions — and the apology could have affected the stock more than you might expect.
""Elon’s tone was generally improved vs. last quarter, which may seem trivial, but TSLA stock has become somewhat of an Elon sentiment gauge,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak told clients in a note Thursday morning. Spak attempted to ask Musk about Model 3 cancellations on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, but  was cut-off in favor of a question from YouTube.
 Personality cult aside, Spak says Tesla's earnings on Wednesday leave some questions in his mind, but were in no doubt ""a better quarter"" with ""a number of positives"" that led him to raise his target price from $280 to $315 — about 4.5% below where shares were set to open Thursday.
""2Q 18 results better than expected and we are more comfortable with 2H 18 profitability/cash flow,"" he said. ""Further, there seems to be more ammo for bulls than bears in commentary. Given stock's propensity to sentiment/momentum, we could see a rally, but remain Sector Perform rated believing a lot priced in.""
 Tesla rallied nearly 10% following the earnings release, and is set to open around $330 Thursday morning. Shares are up 3.4% this year. "

(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) quarterly sales fell short of Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as fewer customers dined at its Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, sending its shares down slightly in morning trading.
Executives last quarter had warned that the second quarter would likely be the weakest period of the year. 
In February, Yum was forced to shut hundreds of British KFC outlets after a supplier change led to shortages of everything from chicken to gravy, in a snafu that led to a months-long recovery. 
""I remain confident our actions to become more focused, more franchised and more efficient are establishing the foundation required for sustainable, long-term growth that will translate to strong returns for all Yum! Brands stakeholders,"" Chief Executive Greg Creed said in a statement. 
Yum, the parent company to brands KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said it continues to expects its full-year performance to land within earlier guidelines. 
New unit growth for the year is now expected at the high end of the 3 percent to 4 percent range, while same store sales growth will clock in at the lower end of between 2 percent and 3 percent growth.
Yum shares pared back earlier losses to slip 0.53 percent in morning trading. Its shares are down 3 percent since the start of the year.
Sales at Yum's worldwide restaurants open for at least a year rose 1 percent, missing analysts' average estimate of a 1.92 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Same-store sales at Pizza Hut posted a surprise drop of 1 percent, missing expectations of a 1.21 percent increase, while Taco Bell's 2 percent rise also fell short of estimates. 
""(Pizza Hut) comps were worse than already low expectations, but KFC was the real disappointment,"" Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note. 
Net income rose to $321 million, or 97 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $206 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 82 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations of 74 cents.
Total revenue fell 5.5 percent to $1.37 billion, but edged past estimates of $1.36 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Belgian materials technology group Umicore is planning to invest in ramping up its recycling capacity over the next decade in line with rapid growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market, the group's Chief Executive said on Thursday.
The International Energy Agency expects numbers of electric vehicles on roads worldwide to be around 40 times higher in 2030 than in 2017, leading to a sharp rise in spent batteries becoming available for recycling.
""We are preparing to make investment choices and decisions in the first part of the next decade because we will have to be ready with larger industrial scale recycling facilities than we have today sometime around the mid 2020s,"" said Marc Grynberg during a media briefing.
""Today we have capacity of about 7,000 tonnes of spent batteries... that would correspond to the recycling of about 150,000-200,0000 EV batteries,"" he said.
""If you make assumptions about what the market may be 10 years down the road, knowing that this year probably more than 2 million EVs and plug-in EVs will be sold, then you have an idea about the scaling up factor that will be required.""
In June Berenberg analysts said they expected Umicore to invest 280 million euros in a recycling facility around 2020/21, which would potentially give it around a one-third market share in EV battery recycling by 2025. 
Umicore said it had no comment to make on the projection, and that it was too early to give detail on the amount of any investment.
Grynberg said so called 'second life' applications, where EV batteries are reused for tasks like storing power for homes and offices, would not have an effect on recycling demand.
""We've always said that this is going to be a niche application for some residential energy storage because the economics wouldn't work for a utilities-scale project of energy storage, nor for grid regulation,"" he said.
Grynberg also said plans to launch cash-settled contracts for lithium and cobalt by the London Metal Exchange are ""irrelevant"" as most suppliers are not interested in participating.
The LME is planning to launch a suite of contracts next year to tap into an expected boom in electric vehicle demand.
Grynberg said while having a paper market that end-users could use to hedge their positions ""would simplify our lives"", the chances of the contracts succeeding were limited. 

""The producers are not interested and I don't see what could make them change their minds,"" he said.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Run your dishwasher when the sun shines: dynamic power pricing grows,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - One day, the weather could drive your domestic schedule. Your dishwasher springs to life at the windiest time of day. The washing machine starts spinning when the sun beats down.
In such scenarios, algorithms in smart appliances automatically respond to price drops on wholesale spot markets caused by higher supplies of wind and solar power, saving households money and balancing the electricity market.
This may be many years away, but it is the future envisioned by the European Union, which wants to make the electricity system more efficient as the continent switches from predictable fossil-fuel power generation to intermittent renewables.
Most utilities have long offered cheaper night-time tariffs, but new EU rules expected in 2020 will require them to provide more flexible options that encourage customers to use power during sunny or windy periods, at varied times of day or when businesses are shut at weekends.
These kind of flexible ""dynamic pricing"" contracts are already widely offered in Spain and Scandinavia. But utilities in some of the biggest European markets like Britain and France are now beginning to follow suit in a shift that analysts say could disrupt the continent's electricity retailing industry.
The nascent drive is enabled by the mass rollout of smart meters, which can precisely record energy usage patterns.
""From now on, consumers in Europe will be able to seize more spot market opportunities as the rise of renewable power and the availability of smart meters and internet-connected appliances boost dynamic pricing,"" said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group CEO of consultancy Accenture Resources.
Newer, smaller players are offering the most experimental tariffs, selling power in hourly or even half-hourly slots tied to wholesale spot prices. The big, traditional utilities like EDF (PA:EDF) and  Centrica  (L:CNA) are responding more gradually by offering variable time-pricing options.
Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, director Internal Energy Market at the European Commission, the EU's executive, says variable pricing could cut power bills for a household by up to 400 euros ($470) a year.
It is early days in Europe, and in other developed power markets such as the United States and Australia. Utilities largely sell at fixed prices, regardless of wholesale swings or time of usage, and dynamic pricing accounts for a fraction of the market - but it is growing.
The number of customers on dynamic pricing rates globally is expected to rise from 4.5 million in 2018 to 75 million by 2025, of which 15 million will be in Europe, according to Navigant Research analyst Brett Feldman.
Experts say automation will be crucial for take-up.
The proportion of households with smart appliances is expected to rise to about 10.6 percent globally by 2022 from 3.5 percent now, according to market data provider Statista.
""Convenience is key,"" Ollagnier said. ""Users want to be able to 'set and forget' smart rules for their appliances.""
The Commission agrees. ""To enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities, they must have access to fit-for-purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices,"" it said in a policy document.
An anticipated surge in electric vehicle usage will also bolster uptake of flexible pricing tariffs, analysts say.
STARTUPS LEAD WAY
British startup Octopus Energy in March launched an ""Agile"" tariff which sells power in 30-minute slots tied to wholesale spot prices. It also sends SMS alerts when prices turn negative and customers get paid for taking excess power off the grid, which happens a few times a year on sunny and windy days.
The two-year-old company, whose UK market share is about 1 percent, has limited the experimental tariff to 500 of its more than 200,000 residential customers. ""We hit that limit quickly and are now assessing the impact before expanding further, which we expect to do next year,"" CEO Greg Jackson said.
Octopus told Reuters it was working with electronics companies including Samsung (KS:005930) to allow its software to communicate with smart household appliances so that they can switch on automatically at the cheapest time.
The company said a family on its Agile tariff could have saved 210 pounds ($275) over the last 12 months compared with average British fixed-rate prices.
Green Energy UK, another small player, is offering contracts with varying ""time-of-day"" rates for residential customers, ranging on weekdays from 5 pence per kilowatt hour to 20 pence.
In France, Engie (PA:ENGIE), which has 4 million customers, has also started offering flexible pricing deals including 30 percent weekend discounts and, for electric vehicle owners, a 50 percent discount for nighttime charging.
Engie's retail chief Augustin Honorat declined to detail how many customers have flexible tariffs. ""It is a success, as the offers are among our best-sellers,"" he said.
The flexible contracts offered by new players are prompting traditional utilities to offer their own options, analysts say.
French market leader EDF, for example, has launched offers with 30 to 40 percent tariff discounts for weekend use and a tariff that offers varying rates for each eight-hour period of the day. EDF marketing director Gregory Trannoy said the new offers were ""growing quickly"" but declined to give numbers.
Oliver Wyman consultant Keric Morris said dynamic pricing was a big operational challenge for traditional utilities.
""It is much more difficult for an incumbent with all its legacy systems, than for a nimble start-up,"" he said.
SPANISH CASE STUDY
The European Commission's Nov. 2016 Clean Energy Package aims to force all utilities to offer customers smart meters and a dynamic price contract linked to spot market prices. The rules are being negotiated with the EU Parliament and member states this year, with a target for implementation from 2020.
That may be overly ambitious; several EU states do not yet have the smart meters required for flexible pricing, notably major power market Germany.
The case of Spain gives an idea of the potential of dynamic pricing - as well as the possible obstacles.
Spain decreed in 2014 that utilities had to offer dynamic pricing contracts as the default regulated offer. All Spanish utilities now offer contracts linked to hourly spot prices on the OMIE exchange and with utilities' margins set by regulation.
The European Commission estimates that in Spain - where 28 million smart meters were installed end 2017 - about 40 percent of power users have some form dynamic pricing.
However, Pedro Gonzalez, head of regulation at Spanish utilities association Unesa, told Reuters that this is down from about 60 percent four year ago.
Despite the fact that power is slightly cheaper on dynamic contracts, their number has fallen as customers switch to fixed-price contracts because they want the peace of mind of not being exposed to fluctuating wholesale prices.
""Surprisingly, despite the fact that average dynamic prices should be lower, many people want to avoid risk and prefer to pay a fixed amount per month,"" Gonzalez said.
He said the number of people on dynamic pricing contracts has been stable over the past year, and that in recent months utilities have started offering intermediate options such as varying rates for different blocks of the day.
In the Nordics, many utilities offer dynamic pricing, though uptake ranges from about 30 percent in the tiny but highly digital Baltic country Estonia to 10 percent in Finland and a few percent in Sweden and Norway, according to EU data.
Industry specialists say much will depend on to what extent the European Commission's proposal on dynamic pricing is accepted, but all agree the higher the share of renewables in total generation, the bigger the pressure will become to make demand more flexible.
Octopus Energy's Jackson said mass rollout of smart meters could ultimately lead to a sophisticated form of congestion pricing, with supply and demand increasingly driving prices.

""On trains and airlines, the first seats are very cheap, the last ones very expensive,"" he said. ""The electricity market will end up like that too.""

Kellogg, struggling with shifting trends as more consumers opt for low-sugar options, protein bars and yogurt for breakfast over cereals, has been buying smaller snack brands that promote healthy eating and expanding in emerging economies.
Kellogg bought RXBAR for $600 million in 2017 and Brazil's Parati for $429 million in 2016. It also made a $400 million investment in Nigeria's Tolaram Africa Foods to enter west African markets.
""This is starting to show up in our net sales and our in-market performance, and puts us in a position to raise our full-year guidance,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Cahillane said in a statement.
Kellogg said it expects net sales to rise 4-5 percent in fiscal 2018, and earnings per share to grow 11-13 percent. The company had previously forecast a sales rise of 3-4 percent and earnings per share growth of 9-11 percent.
Its net income rose to $596 million, or $1.71 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $283 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.

The airline has been hunting for a new boss to fill a gap left by the abrupt departure of chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac in May, after staff rejected a pay proposal aimed at ending strikes that have resulted in heavy losses.
Air France KLM reported its second quarter results on Wednesday but did not give clues on the CEO search.
""The initial timetable was - 'Let's strive for an announcement before end-July.' It was the will of the nomination committee to identify a candidate before the end of the month,"" said one of the sources.
But disturbances ranging from media speculation about the potential candidates to AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) voicing an interest in buying a stake in Air France KLM and then dropping that plan, had complicated the process, said the sources.
""So you lose a week here and there and it's August 1. It means nothing will happen before the end of the month. Everyone must go and come back from holidays,"" said one of the sources.
In mid-July, Anne-Marie Couderc - the interim chairman of Air France KLM - had said in a memorandum seen by Reuters that the company hoped to have a new leadership team fully up and running by September.
According to La Tribune.fr website, Air France-KLM's nomination committee is currently talking to one north American executive with a good knowledge of the airlines industry.
Air France-KLM declined to comment on the situation.

The French government has a stake of about 14 percent in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.

The outspoken Musk, who told analysts last quarter that he refused to answer their ""boring"" questions, apologized multiple times last night for his past behavior and sounded upbeat on the company's future.



Musk said on the call that he expected the company to be henceforth profitable and cash flow positive, excluding some debt repayment, and had no plans for an equity raise.
""From an operating plant standpoint, from onwards I really want to emphasize our goal is to be profitable and cash flow positive for every quarter going forward,"" Musk said.
The electric automaker reported $4 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating Wall Street estimates of $3.92 billion. Despite the revenue beat, the company posted a larger-than-expected earnings per share loss of $3.06 for the quarter.
The company also said that it expects production of its Model 3 - Tesla's lowest-priced model and the key to its plans to become a mass-market automaker - to reach between 50,000 and 55,000 units in its third quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were up 9.5% to $329.51 shortly after the open, putting it on track to retake the title of most valuable U.S. automaker from General Motors (NYSE:GM).

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>","White House proposes weaker auto emissions rules, overriding California","By Joseph White and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday moved to revoke California's authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles, as it proposed weakening Obama-era federal fuel efficiency standards.
The proposal to roll back anti-pollution efforts, released early on Thursday, is in line with President Donald Trump's decision last year to abandon the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to mitigate global warming.
The proposal from the U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency would freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, and require dramatically fewer electric vehicles as more people continue to drive gasoline-powered vehicles.
The administration said the freeze would boost U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels of oil a day by the 2030s, and save 12,700 traffic fatalities -- or up to 1,000 per year -- by reducing the price of new vehicles by prodding people to buy newer, safer vehicles more quickly.
Environmental groups criticized the assertion about reducing crash deaths, and said the proposal would drive up gasoline prices and reverse one of the most significant steps Washington has taken to curb climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. It would also put more lives at risk due to asthma-inducing emissions, they said.
The proposal, the Transportation Department says, would dramatically shrink projected regulatory costs for automakers by $319 billion through 2029; it would reduce by more than $60 billion what General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) each would have been expected to spend to comply with the Obama rules. Toyota Motor Corp would save $34 billion (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG $20 billion (DE:VOWG_p) over estimated costs. 
The proposal, if adopted, would dramatically shrink the number of vehicles that would need to be partially or fully electric vehicles to meet emissions requirements. 
The Trump proposal estimated that under Obama-era requirements, about 70 percent of light trucks would be required to have some form of electrification by 2026, versus just 1 percent under the Trump proposal.
The administration also contends that hiking U.S. oil consumption by 2 to 3 percent over forecast levels would have a minimal impact on the environment, boosting global average temperature by just “3/1000th of a degree Celsius by 2100.”
The proposal will escalate the administration's legal battle with California and about a dozen other states, making up about a third of the U.S. auto market, that have adopted California's emission rules.
Seventeen states, including California, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in May challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's decision a month earlier to declare U.S. vehicle emission rules in place through 2025 ""not appropriate."" 
In March, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he would use ""every legal tool"" to protect the current standards.
The proposal calls California's zero emission vehicle rules, adopted by 9 other states, “technologically infeasible.”
The freeze would also eliminate $3 billion in estimated fines for automakers not meeting efficiency standards, but did not specify which automakers could avoid fines.
Trump promised Midwestern auto workers last year that he would tear up vehicle rules touted by the administration of former President Barack Obama as among its biggest climate actions. 
Democrats hope to make any rollback a key part of the 2018 congressional elections. Republicans in states with links to the auto industry may contend the administration is working to ensure automakers can make more profitable, larger vehicles, including fuel-thirsty pickups and SUVs, without excess regulation and state interference.
Some middle ground on the issue might be possible, with acting EPA chief, Andrew Wheeler, saying Wednesday he would welcome a deal between the industry and states like California on vehicle fuel economy.
Wheeler and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao wrote in a joint Wall Street Journal opinion piece that the Obama rules would require automakers to ""produce vehicle lineups that are 30 percent electric or more over the next seven years — far more vehicles than buyers are likely to want."" 
They added ""the effect of the last administration’s standards was to subsidize these expensive electric vehicles at the expense of affordable traditional cars and trucks.""
The rollback in emissions standards is problematic for automakers that could stand to save hundreds of billions in regulatory costs but could create more uncertainty for an industry already struggling with rising tariff risks and a murky sales outlook.
Automakers have long pressed for one set of rules for emissions and greenhouse gases, saying a national regulatory framework to improve fuel economy reduces complexity and costs for the industry.
Two auto trade groups representing GM, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and others, said in a statement Thursday that despite the administration's proposed freeze, ""automakers support continued improvements in fuel economy and flexibilities that incentivize advanced technologies while balancing priorities like affordability, safety, jobs, and the environment.""
The groups said ""it’s time for substantive negotiations to begin. We urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of America’s drivers.""
The administration's ""preferred option"" released Thursday means the fleets of cars and light trucks sold by automakers in the United States could average about 37 miles (59.5 km) per gallon, instead of the 46.8 mpg projected for 2026 under the Obama rules.
Trump's decision to challenge California's authority to regulate vehicle emissions upends decades of federal policy undertaken to allow the largest U.S. state to combat air pollution that particularly afflicts Los Angeles.
Eliminating California's electric vehicle mandate could hurt automakers like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and GM, which are already investing billions in EVs.

Relying on the state's regulatory authority, California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, set a target in January of putting 5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road in California by 2030, up from a prior goal of 1.5 million by 2025.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Qualcomm expects $1 billion from chips for watches, speakers","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc said Thursday it expects to bring in more than $1 billion in sales this fiscal year from semiconductor chips from smart watches, connected speakers and other devices outside its core business of chips for mobile phones.
The figure is the most recent data point the company has released to prove it can diversify its revenue sources after its $44 billion deal to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors fell apart last month.
The sales of so-called ""internet of things,"" or IoT, chips is about one fifth of the $5 billion in revenue that Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said the San Diego chipmaker believes it will make outside the mobile phone market.
Qualcomm dominates the market for processor chips for phones as well as modem chips that let phones connect to wireless data networks, counting firms like Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as major customers.
The sales of smart phones has flattened in recent years though and are growing slowly. To respond to that broader trend, Qualcomm had sought to purchase NXP, a dominant supplier to the automotive market, where car makers are adding more chips to vehicles each year. That deal fell apart last month after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators.
Now, Mollenkopf is under pressure from investors to show he can expand Qualcomm's sales without NXP's help.
While Qualcomm had disclosed that it expected $5 billion in non-mobile chip sales this year, up from $3 billion last year, it had not given any information about the composition of that $5 billion until Thursday. The rest of the $5 billion beyond IoT chips comes from networking chips, Qualcomm's own automotive chips and a few other areas.
Qualcomm's chips for the IoT market typically power small, battery-powered devices that are becoming more common.
In a statement released ahead of a planned briefing with analysts on its progress, Qualcomm said its chips are now in more than 200 kinds of so-called wearable devices and 1,300 different wireless headsets, earbuds and wireless speakers.
The company also said it expects revenue growth from chips for wireless, internet-connected cameras to increase 120 percent this year versus last year, though it did not give an absolute dollar figure.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) reported a smaller-than-expected 6 percent decline in second quarter operating profit on Thursday while brushing off concerns about new anti-pollution rules and global trade tensions which caused rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) to warn on profits.
The German carmaker said higher spending to develop electric and autonomous cars and currency headwinds weighed on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which fell to 2.74 billion euros ($3.19 billion) but topped the 2.69 billion expected by analysts.
""At times when others are struggling, they are rock solid, and they don't seem to have an issue with WLTP,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, referring to the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure.
Evercore, which holds an 'in-line' rating on BMW, said the results were solid if unspectacular, while rivals Volkswagen and Mercedes had struck a more cautious tone. 
BMW's automotive EBIT margin narrowed to 8.6 percent from 10.1 percent a year earlier while vehicle deliveries rose 0.7 percent.
Adjusted for comparability, BMW's automotive margin came in at 9.3 percent versus 9.2 percent for Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand and 9.6 percent for Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Evercore said.
BMW shares were down 1.2 percent at 1113 GMT.
The company expects capital expenditure to reach an all-time high in 2018, it said, as the company continues high levels of spending to develop electric and autonomous cars. 
BMW will open a battery cell competence center with expertise in developing and producing battery cells in early 2019.
""We will also be purchasing raw materials for battery cells ourselves, especially cobalt, in the future,"" Chief Executive Harald Krueger told investors on a call to discuss earnings. 
WLTP
BMW affirmed its 2018 targets to achieve slightly higher deliveries and revenue in the automotive segment and achieve a group profit before taxes at the previous year's level.
Mercedes-Benz and VW have both warned that problems certifying their vehicles to the WLTP standard would result in a more limited product offering, potentially damaging margins, BMW has largely completed converting its fleet. 
""We see some advantages when compared with our competitors,"" Krueger said, explaining that most of BMW's models had received road worthiness certification and that waiting times were no longer than three months.
While BMW said it has most of its fleet available for sale, Volkswagen said only 60 percent of its VW brand fleet will have met emissions tests by end August.
BMW also said increased efficiency measures had helped offset a triple-digit million euro headwind from foreign exchange rates and raw materials.
TARIFFS
Because BMW earlier this year stopped exporting its X3 offroader from Spartanburg, South Carolina, to China it has been able to avoid a 40 percent import tariff, imposed since July, while rivals such as Mercedes still export large SUVs from the United States.
Demand for new models like the large X7 sports utility vehicle are so high that BMW is confident it can adjust prices to still make a profit on cars exported from the United States to China. 
It has already raised prices on its X5 and X6 models and is building some X5 models in Thailand for export to China, the company said. 
Tariffs were introduced as part of a broader trade dispute as the United States seeks to ""rebalance"" trade relationships with the European Union and China. These tariffs will have a low to midsize triple-digit million euros impact, Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said. 
This may force carmakers to retool their production networks to curb inter-continental exports and to serve regional trading blocs instead. BMW has already announced an expansion of its product capacity in China and Europe this year.
Krueger said he had met British Prime Minister Theresa May to underscore the need for Britain to maintain trading ties to the European Union.
""I explained this complex situation to her and what business preconditions we need. Britain should stay in the customs union,"" Krueger told journalists on a call. 

Daimler,  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and General Motors (N:GM) and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) all blamed trade tensions for lowering their profit forecasts for the year.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (SS:600115) and  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (JAL) (T:9201) on Thursday said they would form a joint venture (JV) to capitalize on a boom in Chinese tourism, in the first such deal between a Chinese and Japanese carrier.
The pair, which already have a codesharing agreement, said the venture will allow them to coordinate flight times, offer more connecting flights, lower ticket prices and share revenue on routes they both fly such as Tokyo-Shanghai.
They aim to begin operations in the first half of 2019 pending approval from competition regulators.
""This partnership will generate more passenger traffic between the two countries and open up commercial opportunities,"" said JAL Chairman Yoshiharu Ueki.
The tie-up comes at a time of relative calm between two countries whose relationship has been historically strained. Six years ago, a territorial dispute sparked anti-Japanese protests across China and a temporary drop in Chinese visitors to Japan.
Chinese tourism to South Korea and Taiwan has similarly fallen in recent years during times of diplomatic crises.
""We understand we may have political risks in China,"" said a spokeswoman for JAL. ""We don't have any backup plans. But we believe we share any difficulties between us - not only political but also others. We think that is joint business.""
A joint venture in the airline industry refers to an agreement to coordinate aspects of business such as scheduling and pricing. The JAL spokeswoman also said there were no plans for the airlines to make equity investments in each other.
Corrine Png, chief executive of transport research firm Crucial Perspective, said regulatory approval was likely based on today's diplomatic relations but there was a risk of delay or cancellation if relations soured during the application process.
CHINESE TOURISM BOOM
China has been experiencing a boom in tourism in tandem with rising household income. Neighboring Japan has been one of the main beneficiaries, with the Chinese comprising the largest group of visitors to the country.
Last year, the number of Chinese visitors to Japan jumped 15 percent from a year earlier, Japanese data showed. Only a third as many Japanese visited China in 2016, latest data showed.
Will Horton, senior analyst at CAPA Center for Aviation, said the China Eastern-JAL joint venture made commercial sense but would not bring as big a financial benefit as ventures involving long-haul flights where connections were more common.
""Short-haul JVs have limited impact across the network aside from when the two airlines control a notable amount of capacity on a trunk route (such as Tokyo-Shanghai). Then they can choke the consumer and then shake the change out,"" Horton said.

JAL is part of the oneworld airline alliance whereas China Eastern is a member of the rival SkyTeam group. Cross-alliance deals have become increasingly common as airlines seek financially beneficial bilateral tie-ups.

(Reuters) - U.S. chemicals producer DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP) reported better-than-expected profit for the fourth straight quarter, driven by higher prices and strong demand for its products including paints and packaging materials.
The company, formed after chemical giants  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont merged last year, has launched new packing materials, components for laundry detergents and a new seed variety, Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider said on a call before earnings.
He also said the company, which has global operations and often sources materials locally, does not expect any tariff-related impact on business this year.
Sales from the company's biggest revenue generator - materials science business, which makes chemicals used in cosmetics, packaging material, and brake fluids, rose 18 percent to $12.6 billion for the second quarter.
""Our new product launches are resonating with customers, resulting in strong demand across each of our targeted end-markets,"" DowDuPont CEO Ed Breen said.
Sales from its agricultural business rose 25 percent to $5.7 billion. Cold weather in the northern hemisphere moved demand for the company's seeds from April to May. 
The agriculture unit, a weak spot in earlier quarters, has struggled due to higher production and slowing demand. 
In April, DowDuPont said the unit could be affected by the escalating U.S.-China trade conflict, after Beijing announced new tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans and other goods.
The company said overall prices rose 4 percent in the quarter, including a 5 percent increase in materials science business and a 4 percent price rise in agriculture.
Net sales rose 17 percent to $24.2 billion, which the company said compares with net sales of $20.7 billion that DowDuPont would have made had it been one company in the same quarter a year earlier. 
Adjusted earnings came in at $1.37 per share, an increase of 41 percent. 
Analysts on average were expecting the company to report a profit of $1.30 per share on revenue of $23.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 

Dow and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger last September. It then made changes to operations in the three units it plans to create, under pressure from investors to run the business more efficiently.

Trade uncertainty continued to weigh on investors minds after reports that the White House plans to propose 25% tariffs instead of 10% on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods. The two largest economies in the world have been in a tit-for-tat trade war over the last few months, which has weighed heavily on markets.
On Wednesday U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the proposed increase was due to China refusing to meet U.S. demands.
China responded that “blackmail would not work and that it would retaliate if the U.S. continues to impose fresh trade tariffs. The Chinese yuan was near a one-year low due to trade war fear, with USD/CNH up 0.45% to 6.8553.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Japan steelmakers shrug off U.S. tariffs in earnings but warn on automobile duties,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese steelmakers reported little fallout in their first-quarter earnings from the U.S. import tariffs on steel, but they all voiced growing concerns over possible U.S. duties on automobiles which could hurt a wide range of Japan's industries.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a national security probe into imports of automobiles in May. Similar national security investigations were the precursor to the imposition of import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in March.
Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal (T:5401), Japan's top steelmaker, on Thursday reported its recurring profit fell 19 percent in the April to June quarter from a year earlier, weighed down by lower appraisal gains in raw materials inventory and rising costs of secondary materials.
But it forecast a profit gain for the year to March 31 as it plans to boost steel output to meet local demand in automobiles and construction as well as raise product prices to pass on the rising costs of materials such as manganese and zinc.
""Demand for automobiles, including SUVs for North America and electric vehicles for Europe, are strong,"" Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Katsuhiro Miyamoto said, adding that demand for industrial machinery and construction are also solid.
JFE Holdings (T:5411), Japan's second-largest steelmaker, logged a 41 percent jump in first-quarter recurring profit and raised its full-year forecast by 18 percent, on higher product prices.
Both companies shrugged off the U.S. steel tariffs in their quarterly earnings, but raised concerns of weakening demand linked with U.S. tariffs on autos.
""We had only limited impact from the U.S. duties so far,"" JFE Executive Vice President Shinichi Okada said.
""But if U.S. tariffs expand into autos, we will have some impact as automakers are our major customers,"" he said.
Nippon Steel has seen no major ramifications from the U.S. duties as its exports to the U.S. market are only 2 percent of its total shipments, Miyamoto said.
Rather, its U.S. units, which have an annual production capacity of 7.1 million tonnes, are benefiting from higher U.S. steel prices, he said.
""But our biggest concern is over autos,"" he said, noting that Japanese steelmakers supply about 3.5 million tonnes of material a year for automobiles that are exported from Japan to North America.
""If it happens, the impact will be big,"" he said.

In its quarterly report this week, Switzerland's second-biggest bank said it had approved moving around $200 million worth of assets linked to its German unit to its investment banking and capital markets division from its strategic resolution wind-down unit.
The move came ""after a business reassessment in connection with our planning relating to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU"", it said.
A spokesman declined comment on a Financial Times report that the bank would likely move around 50 investment bankers to Germany from its London headcount of 5,500.
Credit Suisse is also moving around 50 bankers to Madrid from London.
With an October deadline on the trading relationship between Britain and the EU, banks are losing hope that they will be able to retain ""passport"" access to EU financial markets and have started implementing contingency plans.

Credit Suisse was looking to relocate staff to multiple EU locations, a source said this week, adding that London will still play a role even after Brexit.

1556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",China Vows It Won't Back Down After Trump's Latest Tariff Threat,"(Bloomberg) -- China said that the latest threat by the U.S. to increase tariffs won’t succeed in forcing concessions from Beijing.
“China is fully prepared and will have to retaliate to defend the nation’s dignity and the interests of the people, defend free trade and the multilateral system, and defend the common interests of all countries,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Thursday on its website. The “carrot-and-stick” tactic won’t work, it said.
The Trump administration said Wednesday that it’s considering increasing the proposed tariff on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent, in a bid to force China back to the negotiating table. President Donald Trump has asked U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider hiking the duties, which could be implemented as early as next month.
China’s yuan extended loss following Mofcom’s comments, signaling investor concern that the trade war is escalating. The onshore currency tumbled 0.35 percent to 6.8494 per dollar, the lowest level in more than a year, as of 5:58 p.m. in Shanghai. The offshore rate lost 0.58 percent. Earlier, shares in Asia fell.
The U.S. had indicated it is open to restarting formal negotiations with China, though Beijing must agree to open its markets to more competition and stop retaliating against U.S. trade measures.
Door Open
Along with its pledge to fight back, China also left the door open for a resumption of negotiations. The statement also left out language that had been used previously pledging to fight back using the “same scale, same intensity” as the U.S. trade measures.
“China has consistently advocated resolving differences through dialogue, but only on the condition that we treat each other equally and honor our words,” the ministry said. “The Chinese side always believes that bad things can turn into good things and challenges can be turned into opportunities.”
The proposed higher tariff “is intended to provide the administration with additional options to encourage China to change its harmful policies and behavior and adopt policies that will lead to fairer markets,” Lighthizer said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the administration was considering boosting tariffs to 25 percent. The U.S. is open to renewing formal negotiations with China, though Beijing must agree to open its markets to more competition and stop retaliating against U.S. trade measures, according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.
The move to more than double the proposed tariff may inflame already heightened tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The International Monetary Fund has cited escalating trade disputes as a growing downside risk that’s threatening the strongest global economic upswing in seven years.
Asian stocks declined as trade worries came back to the fore, with China and Hong Kong equity indexes leading declines.
Increasing the pressure on China by threatening even higher tariffs could backfire. Beijing responded to news reports on Tuesday about the planned tariff increase by cautioning the U.S. against “blackmailing and pressuring” and it vowed to strike back at every escalation.
TVs, Handbags
The administration last month released a list of thousands Chinese products it wants to slap with an additional 10 percent in tariffs, ranging from television components to handbags and seafood to baseball gloves. The duties could take effect after the administration draws up its revised, final list of imports following a public comment period. Hearings are scheduled for Aug. 20 to 23 and the comment period has been extended to Sept. 5 from late August, according to Lighthizer’s office.
The first wave of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods took effect last month, prompting immediate in-kind retaliation from China, and the next round on $16 billion could be implemented by the U.S. in the coming days or weeks.
Trump said last month that he’s willing to impose tariffs on every good imported from China, which totaled more than $500 billion last year. American companies, industry and consumer groups have pleaded with the administration to avoid tariffs, saying they could raise their costs and eventually lead to price hikes for consumers.
Inflation Factor
Implementing the tariffs would complicate the Federal Reserve’s decision-making on interest rates. Omair Sharif, an economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York, said a 25 percent tariff on the entire $200 billion product list could cause inflation to surge by 1.1 percentage point. Assuming the levies get passed along to customers, the annual increase in the consumer price index, excluding food and energy, would jump to 3.4 percent from the current rate of 2.3 percent, he said in a research note on Wednesday.
The Institute for Supply Management’s latest survey released Wednesday indicated that U.S. companies are already mulling significant investment changes. While manufacturers are experiencing healthy demand in the U.S., they’re considering expanding outside the country to avoid tariffs, Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM manufacturing survey, said on a conference call with reporters.
Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations after talks broke down last month, according to people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity.

The iPhone maker’s shares jumped to $201.50 on Wednesday, leaving it about $27 billion short of the milestone. At that price, Apple is still holding on to its ranking as the largest firm on Earth, for a seventh year, trailing only  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. for time at the top. GE’s two runs during the 1990s and early 2000s totaled 11 years.
Those long runs are more the exceptions than the rule over the past two decades, and the role of most valuable company has been short-lived for some who have worn the crown.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). lost $370 billion in value in 2000 as it tumbled from its perch at the top and only regained its 1999 market-cap peak last October. Since they last lost the title,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and GE have lagged far behind S&P 500 returns.
In Asia, PetroChina Co. soared after it debuted in a Shanghai share listing in November 2007, briefly giving it a market cap of more than $1 trillion in both China and Hong Kong. By the end of the subsequent year, it was worth less than $260 billion.
On current estimates, Cupertino, California-based Apple would need to hit $207.0425 a share to crown it as the first American company to surpass $1 trillion. While that’s less than a 3 percent gain from its closing level yesterday, Apple fell 0.8 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. The calculation uses the number of shares disclosed in its 10Q filing published Wednesday.
You need to go back to Exxon in 2011 to see another U.S. firm hold the title of biggest by market value, Bloomberg calculations based on year-end data, show.
Back in the 1990s technology boom, Apple’s peer Microsoft jumped to the top spot. In the past two years, Microsoft has boosted its traded value markedly, though it hasn’t kept up with the rocketing growth of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which immediately trail Apple in market value.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 06:16AM ET</span>",Google plans return to China search market with censored app: sources,"By Cate Cadell and Joseph Menn
BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google plans to launch a version of its search engine in China that will block some websites and search terms, two sources said, in a move that could mark its return to a market it abandoned eight years ago on censorship concerns.
The plan, which was criticized by human rights advocates, comes as China has stepped up scrutiny of business dealings involving U.S. tech firms including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc amid intensifying trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Google, which quit China's search engine market in 2010, has been actively seeking ways to re-enter China where many of its products are blocked by regulators.
The Intercept earlier reported Google's China plans on Wednesday, citing internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans. 
The project is code named ""Dragonfly"" and has been underway since the spring of 2017, the news website said. 
Progress on the project picked up after a December meeting between Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official, it added.
Search terms about human rights, democracy, religion and peaceful protests will be among the words blacklisted in the search engine app, which The Intercept said had already been demonstrated to the Chinese government.
The finalised version could be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials, it added.
Chinese state-owned Securities Times, however, said reports of the return of Google's search engine to China were not true, citing information from ""relevant departments"". 
But a Google employee familiar with the censored version of the search engine confirmed to Reuters that the project was alive and genuine.
On an internal message board, the employee wrote: ""In my opinion, it is just as bad as the leak article mentions.""
The worker, who declined to be named, said that he had seen slides on the effort and that many executives at the vice president level were aware of it. He said he had transferred out of his unit to avoid being involved.
Separately, a Chinese official with knowledge of the plans said that Google has been in contact with authorities at the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) about a modified search program. 
The official, who declined to be named, said the project does not currently have approval from authorities and that it is ""very unlikely"" such a project would be made available this year.
A separate report, by technology news site The Information on Wednesday, said that Google was developing a news-aggregation app for use in China that would comply with the country's censorship laws.
Google declined to comment on the accounts and the CAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters on Thursday. 
A day earlier, the search giant also declined to comment on specifics mentioned in The Intercept report, but noted that it has launched a number of mobile apps in China and works with local developers as part of maintaining its domestic presence.
'CHILLING PRECEDENT'
But the report pummelled shares of U.S.-listed Baidu, which dominates China's search engine market. Baidu shares fell 7.7 percent on Wednesday, despite posting better than expected quarterly results.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it was calling on Google to change course. 
""Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory,"" its China researcher, Patrick Poon, said in an e-mailed statement. 
""This also raises serious questions as to what safeguards Google is putting in place to protect users' privacy,"" he said. 
Google's main search platform has been blocked in China since 2010, but it has been attempting to make new inroads into China. 
In January, the search engine joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou, and earlier this month, launched an artificial intelligence (AI) game on Tencent Holdings Ltd's social media app WeChat.
Facebook's website is also banned in China but the company has also signaled its interest to enter the market. 
Reports of Google's possible re-entry spurred a strong reaction on Chinese social media outlets on Wednesday evening, including debates over the merits of a censored search engine versus accessing the U.S. version through illegal virtual private networks.

""Let's carry on jumping the Firewall,"" said one anonymous poster. ""I'd rather not have it than use a castrated version.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A selloff in European shares extended on Thursday with Germany's DAX taking the brunt of anxieties over trade tensions, while results from industrial group  Siemens  disappointed but Europe's biggest asset manager, Amundi, impressed the market. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.6 percent by 0840 GMT as investors sold risky assets on President Donald Trump's threat to increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. 
Germany's top index (GDAXI), the most sensitive to trade, dropped 1.7 percent as heavyweights Siemens and BMW tumbled.
""Stocks which disappoint are being penalized by the market, but I think beyond actual earnings delivery, the market is concerned about tariff uncertainty,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Siemens (DE:SIEGn), which makes everything from turbines to trains, fell 4.7 percent after reporting lower than expected revenues, though its profit slightly beat expectations.
Analysts and traders said the fall was probably due to concerns over the new ""Vision 2020+"" strategy and disappointment that the company did not increase its earnings forecasts. 
Carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 2.3 percent after reporting smaller auto margins than expected. It helped to drive the autos sector (SXAP), which has suffered in recent weeks from the U.S. threats to impose more tariffs, down 1.6 percent.
Cau has an ""overweight"" recommendation for autos, highlighting that car volumes are still going up and margins are resilient even though investors are shunning the sector due to the tariff fears. 
""The sector might be a proxy to express concern about tariffs, but it is already down very significantly and you can pay very little to still buy interesting growth,"" he said.
France's Amundi (PA:AMUN) jumped 8.7 percent after reporting higher second-quarter profits, benefiting from an inflow of new client money. ""Amundi reported a good-quality beat to consensus expectations on higher revenues and inline costs,"" said UBS analysts. 
Shares in German retailer Metro (DE:B4B) rose 10 percent after it said steps to stabilize its shrinking Russian business are starting to pay off.
Many more stocks were punished for disappointing results. 
Shares in Altice Europe (AS:ATCA), the debt-ridden telecoms and cable group, sank 12.5 percent after reporting that margins suffered when it pushed on with aggressive promotions in France in the second quarter.
 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) shares fell 5.2 percent after earnings missed forecasts. ""The 2 percent EBITDA miss is likely to be taken negatively in light of concerns that Hugo Boss' strong underlying retail performance is not translating to an improvement in margins,"" said Berenberg analysts. 
Overall companies in the MSCI Europe index have so far reported year-on-year earnings growth of 8.2 percent for the second quarter. European earnings growth pales in comparison with that delivered by U.S. firms, however.
Bringing up the rear among European stocks was Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH), sinking 13 percent - taking its losses since Tuesday to 23 percent. 
An investor exodus after it decided to suspend a director forced the firm to halt dealing in some bond funds.
""The suspension of client dealings in absolute return bond funds increases the likelihood of a bear case scenario for AuM (assets under management) loss,"" said Baader Helvea analysts.

The technology giant has an adjusted outstanding share count of 4,829,926,000 as of July 20, the firm announced in its 10Q, after reporting its third-quarter results on Tuesday.
Shares of Apple need to reach $207.05 for the firm to reach the $1 trillion mark, or about 2.75%. The company closed at $201.50 on Wednesday and was down 0.60% to $200.30 in pre-market trading as of 5:17 AM ET (9:17 GMT).

Shares of Apple surged on Wednesday after a stronger than expected quarterly report, driven by software and services revenue and higher iPhone prices. Apple reported revenue of $53.3 billion and profits of $2.34 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $52.3 billion and $2.16 per share, respectively.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>",Delivered hot: Starbucks bets on Alibaba tie-up to revive China sales,"By Brenda Goh and Pei Li
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) is partnering with  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to deliver its coffee in Chinese cities starting this fall, betting the move will revive sales growth in its second-largest market that is witnessing aggressive local competition.
Starbucks flagged in June that it was pursuing such a tie-up after reporting a sudden slowdown in China sales growth, which it blamed partly on a crackdown on third-party delivery firms that had previously helped drive orders at its cafes.
""I consider this strategic partnership to be one that ... will just be rocket fuel for Starbucks' growth and continued expansion in China,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson told reporters in Shanghai on Thursday.
The Seattle-based company will pilot delivery services from 150 Starbucks stores in Beijing and Shanghai and plans to expand that to more than 2,000 stores across 30 cities by the end of the year, Starbucks and Alibaba said in a joint statement.
Starbucks expects to start seeing some of the benefits from the partnership in the next quarter and the full impact in 2019, Johnson said.
The companies will collaborate across businesses within the Alibaba group, including delivery platform Ele.me, supermarket chain Hema, online retailers Tmall and Taobao, and mobile and online payment platform Alipay. Starbucks will also open a virtual store on Alibaba's platforms where customers can buy Starbucks merchandise, they said.
The delivery program will leverage Ele.me's 3 million registered riders, with an aim of delivering orders within half an hour. Starbucks will establish ""Starbucks Delivery Kitchens"" inside Hema stores and use the supermarket's delivery system to fulfill Starbucks delivery orders.
Starbucks had no formal online delivery in China before this deal.
Instead, unapproved third-party delivery services had filled that gap by picking up bulk orders for their own customers. Analysts have said an official delivery arrangement would push up costs for Starbucks.
Starbucks said its delivery menu will only contain items that can meet its half-hour deadline, but did not specify whether it will charge for the deliveries. Its pilot delivery program in Manhattan and Seattle a few years back fizzled partly because it charged too much: $5.99 per delivery.
Luckin Coffee, a local startup that wants to go toe-to-toe with Starbucks, charges less than $1 per order and has said its deliveries took an average of 18 minutes.
Starbucks and Alibaba did not give financial details of the partnership and declined to say whether the companies had discussed taking equity stakes in each other.
Some parts of the agreement, including the Ele.me tie-up was exclusive, while others were not, Starbucks executives said. The partnership had been discussed for more than a year, the companies said.
OPPORTUNITY = COMPETITION
China has offered Starbucks rich pickings in recent years, thanks to a burgeoning cafe culture which has helped offset saturation in the United States. It has 3,400 stores in the country and plans to almost double that number by 2022.
But there is pressure from local companies such as Luckin, which has expanded rapidly and offers cheap delivery, online ordering, big discounts and premium pay for its staff.
Luckin said on Wednesday it planned to more than double its number of stores in China to 2,000 by the end of 2018.
Johnson acknowledged the competition but added that the significant opportunity in China made that unsurprising.
Starbucks' move to offer delivery ""is in part to make sure they don't fall behind Luckin Coffee in terms of offering high quality delivery services"" to a customer group of young office workers who do not want to stand in line, said Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group.
The partnership is also a leg up for Ele.me in its race for market share in the Chinese delivery market against Meituan-Dianping, which is backed by gaming giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700).

Ele.me said last week that it will spend more on subsidies at a time when Meituan is preparing for a $4 billion Hong Kong listing.

1575,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Trump's Tariff Threats Erase $220 Billion From Asia Stock Values,"(Bloomberg) -- The respite was brief: A fresh round of trade-war fears sent stock markets sinking across Asia.
Investors had nowhere to hide, with equity gauges from Japan to India plunging on Thursday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped as much as 1.4 percent, heading for its biggest slide in six weeks as more than $220 billion in equity-market value evaporated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure has lost 2.1 percent from a high less than a week ago.
“The hot and cold news on tariffs and mixed signals coming out of the U.S. are taking their toll on investor sentiment,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “All in all, markets seem to be gearing up for another leg down. We are taking risk off the table.”
President Donald Trump has asked U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider hiking proposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. The measures could be implemented as early as next month.
Shares in China paced losses, as the Shanghai Composite Index came close to its bottom in July, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell for a fourth day to its lowest level since September. Benchmarks in Japan and South Korea retreated at least 1 percent, while Australia’s slipped 0.6 percent, led by a slump in commodity producers.
BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. sank 3.3 percent in Australia, the most since February, after workers at its Escondida copper mine in Chile overwhelmingly voted in favor of a strike. The dispute is one of a number in the country that could lead to supply woes for the key industrial metal.
Tech Burden
Technology stocks including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. were the biggest drags in Asia, despite gains for the sector in the U.S. on Wednesday. The S&P 500 Index itself erased an advance in that session as trade concerns and the Federal Reserve’s moves to stick with a plan for a gradual rate hike offset bullish sentiment following Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s surge to a record.
Tencent’s 7.6 percent plunge this week took its market-cap loss to about $160 billion since the shares peaked in January. The slide has opened up a record 50 percent gap between analysts’ average price estimate and the current stock price, even after several of them slashed their targets last month. Tencent, which reports earnings Aug. 15, is the biggest component of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, accounting for 2.8 percent of the gauge.
“We seem to be stuck in this continuously revolving door around the trade war and emerging market-specific issues in general,” Stephen Innes, Singapore-based head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp., wrote in an email. “I can’t help but exercise prudence in these conditions given the outlook for U.S.-China negotiations remains muddled.”

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Hong Kong insurance market lures well-educated mainland Chinese,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - May Zhang, a 28-year-old from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, holds a master's degree in engineering from the University of Oxford, but now makes her living selling insurance in Hong Kong.
Drawn by lucrative pay, Zhang is part of a growing band of well-educated young Chinese selling insurance in the city to buyers from mainland China who are seeking refuge from a falling yuan and are rattled by healthcare safety fears at home.
These agents are seen as having the edge in winning business from clients from China's upper and middle classes since they have similar educational and social backgrounds.
""Every time the yuan depreciates or when things like the vaccine scandal happens, I get more people panicking and asking about Hong Kong insurance,"" said Zhang, referring to recent cases in which Chinese companies falsified data and sold ineffective vaccines.
The yuan has dropped more than 6 percent since mid June amid worsening Chinese economic data, and some forecast it will ease further if a U.S.-China trade dispute intensifies. 
According to the Hong Kong Insurance Authority, new business premiums from mainland clients amounted to HK$11.8 billion ($1.50 billion) in the first quarter of 2018, with 95 percent of that spent on medical or protective products. While that was down 37 percent from the first quarter of 2017, partly due to a decline in endowment and life insurance policies, agents said the number of Chinese clients was rising, especially from middle class families and millennials. 
""The average policy size has got smaller but our client base has grown much larger,"" said Sheria Li, 32, a fashion-buyer-turned-manager at a Hong Kong insurance company who joined the sector in 2015. Li, who oversees about 40 people with a mainland background like hers, said total commissions were growing as much as 50 percent a year.
""More people on the mainland are only just starting to be aware of Hong Kong insurance,"" she said. ""The market potential is huge.""
AIA Group (HK:1299), a Hong Kong-listed insurer, reported a 20 percent rise in new business in its first quarter, fueled by demand for insurance products in mainland China and Hong Kong.
SAFE HAVEN
Mainland Chinese have long flocked to Hong Kong in times of crisis, such as when Beijing curbs capital flows or when scandals erupt in the food and healthcare sectors. 
Agents say Hong Kong insurance provides more comprehensive and higher protection for health issues than mainland products. And insurance savings products denominated in Hong Kong or U.S. dollars are also seen as attractive investments for hedging against falls in the yuan. In 2016, when the yuan depreciated nearly 7 percent, mainland Chinese spent a record HK$72.7 billion on Hong Kong-issued life insurance policies, double the 2015 total. Many were taking advantage of a loophole that allowed them to transfer assets across the border beyond the annual limit of $50,000 by swiping UnionPay cards to buy large insurance policies, and then using them as collateral to borrow money from Hong Kong banks.
The UnionPay channel was shut by the authorities in 2016, resulting in a drop in sales of policies to mainland customers. 
Hong Kong insurance polices are not protected by law on the mainland, making it a legal gray area for mainlanders that choose to buy them - which involves traveling to Hong Kong to sign contracts. But many are willing to take the risk, citing trust in big multinational insurers working from the city.
Thanks to booming demand, successful agents were easily able to qualify for membership in the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT), a global association of top-earning insurance professionals, Li said.
Most new joiners were able to achieve MDRT's entry requirement of an annual income of HK$533,200 by their second year, she added.
The Hong Kong Insurance Authority does not provide figures for the number of mainland Chinese insurance salespeople in the territory.
Jack Chiu, 30, a former manager at the Chinese tech conglomerate LeEco, became an insurance agent in Hong Kong in 2017. Chiu, originally from mainland China, said he had grappled with entering a trade he deemed low in terms of prestige, but the prospect of high commissions and the business's flexible nature, convinced him to join. A senior manager at a large insurance company in Hong Kong who holds a PhD said that almost everyone in her team of around 200 people had a master's degree at least. She declined to be identified as she was not authorized to speak to the media. ""Insurance agents with better education are not necessarily better salespeople - on the contrary, many are terrible because they are too proud,"" she said. ""But they tend to come from the circle of people that are spending the most money.""

1578,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Why Tesla’s Billion-Dollar China Play Is Key to Its Survival,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is embarking on a Chinese expansion costing billions of dollars for a good reason: the country is set to remain the largest electric-vehicle market for decades to come, and Elon Musk has a long way to go if he wants to dominate it.
Demand for electric cars will continue to gain ground in what is the world’s fastest-growing auto and consumer market, as the government -- which is cracking down on pollution and re-making its factory-led economy as high tech -- favors them over gas guzzlers. Beijing has been pushing policy to fuel the rise of EVs, giving owners registration breaks and offering tax incentives for buyers. And while other countries are making inroads, China will remain the leader through at least 2040, Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts.
Tesla, which has come under fire from investors for burning cash and its elusive profitability, said Wednesday it plans to use debt raised in China to fund its new factory near Shanghai, the first outside of the U.S.
The facility, known as the Gigafactory 3, is expected to churn out about 250,000 vehicles and battery packs per year initially -- and that capacity will double over time. The first cars are expected to roll off the production line in about three years.
Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday that the cost of the plant at full capacity would be $5 billion, citing a person familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Later on a conference call, Musk said the cost for the factory to build 250,000 vehicles a year would be near $2 billion.
“China’s determination to go electric and the sheer size of its market” are driving global EV adoption, said Nannan Kou, a senior associate at Bloomberg NEF in Beijing. “Global carmakers have brought forward their timetables for EV development by six to seven years under China’s EV push.”
Tesla isn’t alone. Global giants such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Toyota Motor Corp., and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG are pouring billions of dollars into new-energy vehicles -- but they’re coming late to to the party in China. Hundreds of domestic automakers are also seeking a slice of the market, spurred on by the government’s ambition to boost annual sales of new-energy vehicles tenfold by 2025.
Local production is crucial for Tesla to not only secure its foothold in China, but keep costs down -- especially as the trade war with the U.S. results in higher tariffs on car imports. The automaker has already boosted prices on its Model S and Model X cars by as much as $30,000 in China after the government imposed additional duties on American-built vehicles.
That risks putting them out of reach for the country’s growing middle class.
Encouraging for Tesla, though, EV demand is strongest in China’s largest cities, which have imposed restrictions on gasoline-engine cars.
Places like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are also home to China’s wealthiest consumers, the people that are more likely to afford a Tesla either now -- or down the road -- especially as the company rolls out the Model 3 sedan, its cheapest-ever car.
After years of to-ing and fro-ing with China, Musk secured preliminary agreement with Shanghai’s government to build the plant after a flying visit to the city last month.
While construction is expected to start in the next few quarters, the carmaker’s investment won’t begin “in any significant way” until next year, according to a letter to shareholders out Wednesday, released alongside Tesla’s second-quarter earnings.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Khazanah's investment playbook set for revamp under Mahathir's Malaysia,"By Anshuman Daga and Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Khazanah Nasional will likely cut stakes in some top state-linked firms as the government overhauls the sovereign wealth fund's investment strategy, after revamping its board last week, to boost transparency and slash national debt.
The performance of the $39 billion fund has been muted, but backed by past governments, its investments have spread across various sectors globally, with one of the highlights being its profitable stake in  Alibaba  (N:BABA) bought before the e-commerce giant's blockbuster IPO in 2014.
New Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is keen to make the fund leaner and use sale proceeds to cut massive debt piled up in a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), banking and financial industry sources said.
Khazanah will likely trim stakes in CIMB Group Holdings (KL:CIMB), chaired by the brother of former Premier Najib Razak, regional telecoms firm Axiata Group (KL:AXIA) and restructure struggling Telekom Malaysia (KL:TLMM) in the coming months, the sources told Reuters.
It could also review its stake in IHH Healthcare (KL:IHHH), which has grown into one of the world's biggest healthcare service providers with a $12 billion market value, they added.
IHH has been in news recently for its winning $1.1 billion bid to takeover India's Fortis (NS:FOHE).
""In the current climate, Khazanah is bound to be smaller,"" said a banker, who also noted that property projects in the southern Malaysian region of Iskandar and overseas infrastructure deals were ripe for sales.
Malaysia is saddled with over 1 trillion ringgit ($246 billion) in debt, swelled by liabilities tied to 1MDB, the scandal over which led to the ouster of Najib's government and the return of 93-year-old strongman Mahathir, who has begun a swift corporate clean-up.
Sources said other options the government could consider for Khazanah include partial stake sales in regulated state-linked firms as these have crowded out the private sector. Overseas investments could also be trimmed.
""Strategic sell-downs are going to be part of the rationalization drive by this government,"" said a corporate lawyer familiar with the government's approach.
Khazanah and the Prime Minister's office did not reply to emails from Reuters seeking comment for this story.
LIKELY BUYERS
Malaysian asset manager Permodalan Nasional Bhd and pension funds Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, already big investors in state-linked companies, are seen as likely buyers of potential sell-downs, the sources said.
Khazanah has stakes in more than 100 companies such as India's  Infosys  Technologies (NS:INFY), NYSE-listed e-commerce firm SEA Ltd (N:SE) and has shaped up homegrown firms including IHH and lender CIMB into regional champions.
""Khazanah has become an asset accumulator and builder - a separate force in its own right, which Mahathir seems to perceive as diluting the government's influence,"" said Munir Abdul Aziz, partner at law firm Wong & Partners.
Mahathir sees the resignation of Khazanah's management as a restructuring opportunity for a fund he said has deviated from its goal to help Malaysia's ethnic majority, the bumiputera or ""sons of the soil"".
The fund deviated by divesting shares in strategic assets, Economic affairs minister Mohamed Azmin Ali, a new director of the fund, told parliament on Wednesday, enumerating failed investments it had written off. 
The realizable asset value of Khazanah's portfolio climbed 29.4 percent to 157.2 billion ringgit in 2017 from 121.5 billion ringgit in 2012, while the portfolio value of Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL) rose 43.2 percent to S$308 billion ($226 billion) in the five years to March 2018.
Mahathir took over as chairman of Khazanah this week, after Managing Director Azman Mokhtar resigned. The entire board offered to quit last week.
Sources say EPF CEO Shahril Ridza Ridzuan is the top pick to replace Azman. EPF did not reply to requests for comment.
DIFFERENT VISION
Azman took charge of Khazanah in 2004, and modeled the fund on the lines of Temasek, boosting corporate governance at public sector monopolies and driving big restructuring at some firms. 
The fund also invested in real estate projects, technology and logistics sectors, while opening worldwide offices. Under Azman, its offshore investments grew to represent about 44.5 percent of its realizable asset value by geographical exposure.
While there have been revelations that funds from deals with Khazanah were used by the previous government to meet 1MDB's liabilities, Khazanah has said it had no control over the utilization of those funds.
Some experts continue to see Khazanah as a vehicle for investments in emerging sectors, especially overseas.

""Its role in the economy is to venture into new areas which the private sector would not,"" said political economy professor Edmund Terence Gomez. ""Mahathir has made it very clear that he wants to link Khazanah to his bumiputera agenda. I think that was not what Khazanah was set up for.""

The board has also set up a special committee to help the probe, and Moonves will have no role in the investigation, CBS said in a statement.
The investigation by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton will be led by Mary Jo White, a former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, CBS said.
Covington & Burling, which previously worked with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to look into its culture and workplace practices, is the second law firm that will probe the matter.
Moonves, who joined CBS in 1995 and has been CEO since 2006, earlier said he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"", which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and had never used his position to harm anyone's career.
Moonves is the latest executive to come under scrutiny by the #MeToo social movement, which has sought to hold accountable male business leaders, politicians and entertainers for sexual misconduct, leading to resignations in major corporations, Hollywood and among lawmakers.

CBS board left Moonves in his post on Monday as it discussed sexual harassment claims against him.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest lenders have started lowering their mortgage rates in an attempt to attract borrowers amid plummeting credit growth, even as rising wholesale funding costs have forced smaller rivals to increase their rates.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) on Thursday reduced the variable mortgage rate by 34 basis points to 3.65 percent, three days after the largest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), lowered some of its fixed mortgage rates by 10 basis points on competition grounds.
""The big four banks have been losing market share and their home loan growth has been below the market, so they are doing this as an attempt to recover some market share,"" said Morningstar banking analyst David Ellis.
ANZ's discount will apply to new customers for loans financing less than 80 percent of a property, the bank said in a statement.
Growth in Australian home loans fell to a four-year low of 5.6 percent in June, as tighter lending standards and hikes in some mortgage rates sucked the life out of the buy-to-let sector.
Australia's big four lenders, which also include Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), already control about 80 percent of the country's home loan and deposit market, making them some of the most profitable in the world.
But they have been losing market share to smaller competitors who have been growing mortgage books at double-digit rates by offering cheaper rates.
""All the small banks and the regional banks increased their variable home loan rates because of higher funding costs, but short-term market rates have actually been easing in the last few weeks, taking some pressure off the major banks,"" Ellis said.
""That's why we haven't seen the majors increase their home loan rates,"" he added.
Over the past few months, about 16 smaller banks have raised their home loan rates to protect profit margins against a sudden increase in wholesale funding costs.
Even with the increases by those smaller rivals, the four major banks' lending rates remain higher, according to Moody's Investors Service.

HONG KONG (Reuters/IFR) - Chinese Nasdaq-listed biotech BeiGene Ltd has raised $903 million after pricing its secondary listing in Hong Kong - the first under new exchange rules - near the top of an indicative range, three people close to the deal said on Thursday.
The listing comes as Hong Kong works to lure overseas-listed firms to conduct secondary share offerings in the financial hub. It is also the second listing under new rules for early-state drug developers.
Hong Kong's stock exchange is seeking to establish itself as a financing center for the growing number of pre-revenue drug developers. Its efforts will pit it against Nasdaq, currently the biggest center for biotech listings, with $2.4 billion worth of such shares sold last year, Thomson Reuters data showed.
BeiGene, which develops molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs to treat cancer, is selling 65.6 million new shares, or 8.55 percent of its enlarged share capital, at HK$108 ($13.76) each, close to the top of a price range of HK$94.4 to HK$111.6, the people said.
The price of its secondary listing represents a discount of 1.6 percent against its closing price of $181.74 in the U.S. on Wednesday.
BeiGene has seen its shares jump more than seven times since raising $158 million in its 2016 Nasdaq IPO. Each American Depository share (ADS) represents 13 ordinary shares.
BeiGene declined to comment on the pricing. The people declined to be identified as the information was not public.
Four cornerstone investors - Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL], U.S. hedge fund Baker Brothers Advisors and Chinese investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group and Ally Bridge - have committed $276 million for the offering.
Under Hong Kong's new rules, in place since April 30, biotech firms without revenue or profit can apply to list.
The first listing by Ascletis Pharma Inc under the new listing regime saw shares close flat with their IPO price on their debut on Wednesday.
More than 10 biotech firms - mostly Chinese and including Innovent Biologics, backed by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd (TEM.UL), and Shanghai Henlius Biotech - plan to list in Hong Kong and some have dropped U.S. IPO plans in favor of listing closer to home.
""There are a lot of global investors that are specialists in biotech, but they know very little about China. And there are a lot of investors (here) that know a lot about China, but they know very little about biotech. The dual-listing that we're doing is helping educate both ways,"" John V. Oyler, founder and chief executive of BeiGene, told a news conference in Hong Kong on Sunday.
The China and U.S.-based BeiGene was founded by Oyler and Wang Xiaodong in 2010. It has a portfolio of six internally developed clinical drug candidates including three near commercial stage, its prospectus showed.
It plans to use proceeds from its secondary listing for developing and commercializing the three late-stage drug candidates, expanding its product portfolio and for general working capital, the prospectus showed.
The company recorded a net loss of $105 million in the first quarter of 2018, a loss twice as wide as in the same period a year prior.
Its shares will start trading in Hong Kong on Aug. 8.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are joint sponsors for the deal.

The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. chief executive officer began the question-and-answer portion of the carmaker’s second-quarter earnings call by atoning for what he called his “bad manners” three months earlier. Musk then took the first two questions from two analysts he was harshest with last quarter -- Sanford C. Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi and RBC Capital Markets’ Joseph Spak -- and offered personal apologies.
In the first-quarter call in May, Musk cut off Sacconaghi for what he called “boring, bonehead” questions and said Spak’s questions were “so dry.” On Wednesday’s call, Musk apologized to Sacconaghi for being “impolite” before and blamed insufficient sleep.
It was a major mea culpa to Wall Street by a billionaire who in recent weeks called a British cave diver in the Thai rescue mission a pedophile and portrayed a former battery factory employee as a saboteur. Musk was urged last month by major shareholder Baillie Gifford & Co. and bullish venture capital firm Loup Ventures to focus on execution.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 08:06PM ET</span>",Lawsuit claims Walmart stole technology to keep produce fresh,"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) was sued on Wednesday by a Silicon Valley company that accused the largest U.S. retailer of stealing its technology to prolong the shelf life of produce and reduce spoilage.
In its $2 billion complaint, Zest Labs and its parent said Walmart's ""Eden"" technology to preserve fruit and vegetable freshness ""looks, sounds, and functions"" like its own Zest Fresh technology.
Zest said it had worked with Walmart for years on Zest Fresh before the retailer lost interest last November.
It said it was ""stunned"" in March when Walmart claimed to have developed Eden internally over six months through a ""hackathon"" among its own engineers, and that it had prevented $86 million of waste so far.
""In reality, Walmart used its years of unfettered access to plaintiffs' trade secrets, proprietary information, and know-how to steal the Zest Fresh technology and misappropriate it for Walmart's own benefit,"" the complaint said.
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said ""we respect the intellectual property rights of others,"" and will respond to the complaint in court.
Zest said Walmart has estimated $2 billion of savings over five years from Eden, and said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer could save $15 billion over a decade.
Its lawsuit seeks to recover such savings for Walmart's alleged theft of trade secrets, unfair competition, breach of contract and other wrongdoing.
Walmart is one of the largest U.S. grocery sellers, and has been exploring new means to expand sales and market share, including in home delivery following Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) purchase of Whole Foods last year.
Zest Labs is based in San Jose, California, and filed its lawsuit with the federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas.

The case is Zest Labs Inc et al v Walmart Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, No. 18-00500.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Wednesday it is among banks and securities dealers being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their handling of so-called ""pre-released"" American Depositary Receipts (ADR) between 2011 and 2015.
The disclosure, made in a regular quarterly filing by JPMorgan, comes after the SEC said on July 20 that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had agreed to pay nearly $75 million to settle its part of a continuing investigation into mishandling of the securities.
ADRs are U.S. securities that represent foreign shares of a foreign company. They require a corresponding number of foreign shares to be held in custody at a depositary bank. Under certain conditions the SEC allows the ""pre-release"" of ADRs before the corresponding shares have been deposited.
In the case of Deutsche, the SEC said the bank had improperly provided thousands of pre-released ADRs and failed to prevent securities law violations when the instruments were borrowed or lent.
Failures to properly handle the transactions leave ADRs ""ripe for potential abuse at the expense of ADR holders,"" the SEC said when it settled with Deutsche.

JPMorgan said it has been cooperating with the investigation. A spokesman declined to comment further.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>",Tesla flags promise of profit as Model 3 production steadies,"By Alexandria Sage and Sonam Rai
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it would produce its new Model 3 sedan at a profit after several recent weeks in which output stabilized, buoying hopes that the electric vehicle maker led by Elon Musk will stanch its financial losses in the second half of the year.
Chief Executive Musk is under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the sedan, Tesla's lowest-priced model and the key to its plans to become a mass-market automaker, after a host of manufacturing challenges and concerns it was running through cash too quickly.
Despite Tesla reporting a record loss that doubled to $718 million in the second quarter, shares jumped as much as 11 percent in after-hours trading, as investors focused on steadier production volumes and a slower rate of cash burn. That put it on track to retake the title of most valuable U.S. automaker from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
The company cut its capital spending plans and said it would not hit its long-term rate of producing 10,000 Model 3s per week until next year, trading off production ramp speed for financial health.
""We like the more muted tone of the company's outlook, with the absence of unnecessary new stretch goals,"" said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy. ""Perhaps it reflects a more cautious Elon Musk.""
The outspoken Musk, who told analysts last quarter that he refused to answer their ""boring"" questions, apologized multiple times on Wednesday during a post-earnings call for his past behavior.
Tesla said that during July it had hit an earlier goal of building about 5,000 Model 3s per week ""multiple times"", and reiterated a target of producing 6,000 per week by late August. Analysts have questioned whether the 5,000 rate would be sustainable.
It expects to build a total of up to 55,000 Model 3s in the third quarter, which works out to an average weekly rate of 4,230, at a roughly 15 percent gross margin, rising to 20 percent in the fourth quarter.
Tesla delivered its 200,000th electric car - including its more expensive Model S and X vehicles - in July, a threshold which means a $7,500 federal subsidy will remain in place to the end of the year.
Had it delivered the car in June, the subsidy would have lapsed a quarter earlier, a strategic move applauded by Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which holds Tesla shares. 
Thus far, Tesla has only produced higher-cost versions of the Model 3, starting at about $49,000. But Musk said many of the trade-ins it received were mass-market vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Honda Accords and Civics.
Tesla recently opened up reservations for the Model 3, allowing new buyers of the pricier models to jump ahead of those who had ordered base models of the vehicle two years ago. That angered some deposit-holders, and analysts questioned whether more would drop out because of delays making the cheaper $35,000 version.
CASH FLOW POSITIVE 
Wall Street analysts have also questioned whether Tesla would need to raise more cash, but Musk said on the call that he expected the company to be henceforth profitable and cash flow positive, excluding some debt repayment, and had no plans for an equity raise.
Tesla plans to pay off its upcoming debt - some $1.8 billion comes due before November 2019 - through internally generated cash flow, Musk said.
Tesla ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses.
Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, narrowed to negative $740 million in the second quarter from negative $1 billion in the first quarter, excluding solar business costs. 
Tesla has begun to lay off 9 percent of its workforce as it tightens spending. Tesla said its capital expenses would be slightly below $2.5 billion in 2018, less than last year's $3.4 billion. 
The company also outlined expansion plans, saying it would likely announce the location of a European factory this year and planned a Shanghai, China plant to produce both vehicles and batteries. Tesla's China investment would not start ""in any significant way"" until 2019, with much of the roughly $2 billion cost to be funded via local debt. 
Excluding items, Tesla reported a loss of $2.45 per share, compared with expectations of a loss of $2.92.
Total revenue rose to $4 billion from $2.79 billion.

The after-hours rise took shares to around $328. The stock has slumped 19 percent since a 2018 high of $370.73 in June.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) on Wednesday said it added far more wireless subscribers than Wall Street had expected, as the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier invests in its network while awaiting regulatory approval to buy rival Sprint Corp (N:S).
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said in an interview he felt confident regulators will approve the current merger structure without having to divest parts of the business.
The combined T-Mobile and Sprint would be able to better compete against larger rivals  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T), and combine resources to build the next-generation wireless network, or 5G.
Legere, in a call to discuss quarterly results with analysts, said the merger is critical to 5G plans and for increasing industry competition, adding that the pending deal ""has been very well received.""The Bellevue, Washington-based company said it added 686,000 wireless subscribers during the second quarter, compared with 786,000 added in the previous year. Analysts had expected T-Mobile to add 467,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. Shares of T-Mobile rose 1.5 percent to $60.25 in extended trading on Wednesday. T-Mobile's revenue rose to $10.57 billion from $10.2 billion a year earlier, shy of Wall Street's estimate of $10.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said capital expenditures for the year would be at the high end of its $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion forecast range, as the company works to install its spectrum for 5G.Net income for the quarter rose 35 percent to $782 million, or 92 cents per share, from $581 million, or 67 cents per share, a year ago. 
Phone subscriber churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 0.95 percent during the quarter, down from 1.1 percent last year.

The company's average revenue per phone subscriber was $46.52 in the second quarter, down 1.2 percent from the year-ago quarter, due to customers moving to tax inclusive plans. T-Mobile said on Monday that Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) would supply it with network equipment for 5G in a $3.5 billion deal, the world's largest 5G deal so far.

The announcement comes days before a task force set up by President Donald Trump is due to recommend postal reforms to the White House. Trump has said without evidence that the world's largest online retailer is making the postal service incur losses, mandating the task force review USPS pricing on package delivery.
While Amazon has steered clear of any quarrel with the president, the Package Coalition is now poised to take the company's case to the public as the government weighs changes affecting USPS.
""These companies just want to ensure that decisions are made based on a clear understanding of what the facts are,"" John McHugh, the coalition chairman, told Reuters in an interview. ""The package service portion of the postal service's business model is one of the few bright spots. It makes money.""
McHugh, a former member of Congress who served as chairman of the postal service subcommittee, said package rate hikes not based on market prices could reduce demand and revenue for USPS, potentially undercutting its ability to deliver to any address in the United States.
USPS has lost $65 billion since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, according to the executive order establishing the postal task force. The service, which is supposed to be self-sustaining, must ask Congress for permission to raise rates and must pre-fund decades worth of retiree health benefits.
Coalition members have already shared information with the presidential task force, McHugh said. With the task force's Aug. 10 report deadline looming, the coalition's focus at present is on broader government and public outreach.
""Earlier today we sent out emails asking for meetings with both House and Senate members,"" said McHugh. ""We view this as a long-term effort.""
Members of the new group include  Columbia Sportswear  (O:COLM), pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (O:ESRX), the National Retail Federation, package shipping firm OSM Worldwide, postal service company Pitney Bowes (N:PBI), Publishers Clearing House and the retailer QVC.
""Without (the Postal Service), consumers would have fewer shipping options, reduced service in rural areas, and prices would drastically increase,"" said Blair Anderson, director of transportation policy at Amazon.

Amazon did not respond to a request for further comment, beyond the Package Coalition statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday postponed a vote to confirm President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. consumer watchdog following an effort by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren to get more details on the nominee's role in immigration matters and other policy areas.
In a letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, Warren asked the panel to postpone Thursday's scheduled vote to advance the nomination of Kathy Kraninger as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) until she had provided more detailed answers to Warren and other Democrats.
Later on Wednesday, Crapo said in a statement the hearing would be postponed, but did not confirm whether Warren's letter was the sole impetus.
""An update will be sent when a new date has been scheduled,"" the statement said.
The CFPB was formed in 2011 under former Democratic President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to look out for the interests of ordinary borrowers.
The letter marked another step by Warren, a consumer advocate, to ramp up pressure on Kraninger, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and rally 'no' votes in the Senate against her confirmation.
Kraninger and the OMB did not respond to requests for comment. 
Warren, Sherrod Brown and other Senate Democrats asked Kraninger last week for more details on the role she played in the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy that separated more than 2,000 children from their parents. 
They also asked Kraninger to provide more information on her position on a range of consumer finance issues. 
During her nomination hearing last month, Kraninger told the committee she had no role in setting or developing the immigration policy but that she had attended meetings relating to its implementation. 
Warren and Brown have twice written to Kraninger asking her to clarify the exact nature of her role, including a list of those meetings and who else attended.
Kraninger provided responses to the committee on Tuesday, but Warren said in Wednesday's letter that the answers were not sufficiently detailed and that Kraninger had failed to hand over relevant documents.

Senate Republicans have said the CFPB has overstepped its legal powers and are hoping Kraninger, who would take over from interim chief Mick Mulvaney, will continue to rein in the agency.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has a sizable stake in health insurer Cigna (N:CI) and plans to vote against its planned $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (O:ESRX), the Wall Street Journal reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-icahn-has-sizable-stake-in-cigna-plans-to-vote-against-express-scripts-deal-1533150217 on Wednesday.
Icahn believes Cigna is paying too high a price for Express Scripts, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The Journal said Icahn's stake was less than 5.0 percent of Cigna's shares.
Cigna shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal on Aug. 24. The two companies hope the deal will help them hold onto profits despite scrutiny for rising healthcare costs. 
Cigna's shares closed up 2.0 percent on Wednesday afternoon, while Express Scripts' stock slid nearly 7.0 percent.
Express Scripts shares have been trading well below the value of Cigna's bid. 
The arbitrage spread of the deal, which measures that difference, widened to more than 25 percent from 18 percent after Icahn's stake was revealed, suggesting investor skepticism the deal can close. 
""Clearly there had been shareholder disappointment and discontent post the transaction announcement,"" Evercore ISI analysts Mike Newshel and Ross Muken said in a research note
Express Scripts business model is in question, and on its own would likely be worth $57 to $62 a share, they said. 
Cigna would be better off doing a share buyback of $7 billion to $10 billion, buying smaller pharmacy benefit managers, and increasing its government paid business, they said. 
Leerink Research analyst Ana Gupte doesn't believe investors will vote the deal down, noting that Icahn would need to get other large investors on board. 
""I don’t know if he could do that,"" she said.
Neither Icahn nor Cigna immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the deal would ""deliver significant value to shareholders.""
Cigna announced the deal in March, looking for new ways to boost profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs. 
They say the deal could generate $600 million in savings per year and help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients.
But headwinds for the companies have strengthened since the deal was announced. 
Pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) like Express Scripts have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, which is looking at scaling back or eliminating rebates from drug purchases that are diverted to middlemen like PBMs.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has also purchased an online pharmacy that Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales. 

The deal followed the $69 billion merger announced in December between CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and health insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET). Shareholders from those companies approved the CVS-Aetna tie-up in March, but they are still awaiting antitrust approval.

Aberdeen Standard Investments Ltd. is finding bargains in the offshore junk bonds of Chinese companies, especially property developers, as it expects the nation’s stimulus measures to continue improving conditions. The $779 billion asset manager added to its exposure in the second quarter as it found valuations attractive, according to Paul Lukaszewski, Singapore-based head of Asian corporate debt and emerging-market credit research.
“Offshore Chinese bonds went from being a very expensive asset class for the last three or four years to one of the more attractively priced over the course of the first half of 2018,” Lukaszewski said in an interview in Sydney. “We expect to see a loosening of policy in the second half of the year given the slowing growth trajectory as well as the probable knock-on effect of trade tensions escalating.”
China’s central bank has rolled out a raft of measures to aid growth over the last few weeks.
“The problem has been that financial conditions tightened up and investors were becoming uncomfortable in terms of companies’ ability to access credit to refinance,” Lukaszewski said. “Slowly but surely the policy steps are coming to address this.”
The moves are encouraging Chinese builders to slowly make their way back into the U.S. dollar bond market. Yuzhou Properties sold more of its 2021 notes last week after Agile Group Holdings tapped investors for another $400 million of similar-maturity debt. Sunac China Holdings also returned to the market having raised $1.1 billion in April.
A rally in Asian dollar bonds in recent weeks has helped cut Chinese companies’ borrowing costs. The average yield for China’s speculative-rated notes was at 9.4 percent Tuesday, according to ICE BofAML indexes. Yields rose to 10.6 percent on July 12, the highest in more than three years.
“If Chinese are concerned about slowing exports, the natural response will be to shore up the property sector, which is a very meaningful contributor domestically,” Lukaszewski said. “There are some Chinese property developers with good metrics and outlook that have repriced to levels that we thought were irrational, so we were comfortable increasing exposure. I see further room for things to improve.”

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) updated its latest share count on Wednesday, putting the magic stock price at $207.04 that would make the iPhone maker the first publicly listed U.S. company valued at $1 trillion.
Apple said in a quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, that its share count was 4,829,926,000 on July 20, less than the 4,842,917,000 it reported on Tuesday for the end of the June quarter.
Apple's stock rose 5.89 percent to a record-high close of $201.50 on Wednesday following the company's better-than-expected quarterly results.
That would put Apple's stock market value at $973 billion, based on its newly disclosed number of shares.
With a mountain of overseas cash freed up by last year's sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts, Apple bought back a record $43 billion of its own shares in the first six months of 2018, and its report to the SEC suggested it has continued that program in recent weeks.

A lower share count means Apple's stock must reach a higher price to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Four people have tested positive for Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo just days after another outbreak that killed 33 people in the northwest was declared over, the health ministry said on Wednesday.
Twenty people have already died from hemorrhagic fevers in and around Mangina, a densely populated town about 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the city of Beni and 100 km from the Ugandan border, the ministry said in its statement, without saying when the deaths occurred.
A team of 12 experts from Congo's health ministry will arrive in Beni on Thursday to set up a mobile lab, the ministry said. The World Health Organization has started moving staff and supplies to the area, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
They head to a region where deep security problems could complicate efforts to contain the virus. About 1,000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people. 
""This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population,"" Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement. 
Jeremy Konyndyk, an aid expert at the Center for Global Development, said other recent Ebola outbreaks had fortunately been in relatively safe and stable areas. 
""North Kivu is a different story, which makes me a little nervous,"" he said.
The area also has strong trade with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, raising the risk of the virus moving internationally.
Julie Hall, chief of staff at the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the Ebola response in North Kivu would be a ""highly complex"" operation.
The ministry said no evidence linked this outbreak with the last one, which began in April and occurred over 2,500 km (1,553 miles) away in northwestern Congo.
BATS AND BODY FLUIDS
This is the central African country's 10th outbreak since 1976, when the virus was discovered near the eponymous Ebola river in the north. That is more than twice as many as any other country.
Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats and can turn up in bush meat sold at food markets throughout Congo. Once present in humans, it causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.
An outbreak concentrated in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea killed at least 11,300 people between 2013 and 2016. 
Congolese and international health officials were credited with responding rapidly to the last outbreak, including by deploying an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck (NYSE:MRK), one of several vaccines being developed against Ebola.
But the Merck vaccine is designed to be used against the Zaire strain of Ebola, and there has been no confirmation of the strain in the latest outbreak, with the WHO calling it only ""presumptive Ebola"". 
A WHO spokesman declined to comment on possible vaccine use.
Aside from the vaccine, the key factors in halting the previous outbreak appeared to be aggressive tracing of potential patients and the speed of the response.
The WHO said the fact that it already had staff and equipment in place would give it a head start against the new outbreak.
""Ebola is a constant threat in DRC. What adds to our confidence in the country's ability to respond is the transparency they have displayed once again,"" WHO head Tedros said. 

""We will fight this one as we did the last.""

1616,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 04:56PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Tesla Climbs on Model 3 Guidance
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares climbed about 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company posting a wider quarterly loss than expected.
The automaker said its lost $3.06 per share in the last quarter, compared with analysts’ expectations for a loss of $2.78 per share. But revenue of $4 billion was about in line with forecasts.
And investors were also encouraged by the company’s guidance on production.
Tesla said it will boost Model 3 production to 6,000 per week by late August and move 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s off the line in the third quarter.
That should help the company on the way to its goal to be profitable in the next two quarters.
2. Jobless Claims and Factory Orders Data Due
Employment data continues to arrive Thursday as the market moves toward the release of the big July jobs report on Friday.
Initial jobless claims come out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists forecast that claims for first-time unemployment benefits came in at 221,000 last week, up from 217,000. A slight rise in continuing claims is also expected.
Looking ahead, the market is looking for the Labor Department to report a drop in nonfarm payrolls and for a tick down in the jobless rate.
Also Thursday, the latest numbers on factory orders arrive. The consensus is for a 0.7% rise in orders for June, compared with a 0.4% rise the month before.
3. BoE Wraps Up Central Bank Week With Hike Expected
Volatile moves in currency markets is expected to continue Thursday as the last of the three big central bank meetings this week wrap up.
It’s widely anticipated that the Bank of England’s Money Policy Committee will raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The decision is expected at 7:00 AM ET (11:00 GMT).
As with all rate decisions where the actual move is not in doubt, any signals on future rates decision will be of greatest interest. That’s especially true with the U.K. as the uncertainty about a Brexit deal persists.
""The key thing to watch is what the Bank of England has to say on its next steps,"" ING said.
Brexit will probably limit the MPC to one hike this year, but the Committee is likely to raise rates sooner rather than later, it added.
""In an ideal world, we believe policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019),"" ING said.
The voting for a hike is likely to be unanimous, according to economists, although one dovish member could vote to keep rates steady. Bank of England Deputy Governor John Cunliffe said in mid-July there’s a case to make for caution -- or “stodginess” as he put it -- when it comes to rates, Reuters reported."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow slipped on Wednesday as gains in Apple shares were offset by a drop in energy and industrial companies, while the U.S. Federal Reserve remained on course for an expected interest rate hike in September.
Technology companies pushed the Nasdaq higher. 
The central bank left rates unchanged, and reiterated its view that the U.S. economy is growing and the job market is strengthening, and inflation continues to hover near the Fed's 2 percent target since it last raised rates in June.
""The Fed demonstrated that they are willing to let the economy run a little hot as long as they don’t foresee a significant spike in inflation which would potentially serve as a headwind for the current bull market run,"" said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.
While technology stocks pulled the Nasdaq into positive territory and gave a boost to the S&P and the Dow, trade worries intensified as the Trump administration proposed hiking tariffs on imports from China.
Officials told reporters that Trump had directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider a tariff rate increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent as part efforts to ensure that it has ""the right tools in place in order to encourage China to change its actions.""
China called the move ""blackmail,"" and warned it would respond in kind. 
""It is clear that a lot of businesses are growing concerned about the direction that (the tariff dispute) is heading,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. ""If the trade tensions continue right up to the midterm elections, it would be disastrous for the GOP."" The U.S. congressional midterm elections will be held on Nov. 6.
Trade-sensitive stocks fell on the news, with the S&P 500 industrials index (SPLRCI) dropping 1.3 percent.

Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, eight ended the session in negative territory.
With the second-quarter earnings reporting season nearly two-thirds complete, analyst estimates for S&P 500 profit growth are now at 23.3 percent, up from 20.7 percent a month ago.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares hit an all-time high after posting results on Tuesday, beating estimates and forecasting better-than-expected sales on strong smartphone demand. The company is closing in on $1 trillion in market value.
Financial stocks (SPSY) advanced after yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) hit 3 percent for the first time since June 13.
Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) were up in choppy trading after the bell following the electric automaker's second-quarter earnings report. 
The energy sector (SPNY) was pressured by a drop in crude prices (LCOc1) on rising U.S. stocks and unexpectedly higher OPEC production. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

China warned that U.S. against ""blackmailing and pressuring"" it over trade, raising the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world's largest two economies, weighing on trade-sensitive stocks.
Shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), - notable names most sensitive to escalating trade tensions - came under pressure, dragging industrials lower and offsetting an Apple-infused tech rally.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose more than 5%, as it neared an unprecedented $1-trillion-dollar market-cap landmark after its second-quarter report beat estimates. Other tech heavyweights including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the day higher.
Monetary policy returned to focus in the late afternoon session as the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged and stuck largely to script, keeping market expectations for a September rate hike intact.
The Fed said it would continue to gradually raise rates should the economy continue to show ""sustained expansion,"" supported by a strong labor market and close-to-target inflation.
Plunging energy stocks continued to weighed on the broader market after data showed an unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles as imports increased and exports fell.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 04:18PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Insurtech firm wefox in talks with suitors including Softbank - sources,"By Eric Auchard and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Wefox, one of Europe's fastest-growing insurance technology firms, is close to settling on a new ""triple-digit million"" euro funding round, with Softbank's (T:9984) Vision Fund among the suitors, three sources familiar with the negotiations said.
One of the sources said Softbank would lead the new round in wefox by taking a substantial stake, while two others said there was competition from other lead investors, while declining to name them. 
Wefox aims to expand the insurance industry's reach by harnessing an emerging trend to use ""big data"" to provide more tailored coverage of, for example, taxi or food delivery workers on occasional shifts, or skiers spending a day on the slopes. 
Softbank's Vision Funds's big investments in firms like Uber or WeWork, leaders of the so-called ""gig economy"" mean that insurance acquisitions are particularly suited to its portfolio. Softbank founder Masayoshi Son has said he sees ""insurtech"" as a way to cross-sell to customers of his other companies.
Wefox declined to comment. Softbank Vision Fund declined to comment. Goldman Sachs (N:GS), which is advising wefox on its fundraising, did not returns calls seeking comment.
Little known outside the German-speaking world, wefox operates digital platforms that connect insurers, brokers and consumers, allowing them to buy insurance, change policies and settle claims as quickly as hailing a taxi online. 
    ""There are multiple bidding groups,"" said one person involved in the funding process. ""Basically, everything is sorted already. It's just the final people and pieces that need to come together.""
A second source said: ""Softbank invested a small amount in the previous round and now they want to pre-empt the next round with the Vision Fund. It's too early to tell... because it (the deal) is not sure yet."" 
The Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity investor and an arm of Japan's Softbank Group Corp (T:9984), has scooped up a string of insurance deals in the last year, ranging from major online Chinese insurance groups to an Indian price comparison site to Lemonade, a U.S.-based rival to wefox. 
A more ambitious move by Softbank to take a minority stake in reinsurance giant  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) worth as much as $8-10 billion foundered in May with no firm reason given.
COMPLICATIONS
A copyright lawsuit by Lemonade against wefox had been holding up the wefox funding round. The legal wrangling had put investment discussions on hold but executives of the two companies agreed to make peace this week.
After a meeting between the CEOs of the two companies wefox agreed to tackle the alleged copyright issues, the two executives said on their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles. Lemonade plans to drop the lawsuit once wefox makes the changes, the CEOs agreed.
With the legal cloud promising to lift, a third source told Reuters ""the company is indeed closing a round now. The process is open and there are many contenders. There's a lot of competition and there's a wide range of valuations.""
Founded in 2015, Wefox had raised $38.5 million to date.
Existing wefox investors include Target Global, SalesForce Ventures (N:CRM), Seedcamp and Idinvest and Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher's investment vehicle, Sound Ventures, according to the company. Softbank International, a separate arm of Softbank, also has a stake. 
So far, it operates in three markets - Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It will open in Spain this quarter and in five more European markets within six to eight months, wefox Co-Founder and Chief Executive Julian Teicke said in an interview.

In the fourth quarter, wefox also plans to introduce a global portal for insurance companies to develop and price products, then pitch them to wefox's growing base of 300,000 consumers, which has more than doubled in the last year. This will develop a three-sided marketplace connecting insurers, brokers and consumers, the company said.
The backbone of wefox's strategy is keep insurance brokers on side, by making them more efficient but also more profitable. 
Teicke cites data showing that 50 percent of policies are written by independent brokers, another 40 percent by in-house agents, with the remainder being sold directly to consumers via online sites.

""We want a very sustainable win-win-win type of model that serves the interests of brokers, customers and insurers,"" Teicke said in a phone interview.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:42PM ET</span>","EPA head wants car industry, states to compromise on emissions","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Acting U.S. EPA chief Andrew Wheeler told lawmakers on Wednesday he would welcome any deal between the auto industry and states like California that might result from a long-awaited Trump administration effort to roll back vehicle emission rules.
The Trump administration's proposal on vehicle fuel efficiency, which would roll back Obama-era standards, is expected to include plans to freeze tailpipe emissions limits at 2020 levels through 2026. It is also expected to revoke California's power to set state emissions rules that are tougher than the federal government's and mandate the purchase of electric vehicles. 
The proposal, by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation, will be released on Thursday, an administration official said on the condition of anonymity.
On the eve of the release, Wheeler told a U.S. Senate hearing that any deal between the auto industry and California and the 12 other states that follow its lead on emissions limits would be well received, as the parties digest the proposal and the EPA moves to issue a final rule.
""I would certainly welcome such a compromise,"" Wheeler said in his first congressional testimony since former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt resigned last month under a cloud of ethics controversies.
Wheeler's openness to a deal on fuel efficiency signals a more measured approach than Pruitt's to rolling back regulations, which could help ensure that changes will not be quickly reversed in the courts. Wheeler is a long-time Washington insider, while Pruitt was a former attorney general of Oklahoma who had sued the EPA many times before being appointed to run the agency.
The administration's proposal will contain a range of emissions cutting plans from a ""flat line"" approach on emissions levels to keeping the standards that former President Barack Obama had outlined, Wheeler said. The flat line, apparently referred to the freezing of the emissions requirements to 2020 levels. 
The proposal, which will undergo a public comment period before being finalized, is expected to intensify a legal battle between the EPA and California and the states that have adopted its emissions rules.
Eliminating California's electric vehicle mandate would also hurt automakers like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and General Motors Co (N:GM) that are investing billions of dollars in EVs.
Regulators forecast freezing national emissions standards after 2020 would increase U.S. fuel consumption by about 500,000 barrels of oil per day an government source said last month. Government regulators also estimate the regulation, which they name the Safer and Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles rule, will cut traffic deaths by reducing the cost of new vehicles with enhanced safety features.
A freeze would reduce the average fleet fuel economy standard from a current projected level of 46.8 miles per gallon in 2026 to 37 miles per gallon, according to an early draft of the proposal.
Democratic senators slammed the plans to freeze emissions limits and stop California from issuing separate standards, saying that it would kill technological incentives to make cars more efficient and raise fuel bills for consumers.
BIOFUEL REFORM
Senators from corn producing states also criticized Wheeler's agency over its handling of a waiver program from the nation’s biofuel laws for small refineries. The EPA, under Trump, has significantly increased the number of waivers, drawing criticism from farmers that the agency is undermining the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The controversial issue cuts across two of Trump’s core constituencies of farmers in the nation’s heartland and blue-collar workers at refineries. 
Wheeler pledged to bring more transparency to the program and consider ways to force larger refineries to blend higher volumes of biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool to make up for the gallons exempted at the smaller plants, but he said the agency may lack the authority.

He also said the agency is considering expanding sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, but was less emphatic than Trump, who told Iowa farmers last week that they were very close to introducing the new rule.

MUNICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) unveiled its new Vision 2020+ strategy on Wednesday - a move designed to boost the German engineering group's profitability in an era where sprawling conglomerates are increasingly unloved by investors.
The overhaul - which sees its five industrial divisions combined into three operating companies - is designed to simplify the trains to turbine company and make its structure leaner.
Under the changes, Siemens, which is due to report its latest earnings on Thursday, said it expects to increase the annual growth rate and profit margin of its industrial business by two percent over the medium term - defined as the next three to five years.
It also aims to increase its basic earnings per share at a faster rate.
Siemens said it would ramp up its investment in the internet of things, electric mobility and digitalization. An early sign of this came on Wednesday when it also announced it was buying U.S industrial software company mendix for 600 million euros ($700 million).
The changes come as large conglomerates have become increasingly unfashionable with investors who favor pure-play companies which have had better share price and sales growth over the last five years, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) noted in a recent report. Siemens' rivals like ABB (S:ABBN) have come under pressure from activist investors to spin off weaker performing units, while  General Electric  (N:GE) is reported to be seeking a buyer for its digital assets. Siemens's share price has gained 2.9 percent in the year to August 1, one third of the gain made by the Stoxx 600 Industrial Goods & Services Index (SXNP) 
Under the changes, Siemens will reorganize into three operating companies - ""Gas and Power"", ""Smart Infrastructure"" and ""Digital Industries"" – to give its individual businesses ""more entrepreneurial freedom,"" the company said.
The new units would work alongside Siemens' so-called ""Strategic Companies"" - Siemens Healthineers, Siemens Gamesa and the planned Siemens  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) train unit, where it has already reduced its ownership.
DIGITAL REVOLUTION
Under the new strategy, which replaces Siemens' Vision 2020 plan unveiled in 2014, the Munich-based company is targeting a higher profit from the current range of 11 to 12 percent.
""It would be irresponsible to rest on our laurels now. The speed and power of global changes are increasing, and it’s our obligation to anticipate them. We’re convinced that this is the right time to sustainably shape our future,"" Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement. 
The changes are designed to meet the digital revolution transforming industry and is Kaeser's last chance to significantly change the company before he steps down in 2021. 
The plan will go into effect from the start of Siemens' new financial year on Oct. 1 and aims to be completed by the end of March 2019. 
Siemens said its corporate headquarters functions would be leaner as a result of tasks being outsourced, but gave no details of job losses.
Workers at Siemens warned that staff must not bear the brunt of the revamp and should be offered reliable future employment prospects, Siemens labor boss Birgit Steinborn said in remarks emailed to Reuters. 
Juergen Kerner, a member of IG Metall union's executive board and Siemens' controlling panel, said workers will continue to resist any moves by Siemens to adopt a holding structure.

""For the workers at Siemens, it's important that the realignment will occur under the roof of Siemens AG,"" Kerner said. ""The filleting of companies with a broad portfolio is currently a popular game of the so-called financial markets but a company like Siemens can act by its own strength.""

The civil fine is for alleged origination and sale of residential mortgage loans that the lender knew contained misstated income information and did not meet the quality that Wells Fargo represented, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/wells-fargo-agrees-pay-209-billion-penalty-allegedly-misrepresenting-quality-loans-used on Wednesday.
""Today's agreement holds Wells Fargo responsible for originating and selling tens of thousands of loans that were packaged into securities and subsequently defaulted,"" said Alex Tse, acting U.S. attorney in San Francisco.
The loans in question included subprime and other relatively risky home loans.
""We are pleased to put behind us these legacy issues regarding claims related to residential mortgage-backed securities activities that occurred more than a decade ago,"" Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said.
The settlement amount was fully accrued as of June 30, the bank said.
This is the latest blow to the San Francisco-based bank as it tries to recover from a sales scandal that has hurt its results and tarnished its reputation.
In April, the company paid $1 billion in fines to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses.

Since the sales scandal surfaced about two years ago, the bank has overhauled management and replaced John Stumpf as CEO. It is also running campaigns to regain trust, including an ad saying Wells Fargo was established in 1852 and ""re-established"" in 2018.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:57PM ET</span>",Apple nears $1 trillion as bright forecast highlights future demand,"(Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) touched the $200 mark for the first time and neared a $1 trillion valuation on Wednesday, after the company forecast blowout current-quarter sales and analysts said a September launch of new iPhones set the stage for sustained growth.
The company's shares rose as much as 5.7 percent to a high of $201.32 in early trading - within striking distance of the $206.49 mark that will give it a trillion-dollar valuation. Including Wednesday's gains, the stock has risen 17.5 percent this year.
Apple forecast revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, beating the $59.6 billion analysts had expected, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The iPhone maker usually launches new mobile models in September, which includes a few days worth of sales in the fiscal fourth quarter.
This September, the company is widely expected to launch models sporting full screen iPhone X-like displays along with other upgrades.
""We believe Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones in September with possible lower price points, and greater segmentation could lead to YoY unit growth in C2019,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a client note.
At least four brokerages raised price targets on the stock. Independent Research continues to be the most bullish by raising its target by $6 to $226.
Apple's pricey iPhone X boosted third-quarter margins and created optimism that a new handset with premium features and priced higher than other models would boost margins further, analysts said.
""We think the lesson Apple's management has learned from the iPhone X is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1K you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
Apple sold 41.3 million iPhones in the fiscal third quarter, half a million less than expected. But the average iPhone selling price topped expectations by $30, hitting $724. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts raised their fourth-quarter iPhone shipment estimate by 3 percent to 48.3 million and increased the mobile average selling price to $720.
The company's other products also did well in the third quarter, including its app store and Apple music. Analysts also expect the company to soon unveil a video service, which could take on leading streaming services like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime. 
On a conference call on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook hinted at a content project run by two prominent television executives hired from Sony Corp (T:6758), without giving details.
""We are really happy to be working on something, we are just not ready to talk about it in depth today,"" Cook said. 
BTIG analysts said Apple is likely to build its way into the market rather than buy their way in.
Of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 26 have a ""buy"" or higher rating and 14 are on ""hold."" The median price was $210, pointing to a valuation of over $1 trillion.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>",U.S. new vehicle sales drop in July,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Wednesday reported lower U.S. new vehicle sales for July amid steep declines in passenger cars, except  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), which said its sales climbed 6 percent.
U.S. consumers have been shifting away from traditional passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks, which are also more profitable for automakers.
""Every year there is a clunker of a month,"" Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc (N:AN), the largest U.S. auto retail chain, told Reuters. ""I think July will be that month from a retail point of view.""
U.S. new vehicle sales rose in the first half of 2018, boosted in part by an overhaul of the tax system, but are expected to fall in the second half amid rising interest rates and a glut of cheaper, nearly-new used vehicles.
U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent last year after hitting a record high in 2017. Full-year 2018 sales are expected to be lower than last year's.
FCA's rise in July sales was due mostly to higher sales to consumers, above all a 15-percent jump in sales of its popular high-margin Jeep brand. 
Sales at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) slipped 3.1 percent for July. Ford's retail sales sank 10.4 percent, largely due to a 28 percent slump in passenger cars. 
But sales of Ford's high-margin pickup trucks jumped 10.2 percent.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said earlier this year it would gradually cease production of most passenger cars in the United States. On a conference call, U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said Ford had ended production of its Focus sedan and was winding down output of the Fiesta.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported an overall drop in sales of 6 percent for the month, with U.S. passenger car sales down 16.5 percent and pickup truck and SUV sales up 2.2 percent. 
Earlier this year, General Motors Co (N:GM) stopped reporting monthly sales and switched to reporting them quarterly. The No. 1 U.S. automaker's sales were expected to be down slightly over 2 percent for July.
At Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), vehicle sales fell 15.2 percent in July. Passenger car sales were down 21.1 percent, SUV and pickup truck sales fell 10.6 percent.
Nissan ""experienced some challenges"" in July, but made progress towards ""sustainable retail growth,"" said Billy Hayes, the automaker's vice president for regional operations in North America. 
Nissan has worked to smooth its transition to the 2019 model year so it does not end up stuck with old models and has worked to reduce its inventory, Hayes said.
""It seems like it (July) was tough across the board, across the industry,"" Hayes said. ""It seemed to impact us all."" 
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267)'s July sales were down 8.2 percent. Its passenger car sales were off 19.3 percent, while sales of its SUVs rose 3.2 percent.
Ford shares dipped 0.8 percent in morning trading, while FCA's shares fell 1.4 percent.
Last week, Detroit's automakers warned that mounting U.S. and Chinese tariffs would hurt their results in 2018.
U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week after meeting with European Union officials to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers, easing the threat of a transatlantic trade war.
But the possibility that Trump might reverse course impose broader tariffs is still a cause for concern in the industry. 
""The whole trade war and tariffs are deeply unsettling from an economic point of view, AutoNation CEO Jackson said. ""The threats of tariffs on motor vehicles is a great concern."" 

""It will make the other tariffs look like a company picnic.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Wednesday it has tapped a former Trump administration economic and trade adviser to head its public policy efforts.
The largest U.S. automaker said it hired Everett Eissenstat, who was until recently a senior White House aide on economic and trade issues, as its new senior vice president for global public policy. The 55-year-old Oklahoma native will report to Chief Executive Mary Barra.
Eissenstat's ""broad experience interacting at the highest levels of government, both within the U.S. and globally, and his track record for partnering and building relationships on both sides of the aisle make him a perfect fit to represent GM,"" Barra said in a statement. 
    Eissenstat, who could not be reached for comment, was a deputy assistant to the U.S. president on international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council until July 6. 
He worked for the U.S. trade representative during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama and was a key adviser to the Republican Trump administration on Chinese trade issues.
""He is a true believer in free trade and the benefits free trade brings to our economy,"" Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican, said in a speech in July 2017, speaking about Eissenstat. ""The administration and the country are lucky to have such an important asset.""
Ongoing talks with Mexico and Canada to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could have a deep financial impact on GM, as could other trade disputes between the United States and China and the European Union.
Last week, GM blamed higher steel and aluminum costs for a 2018 profit forecast reduction, citing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. 
GM buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, which have raised prices in reaction to the tariffs on imported steel.
In June, GM said it would go ahead with its plan to manufacture the new Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico, despite Trump's criticisms of U.S. companies making vehicles abroad.

The Detroit automaker also faces concerns about the potential impact from trade worries on pickup trucks it builds in Mexico. In June, GM warned that imposing tariffs on imported cars and parts of up to 25 percent could lead to a ""smaller GM.""

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo finds efficiency target elusive as revenue slips,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - With  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) revenue slumping and no clear end in sight for sales scandal-related costs, analysts have pushed back predictions for when the bank's closely watched efficiency ratio will return to pre-scandal levels. 
The fourth-largest U.S. bank booked hundreds of millions of dollars in fresh customer remediation and rebate costs in the second quarter, fueling worries about lingering scandal-related fallout.
Wall Street has been pressuring Wells Fargo to deliver more revenue to the bottom line for over two years. That ramped up once the bank landed in regulatory and reputational trouble over sales practices, and management responded with hard cost-cutting goals. 
But Wells Fargo has faced more challenges since, with businesses like mortgage lending shrinking and the Federal Reserve imposing an asset cap until the bank proves governance and controls have improved.
It is also no longer receiving revenue from some products it missold as recently as last year, like add-on insurance. 
As a result, analysts say it may take until 2020 for Wells Fargo to get its efficiency ratio within the 55 percent to 59 percent range Chief Executive Tim Sloan has pledged to hit. It has not reported a ratio below 60 percent since September 2016.
That metric, which measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, was 66.7 percent at Wells Fargo during the first half of the year. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) efficiency ratio was 57.6 percent.
Two-thirds of the analysts who updated estimates since second-quarter results now see the ratio staying at or above 60 percent through 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. Prior to earnings, the consensus for the ratio was 59.5 percent.
""It's dragging on longer that what people originally expected,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, referencing costs associated with the bank's past wrongdoings.
Sanders did not change estimates much after the second-quarter report but said his models were more conservative than other research houses. 
Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank in the world by market value, as investors rewarded the company for its perceived profitability and growth potential. 
But revelations about millions of customers getting locked into unnecessary products has forced investors to rethink how they value the stock, which has lagged rivals since September 2016. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2M6C0rP)
The bank pledged to shut 800 branches by 2020, and has cut 4,600 employees from its payroll since 2016. The efforts are part of Sloan's goal to slash $4 billion from annual expenses by next year.
While executives reiterated that pledge in recent weeks, they have declined to provide a near-term efficiency ratio target. 
Management initially expected to approach 59 percent by the end of 2018, but said in April actions to comply with the Fed's consent order would delay progress.
Analysts say it could take more than a year to get there, given the business pressures and scandal costs.

""It's not an outrageous target,"" said Sanders, of Edward Jones. ""They do have lot of levers to pull on in terms of squeezing costs out of the business.""

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Judge orders further extension of aid to Puerto Rico storm evacuees,"By Nate Raymond
WORCESTER, Mass. (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday extended until Aug. 31 an order preventing the eviction of hundreds of Puerto Rican families who fled the hurricane-ravaged island in 2017 and have been living in hotels and motels across the United States.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman in Worcester, Massachusetts, issued the order after hearing arguments over whether he should issue a longer-term injunction barring the federal government from cutting off housing assistance to people who were forced to leave their homes because of Hurricane Maria.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had planned to end the assistance program on June 30. Hillman's decision on Wednesday extended a previously-imposed temporary restraining order that allowed the families to remain in hotels until checkout time on Aug. 7.
Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 with winds close to 150 miles per hour (240 kph), causing an estimated $90 billion in damage to the already economically struggling U.S. territory.
According to FEMA, 1,041 families displaced by Maria are currently receiving aid under a program in which they were provided a voucher to seek hotel lodging. In total, the Maria assistance program has since its launch helped 7,032 families, the agency said. 
Four Puerto Ricans, including one residing in Massachusetts, are pursuing a proposed class action lawsuit, which was filed on June 30 and contends that FEMA's actions would violate their due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
Their lawsuit contends that FEMA is seeking to prematurely stop providing assistance to Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria whose homes remain uninhabitable due to the worst natural disaster to hit the island in a century.

Critics on the island have said in the weeks after the storm that federal agencies responded poorly to the disaster. They argued that President Donald Trump's administration viewed Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens, a claim it denies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday unveiled proposed regulations governing the repatriation of more than $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate foreign income, a move experts see as a vital step in returning the money to U.S. soil.
The 2017 Republican tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in December allows major corporations, which have been stockpiling income abroad for decades, to repatriate the money at special low-interest rates of 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents and 8 percent on illiquid assets.
Trump and Republicans view the capital's return as an important stimulus to economic and job growth, while Democrats predict much of the money will be used instead to repurchase shares and declare lucrative dividends for shareholders. 
But only now have regulators at Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service begun to set down rules on how companies should apply the new law to their overseas holdings.
""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates a historic opportunity for American companies to bring capital back home from overseas to invest in our domestic economy and create jobs,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. 
""Our administration's policies are focused on creating a more competitive system for business,"" he added. 
Experts say Wednesday's proposed rule is only the first in an expected series of Treasury guidance needed to clarify the new tax law's international provisions before U.S.-based multinational corporations can undertake major investment decisions with the money. 
Some analysts have also warned that the Trump administration could leave in place a loophole allowing corporations to dodge billions of dollars in taxes.
Before the new law took effect, corporations with household names like Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Google (O:GOOGL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) were required to pay a domestic tax rate of up to 35 percent, less credit for foreign tax payments, on foreign income brought back to the United States.
But they could defer their tax bills so long as the money remained abroad. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed the domestic tax rate to 21 percent, allowed corporations to pay the two lower rates on repatriated foreign income over an eight-year period and did away with U.S. tax on most foreign income going forward.

LONDON (LPC) - General Electric’s Distributed Power business is set to launch a US$2.2bn-equivalent all-loan financing backing its buyout by Advent after the summer, banking sources said on Wednesday. 
The private equity firm has mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Jefferies to arrange the deal.
The debt will comprise first and second-lien facilities in both euros and dollars. Other banks are expected to join the deal shortly, the sources said. 
The deal backs Advent’s US$3.25bn carve-out of General Electric’s Distributed Power division which was announced in June. The sale is expected to be closed in the fourth quarter. 
The business is forecast to have Ebitda of nearly US$290m for 2018, according to Reuters, after posting revenues of US$1.317bn last year.
Ebitda of US$290m would bring nominal leverage for the deal to over seven times that figure.
The division includes the Jenbacher and Waukesha gas engine brands and manufacturing sites in North America and Austria.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) announced a corporate shake-up and divestment strategy after posting weak profits and calls to be broken up.
The three-year plan will see the company exiting about US$20bn in industrial assets. General Electric hopes to book as much as US$10bn of sales proceeds this year.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Humana eyes stronger ties with Walmart despite Walgreens partnership,"By Tamara Mathias and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) -  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) said it was looking to expand its tie-up with Walmart (N:WMT), easing concerns that the insurer's agreement with drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA) would prevent it from broadening its partnership with the retailer.
Humana's shares rose about 4 percent to a record high of $326.97 after Chief Executive Bruce Broussard's comments on a call discussing the company's better-than-expected earnings.
""We still value and have a strong relationship with Walmart,"" Broussard said, adding that the insurer is looking at ways to expand the partnership.
Walmart currently has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores. The partnership offers a prescription drug plan that can save up to 20 percent in drug costs for customers.
In June, the insurer announced it would partner with Walgreens, with its unit operating senior-focused primary care clinics inside two Walgreens stores in Kansas, a move some analysts said at the time ended any speculation over a deal with Walmart.
Reuters reported in March that Walmart was in early talks with Humana about developing closer ties, with a possible acquisition on the table.
""Both of them (ties to Walmart and Walgreens) are complementary,"" Broussard said, adding partnering with one does not restrict the other deal.
Unlike its rivals, Humana has said it will focus on partnerships and smaller deals while cementing its dominance in the Medicare Advantage business, which powered a better-than- expected second quarter profit.
Humana, in the past few months, has joined hands with private equity firms to buy health care services companies, creating the largest hospice operator in the United States.
RAISES FORECAST
Humana also raised its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to about $14.15 per share from its previous forecast of $13.70 to $14.10 per share.
The company's adjusted consolidated benefit ratio, the percentage of premiums spent on claims, deteriorated to 84.3 percent in the quarter, missing consensus estimate of 83.9 percent according to brokerage Evercore ISI.
Over the past few quarters, insurers have kept a tight leash on medical costs and even a slight slip has weighed on stocks.
Earlier this month, the largest U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH) reported quarterly medical costs slightly higher than expected, overshadowing a second quarter profit beat.
Excluding items, Humana earned $3.96 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $3.77, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $14.26 billion, above the average estimate of $14.16 billion.

Apple stock rose about 5% at 11:45 AM ET (15:45 GMT) after reporting strong numbers postmarket Tuesday. That also put the company in touching distance of becoming the first to hit $1 trillion in market cap.
Based on the number of shares outstanding at the end of the last quarter, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have to hit $206.49 to make the milestone.
Apple’s fiscal third-quarter results beat on the top and bottom lines, driven by sales of the pricier iPhone X and subscription revenue to services such as Apple Music and its App Store.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk last month landed a deal to build the company's first plant outside the United States that would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.
""We expect some funding to be from China investors, but expect international (including the U.S.) funding to be needed too,"" CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and analysts predict that electric vehicle sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as government regulations aimed at having 100 percent electric vehicles by 2030 roll out.
For Tesla, which is rapidly burning cash and struggling to turn a profit, China is a key market. The country accounted for about 17 percent of its total revenue last year.
""In the long run, China will be the most important car market for Tesla by far where the company will earn more than a third of its money,"" NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said.
""A plant in China is the best way to avoid high tariffs. It's a kind of natural hedging.""
However, following Tesla's announcement of building the Shanghai factory, analysts questioned the money-losing company's ability to get the capital required to build and staff such a large plant.
Musk in the past has said Tesla would be profitable in the second half of the year and would not have to raise any money from investors.
In contrast, Wall Street had been speculating that Tesla would need to return to capital markets this year to raise more funds as it ramps up production of its Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to the company's long-term profitability.

Tesla is due to report its second-quarter results after market closes on Wednesday.

""Klaus Schaefer has informed the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Bernhard Reutersberg, that he is suffering from cancer and that the treatment will take several months,"" Uniper said in a statement on Wednesday.
Uniper's supervisory and management boards will now arrange how to divide up Schaefer's duties during his absence, the company said in a short statement.
Schaefer, 51, has been CEO since Jan 1, 2016, when the company began operating as a separate unit of E.ON (DE:EONGn). 
He has vowed to defend the energy group's independence, after Finnish rival  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM) agreed a 3.8 billion euro deal to buy around 47 percent of Uniper from E.ON.
His opposition to the deal had prompted activist investor Elliott to try to launch a probe into whether managers had actively worked to obstruct the sale. A vote on the motion was delayed in June, leaving the fate of Uniper management in Fortum's hands. 
Fortum said last month that it was seeking to reset its relationship with Uniper.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nissan close to settling dispute with India over unpaid incentives,"By Aditi Shah and Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and authorities in an Indian state are close to settling a dispute over which the Japanese carmaker initiated international arbitration seeking more than $729 million in unpaid dues and damages, sources told Reuters.
Under the proposed settlement, which could be finalised as early as this week, Nissan would take a lower payout of about 20 billion rupees ($292 million) in unpaid dues and forego sums it has sought in damages, two sources aware of the matter said.
The resolution would be a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election next year and has spent the last four years trying to transform India's image as a business-friendly nation.
Nissan sent a legal notice to the Modi government in 2016 seeking payment of incentives it said it was due from the government of Tamil Nadu as part of a 2008 agreement to set up a car manufacturing plant in the southern state.
The carmaker, in its notice, had claimed 29 billion rupees ($423 million) in unpaid incentives and 21 billion rupees ($306 million) in damages, plus interest and other costs. 
The Tamil Nadu government has since paid some money and now owes Nissan about 20 billion rupees in unpaid incentives, one of the sources said.
According to the proposal the two sides are close to agreement on, the state would pay the automaker 3 billion rupees upfront once the deal was signed, with the remainder paid by the end of 2019 in 10 installments, the sources said.
Nissan would drop the arbitration case against India once the settlement was agreed, the sources said.
The proposal has been drawn up by state government officials and Nissan India executives and needs to be approved by Tamil Nadu's chief minister and the carmaker's executives in Japan before it is finalised, one of the sources said.
M. C. Sampath, Tamil Nadu's industries minister, confirmed the state was in advanced talks with Nissan. 
""A final decision on this matter will be taken soon, there is a conducive environment that prevails between the two parties now,"" he said, without commenting on the detail of the proposal.
""Nissan continues to work with the government to resolve this matter,"" a company spokesman said in a statement, without commenting on the detail of the proposal. 
The Prime Minister's Office also did not respond to a request for comment.
""DETROIT OF SOUTH ASIA""
Nissan, which has less than a 2 percent share of India's passenger vehicle market, builds and sells the Micra hatchback, Sunny sedan and Terrano sport-utility vehicle in the country. It also sells budget cars under its Datsun brand. 
In 2008, when the Japanese carmaker and its French global alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) agreed to invest in a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives, including some tax refunds.
Over seven years, Nissan and Renault spent 61 billion rupees setting up a plant with an annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles, which entitled them to receive the incentives in 2015, according to the legal notice.
Several other automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), have production hubs in Tamil Nadu, giving state capital Chennai the nickname the ""Detroit of South Asia"".
The Nissan case, covered by a bilateral trade and investment agreement between New Delhi and Tokyo, is one of more than 20 international arbitration proceedings brought by investors against India, among the highest against any single nation.
Companies including  Vodafone  Group (L:VOD),  Cairn Energy  (L:CNE) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) have initiated arbitration seeking to protect their investments against retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts.
India last year canceled investment treaties with about 50 foreign governments, making it harder for investors to seek international arbitration for disputes, sources have told Reuters.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>","Sanofi, Novartis latest to stockpile drugs in case of no-deal Brexit","PARIS/ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) said on Wednesday they planned to increase stockpiles of medicines Britain in preparation for potential disruption if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal.
The move follows similar action by AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which said last month it would increase stockpiles of drugs that could be affected by Brexit by around 20 percent.
Roche (S:ROG), the world's biggest maker of cancer medicines, also said it was taking ""appropriate action"" to review its stock levels in order to protect supplies to patients.
Britain's largest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), said last week it was taking steps to secure the supply of its medicines and vaccines ahead of the UK's departure from the EU, without going into details.
Supplies of thousands of medicines are at risk of disruption if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, forcing manufacturers to prepare duplicate product testing and licensing arrangements to ensure their drugs stay on the market.
More than 2,600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the UK to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.
Leading drugmakers have long been vocal in their concerns about Brexit and the need for the pharmaceuticals sector to stay within the European regulatory system.
British lawmakers have also called for an agreement that allows the country to have continued participation in the European medicines regulatory framework, but it remains unclear how this will play out in the broader EU negotiations.
Sanofi said it was confident its stockpiling measures would ensure British patients had access to its treatments after Britain leaves the EU, regardless of whether a deal over its future relations with the bloc is in place.
""The uncertainty in the Brexit negotiations means that Sanofi has always been planning for a no deal scenario,"" a spokesman with the French drugmaker said in an emailed statement.
""We have made arrangements for additional warehouse capacity in order to stockpile our products in the UK and increase UK-based resources to prepare for any changes to customs or regulatory processes.""
Novartis said it planned to hold increased inventories in Britain across its portfolio of medicines from both Novartis itself and Sandoz, the Swiss company's generic drugs division.
""We have apprised officials and ministers of our preparedness plans and status, including plans to increase our UK inventory holding,"" Novartis said.

The European Medicines Agency has warned drugmakers they needed to be ready for a possible hard Brexit in 2019. It has also expressed ""serious concerns"" over the availability of some 108 medicines that are manufactured exclusively in the UK.

1668,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. Boost in Long-Term Debt Sales Sends 10-Year Yield Above 3%,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department will raise the amount of long-term debt it sells to $78 billion this quarter while launching a new two-month bill. It also will lean more heavily on maturities out to five years.
In its quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, the Treasury boosted the auction sizes of coupon-bearing and floating-rate debt from $73 billion the previous quarter. It was the third consecutive quarterly increase, as President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies widen the nation’s budget deficit.
The Treasury will sell $34 billion in three-year notes on Aug. 7, compared with $33 billion it sold last month and $31 billion in May. The government increased to $26 billion the sale of 10-year notes to be auctioned on Aug. 8, from $25 billion last quarter, and the 30-year bonds to be sold on Aug. 9 to $18 billion from $17 billion in May, Treasury said. The sales will raise new cash of $39.8 billion.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3 percent for the first time since June 13 in the wake of the refunding announcement. The yield curve from 5 to 30 years steepened on the announcement, with the spread rising to 25.2 basis points.
The department will start sales of a new two-month bill in October. This security will settle on Tuesdays rather than Thursdays.
Other Maturities
The Treasury also said in the statement it plans to boost auction sizes of all other maturities over the coming quarter. Treasury will boost the size of its two-, three- and five-year notes by $1 billion per month over the quarter, while increasing the floating two-year auction by $1 billion in August. The department will raise the size of its seven-, 10- and 30-year notes by $1 billion in August, holding auction sizes at that level through October. The changes will result in an additional $30 billion of new issuance.
The department again left unchanged the size of inflation-linked securities, or TIPS. Treasury is studying whether to introduce a second new five-year TIPS to its auction calendar. The department is still analyzing potential additions and expects to make an announcement in November.
Given seasonal patterns, “bill supply is anticipated to gradually increase,” Treasury said. “This increased bill supply will include the launch of the new benchmark 2-month bill in October.” The department said it will meet any unexpected change in financing needs with increased bill sales.
The Treasury’s borrowing needs in the second half of the year will be the most since the financial crisis a decade ago, with the Treasury expecting to issue $769 billion in net marketable debt, the department said Monday. That compares with $1.1 trillion in July-December 2008, when America was in the midst of its worst recession in generations.
Budget Shortfall
Tax cuts, higher government spending and an aging population are expected to push the federal budget shortfall to $804 billion in the current fiscal year, with the deficit exceeding $1 trillion in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit totaled $607 billion in the first nine months of the 2018 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, compared with $523 billion from the same period a year earlier.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said repeatedly that corporate and individual tax cuts will fuel faster economic growth that will boost tax revenue and shrink the deficit. Gross domestic product accelerated in the second quarter to the fastest pace since 2014, though many economists say the expansion will moderate in coming quarters and years.

(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) on Wednesday topped analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, helped by surprise growth in wireless subscribers in a competitive U.S. wireless market.
The fourth-largest U.S. wireless carrier is working to merge with T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), in order to combine resources to build the next-generation wireless network, or 5G.
Sprint reported a net 87,000 new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the first quarter, more than double the average analyst estimate of 40,000 additions, according to research firm FactSet.
Shares of the Kansas-based company, which have fallen 9.8 percent this year, rose 2.6 percent to $5.57 before the bell.
Net income attributable to Sprint fell to $176 million, or 4 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $206 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts expected the company to break even on a per-share basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 1.55 percent during the quarter, up from 1.5 percent a year earlier. 
In a bid to become the first company to bring 5G technology to major U.S. cities, Sprint has been targeting a first half 2019 launch in at least eight cities, including New York City and Kansas City.

Total operating revenue fell to $8.13 billion from $8.16 billion a year earlier.

WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) warned that a shortage of engineers is hampering efforts to get its cars to meet new anti-pollution rules, clouding its sales outlook and overshadowing a forecast-beating 23 percent rise in underlying operating profit.
VW has seen a raft of engine experts depart since admitting to systematic emissions cheating in Sept. 2015. That has left the carmaker short of engineers now needed to work on models complying with stricter emissions tests, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on Wednesday.
""Engine development expertise has been lost,"" said Diess, explaining that getting engines certified for road use has become a lot harder under a new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure, known as WLTP, that takes effect from September.
The carmaker last week poached BMW engine development expert Markus Duesmann to help overcome the problem, but warned that delays in getting road certification will result in bottlenecks for certain model variants between August and October.
""That impacts capacity utilization at our plants, so there will be closure days at our sites during this period,"" Diess said. Although VW is sticking to its delivery targets, meeting them will be hard.
""One thing is clear, though: this will be a titanic task for the second half of the year, particularly on the margin side,"" said Diess, who was promoted to the top job in April after running the VW brand.
In a press conference on Wednesday to discuss second-quarterresults, Diess said the changeover to the WLTP testprocedure poses, ""The biggest volume and earnings risk forVolkswagen.""
Volkswagen shares were down 1.3 percent at 1145 GMT.
The introduction of WLTP rules was accelerated in the wake of Volkswagen's diesel cheating. Regulators now take a much more granular look at vehicles and test car pollution levels much more comprehensively, Diess said.
""They look at what kind of tyres were fitted and whether the air conditioning is switched on,"" Diess explained. In June, VW warned that production of up to 250,000 cars will be delayed because of WLTP and said last month it would
be renting parking spaces to stockpile vehicles that cannot be sold.
DIESELGATE COST
Rival carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) cut their outlooks citing the introduction of new stringent emissions standards and a slowdown in growth as a trade war and tariffs hamper global trade.
Automakers General Motors Co (N:GM), Ford Motor (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) lowered their full-year profit forecasts last week due to escalating tariffs.
Although its sales have held up, Volkswagen is still suffering the financial consequences of the ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal almost three years since it broke.
The scandal has cost the carmaker 27.4 billion euros so far and second-quarter earnings took a 1.6 billion euros hit to cover a fine and legal expenses, it said.
A 5.5 percent rise in vehicle sales helped lift second-quarter operating profit before special items to 5.58 billion euros from 4.55 billion a year-earlier, compared with analyst consensus for 4.98 billion in a Reuters poll.
After special items, group operating profit dropped by 13 percent to 3.95 billion euros.
""These are solid numbers despite the legal expenses,"" NordLB analyst Frank Schwope, who has a ""Buy"" rating on VW, said on Wednesday.
Despite confirming its outlook for a full-year adjusted operating margin of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent, Volkswagen warned that sticking to its financial targets will be a challenge.
After special items, VW said it anticipates that its operating return on sales will fall ""moderately short.""

In the wake of its emissions scandal, Volkswagen accelerated a push to expand its portfolio of electric cars. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said it could start serial production of solid-state battery cells from 2024 or 2025. ""We must not make ourselves dependent on a few Asian manufacturers in the long term,"" Diess said, explaining that advances in ceramic separators had raised the viability of mass production. A solid state battery factory would likely be in Europe, or even in Germany under the right conditions, Diess said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell and the dollar strengthened on Wednesday due to fears of an imminent escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war, although strong corporate earnings eased investor concerns about a recent sell-off in the tech sector.
Solid earnings and better-than-expected economic data looked poised to lift European shares on Wednesday but the Stoxx 600 declined, dragged down by autos and miners, as tensions over trade rose again between the world's two largest economies.
The United States is reportedly considering more than doubling its planned tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to pressure Beijing into making trade concessions.
This came just hours after European stocks were cheered by a report that the United States and China were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs.
Renewed concern about what a full-blown conflict would mean for China and the global economy weighed on Chinese shares, the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar.
Wednesday's reaction remained fairly muted, however, as investors turned their attention to central bank decisions.
""Maybe the market is underestimating the economic impacts of the tariffs and that is why it is keeping calm,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currencies strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday and markets are preparing for the Fed policy statement for signs of whether the expected two rate hikes for the remainder of 2018 can be cemented into pricing.
""Buying sentiment towards the dollar could receive a boost if the central bank strikes a hawkish tone,"" Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, wrote in a note.
At 1130 GMT, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 94.570.
APPLE SUPPORT
Stronger than expected earnings by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pushed quarterly results beyond Wall Street targets on Tuesday, allaying some concerns about a tech sector shaken by recent sell-offs in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB),  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The tech retreat has overshadowed a generally buoyant U.S. earnings season, with average 22.6 percent profit growth and 83 percent of companies beating consensus estimates so far.
World stocks in July recorded their best monthly returns since January, despite trade tensions, growth fears and tech selling.
European shares were down across the board as worries about the U.S.-China trade conflict undermined a fresh batch of positive corporate earnings.
The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.4 percent while Germany's DAX slipped 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 tumbled 1.3 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 0.1 percent.
Investors fear a trade war between Washington and Beijing could hit global growth, and prominent U.S. business groups have condemned Trump's aggressive tariffs.
YEN DOWN
The yen continued to depreciate, falling 0.2 percent versus the dollar to 112.13 as Tuesday's pledge by the Bank of Japan to keep rates extremely low for an extended period continued to weigh on the Japanese currency.
BOJ's policy announcement on Tuesday to make its massive stimulus programme more flexible provided some comfort to bond investors.
Traders appeared to be putting the BOJ's tolerance for higher yields to the test on Wednesday as the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to 0.12 percent in its biggest one-day rise in two years.
""Since the BOJ was vague about what its flexibility means, the market wants to test the bank's pain threshold,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea in Helsinki.
In Britain, a 25 basis-point hike is now widely expected on Thursday when the Bank of England meets, despite economic weakness linked to Britain's looming European Union exit.
The pound held at $1.3138, rising away from a more than 10-month trough of $1.2955 touched earlier in July.
In commodities, oil prices fell on industry data showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles. The slump in crude prices comes after their largest monthly decline in two years in July.
U.S. crude dipped 0.8 percent to $67.98 a barrel, while Brent gave up 1.4 percent to $73.2 per barrel.

Spot gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,222.99 per ounce.
