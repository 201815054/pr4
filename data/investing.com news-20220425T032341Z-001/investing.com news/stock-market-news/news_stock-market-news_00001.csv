SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal judge has ruled that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's 2018 tweets about having secured financing to take the company private were false, according to court filings by Tesla investors suing the billionaire over the tweets.
The filing said that the court ruled April 1 that Musk's 2018 tweets were ""false and misleading."" The court ""held that he recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity,"" it said.
Investors in the electric car maker asked in the filing, submitted on Friday, for U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen to block the celebrity entrepreneur from his ""public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative regarding"" his 2018 tweets.
Musk on Thursday claimed that funding actually had been secured to take Tesla private in 2018. He settled with U.S. securities regulators over what the agency found to be false statements, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them. 
That April 1 decision was not listed on the court docket.
The issues will be at the center of a May jury trial in which the investors are seeking damages over the tweets. 
Musk ""has used his fame and notoriety to sway public opinion in his favor, waging battle in the press having been defeated in the courtroom,"" the filing said. 
Musk’s latest comments risk confusing potential jurors and prejudicing a jury decision on the amount of damages owed by Musk, it said. 
Musk is trying to nullify his settlement with the SEC, accusing the agency of harassing him with investigations. 

Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla, on Saturday again asserted that it was true that Musk was considering taking Tesla private in 2018 and had financing for that move. “All that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light, all to the detriment of free speech,” he said. 
The case is In re Tesla Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-04865.

Bild am Sonntag, in an interview published on Sunday, asked her to name the key points of a planned sixth round of sanctions.
""We are looking further at the banking sector, especially Sberbank, which accounts for 37% of the Russian banking sector. And, of course, there are energy issues,"" she said. 
The EU has so far spared Russia's largest bank from previous sanctions rounds because it, along with Gazprombank, is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries have been buying despite the conflict in Ukraine.
She also said that the EU was working on ""clever mechanisms"" so that oil could also be included in the next sanctions.

""What should not happen is that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin collects even higher prices on other markets for supplies that would otherwise go to the EU,"" she was quoted as saying.
""The top priority is to shrink Putin's revenues,"" she said.

Deripaska, founder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal, has been sanctioned by the United States, European Union and Britain. He has previously called for peace.
A Reuters witness saw the 73-metre (239.5 foot) yacht Clio arrive off the coast of Gocek in the Aegean coastal province of Mugla on Saturday. The Cayman Islands-flagged vessel remains in a bay off Gocek.
The arrival of Clio in Turkish waters comes after two superyachts linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who made a surprise appearance at Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Istanbul this month, docked in Turkish ports.
World governments are seeking to isolate President Vladimir Putin and his allies over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"".
NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and mediates in the conflict. It has supported Kyiv, but also opposed sanctions on Moscow, including measures against Russian billionaires.

Ankara relies heavily on Russian energy imports and tourists and has emerged as a safe haven for Russians fleeing sanctions, and many have invested in Turkish property.
On Friday, a Ukrainian diplomat said Ukraine is working with Turkey for more support and understands - though it is not happy with - the reality of Ankara's parallel ties to Moscow.

5,By CNBC,2022-04-16T21:47:15+0000,"Elon Musk ‘funding secured’ tweets ruled false, new court filing suggests","In a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit.The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so.Tesla's stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized.The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.Damages from the shareholders' class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class.The shareholders' attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter — in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted.This information was revealed in a request the shareholders' lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14.The request for the temporary restraining order alludes to an earlier ruling by Judge Chen that is currently under seal because it refers to evidence that Musk's team regarded as confidential. ""We anticipate the order will be published soon,"" Adam Apton of Levi & Korsinsky, lead counsel for the class of Tesla shareholders, told CNBC by email.At the TED conference on Thursday, Musk called financial regulators in the SEC's San Francisco office ""bastards.""Musk also said, ""The SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that's like having a gun to your child's head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.""It's not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time.Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion.Musk's attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: ""Nothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that's left some half decade later is random plaintiffs' lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech."" Spiro gave the same statement to Bloomberg, which first reported on new developments in the shareholders' class action.A trial date is currently set for May 31, 2022, in a San Francisco federal court, but that could change.Levi & Korsinsky's Apton told CNBC, ""We look forward to proving the rest of our case at trial and recovering damages on behalf of the class."""

The company also said it will not apply to list its shares on any other stock exchange before the delisting of its American Depositary Shares from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was complete. 
It added that it will continue to explore appropriate measures that include exploring a potential listing on another internationally recognized exchange, it said. 
Didi announced in December that it would delist from the NYSE and pursue a listing in Hong Kong after it ran foul of Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO last year.
Chinese regulators had urged the firm to put its listing on hold while a cybersecurity review of its data practices was conducted, sources have told Reuters. 
Days after it went ahead, the country's powerful cyberspace watchdog ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi and told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.
China's securities regulator, in a statement noting Didi's Saturday announcement, said the decision was one that the company had made independently and had nothing to do with other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks or ongoing efforts between Chinese regulators and their U.S. counterparts to resolve an audit dispute affecting U.S.-listed Chinese firms.

Didi's total revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021 fell to 40.8 billion yuan ($6.40 billion) from 46.7 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a separate statement also issued on Saturday.

8,By CryptoGlobe,16 Apr 2022,$USDC: World’s Largest Asset Manager With $9.5 Trillion AUM Interested in USD Coin,"
NYC-based BlackRock Inc., which is the world’s top asset management firm with around $9.5 trillion in total assets under management (AUM) as of 30 September 2021 according to ADV Ratings, has invested in stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial Ltd.
On 26 September 2018, Circle announced that 26 September 2018 announced that it was launching its “USD Coin” ($USDC for short), which is a regulated fully collateralized dollar-backed cryptocurrency that was originally announced on 16 May 2018. This stablecoin is based on an open source fiat stablecoin framework developed and governed by the CENTRE project. Circle said back then that “individuals and institutions” could enroll its dollar tokenization service to “deposit US dollars from bank accounts, convert those dollars into tokens usable everywhere the internet reaches (subject to the token’s compliance controls), and redeem USDC tokens and cash out to bank accounts.”
In a press release issued on April 12, Circle said that it had “entered into an agreement for a $400M funding round with investments from BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP and Fin Capital” and that “the funding round is expected to close in the second quarter.”









The press release went on to say that “in addition to its corporate strategic investment and role as a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves, BlackRock has entered into a broader strategic partnership with Circle, which includes exploring capital market applications for USDC.” It also mentioned that this new funding “promotes Circle’s continued strategic growth as demand for dollar digital currency and related financial services continues to scale globally.”
Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder and CEO of Circle, had this to say about this new partnership:
“USDC is one of the fastest growing dollar digital currencies with over $50 billion in circulation. Dollar digital currencies like USDC are fueling a global economic transformation, and Circle’s technology infrastructure sits at the center of that change. This funding round will drive the next evolution of Circle’s growth… It’s particularly gratifying to add BlackRock as a strategic investor in the company. We look forward to developing our partnership.“

9,By Reuters,"<span>17 hours ago (Apr 16, 2022 05:45AM ET)</span>","Omicron-specific Sinopharm, Sinovac COVID vaccine candidates cleared for clinical trial","BEIJING (Reuters) -COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by a Sinopharm subsidiary and Sinovac Biotech to target the Omicron variant were approved for clinical trials in Hong Kong, the companies said on Saturday. 
Scientists worldwide are racing to study upgraded injections against Omicron, as data indicated that antibodies elicited by vaccines based on older strains show weaker activity to neutralise the highly transmissible variant. 
The two candidates from units of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one from Sinovac contain inactivated or ""killed"" coronavirus and are similar to vaccines that the companies are supplying in China and overseas, the companies said in statements.
The Sinopharm candidates will be tested as boosters in adults who have already received two or three vaccine doses, CNBG said. It did not specify which vaccine products the trial participants would have received before taking the experimental booster, or how many subjects would be recruited. 
Sinovac said it will push forward studies in its existing CoronaVac vaccine's protection against emerging variants. 

A Chinese study https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271215v1.full.pdf showed that a fourth dose of BBIBP-CorV, an existing Sinopharm COVID vaccine, did not significantly lift antibody levels against Omicron when administered six months after a third booster dose to a regular two-dose regimen.
While the fourth dose restored antibody levels to around the peaks that followed the third dose, researchers said new vaccines would offer a better alternative as future boosters.

11,By CNBC,2022-04-16T13:16:39+0000,Etsy sellers eye forming a union after going on strike,"In late February, Kristi Cassidy logged onto Reddit and made a call to action to people who sell their goods on Etsy. A day earlier, Etsy had announced it was hiking fees by 30%. For Cassidy, a seller of gothic wedding dresses on the e-commerce platform since 2006, the decision felt like an insult to small businesses who kept the site humming throughout the pandemic by selling their goods. ""I wonder, what would happen if on April 11, so many sellers put their shops on vacation mode that Etsy starts [freaking out],"" Cassidy wrote. ""And then they have no choice but to negotiate with us.""Cassidy's Reddit post kicked off a weeklong Etsy seller strike that began on Monday. Thousands of Etsy sellers are putting their digital shops in ""vacation mode"" to protest the fee increase. An online petition outlining their demands had well over 77,000 signatures as of Thursday evening. Etsy has 5.3 million active sellers on its platform, according to the company's website.The fee increase comes on the heels of a tremendous growth period for Etsy. The company was a big winner during the Covid pandemic, as consumers cut trips to the store and flocked to online retailers. Etsy sellers generated gross merchandise sales of $12.2 billion in 2021, compared with $5 billion in 2019. Etsy, which is known for its handmade and personalized goods, initially saw an influx of shoppers looking for face masks. Now, Etsy is trying to keep them coming back to the site, while competing with other e-commerce players like Amazon and eBay.Etsy told investors in February that additional revenue from the fee increase will be reinvested back into various initiatives at the company.Raina Moskowitz, Etsy's chief operating officer, said the company is ""committed"" to supporting sellers and helping them grow their businesses.""We are always receptive to seller feedback and, in fact, the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition, including marketing, customer support, and removing listings that don't meet our policies,"" Moskowitz said in a statement.Investors and analysts who track the company applauded the fee increase and other recent changes. Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman acknowledged sellers are likely bearing the brunt of higher costs, but that the changes should ultimately benefit ""everyone on the platform"" longterm.""We appreciate the concerns of the sellers. This is their livelihood,"" said Sigman, who recommends buying Etsy shares. ""But the offset is the company is using this as a lever to reinvest back into the business. Our view is that it should ultimately lead to stronger market share gains.""
Cassidy and other Etsy sellers interviewed by CNBC said they remain skeptical of whether the fee increase will translate to improvements on the platform. The company last raised transaction fees in 2018 from 3.5% to 5%, and the payoff has been minimal, Cassidy said.On top of transaction fees, Etsy sellers also have to pay listing fees, payment processing fees and shipping fees. As part of the company's Offsite Ads program, Etsy sellers are also charged an additional fee between 12% to 15% anytime shoppers make a purchase after clicking on an ad for their product.""The recent transaction fee increase, along with the [other fees], has made it harder for smaller creators to turn a profit and make their business sustainable,"" said Marie Hart, who sells pins, charms and art on her Etsy shop.As part of the weeklong strike, Etsy sellers are urging the company to cancel the fee increase, allow them to opt out of the Offsite Ads and end a recently launched program, called Star Seller, which they say puts undue pressures sellers. 
""As a small indie creator who designs and handmakes my merchandise and apparel, I'm losing hours of labor and money using Etsy,"" said Soudabeh Rouhandeh, who runs art and apparel shop Sudibear. Some veteran Etsy sellers are also calling on the company to crack down on resellers, which they say have sullied the marketplace.Since Alex Kittle became an Etsy seller in 2010, she said she's noticed an influx of mass-market goods and dropshippers. The shift feels disconnected from Etsy's origins as a platform for showcasing handcrafted, one-of-a-kind wares that are often made to order, she said. ""For the most part, I've found it a fun and eclectic community, with both friendly sellers and buyers, and a great place to reach my kind of customers (who are often a little nerdy or alternative in their tastes),"" Kittle said in an email. ""In the past few years, it's expanded to include larger businesses, dropshippers, resellers, and even scammy shops."" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman told sellers in February the company expects to dedicate more resources this year to removing listings that violate its policies. In 2021, Etsy spent $40 million on expanding the teams and technology focused on marketplace safety, the company said.Nicole Lewis, who has sold handmade crayons on Etsy for 15 years, said she doesn't agree with the premise of the strike. Etsy connected CNBC with sellers who did not participate in the strike.Lewis said she doesn't blame Etsy for hiking transaction fees, and that many of the recent changes are a necessary part of growing the marketplace.""I think a lot of the OG sellers that are upset with Etsy still see it as the Etsy of 2004, 2005, 2006,"" Lewis said. ""It's not that anymore and it can't be. Not in the world we're living in today, when there's so many people out there looking to sell their work and we compete with Amazon.""
Cassidy said she didn't expect the seller strike to take off like it did.But after connecting with sellers through the strike and realizing they shared many similar concerns, she and other Etsy sellers began to consider whether they should form a union.""The crazy thing is, I didn't even realize just how many people there were out there that agreed with me,"" Cassidy said. ""It's been this huge, eye-opening experience just to see how much all the other people that are on this platform trying to make a living with me agree and how much my customers support me.""Etsy sellers aren't employees of the company, but they're hoping that by joining together, they can better advocate for changes at the online marketplace. A number of Etsy sellers have joined a Discord server where they intend to map out organizing plans, Cassidy said.While Lewis didn't participate in the strike, she said she supports the idea of a seller union. ""I honestly think it's a smart idea because people just want to be heard and acknowledged,"" she said.Representatives from Etsy didn't respond to a request for comment on sellers' plans to unionize.Cassidy said she was inspired to organize Etsy sellers after witnessing the recent union victories among Starbucks baristas and at an Amazon warehouse.Worker activism has surged across the country since the start of the pandemic. The tightening labor market in the U.S. further galvanized support for unionization, and workers have seized the moment to demand higher pay and better benefits from their employers.Since the strike kicked off, Cassidy said she's been contacted by labor groups who've raised the topic of organizing sellers. Any next steps will boil down to what the seller community wants, she added.""We haven't been sure what to call it,"" Cassidy said. ""Is it union? Is it handmade slash vintage solidarity? What do we call this thing? What that looks like, we don't really know, because we're kind of navigating uncharted territory."""

13,By Huffington Post,"Apr. 16, 2022, 06:45 AM EDT","For The Starbucks Union Campaign, A Bruising Contract Fight Is Just Beginning","The organizing campaign at Starbucks has succeeded in unionizing nearly 20 of the coffee chain’s U.S. stores so far, a historic breakthrough for the labor movement. But the union effort is now in the early stages of an even heavier lift: negotiating a first contract.Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize. From the perspective of the union, Workers United, securing solid gains in a collective bargaining agreement could turbocharge an already hot organizing drive, and bring many more of Starbucks’ 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores into the fold.

Both sides are now girding for what’s likely to be a bruising fight at the negotiating table, one that could ultimately determine the future of unions inside Starbucks. “Developing a contract that meets or exceeds what we already offer to our partners is going to be difficult for them to do,” predicted Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesperson. “These contracts don’t start at the baseline of the benefits that our partners get. That is the full-stop rule. The contract negotiations start at zero.”(After this story ran, Borges said he misspoke about contract talks “start[ing] at zero.” He said he meant to convey that “collective bargaining involves lots of variables, and nobody can predict the outcome.”)Starbucks has already hinted at some of the hardball tactics that might lay ahead. CEO Howard Schultz suggested in a recent company forum that Starbucks could roll out new benefits that would apply everywhere but the unionized locations, since those stores are now negotiating their own work terms. “People who might be voting for a union don’t really understand,” Schultz said, according to The Wall Street Journal.

“Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize.”One of the challenges for the union is consolidating its leverage against the company. The campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has been organizing the chain store by store, filing for elections at locations where union support is high. The company has pushed for larger elections that would encompass an entire market — like Buffalo, New York, which is home to the first store to unionize — but the National Labor Relations Board has rejected that argument and sided with the union.The union’s store-by-store strategy is vastly more manageable than trying to unionize Starbucks nationally or market by market. But it technically leaves the union negotiating a contract for every store that joins.Michelle Eisen, a union leader and barista at the first store to unionize, said the campaign views each Starbucks as distinct, and that applying the same exact contract to every outpost “would go against what we said we’ve wanted from the beginning.” Eisen said the union hopes to achieve what might be called a national framework for a union contract ― one that includes basic guarantees across union Starbucks stores, but allows individual shops to address their own concerns. “There are aspects of the company that are consistent in these stores, but there are a lot of aspects that are not,” she said. 

Michelle Eisen, fourth from right, speaks to members of the union campaign. Via Associated PressEisen said she works at a small walk-in location, known as a cafe in company parlance, and that her store operates differently from a drive-thru store like the one in Mesa, Arizona, that recently unionized. Some contract language for one might not make sense for the other. “We have to find the elements of stores that are consistent and that becomes a national framework ― but allowing for fluidity within the contracts that can cater to each individual store as well,” Eisen said.Starbucks’ Borges said the company has no interest in hammering out national standards of any kind, no matter how many stores decide to unionize.“From our perspective, the law and the NLRB granted the union their argument that each individual store is its own unit,” Borges said. “So now we move forward with individual contracts for each of those stores.”Securing a first contract can be notoriously difficult in the U.S., in part because employers face no meaningful penalties for dragging out the process. It’s a common strategy for companies to bargain “in bad faith” and make no real progress at the table, in hopes union support will dwindle over time and perhaps the union will even be decertified, or purged from the workplace.If only a handful of stores ultimately unionize, it would be easier for Starbucks to stifle the campaign. But the union has filed for elections at more than 200 stores, and so far they have lost only two of the more than 20 vote counts that have already occurred (the results have not been certified for some of them). At this pace, the union is likely to gain more leverage at the bargaining table and more public support. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other,” said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “So we know that the workers that are already at the bargaining table at one store are going to try to get a broad understanding of what the workers everywhere want as they establish their demands.”Borges assured the company would bargain in good faith: “We’re going to be respectful, we’re going to honor the process.” But achieving a contract could realistically take years, and will ultimately depend on the company’s willingness to reach one. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other.”- Rebecca Givan, Rutgers UniversityStarbucks has deployed dozens of lawyers from the union-avoidance law firm Littler Mendelson to slow the pace of union elections, and has dispatched Starbucks managers to persuade workers to vote against the union. But Givan said fighting a union effort at each store becomes less tenable as the campaign grows.“It will be hard to maintain that strategy at potentially dozens of bargaining tables, especially when workers are fully aligned and in coordination with each other,” she said.

Starbucks has also fired a number of known union supporters. The company maintains that these terminations were all for legitimate reasons, but labor board officials have already determined that seven firings in Memphis were in response to union activism and therefore illegal. Bloomberg recently reported that the labor board will pursue a case against Starbucks if it doesn’t agree to a settlement.As workers speak out about the company’s handling of the union campaign, Starbucks could face a backlash from consumers that affects its bottom line. The stakes could be even higher in an ugly contract fight if the union enlists labor-friendly politicians and other high-profile supporters willing to criticize the company.Sharon Block, a labor law professor at Harvard University and former official in the Biden White House, said the brand dynamic is “hard to quantify,” but reputable considerations must figure into Starbucks’ calculus. “I imagine it weighs on their decision-making,” she said. “It isn’t just about doing the [financial] math.”If workers can successfully organize hundreds of stores, there may be a point in which Starbucks finds it in the company’s interest to acknowledge itself as a union employer and bargain accordingly, rather than continue to wage a battle at every store where a union petition pops up. Eisen said she thinks about that prospect often, and wonders how much organizing it would take to get there. She said unionizing a single store takes much longer than one might expect. She believes public support for the campaign might matter more in the end than how many stores wind up in the union’s column. “We get stronger, obviously, with every petition that’s filed and every store that wins,” she said. “The hope is that if the company is really who they’ve professed to be for the last 50 years, that there’s still room for them to make changes and get onboard and become the corporation that truly is progressive and leads by example.”Related...The Starbucks Union Campaign Has Won 16 Elections And Lost Just OneStarbucks Union Notches Another Victory With Eighth StoreThe Labor Board Is Withering Away, And That's Bad News For The Labor Mo"
14,By Reuters,"<span>23 hours ago (Apr 16, 2022 12:30AM ET)</span>",Activision cooperating with federal insider trading probes - filing,"(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is cooperating with federal investigations into trading by friends of its chief executive shortly before the gaming company disclosed its sale to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), it said in a securities filing on Friday. 
It received requests for information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and received a subpoena from a Department of Justice grand jury, the maker of ""Call of Duty"" said in an amended proxy filing. 
The requests ""appear to relate to their respective investigations into trading by third parties – including persons known to Activision Blizzard's CEO – in securities prior to the announcement of the proposed transaction,"" it said. 
Microsoft in January agreed to acquire Activision for $95 a share, or $68.7 billion in total, in the biggest video-gaming industry deal in history.
The company did not name the parties, nor say whether the grand jury subpoena was directed at any employee. 
The filing did not disclose when it received the subpoena or the SEC request for information. 
Media moguls Barry Diller and David Geffen, and investor Alexander von Furstenberg, acquired share options after von Furstenberg met with Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and days before it disclosed the sale to Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. 
""Activision Blizzard has informed these authorities that it intends to be fully cooperative with these investigations,"" the company said. 

Diller told Reuters last month that none of the three had any knowledge about a potential acquisition and had acted on the belief that Activision was undervalued and had the potential for going private or being acquired. 
The amended proxy filing that included the information on its cooperation with the SEC and DOJ came after shareholders sued the company alleging omissions to a preliminary proxy on the sale.

15,By CryptoGlobe,16 Apr 2022,You Can Now Earn NFTs by Learning About Blockchain Technology,"
A gamified educational platform from Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) lets people earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by learning about blockchain technology in general and Stellar ($XLM) Network in particular.
Stellar is “an open-source network for currencies and payments”, and it “makes it possible to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money—dollars, pesos, bitcoin, pretty much anything.” Stellar “relies on blockchain to keep the network in sync, but the end-user experience is more like cash—Stellar is much faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than typical blockchain-based systems.” 
Stellar network, which was launched in 2014, has “a native digital currency, the lumen, that’s required in small amounts for initializing accounts and making transactions.” 
Here is one use case for Stellar:
“You can create a digital representation of a U.S. dollar—on Stellar you’d call this a “dollar token”—and you can tell the world that whenever someone deposits a traditional dollar with you, you’ll issue them one of your new tokens. When someone brings that “dollar token” back to you, you promise to redeem it in turn for one of the regular dollars in that deposit account. 
“Essentially, you set up a 1:1 relationship between your digital token and a traditional dollar. Every one of your tokens out in the world is backed by an equivalent deposit. So while people hold the tokens, they can treat them just like traditional money, because they know that they’re exchangeable for traditional money in the end.“
The original Stellar Quest platform, which was created by SDF ecosystem evangelist Tyler van der Hoeven and launched in October 2020, was aimed at developers and it featured live challenges (such as creating and funding a Stellar account). For completing each challenge, you would get awarded a badge and some $XLM tokens.












According to a blog post published by SDF on April 11, Stellar Quest Learn won’t function much differently than the existing Stellar Quest site,” and “you’ll still be able to play quests at any time, in any order.” With Stellar Quest Learn, “you can go at your own pace,” and finishing each quest “earns you a unique, fresh NFT badge (coming soon!) that you’ll be able to display, or boast about, in your Stellar Quest profile.” Five quests are available now, and SDF plans to “add new sets regularly.”
Users of Stellar Quest Learn earn NFTs by “completing modular quests that leverage Stellar’s API and SDKs”. They unlock and receive NFTs after each quest that they complete. They are also able to display their NFT badges in their Stellar Quest profile.
The SDF blog post went on to say that the existing Stellar Quest Live, “where quests are live and timed events that are hosted periodically,” will still be around:
“We will continue to host live events periodically as a separate and supplemental experience to Learn. Face-off against other developers to solve new and unique timed challenges on the Stellar network.“
As before, $XLM rewards will be available for completing live quest events.
In other words, the original Stellar Quest has been “split into two main components: Stellar Quest Live and Stellar Quest Learn.”

17,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 09:20PM ET</span>",DaVita and its former CEO acquitted of U.S. antitrust charges,"(Reuters) -A jury in Denver, Colorado, acquitted dialysis provider DaVita (NYSE:DVA) and its former CEO Kent Thiry on Friday of charges that they conspired with competitors not to hire each other's employees.
The Justice Department had alleged in the case that both DaVita and Surgical Care Affiliates LLC required senior-level employees who sought to work for them to notify their current employers that they were job-hunting.
""The jury affirmed that this case should never have been brought,"" Thiry said in a statement. ""I want to thank the community that provided so much support through this difficult time.""
In a statement, DaVita said: ""(We) are grateful to put this matter behind us. We remain committed to operating with integrity and upholding the highest standards of law."" 
While enforcers have traditionally focused on prices and innovation in enforcing antitrust law, the Biden administration has shifted its emphasis somewhat to put more focus on illegal agreements that might push down wages.
Friday's decision comes after DaVita and Thiry had an alleged anti-poaching agreement with Surgical Care Affiliates LLC, now part of UnitedHealthcare, from 2012 to 2017 that sought to prevent each company from wooing away senior-level employees, the Justice Department said last year. 
SCA was charged in early 2021. Trial has been set for early next year.
The department also alleged that DaVita struck agreements with two other companies, Hazel Health Inc and Radiology Partners, to not hire DaVita employees.

The jury acquitted the company and its former CEO on all three counts, a spokeswoman for Thiry said.
Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department, said in a statement that he was disappointed in the outcome, but respects the jury's decision and remains committed to enforcing the antitrust laws in the labor markets.

""We are going to make promises that we will keep, promises that are real and going to solve the problems that exist in your stores,"" Schulz said in the video released to Reuters on Friday. 
Schultz, who returned to lead the company for the third time last month, is in the midst of dealing with a growing union drive at U.S. cafes.
He added that he plans to focus on issues raised by employees in their ""co-creation sessions"" such as need for more training, need for guaranteed hours, problems with ice machines breaking, maintenance and repairs not coming in a timely manner. 
""I have realized there have been many short term decisions that have had an adverse affect. We are going to reverse that,"" the CEO who has been practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987 said. 
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. Starbucks locations have asked the NLRB for union elections since August, with at least 10 locations voting in favor of the Workers United union. 

Last month, a federal labor board accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to unionize their store. 
The same day, a group of investors with $3.4 trillion under management urged the company to stop sending anti-union communications to its employees and to adopt a neutral policy towards unions.

(Reuters) -The New York Times sued an anti-immigration author for the cost of defending itself against defamation in the first lawsuit of its kind under New York's recently expanded ""anti-SLAPP"" law to protect critical speech.
The company is seeking unspecified fees spent fending off a 2020 lawsuit by Peter Brimelow, according to the company's lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday. 
Brimelow had sued the company over five articles published between January 2019 and May 2020 that described him as being ""white nationalist"" and his VDARE.com website as being ""animated by race hatred.""
Brimelow said the lawsuit does not have merit. ""This lawsuit, like the five articles at issue in the original litigation, is but another effort to raise the stakes against dissident (but desperately needed) voices,"" he said in an email.
The Times said in a statement it was the first anti-SLAPP case by the company which it called an important step in protecting itself from defamation claims.
One of the five articles that Brimelow alleged was defamatory was originally published by Reuters and republished by the Times. Brimelow did not name Reuters in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit by Brimelow, who has said he thinks the United States is a white nation, was dismissed in December 2020 soon after New York expanded its anti-SLAPP law, which is meant to deter lawsuits that are designed to punish defendants for speaking out on public issues.
SLAPP stands for ""Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation"" and then-Governor Andrew Cuomo said the expanded law would protect free speech by preventing wealthy interests from using the court to bully their opponents.
The Times lawsuit is the first in which a defendant in a SLAPP case turned around and sued the plaintiffs after getting the case dismissed, according to Daniel Novack, an attorney who specializes in media law. 

The anti-SLAPP law has also been embraced by defendants in the original litigation. 
Fox News argued a $2 billion defamation lawsuit by the Smartmatic voting systems company violated the law and former President Donald Trump tried unsuccessfully to use the law to sue E. Jean Carroll, a writer who said he raped her in the 1990s.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 04:20PM ET</span>",Twitter adopts 'poison pill' as challenger to Musk emerges,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) adopted a 'poison pill' on Friday to limit Elon Musk's ability to raise his stake in the social media platform, as a buyout firm emerged to challenge his $43 billion bid for the company.
Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused private equity firm that had more than $103 billion in assets under management as of the end of December, has informed Twitter that it is exploring the possibility of putting together a bid, people familiar with the matter said.
It is not clear how much Thoma Bravo would be prepared to offer and there is no certainty that such a rival bid will materialize, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A Thoma Bravo spokesperson declined to comment while Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Thoma Bravo was considering a bid for Twitter.
Twitter said on Friday it adopted a poison pill that would dilute anyone amassing a stake in the company of more than 15% by selling more shares to other shareholders at a discount. Known formally as a shareholder rights plan, the poison pill will be in place for 364 days.
The move would not bar Musk from taking his offer directly to Twitter shareholders by launching a tender offer. While the poison pill would prevent most Twitter shareholders from selling their shares, the tender offer would allow them to register their support or disapproval of Musk's offer.
""It is a predictable defensive measure for the board to go down that will not be viewed positively by shareholders given the potential dilution and acquisition unfriendly move,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted on Friday.
Thoma Bravo's interest raises the specter of more private equity firms vying for Twitter. The global private equity industry is sitting on about $1.8 trillion in dry powder, according to data provider Preqin. Unlike major technology conglomerates, most buyout firms would not face antitrust restrictions in acquiring Twitter.
It remains possible that a private equity firm will boost Musk's bid by partnering with him rather than challenging him. Musk's criticism of Twitter's reliance on advertising for most of its revenue, however, has made some private equity firms apprehensive about teaming up with him, industry sources said. This is because a strong cash flow makes financing a leveraged buyout much easier. 
Silver Lake, a private equity firm with more than $90 billion in assets under management, would be a natural partner for Musk because it offered financing for his $72-billion bid for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc four years ago, which Musk subsequently abandoned. Silver Lake co-chief executive Egon Durban also sits on Twitter's board.
But Durban did not recuse himself on Thursday when Twitter's board met to discuss Musk's offer for the first time, people familiar with the matter said, in a sign that Silver Lake has not sought to team up with Musk or make a bid of its own thus far. 
It remains possible that Silver Lake will choose to become involved as a buyer. A Silver Lake spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
' BEST  (NYSE:BEST) AND FINAL OFFER'
Twitter has more than $6 billion of cash on its balance sheet and its annual cash flow is close to $700 million, providing some comfort to banks considering whether should provide debt for a deal. Still, a leveraged buyout for Twitter could be the biggest of all time, potentially requiring several buyout firms and other major institutional investors to team up. 
Musk is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $265 billion. He has however drawn a line on how much he is willing to pay. He informed Twitter on Wednesday that his $54.20-per-share all-cash bid for the company was his ""best and final offer"", and that he would reconsider his position as a Twitter shareholder if it was rejected. Musk owns more than 9% of Twitter, making him the largest shareholder after mutual fund giant Vanguard.
Musk tweeted on Thursday that Twitter's shareholders should have a say on his offer and posted a poll on Twitter in which most users agreed with him. Twitter's board is still assessing Musk's offer and would only put it to the company's shareholders for a vote if it approves it. Twitter shares fell on Thursday, indicating that most investors expect the company's board to reject Musk's bid as inadequate and thin on financing details.

Twitter's board is expected to take several more days to assess Musk's bid and draft its response, the sources familiar with the matter said. An outcome over the weekend is unlikely, the sources added.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has been advising Twitter's board on its deliberations. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the board had tapped JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Co Inc as a second financial adviser.

21,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 03:40PM ET</span>",Twitter Adopts Limited Duration Shareholder Rights Plan,"Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan (the ""Rights Plan""). The Board adopted the Rights Plan following an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire Twitter.
The Rights Plan is intended to enable all shareholders to realize the full value of their investment in Twitter. The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
The Rights Plan does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders.
The Rights Plan is similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies in comparable circumstances. Under the Rights Plan, the rights will become exercisable if an entity, person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Twitter's outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board. In the event that the rights become exercisable due to the triggering ownership threshold being crossed, each right will entitle its holder (other than the person, entity or group triggering the Rights Plan, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, additional shares of common stock having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the right.
The Rights Plan will expire on April 14, 2023.
Additional information regarding the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by Twitter with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."

23,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 03:11PM ET</span>",Analysis-Elon Musk deals Twitter a wild card as shareholders seek reforms,"By Ross Kerber and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Elon Musk, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)'s newest big shareholder, could alter the course of the social media company as management battles a set of proxy proposals focused on topics from civil rights to politics at its upcoming annual meeting, shareholder activists and corporate governance experts said.
Whatever the outcome of Musk's $43 billion bid to buy Twitter outright announced Thursday, investors with opposing political views described the billionaire entrepreneur as likely to work to undo some of the restrictions on content that Twitter has imposed as it attempts to promote free speech while combating hate speech and false information.
Even if he fails to buy Twitter, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, who recently disclosed a 9.6% stake, is seen as likely to vote in ways that could shake up the company at its virtual May 25 meeting, said people who follow corporate governance issues.
""Given where Musk has positioned himself relative to the strategy of Twitter and given he wants to be something of a disrupter, I don’t see him voting with management very often,"" said Brian Bueno of Farient Advisors, a corporate governance and executive pay consulting firm.
Musk said his offer price of $54.20 per share was meant to promote open discourse. At the virtual meeting, he will control the second-largest stake after Vanguard Group, enough to give either investor a kingmaker role in close contests.
Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how he might vote at Twitter.
Musk's star power will likely draw much attention to event, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ""He's a well-known individual in the middle of all this, so it will increase the interest in voting and could have a big impact,"" Elson said.
Although Twitter on Friday adopted a shareholder rights plan to defend itself against Musk, Elson said its impact on the voting might only be to make proxy advisers, which tend to frown on such so-called ""poison pills,"" more skeptical of management.
FIVE HOT-TICKET ITEMS 
Twitter faces five shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, dealing with topics drawing much investor attention.
Two are from conservative groups, one asking Twitter to report on its impact on civil rights and the other on its lobbying activities. Scott Shepard, a fellow at the right-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research think tank, one of the sponsors, called Musk's offer ""terrific"" for shareholders. 
Shepard said he hoped Musk would turn Twitter away from censorship, and his group has criticized the company for steps like banning the account of former U.S. President Donald Trump after the storming of the U.S. Capitol due to the risk of further incitement of violence.
“Twitter under Musk will be what it should been -- both from a civic and a value standpoint -- all along"" Shepard said via email.
Taking a dimmer view is Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Benton, founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which focuses on social and environmental matters and filed a resolution critical of non-disclosure agreements for employees. 
""Missteps, in pushing for his (Musk's) own unfettered speech, risk destroying the appeal of the platform for millions who need to feel safe before they can speak up,” Benton said.
A fourth proposal filed by overseers of New York State's pension fund, who declined to comment, calls on Twitter to report on its electoral spending.
A fifth proposal was filed by Arjuna Capital, calling on Twitter to nominate at least one board member with a background in human or civil rights. Arjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she would expect Musk to back the proposal as it is in line with his free speech concerns.

But she called Musk's buyout bid ""troubling"" as a further consolidation of power on social media, where good governance is essential.
""We don’t need Twitter run by another social media emperor. We need it run by experts,"" Lamb said. (This story refiles to correct typographical error in paragraph 17)

MANCHESTER (Reuters) -Bahrain-domiciled asset manager Investcorp has entered into exclusive talks to purchase Serie A club AC Milan, sources said on Friday, in what would be the first takeover of a top Italian team by Middle East investors. 
One source close to the talks told Reuters the deal to buy the seven-times European champions from current owner Elliott Management Corporation was near to completion.
A potential valuation for the club would be in the region of 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) including debt, the sources said. 
Investcorp manages over $42 billion in assets with business lines including private equity, real estate, absolute return investments, infrastructure, credit management, and strategic capital. 
Investcorp and Elliott, which took over Milan in 2018, would not comment when contacted by Reuters. 
An AC Milan spokesperson said only that ""AC Milan remains focused on improving its performance on the pitch and to develop the club.""
A second source briefed with the matter confirmed talks between Elliott and Investcorp over a potential sale.
Milan have won Italy's top flight league title 18 times but not since 2011. The club has struggled to recreate the glory years enjoyed under the ownership of Silvio Berlusconi and his Fininvest group.
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PEDIGREE
The club won Champions League titles in 2003 and 2007 after Berlusconi was able to bring in some of the biggest names globally such as Brazilian Kaka and Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko.
Berlusconi sold the club to Chinese investor Li Yonghong in 2017 for 740 million euros, including debts, before Elliott later took control.
Milan are currently top of the table, two points clear of city rivals Inter Milan but having played a game more.
The club reported a loss of 96.4 million euros ($104.18 million) for the year ending June 30, compared with a record 194.6 million loss the previous year.
Elliott has never formally put the club up for sale but a source with knowledge of the situation said it had received interest from investors.
Elsewhere in Italy's Serie A, Inter Milan are owned by Chinese company Suning Holdings Group, while American company The Friedkin Group own AS Roma. 
Fiorentina and Atalanta are also American-owned.
While not present in Italian football, Middle Eastern investors control several other top European clubs, with Qatari Sports Investments owning Paris St Germain and Manchester City held by the Abu Dhabi United Group.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund took a majority stake in Premier League club Newcastle United in October.
Investcorp Holdings is domiciled in the Kingdom of Bahrain as a Bahrain Shareholding Company but delisted from the Bahrain bourse last year.

The company, whose executive chairman is Mohammed Alardhi, has offices in New York, London, Switzerland, Riyadh, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Mumbai, Beijing and Singapore.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 11:55AM ET</span>",Sanction fears deter Russian brokerages from adopting Sberbank's clients - sources,"(Reuters) - Fears of being targeted by Western sanctions are deterring Russian brokerages from helping Sberbank by hosting its clients' accounts with foreign stocks holdings, three financial market sources told Reuters.
The United States imposed full blocking sanctions on Russia's largest lender Sberbank and the country's top private bank Alfa Bank last week, exerting pressure on Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
The U.S. Treasury has put deadline for termination of transactions with Sberbank and Alfa Bank at April 12 and May 5, respectively. The banks said the penalties would not have a significant impact on their operations.
Russia has experienced a boom in private investments on the stock market since the onset of COVID-19. Last year, the number of citizens with brokerage accounts neared 17 million, as people looked for ways to make money amid a record number of domestic share floatings and low deposit rates.
Sberbank, VTB and Alfa Bank, Russia's biggest banks, were also top brokerage houses before the latest sanctions, which left their clients holding foreign stocks with the need to park their funds with smaller domestic players. 
Sberbank, which had to decide on transferring accounts with foreign stocks by the end of Tuesday, told its clients to contact the bank about the issue.
""We have taken action so you can manage your assets without restraints,"" Sberbank said on its website, without elaborating to where the accounts were transferred. 
Many Russian brokerage firms not targeted by Western sanctions said they were not taking trading accounts with foreign stocks from Sberbank, leaving its clients and the market unclear about their fate.
""The market situation is unique. No one is willing to take sanction risks as the aftermath is unclear... (The transfer of Sberbank clients) could be seen as help to the sanctioned bank in solving its business issues,"" said a financial market source who asked not to be named.
Sberbank did not disclose the name of the depository or brokerage that it was negotiating with and did not reply to a request from Reuters for comment.
""No one wants to see a massive inflow (of clients), primarily due to sanctions,"" another person from a Moscow-based brokerage told Reuters.
Fears of sanctions intensified as Alfa Bank took a hit from severe sanctions after it obtained clients from Russia's second-largest lender VTB, which was among the first banks hit by Western sanctions this year. 
A third source at a Russian brokerage said companies were reluctant to deal with sanctioned banks ""after the Alfa case.""
""Banks are trying to transfer their clients to empty brokerage firms with a licence but with no infrastructure,"" the source said.
Some media reports suggested Sberbank at some point was considering transferring clients to Aton and BCS brokerages. The two firms quickly issued statements saying they were not involved in the deal.
Finam brokerage, Tinkoff Bank, Rosselkhozbank, Freedom Finance said Alfa Bank and Sberbank had not asked them to take their brokerage accounts.

Otkritie Bank, hit by wider Western sanctions, and Gazprombank, under UK sanctions, did not reply to Reuters request for comment.
Alfa Bank told Reuters it was looking for a brokerage that would obtain its clients' accounts so they can continue trading freely, but a decision on what firm can do that has not been made yet.

Circle Raises $400m, Partners With BlackRock To Develop USDC Standard
","
Circle Internet Financial, the global internet finance firm behind the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin standard, has recently begun a $400 million investment round with support from BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital.
With the latest investment round, Circle is looking to explore new inroads in the traditional financial sphere, where USDC, its stablecoin, may be utilized to integrate crypto with traditional financial instruments. While the invested figure is not yet final, the funding round will continue up to Q2 of 2022, with Circle working towards a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) merger, which would take the firm's valuation to roughly $9 million (USD).
BlackRock, in partnership with Circle, has resolved to servee as the primary asset manager for USDC cash reserves, with a broader partnership that would explore market applications of the USDC stablecoin, as well as pooling for technical expertise and industry knowledge.

“Dollar digital currencies like USDC are fueling a global economic transformation, and Circle’s technology infrastructure sits at the center of that change. This funding round will drive the next evolution of Circle’s growth. It’s particularly gratifying to add BlackRock as a strategic investor in the company. We look forward to developing our partnership.” shares Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.

The crypto industry has reached a key juncture, where traditional finance is starting to take notice of crypto assets and the potential for blockchain technology. The latest investment round by Circle only cements this trend, with crypto assets slowly but surely gaining mainstream adoption.
Circle is currently pursuing an application to operate as a bank in the U.S. The new funding is set to bolster Circle's presence in both the crypto space and the traditional financial space, where access to banking products will be of great importance as the global economy shifts to digital currencies.
Circle's USDC is the second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin by market capitalization and is available on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Huobi Global. The USDC standard is an open source initiative that Circle launched in partnership with several crypto firms in September 2018, with its protocol built on top of the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.
Circle's USDC stablecoin currently has over $50.2 billion worth of circulation, with roughly $3.4 billion in average daily trading volume. Circle's previous funding round went up to $440 million, closed in May 2021.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 09:30AM ET</span>",Explainer-Michael Barr faces long to-do list as the U.S. Fed's next Wall Street cop,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said he would nominate former Treasury official Michael Barr to be the Federal Reserve's Wall Street cop, replacing Sarah Bloom Raskin, who withdrew in March after failing to win support from moderate Democrats.
Currently a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, Barr was a central figure at the Treasury under President Barack Obama when Congress passed sweeping reforms following the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Here is the regulatory agenda that Barr will have to tackle if he wins Senate approval:
DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Randal Quarles, the previous Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, led a review of post-crisis regulations, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks, and they want the Fed to revisit some of those changes.
Among the most contentious were revisions to the ""Volcker Rule"" curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual ""stress tests"" based on subjective concerns.
Barr will have to decide carefully which of these he believes he can reverse, given such changes are likely to be contentious and time-consuming.
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported. 
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether the Fed pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
Fed officials may end up treading more carefully than progressives had hoped, as Raskin's nomination was ultimately sunk by concerns she would push too aggressively on climate risk.
BANK M&A
The Fed's position on bank M&A is expected to become tougher under a new supervision chief. Progressive Democrats generally oppose bank tie-ups, arguing that they reduce competition and hurt consumers, and many deals were delayed after Quarles stepped down from the supervision role in October.
Some pending deals have been approved following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, but the industry is still waiting for the Fed and the Justice Department to decide on a potential new policy for bank deals. If confirmed, Barr is expected to lead the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups. 
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
The Fed is also expected to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
It's exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up bank capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules, which promote lending in lower-income communities.

The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the CRA can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
Barr would likely have to be in place before the Fed could sign off on the changes.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 08:45AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russian companies, banks could reap windfall from depositary receipt delisting","(This April 14 story corrects first dateline from Washington to London)
By Sinead Cruise and Carolina Mandl
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russian companies and global banks including BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could profit if Moscow moves to de-list Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The potential windfall is due to the fees that bank issuers of depositary receipts can contractually charge investors when they cancel the product. 
It is unclear how much companies and banks could make or if banks will charge the fees and risk angering investors who say it would be unfair given the extraordinary circumstances which have been triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, the fees could potentially translate into hundreds of millions of dollars according to Reuters' calculations based on fee data provided by the sources.
Assailed by Western sanctions, Moscow is preparing to de-list Russian company depositary receipts from foreign exchanges and convert them into local Russian securities in a bid to reduce foreigners' control over these companies.
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. They allow investors to dabble in overseas stocks in their own geography and time zone.
There are more than 30 depositary receipts on Russian companies including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Rosneft, Lukoil and Norilsk Nickel issued by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan, among others, trading on U.S. and European markets. 
Under standard agreements, depositary receipts can be canceled by the issuer or the investor. When that happens, the investor typically gets cash from the sale of the underlying shares, although they have the right to take custody of the shares instead. 
Banks charge an administration fee, typically around $0.05 per receipt, which may be shared with the companies, two sources said. 
If Moscow de-lists Russian depositary receipts, banks will have to cancel the products. Banks could still charge the fees, even though their hand was forced, according to three sources. 
For example, an investor in Rosneft with 150 million depositary receipts representing the same number of shares in the company could be on the hook for $7.5 million in cancellation fees, according to Reuters' calculations. 
Sweeping Western sanctions could make it challenging for banks to transfer the cash to some companies. 
Regardless, some investors say the fees should not apply. One global asset manager told Reuters that if Russia passes the de-listing law there should be no fees as investors would have no choice in the matter. The other two sources, however, say banks still have to cover their costs.
BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. Russian companies did not respond to a Reuters emails seeking comment.
MARKET FREEZE
As Western sanctions pummeled Russian stocks from late February, the Moscow exchange closed and the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring shares out of their custody accounts. It also barred foreigners from selling Russian shares. 
The restrictions made it nearly impossible for banks to cancel receipts when asked by investors anxious to slash their Russia exposure. 
With curbs on custodians recently lifted, BNY Mellon, Citi and JPMorgan have resumed processing cancellations. But because the foreign banks still can't sell the shares, investors have to take custody of them instead. To do that, investors need an account in Russia, which many don't have.
As a result, a lot of investors are likely to hold onto the receipts for the time being, according to three people. 
Many investors are worried, however, about the de-listing bill which Russia is preparing. 

Aside from the potential cancellation fees, investors are worried about what will happen if they can't open a local custody account.
In a note to clients, JPMorgan said clients may be able to open a Russian account under some unspecified circumstances if the new law is passed.

Russia proposes cross-border cryptocurrency settlement with African nations
","
The Russian President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sergei Katyrin has proposed a new cross-border cryptocurrency settlement for import-export payments, with the intention of boosting relations with African nations.
In a report by Russian news agency TASS, Sergei Katyrin sent a letter to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin that included a set of proposals for developing cooperation with African countries. 

""It seems appropriate to instruct the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, together with the Central Bank, to ensure the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements with African states (as agreed) on the use of national currencies and cryptocurrencies in mutual settlements and payments. To work out the issue of establishing a specialized export-import bank, as well as a trust fund to support export activities of small and medium-sized businesses in African countries,"" the letter noted. 

The President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry also brought up the possibility of two industry and trade departments establishing trade missions in African states as well as creating free trade zones and encouraging investment.
Katyrin also stressed the impact of the “negative transformation of trade and economic relations on the part of the collective west” and how cooperation with other nations, in this case, African nations, “ is of particular importance for the future development of Russia”.
With large-scale sanctions being imposed upon Russia following their attack on Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing restrictions on their ability to trade internationally. 
Ukraine legalized cryptocurrency in March, and has received large donations from the crypto community after Ukrainian President Zelenskyy signed the Virtual Assets Bill. 
Russia has also moved to allow opening up cryptocurrency payments including BTC, for energy exports, with a proposal presented by Russian State Duma Deputy and Energy Committee Chairman Pavel Zavalny at a press conference at the end of March.
The recent recommendations by Russia’s commerce executive are an indication of Russia’s intention to continue to pursue cryptocurrencies,  turning to African nations to facilitate the continuation of international trade.

""The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,"" the company said in a press release.Twitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.Musk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter's CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board. But days later, Musk reversed course and decided not to join the board after all.If he had joined, Musk would not be allowed to accumulate more than 14.9% of beneficial ownership of the company's outstanding common stock.Also on Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources, that Twitter brought on JPMorgan to help respond to Musk's bid. Twitter had already been working with Goldman Sachs and Musk has been working with Morgan Stanley.Several outlets including The New York Post reported Twitter was also fielding interest from Thoma Bravo, though it's still uncertain a bid will materialize, according to sources who spoke to Reuters.JPMorgan has history with Musk, suing Tesla over a matter related to his 2018 tweet claiming he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private.

Despite his fortune, Musk has much of his assets tied up in equity in his companies including Tesla, meaning he'd likely have to liquidate or borrow against his assets to come up with a large sum.But Musk said ""there is"" a Plan B if his initial offer to buy the company and take it private, which he called his ""best and final,"" is rejected.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>",Russian Deputy PM says several buyers agree to pay in roubles for Russian gas,"(Reuters) - Several buyers of Russian gas have agreed to switch to payments in roubles, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday.
""We expect the decision (to switch to roubles) from other importers,"" he added, in comments published in the ministry's in-house magazine. He did not disclose the identities of customers who had already switched.
President Vladimir Putin said last month that buyers of Russian gas from ""unfriendly"" countries should pay in roubles, a move rejected by European Union authorities under the bloc's sanctions regime against Moscow.
Putin has warned Europe it risked having gas supplies cut unless it pays in the Russian currency as he seeks to retaliate over the sanctions, imposed over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
In March, he proposed that energy buyers open accounts at Gazprombank, where payments in euros or dollars would be converted to roubles.

Armenia made several payments for supplies of Russian natural gas in roubles, its Economy Minister Vagan Kerobyan said in an interview with Russian media outlet RBC on Friday.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday that Hungary planned to pay for Russian gas in euros through Gazprombank.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",Tesla looks to resume production at Shanghai plant on April 18 -sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is preparing to resume production at its Shanghai plant on Monday following a three-week stoppage, having received the go-ahead from local authorities, two people familiar with the matter said.
The Shanghai factory, located in the Pudong district east of the city's Huangpu River, suspended production on March 28 after the city started rolling out lockdown measures to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases that were later implemented city-wide.
The plan for resuming production has the blessing of local authorities but could still be subject to change depending on how the epidemic situation develops in the city, said the people, who declined to be named as the matter is private.
One of people said the U.S. carmaker planned to start with one shift and would gradually ramp up. 
Tesla and the Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The latest stoppage was the longest since the factory started production in late 2019 and has led to an output loss of more than 50,000 units, according to calculations based on internal output plans seen by Reuters.

Ongoing production at the plant could be impacted by difficulties in procuring auto parts, however, as logistics in the city and surrounding areas have been severely disrupted by China's COVID curbs. 
He Xiaopeng, the chief executive officer of Chinese electric-car maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), said on Thursday that automakers in China may have to suspend production in May if suppliers in Shangahi and surrounding areas were not able to resume work.

Just 9 days ahead of a runoff that will determine who will lead the European Union's second-largest economy for the next five years, opinion polls show Macron is only slightly ahead of Le Pen in a contest that could potentially go either way.
The 2021 compensation package for Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares adds up to around 19 million euros ($20.5 million), plus a stock package worth some additional 32 million euros and long-term compensation of about 25 million euros.
""We're talking about astronomical sums here ... we should put a cap on these, this could work if we act at a European level,"" Macron told franceinfo radio.
""People can't have purchasing power problems, difficulties and anxiety in their lives and see sums like this,"" Macron said, adding that otherwise ""society going to blow up"".
Le Pen echoed his comments. 
""Of course it is shocking. It's even more shocking when it's a CEO who has put the company in difficulty and gets considerable sums,"" she told BFM television, suggesting one way to offset such remuneration was to develop staff shareholdings. 
The company said in a statement that it does not comment on politicians' positions and said the group had gone from near bankruptcy to a leading position under Tavares' leadership.
It added that it had paid out as much to staff as to shareholders - 1.9 billion euros - and said that Tavares' pay was 90% variable depending on company performance and lower than at rivals GM and Ford.

Just over 52% of the company's shareholders voted on Wednesday against the compensation package in a consultative vote.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 04:35AM ET</span>","Russia may be in default, Moody's says","By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said Russia may be in default because it tried to service its dollar bonds in roubles, which would be one of the starkest consequences to date of Moscow's exclusion from the Western financial system since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia's first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, though the Kremlin says the West is forcing a default by imposing crippling sanctions.
Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds - maturing in 2022 and 2042 - in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the securities.
Russia ""therefore may be considered a default under Moody's definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period,"" Moody's said in a statement on Thursday.
""The bond contracts have no provision for repayment in any other currency other than dollars.""
Moody's said that while some Russian eurobonds issued after 2018 allow payments in roubles under some conditions, those issued before 2018 - such as those maturing in 2022 and 2042 - do not. 
""Moody's view is that investors did not obtain the foreign-currency contractual promise on the payment due date,"" Moody's said.
The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier this month that if Russia is forced into a default, it will take legal action.
Before Putin's Feb. 24 order for what he casts as a special military operation in Ukraine, Russia was rated as investment grade. But its sovereign bonds have become a target in what the Kremlin says is an economic war waged by the United States. 
Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.
In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world's biggest foreign debt piles.
This time, Russia has the money but can't pay because the reserves - the world's fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada. 
DEFAULT 
As Russia could not and would not borrow right now, a default would be largely symbolic, marking the tumultuous finale to its post-Cold War attempt to integrate into the West's financial architecture.
While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt.
The U.S. Treasury this month halted Russia's ability to use foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions to pay its debt.
The Kremlin says the West has already defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its reserves, and that it wants a new system to replace the Bretton Woods financial architecture established by the Western powers in 1944.

S&P earlier this month lowered Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders.
Russia's economy is heading for the worst contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, with soaring inflation and capital flight.

SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shipments of some Apple products, as well as Dell and Lenovo laptops are likely to face delays if China's COVID-19 lockdowns persist, analysts said, as curbs force assemblers to shut down and closed-loop arrangements get harder to maintain. 
China's race to stop the spread of COVID-19 has jammed highways and ports, stranded workers and left countless factories awaiting government approval to reopen - disruptions that are rippling through global supply chains.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Pegatron Corp said this week it would suspend its plants in Shanghai and Kunshan, where according to supply chain experts it produces the iPhone 13, the iPhone SE series, and other legacy models.
Quanta Computer Inc, which produces some three-quarters of Apple's Macbooks globally, also shut operations, which could impact delivers more severely, analysts said.
The final impact on Apple's supply chain is uncertain and depends on factors including how long lockdowns persist. 
The company may also consider re-routing production out of Shanghai and Kunshan to factories elsewhere, such as Shenzhen, which currently is not under lockdown, analysts said.
""Apple may consider transferring the orders from Pegatron to Foxconn, but we expect the volume may be limited due to the logistics issue and the difficulty of equipment adjustment,"" said Taipei-based Eddie Han, a senior analyst at Isaiah Research. Foxconn is the trade name of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd .
As a worst-case scenario, Pegatron may fall behind on 6 million to 10 million iPhone units if the lockdowns last two months and Apple cannot reroute orders, Han said.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
The chief executives of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc have flagged huge economic costs if factories in Shanghai cannot resume production soon.
Shanghai is approaching its third week of lockdown and has shown no sign of a wide re-opening.
Forrest Chen, research manager at Trendforce told Reuters that if lockdowns lift in a few weeks, there is still a chance to recover.
However, ""if the lockdown lasts longer than two months, there is already no way to recover. At that point, after lockdown lifts, there would be a shortage for end-users,"" he said.
Some suppliers may be able to re-route production.
Unimicron Technology Corp, which makes printed circuit boards for companies including Apple, told Reuters the impact of the Kunshan lockdown so far has been minor and that it can rely on other plants in the Hubei province and Taiwan to support production.
But logistics and transport remain a nationwide issue, as cities across China enact measures.
One factory owner in Kunshan told Reuters that the district government had announced protocol for re-opening but provided no date for implementation. 

Laptop makers may also suffer, including Compal Electronics Inc, a Taiwan-based company that makes PCs for Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) Ltd from its plants in Kunshan. Chen estimates that roughly 50% of Compal's laptop production is located in Kunshan.
Compal told Reuters on Friday that it had not halted production in Kunshan. Dell and Lenovo did not respond to emails seeking comment.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 02:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Ferrero to stop buying palm oil from Malaysia's Sime Darby over labour concerns,"By Mei Mei Chu
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Italian confectionary giant Ferrero said it will stop sourcing palm oil from Sime Darby Plantation after the United States found the Malaysian planter used forced labour, in a reputational blow for the palm producer and for Malaysia. 
Labour practices across the Southeast Asian country have come under scrutiny in the past two years, with six companies including Sime Darby banned by U.S. customs over forced labour allegations.
Palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil, is a key ingredient in Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread, giving the iconic products their smooth texture and shelf life.
""On 6th April, we have requested all our direct suppliers to stop supplying Ferrero with palm oil and palm kernel oil sourced indirectly from Sime Darby, until further notice,"" Ferrero told Reuters by email. 
""Ferrero will comply with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's decision,"" it said.
Although Ferrero buys relatively little of the edible oil from Sime Darby, its move - following similar halts by Cargill Inc,  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) and  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) - could hurt Sime Darby's standing as a leader in sustainably produced palm oil.
Sime Darby told Reuters it has taken steps in the area of human rights and that all its stakeholders who are committed to sustainability can be assured of its commitment and leadership in the industry. Ferrero is not a customer, it added. 
""We are also in regular communication with all key stakeholders, particularly customers who have their own commitments,"" it said. 
Sime Darby's shares were down 4% on Friday afternoon, weaker than the main Malaysian stock index, which was 0.3% lower.
""It's very critical that Sime move fast to further alleviate any concern following the departure of some of these key customers,"" said Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CGS-CIMB Research, adding that other buyers could also suspend purchases as the labour concerns drag on. 
Ferrero, responding to queries this week from Reuters about suppliers receiving its requests to stop buying from Sime Darby, said it does not buy directly from the Malaysian firm, which it said supplies 0.25% of its palm oil volumes.
MORE HALTS
Following a 2020 decision to ban imports due to the presence of ""forced labour indicators"" at Sime Darby, U.S. customs said in January it had sufficient evidence of forced labour and that the firm's goods were subject to seizure.
Ferrero said its products and brands in the United States had stopped sourcing from Sime Darby in January 2021. 
Sime Darby has promised ""sweeping changes"" to its governance and some labour practices following the U.S. finding. 
Palm oil is one of the cheapest and fastest-growing vegetable oils, used in products from food to cosmetics to biodiesel. But the industry has faced scrutiny over the years for widespread deforestation in Southeast Asia and exploitation of migrant workers.
Migrant workers from countries like Indonesia, India and Bangladesh account for around 80% of the palm oil labour force in Malaysia, the world's biggest producer of the commodity after neighbouring Indonesia.
Ferrero says it uses only certified sustainable palm oil. It sources 85% of its palm oil from Malaysia, which traditionally has a better reputation for sustainability than Indonesia. 
U.S. commodities trading giant Cargill, in a move not previously reported, said in March it had suspended purchases from Sime Darby pending more information on the firm's measures to address the labour allegations.
Cargill said on its website that Sime Darby had taken ""very constructive and potentially transformative"" steps, but it needed more information to determine whether the planter was meeting the trader's sustainability standards.
Sime Darby said its supply of bulk products to Cargill in India has been taken up by other customers. ""We value all our customers and are certainly in discussions with Cargill,"" it said. 

Cargill declined to say how much palm oil it sources from Sime Darby. 
Last year, U.S. food company General Mills said it has issued global ""no buy orders"" on Sime Darby while chocolate maker Hershey asked suppliers to ensure no Sime Darby oil enters its global operations.

Growing lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19 in China are clogging highways and ports and shutting countless factories - disruptions that are rippling through global supply chains for goods ranging from electric vehicles to iPhones. 
Some Chinese authorities are trying to resolve the situation, said He on his personal Wechat feed which was seen by Reuters, adding he hoped more government departments can provide support.
His comments were echoed by Huawei's Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu, who also warned of huge economic costs if factories in Shanghai couldn't resume production. Yu said all technology and industry firms would have to stop production in May if their suppliers are in Shanghai, the official Securities Times reported on Friday. 
Sales in the world's biggest auto market plunged in March as COVID curbs took their toll.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was among the automakers feeling the pain of limits on production.
The U.S. automaker has suspended production at its Shanghai plant since March 28, leading to an output loss of more than 40,000 units, according to Reuters calculations. The manufacturing hub in Shanghai makes 10,000 Model Ys and 6,000 Model 3s per week, said a person familiar with the matter.
Nio (NYSE:NIO) also suspended production at its Hefei factory - even though there were no local-level curbs - because suppliers from other areas had stopped work.

Carmakers with production facilities in China's northeastern provinces are resuming production as those places emerge from lockdowns. 
State-owned Chinese automaker FAW Group has resumed some production at its Hongqi plant in Jilin while BMW said all of its plants in the city of Shenyang restarted operations on Thursday.

The automaker discovered the problem with the sensor in the CB18 engine used in its Forester, Outback and Levorg models, a spokesperson said, adding that production of models with that engine would be halted in due course, without giving further details.
About 54,000 cars with the engine have been sold in Japan since October 2020 and are for the market only, the spokesperson said, declining to comment on the number of cars affected by the shipment suspension.
Subaru has not decided whether to recall the cars and it would likely take 2-1/2 months before shipment is resumed, the spokesperson said. The company will continue to produce and ship models that do not use the CB18 engine, the spokesperson said.

The malfunction with the sensor causes the engine to fail to start and a warning sign to flash on the dashboard, the spokesperson said. 
Subaru's shares fell 3% in morning trade in Tokyo, after being deluged by sell orders at the open.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 08:41PM ET</span>",Musk says U.S. SEC 'bastards' forced settlement over Tesla tweets,"(Note: Strong language in paragraphs 1 and 4)
By Hyunjoo Jin and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk on Thursday stepped up criticism of the U.S. securities regulator, calling Securities and Exchange Commission officials ""bastards"" for bringing fraud charges against him over his 2018 tweets regarding taking the company private. 
On the day he made major news by unveiling a $43 billion cash takeover offer for social media company  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Musk aired his grievances toward the SEC during remarks at the TED Conference in Vancouver.
Musk, the world's richest person according to a Forbes tally, said funding to take his electrical car company private was actually secured at the time he posted his tweets, but the agency ""pursued the active public investigation nonetheless.""
""So I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards,"" Musk told the audience.
Musk said he felt forced to settle with the SEC because banks threatened to cease providing capital if he did not do so, which would have made Tesla bankrupt immediately. 
""So that's like having a gun to your child's head,"" Musk said.
""I was forced to admit that I lied to save Tesla's life and that's the only reason,"" Musk added.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines - and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman - to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by posting on Twitter that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The SEC said at the time his funding tweets ""lacked an adequate basis in fact."" 
A related consent decree also required Musk to obtain pre-clearance from Tesla lawyers for tweets and other public statements that could be material to Tesla.
A spokesperson for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Musk rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board last Saturday after disclosing his current more than 9% stake. He was required to have disclosed that he held a stake exceeding 5 percent in Twitter and is expected to invite regulatory scrutiny for missing a deadline to disclose such a stake and filing the wrong form, according to securities experts.

On launching his Twitter takeover bid, Musk said he made the offer because he believes ""it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech."" Musk said he believes Twitter's algorithm should be open-source and suggested the code behind it should be available on Github, a Microsoft-owned platform for sharing code for software development. 
Asked if he had the financing to do the deal, Musk said: ""I have sufficient assets. I can do it if possible."" He did not offer details.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 08:40PM ET</span>","Musk's Twitter play sparks concerns about distraction, stock sales at Tesla","By Hyunjoo Jin and Chavi Mehta
(Reuters) - Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter sparked concerns among Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors and analysts that the electric carmaker could suffer as the chief executive becomes distracted by his takeover play and the possible sales of Tesla shares to fund the deal.
The billionaire entrepreneur, who also heads rocket company SpaceX, targeted  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday with a $43 billion takeover offer.
The idea of Musk working to close that deal, possibly by selling even more of his Tesla stake, and then overseeing yet another company has Tesla observers worried.
""Elon is distracted. He's got a lot of things going on. He's involved in a lot of different endeavors,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which owns shares in Tesla. ""This is a one to three months headwind to Tesla's stock.""
Shares of Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, fell more than 9% since he disclosed his more than 9% stake in Twitter last Monday. On Thursday, Tesla's stock fell 3.7%. 
While Musk has talked about potential changes he would like to see Twitter make, Tesla faces its own challenges - the need to boost production at new assembly plants in Berlin and Texas, analysts said. Meanwhile, Tesla's Shanghai factory - its largest - has been idled by the COVID-19 crackdown in China.
""Musk is Tesla, and investors don't want to see Tesla lose that leadership edge,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said. 
And investors have Musk's own words prior to this foray on which they base their fears. Last year, he said he worked seven days a week - ""crazy hours"" - splitting time between Tesla and SpaceX. He also leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and tunneling venture the Boring Company.
Another worry is how Musk will finance a potential deal for Twitter, which would include stock sales and massive loans, analysts said. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said Musk, who holds over a 9% stake in Twitter, would need $39 billion to complete the deal and the sale of more Tesla shares could pressure the stock further.
Tesla executives may pledge their company stock as collateral for loans, but the maximum loan does not exceed 25% of the total value of the pledged stock, according to company policy. 
This means that he could borrow $42.5 billion by pledging all of his shares worth $170 billion. But he already pledged over half of his Tesla shares as collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness, according to a Tesla filing last year. 
Musk said on Thursday he has the assets to buy Twitter, but has not provided details. 

The fortunes of the world's richest person consists largely of stocks at Tesla, and Space X. He sold over $16 billion Tesla shares late last year, $11 billion of which he said would be paid in taxes.
""He is potentially setting himself up for a huge liability down the road,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 08:20PM ET</span>",Musk makes $43 billion offer for Twitter to build 'arena for free speech',"By Greg Roumeliotis, Uday Sampath Kumar and Chavi Mehta
(Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO saying the social media company needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech.
""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" Musk, already San Francisco-based Twitter's second-largest shareholder, said at a TED Talk in Vancouver when asked about his bid. 
Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public.
Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.
After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: ""It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.""
Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said.
Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday. 
Investors were not convinced. 
Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the ""largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,"" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it.
Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his ""best and final offer"" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.
""This is not a way to sort of make money,"" Musk said during the TED Talk.
""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk added.

Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said ""No"".
After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's U.S. Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""
In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.
White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Musk's offer for Twitter, saying that market regulators operate independently from political leadership.
Twitter employees, some of whom were panicked over Musk's impact on its ability to moderate content, attended an all-hands meeting on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source.
Musk said U.S. investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he ""had sufficient assets,"" without saying more. 
CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares.
Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation. 
'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'
Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.
Founded just two years after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users.
""The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
GRAPHIC: Twitter's stock market value https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkdxwkpx/Pasted%20image%201649950835786.png 
Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said. 
Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. 
""If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle – but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal – unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC.
Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter.
""It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.

Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company.
Asked if there was a ""Plan B"" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: ""There is.""

47,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 08:20PM ET</span>",Twitter CEO tells employees company not 'held hostage' by Musk offer -source,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal sought to reassure employees during an all-hands meeting on Thursday that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by news of Elon Musk's offer to buy the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
As Agrawal took questions from staff that were posted on the company's Slack messaging service, he encouraged employees to remain focused and told them ""we as employees control what happens,"" said the source, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The meeting came after news broke that the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive officer had offered to buy the social media company for $43 billion.
Agrawal told staff that the board was continuing to review Musk's offer, but that he was limited in what he could share with the employees.
In one section of the question and answer session, one employee asked how the company arrived to the decision to offer Musk a board seat. 
""Are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to the board?"" according to a section of the meeting heard by Reuters.
Agrawal responded that the board was acting in the best interest of shareholders. 
""I have a strong point of view that people who are critical of our service, their voice is something that we must emphasize so that we can learn and get better,"" he said. 
Another employee submitted a question asking Agrawal to address how he viewed Musk's definition of free speech and whether it aligned with how Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) approaches the concept. 
Agrawal did not directly address the question, saying much of the company's work was focused on continuously improving ""the health of conversation"" on Twitter.

Earlier in the Q&A, Agrawal said he believed ""Twitter stands for way more than one human, any human.""
A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -BMW Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said companies must be careful not to become too dependent on a select few countries by focusing only on electric vehicles, adding that there was still a market for combustion engine cars.
""When you look at the technology coming out, the EV push, we must be careful because at the same time, you increase dependency on very few countries,"" Zipse said at a roundtable in New York, highlighting that the supply of raw materials for batteries was controlled mostly by China.
""If someone cannot buy an EV for some reason but needs a car, would you rather propose he continues to drive his old car forever? If you are not selling combustion engines anymore, someone else will,"" said Zipse.
He has long advocated against all-out bans on combustion engine car sales in the face of rising pressure from regulators on the auto industry to curb its carbon emissions and environmental impact.
Offering more fuel-efficient combustion engine cars was key both from a profit perspective and an environmental perspective, Zipse argued, pointing to gaps in charging infrastructure and the high price of electric vehicles.

Companies also needed to plan for energy prices and raw materials to remain high by being more efficient in their production and stepping up recycling efforts to keep costs down, he said.
""We have a peak now, they might not stay at the peak, but they will not go back to former prices,"" he said. ""How much energy you need and use, and circularity, is important - for environmental reasons but even more for economic reasons.""

The trials that Nektar stopped included those involving a combination of its drug bempegaldesleukin with Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co's cancer drug Opdivo as well Merck & Co Inc's cancer drug Keytruda. 
Nektar and Bristol Myers were testing the combination therapy through an agreement signed in 2020, while the one with Keytruda involved a partnership entered with privately owned SFJ Pharmaceuticals last year. 
Nektar and Bristol Myers last month discontinued two late-stage studies testing their combination therapy in melanoma patients after one of the trials failed to meet its main goals.

On Thursday, Nektar and Bristol said the combination of drugs failed to meet goals in another late-stage study in patients with renal cell carcinoma, as well as in a study testing the therapy in urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.
With Nektar now halting multiple trials of its key drug, the company said it expects to announce a new strategic plan to rein in spending to meet its cash runway goals.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 06:55PM ET</span>",Analysis-Why Musk's Buffett-like playbook won't work on Twitter,"By Krystal Hu, Anirban Sen and David French
(Reuters) - ""My offer is my best and final offer.""
Elon Musk's $43 billion bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) takes a page out of Warren Buffett's take-it-or-leave-it playbook. But investment bankers, investors and analysts said he needed a blowout bid and more details on his financing for this strategy to work. They added that Musk's track record of reversing his positions also weighs against him.
Buffett is known for clinching large deals through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, such as the $11.6 billion deal to buy property and casualty reinsurer Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp and his $37 billion acquisition of aerospace equipment maker Precision Castparts Corp, by making only one offer and refusing to negotiate. 
These offers were viewed as fair by their acquisition targets and were backed by committed financing from Berkshire Hathaway. Musk's bid, on the other hand, was deemed too low by the market and too thin on financing details. 
In 2018, Musk, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of luxury electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, tweeted that there was ""funding secured"" for a $72 billion deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. He and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that he defrauded investors.
""Warren has demonstrated over 40 acquisitions in 60 years that when he says something, he does it. His word has enormous value. With Elon, I wouldn't trust him, ... there's no reliability there,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor at George Washington University who has written extensively on Buffett.
Musk and Buffett did not respond to requests for comment.
Musk's cash offer of $54.20 a share, which values the company at $43 billion, represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public. But it is lower than where Twitter shares were trading as recently as November. For most of 2021, the shares traded at more than $60.
Uninvolved investment bankers say the closest comparison would be  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s offer for Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc, which the payments firm withdrew last October after a negative investor response to its interest. The offer valued Pinterest at 17.4 times sales. By comparison, Musk's offer values Twitter at only 8.6 times sales.
Twitter shares ended trading on Thursday at $45.08, a 1.75% drop since Musk unveiled his $54.20 per share offer, reflecting wide investor skepticism that a deal will happen.
""I don't think the Twitter board will have a really hard time saying no to this deal. It's not an excessive premium and it's not excessively valued now,"" said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for merger arbitrage at Kellner Capital.
A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
FINANCING DETAILS THIN 
Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla shares last year, about 10% of his stake in the electric car maker, partly to settle a tax obligation. 
It's not clear how much of that Musk now has available for a Twitter bid, and it's possible that he could sell more Tesla shares or borrow against them. He provided no details about his financing in a regulatory filing on Thursday. 
A leveraged buyout is typically 60% to 80% financed with debt, so Musk would likely have to come up with an equity check of at least $10 billion. He could get partners, such as private equity firms, to help fund his contribution. 
Another question is banks' willingness to provide debt for the deal given the uncertainty of how Twitter would be run if owned by Musk. He has criticized Twitter's current management but he has not disclosed who the replacement would be. He has also spoken against Twitter's relying on advertising, despite its comprising the majority of its revenue.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is Musk's lead bank working on the bid.
Musk said in the offer letter that he would reconsider his position as a shareholder if Twitter rejects his offer. Later on Thursday, however, he hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid whereby he would bypass Twitter's board. 
He tweeted that Twitter shareholders should get to vote on the deal and posted a poll asking for Twitter users' opinion on the subject. Typically, a company will put a deal to a shareholder vote only once its board of directors has approved it.

If Musk is willing to make another offer despite calling his first bid ""best and final,"" analysts said his chances for a deal would improve significantly, given his resources as the world's richest man.
""The board could see a case to reject the first offer and explore options for a higher price,"" Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), wrote on Thursday.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 06:26PM ET</span>","Oreo-maker, Nestle, Pepsi face pressure from European employees over Russia","By Jessica DiNapoli and Richa Naidu
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Oreo-maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestle and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) face pushback from workers in Ukraine and eastern Europe angered by the companies' decisions to maintain some business in Russia, according to internal corporate communications reviewed by Reuters and interviews with six workers.
The emerging employee activism comes on top of Ukraine's repeated appeals to Western companies to go beyond current sanctions and cut all commercial ties with Russia, with the mayor of Kviv calling such payments to Moscow ""bloody money"".
To be sure, the employees speaking out, or even resigning in some cases, over the companies' response to Russia's invasion are mainly based in Ukraine, Poland or Eastern Europe and are a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of workers the food makers employ.
An internal memo seen by Reuters shows Nestle has seen an unspecified number of Ukraine employees quit and others bullied on social media for remaining with a company doing business with Russia.
Roughly 130 employees at Mondelez in the Baltics region encompassing Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia sent a petition in March to CEO Dirk Van de Put to stop all business in Russia, an action not previously reported.
One Ukraine employee of Mondelez interviewed by Reuters expressed shock and dismay that their company was still promoting ""The Batman"" Oreo cookies in Russia and offering chances to win up to 500,000 roubles ($6,000) on an Oreo website. https://oreo.ru
The website showed cinema tickets and hats being awarded as recently as Wednesday https://oreo.ru/Home/WinnersList to winners whose phone numbers start with the Russian country code.
Another website promoting Milka chocolates https://promo.milka.ru offered Russian residents up to 20% cash back on purchases and prizes in a promotion that started March 15, three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.
""The Batman"" movie was pulled from release in Russia one week before it was scheduled to reach theatres. 
Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) Inc, which owns the movie studio that made ""The Batman"", communicated the move to its partners, such as Mondelez, but had no influence over whether ""The Batman""-branded product is removed from shelves, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mondelez did not respond directly to questions about the ""The Batman"" Oreos or Milka promotions but said it has no advertising on air in Russia. The company said it would suspend advertising media spending March 9.
Consumer goods companies, including Unilever (NYSE:UL) and P&G, have said they are continuing business in Russia because some of their items are necessities, like diapers or milk, that everyday Russians need. They also are supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. 
Nestle, PepsiCo and Mondelez, three of the world's biggest packaged food makers by market capitalization, have not disclosed which brands are still sold in Russia, or what they consider to be essential. 
The Mondelez petition said workers ""strongly oppose"" the company's decision to remain in Russia, according to screenshots of an internal social media posting shared with Reuters by an employee. The employee declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
""Each Russian ruble paid to the state budget in the form of taxes and salaries (helps the) aggressor supply its army and kill even more Ukrainian people, among which there are children, women, elderly people,"" the employee petition states, according to the screenshots. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory and denies targeting civilians.
Mondelez European President Vinzenz Gruber responded to the post, saying that ""our culture (at Mondelez) includes everyone who shares our values and calls for peace,"" according to the screenshot.
""We stand by our colleagues and not by their governments/country decisions,"" Gruber wrote.
""We appreciate that our employees are speaking up and are sharing their voice on this heartbreaking and senseless war,"" Chicago-based Mondelez said in a statement. ""We have heard a range of different voices from colleagues around the world, and our leaders are in active dialogue with their teams as we manage day-to-day operations."" 
'MENTALLY BROKEN'
In addition to 19 posts on internal corporate message boards, one worker at PepsiCo, two at Mondelez and three at Nestle separately told Reuters that they want to see their employers take a stronger stand against Russia. 
""Our grandparents told us terrible stories"" about Russian actions in Poland during World War Two, said Patrycja Stas, 40, a manager at Pepsi in Warsaw. ""I see the same thing is repeating in Ukraine, and it is extremely depressing."" 
Stas told Reuters she is leaving her job for reasons independent of the war but said that Pepsi's ongoing business in Russia showed her she made the right decision. 
Although Pepsi suspended sales of soda in Russia, it continues to sell what it calls ""daily essentials,"" including snacks and dairy products. Pepsi declined to comment. 
The company, which had more than 3,100 employees in Ukraine, is using its headquarters in Poland to offer shelter to those leaving Ukraine.
The head of Nestle's European business, Marco Settembri, in an internal email seen by Reuters said in March that he was ""saddened to hear that employees are resigning"" and ""deeply concerned to hear of employees being bullied and threatened"" on social media. The memo was sent to the head of Nestle's business services center in Lviv, Ukraine, as well as other executives including the company's head of human resources and head of crisis management. 
Nestle had roughly 5,800 employees in Ukraine at the start of the war, but a significant number have now left the country, a Nestle spokesperson said.
Sofia Vashchenko, a manager who for nearly eight years worked in web content at Nestle in Lviv, Ukraine, before quitting this month, said in a post on LinkedIn that her team of about 20 people was ""mentally broken"" after listening to a Europe-wide webcast where Nestle's Settembri said the company would continue to support colleagues in Russia in response to a question about the company's operations there.
""People who are in the middle of a war with the Russian military don't want to hear that,"" she said last week in an interview.
Nestle initially only halted its advertising and capital investments in Russia, drawing anger from both its own employees and Ukraine officials over selling KitKat bars to Moscow.
Some Lviv-based employees sent Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider an open letter on Nestle's internal messaging board, seen by Reuters, in March saying ""our people feel betrayed"" by the company's continued operations in Russia. 
Later that month, Nestle said it was halting the sale of a wide range of its brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik.
Nestle is still selling essentials, such as baby food, in Russia but said it was donating profits to charity. The three employees interviewed by Reuters want greater transparency about what items the company considers essential.
""We have been focused on the safety and security of our Ukrainian colleagues and doing all we can to support them and their families,"" a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that it has been giving people advance salary payments, one-off payments to support relocations and offering people jobs in other Nestle operating companies.
In response to a question about reports of Ukrainian employees refusing to speak with Russian colleagues, Nestle told Reuters that it ""immediately organized for all activities serving Nestle Russia to be handled out of Russia directly,"" a move that separated employees there from those in Ukraine.
""Of course I don't want to work with people in Russia. We don't know who is OK with the war,"" Lviv-based Nestle employee Mariana said on Tuesday. She asked that her last name not be used because she is not authorized to talk with the media. 

""In (my team) we've stopped working with Russia and never want to work with them again.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday at the end of a holiday-shortened week as bond yields resumed their uphill climb and investors contended with mixed earnings and economic data. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes posted weekly losses ahead of the Good Friday holiday.
""It’s a combination of continued worries still there,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's a mixed bag earning season so far, and that, coupled with high inflation and the hawkish Fed have led to selling ahead of the holiday weekend."" 
Rising 10-year Treasury yields pressured growth stocks, dragging the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq deeply into negative territory, while the Dow posted a more modest loss.[US/]
""The higher yields pressure higher growth stocks as their net present value ... takes a hit when yields go higher,"" Detrick said. 
A quartet of large U.S. banks shifted the first quarter reporting season into overdrive, with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co all posting results.
While all four beat Street estimates, they also reported steep profit declines. Their share price reaction was mixed, and were last moving in the range of up 1.6% (Citigroup) to down by 4.5% (Wells Fargo). The broader S&P 500 Finance index fell 1.0%.
""There’s some concerns this earnings season,"" Detrick added. ""Expectations are the lowest since the recovery started and it's got investors cautious of how companies will step up to the earnings altar in the comings weeks.""
A host of economic data showed spiking gasoline prices helped retail sales beat consensus and prompted the largest jump in import prices in nearly 11 years.
The data falls in lockstep with other recent indicators, which appear to cement aggressive inflation-curbing actions from the Federal Reserve in the coming months, including a series of 50 basis point interest rate hikes.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chairman Elon Musk offered to take  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) private with a $41 billion cash offer. The social media company's shares oscillated throughout the session but closed down 1.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.36 points, or 0.33%, to 34,451.23, the S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.21%, to 4,392.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51 points, or 2.14%, to 13,351.08.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, tech shares fared the worst, sliding 2.5%.
The first-quarter reporting season is still in its infancy, with 34 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported.
Analysts now expect aggregate annual S&P 500 earnings growth of 6.3%, less optimistic than the 7.5% growth projected at the beginning of the year.
Thursday marked the monthly expiration for options contracts, an occurrence that has in the recent past helped amplify stock market gyrations as investors make adjustments to account for millions of expiring options contracts on stocks, ETFs and indexes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 218 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.45 billion shares, compared with the 12.22 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The oil giant pegs its fuel prices to international crude prices rather than subsidising fuel for Brazilians.
This is an election year and many Brazilians have demanded that Petrobras limit price increases for gasoline and diesel, which have soared recently, hurting President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity.
""Market prices are a necessary condition to create a competitive business environment, attract investment and new players, expand the country's infrastructure, and secure supply,"" the new CEO said during his inaugural speech.
He also said the company would keep divesting from mature, smaller oilfields and refineries, while focusing on the pre-salt and deepwater fields.
Coelho was Bolsonaro's second pick to replace retired army general Joaquim Silva e Luna, who was ousted in March after disagreeing with the far-right leader on the firm's fuel pricing policy.
Bolsonaro initially tapped well-known academic and energy consultant Adriano Pires for the role, but he ended up turning it down as he could not reconcile his consulting job with Petrobras' command, paving the way for Coelho's nomination.
Coelho previously served as the secretary of oil, gas and biofuels at Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry.
NEW BOARD
Coelho's election came right after the company voted him onto its board earlier in the day, as under Petrobras' statutes the chief executive is required to be on the board.
A new composition for the 11-strong board was also approved at the Petrobras annual shareholder meeting, which began on Wednesday afternoon and concluded early on Thursday, expanding minority shareholder footprint.
Since the government tapped Coelho, his ascent was widely expected. The rest of the board was a more contentious issue.
The government, which holds a controlling stake in the company, held seven seats going into the meeting while market investors had three representatives and company workers had one.
But market shareholders successfully increased their representation to four at the meeting, a list provided by the company showed, including billionaire businessman Jose Joao Abdalla Filho. As a result, the government is now down to six representatives.

Analysts at Itau BBA said the meeting was an important milestone in returning Petrobras to its day-to-day business after weeks of turmoil, ""as well as to bringing more balance to the composition of the board and strengthening the company’s governance.""
Brazil-traded preferred shares in Petrobras were down 0.8% at 31.40 reais in afternoon trading, in line with a 0.7% drop in the broader Bovespa stock index.

CAMERON, Louisiana (Reuters) - Top U.S. liquefied natural gas producer Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) on Thursday said surging U.S. natural gas prices reflect past underinvestment followed by ""a demand shock"" as Europe seeks to wean itself from Russian gas, and that high prices will spur more production that will benefit consumers. 
Gas traded at the main U.S. hub hit $7.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtus) on Thursday, up 96% this year to a 13-year high on record demand. Those prices has companies that consume lots of natural gas calling for curbs on new LNG plants. 
""What we are going through now is a demand shock to the industry that came after a relatively long period of underinvestment,"" Executive Vice President Anatol Feygin said in an interview at Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal. 
""We think the resource is there and our ability to attract that resource and bring it into the right markets will ultimately result in a more attractive domestic gas price,"" he added.
Feygin said its existing Louisiana and Texas operations, which together can supply up to 45 million tonnes per year, have ample unused space that could allow for future expansions. 
The spike in LNG demand from Europe, as buyers steer clear of Russian gas over its invasion of Ukraine, has not changed Cheniere's focus on its Asia markets, he said. 
""Ultimately the driver of growth for energy demand, for natural gas and LNG, we think is going to continue to be Asia. The plurality of those long-term, 20 plus year agreements have been with Asian counterparties,” Feygin said.

Cheniere's success has encouraged rivals to propose several new plants along the U.S. Gulf coast. Competition from lower-cost projects has not changed Cheniere's strategy, he said. 
LNG buyers looking to strike deals with new and untested firms are ""taking risks of that project developer being able to perform,"" he said. ""We compete in a differentiated space.""

56,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 06:00PM ET</span>","With Twitter in his sights, Musk creates new model of 21st century billionaire","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a stable of businesses ranging from electric cars to private rocket ships, iconoclastic billionaire Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world by building a fortune firmly planted in 21st century technology. With an all-cash $43 billion offer to buy  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Musk may soon emulate the tycoons of the past by controlling a media platform that contributed to his rise to fame. 
Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), revealed the takeover bid in a regulatory filing made public on Thursday and said he would take Twitter private.
Owning Twitter would be the next evolution of a polarizing figure. Musk has earned Wall Street's admiration and ire by combining the free-flowing obsessions of aerospace visionary Howard Hughes (NYSE:HHC) with an intense focus on revolutionizing auto production reminiscent of Henry Ford into a new model of a billionaire who is as likely to take on short-sellers as he is to shoot a red luxury sports car into orbit, as he did in 2018. 
""Whatever your feelings on Musk, he would certainly shake things up, with the only question as to whether he would make things worse or improve them,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
Musk, 50, has a $273.6 billion fortune estimated by Forbes that makes him the wealthiest person in the world, worth $92.3 billion more than runner-up Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother and South African father and later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997. 
He did not invent rockets or electric cars, nor did he found Tesla, which he has led from 2008. But his insight that Tesla's electric cars should be high-performance machines with sophisticated, smartphone-style software revolutionized the global auto business, prompting established companies to try to catch up while spurring new, all-electric competitors such as startup Rivian. 
While many initially expected Tesla to fail - which it almost did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and in 2017-2018 when it stumbled through what Musk called ""manufacturing hell"" in the launch of its high-volume Model 3 sedan - the company began turning quarterly profits in 2020. 
Wall Street has underscored Tesla's achievement by lifting the company's market capitalization to more than $1 trillion - more than all three Detroit automakers plus  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, combined - and making it the fourth-largest company in the benchmark S&P 500 index, the backbone of millions of Americans' retirement savings plans. 
At the same time, his company SpaceX, led day to day by President Gwynne Shotwell, has upended space launch industry incumbents by developing rockets capable of putting satellites into space and returning to Earth for re-use.
Perhaps more than any other person, Musk has helped bring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with Tesla holding about $2 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and the company among the few to accept dogecoin as payment. 
Musk has run through a trail of subordinates who could not keep pace or got fed up with his relentless demands. Even his largest shareholders have appeared to lose patience with him at times. Noted stock picker Cathie Wood, whose outsized position in Tesla powered her ARK Innovation ETF to the best performance of any U.S. fund in 2020, suggested at a conference on Tuesday that she is put off by Musk's ""antics"" and has little contact with him personally. 
Labor advocates have criticized Musk for hostility toward unions. Musk has also clashed with former business associates, state and federal regulators, and Wall Street figures such as short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. Chanos came under fire from Musk for suggesting that Musk's production estimates for Tesla and his tunnel business The Boring Company were unattainable. 
""What bothers me is not so much the personal stuff and the personal attacks. I'm used to that. It's the willingness to say things that I think he knows are a stretch, to be polite,"" Chanos told CNBC in 2018. 
Reuters, too, has faced his ire, with Musk tweeting in 2018 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1014800936198213633 that a reporter misled the public about Model 3 production and ""followed that up with mean tweet to me"" on his birthday.
GLOBAL REACH
Twitter helped Musk become a household name. He has 81 million followers and built a pop culture following large enough to help him earn a spot hosting the venerable U.S. comedy TV show ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2021. 
A Twitter takeover would add Musk to the long line of U.S. business tycoons who solidified their fortunes with media properties, ranging from William Randolph Hearst in the late 19th century to Jack Welch's 1986 decision to buy the parent company of broadcast network NBC while he was chief executive of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). 
Musk has used Twitter to go after short-sellers large and small. He also has posted everything from Dad jokes to polls on what he should do with his unrealized gains from Tesla's surging stock price. 

His Twitter content has been the source of an ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the agency requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said he defrauded investors, though the settlement included no admission by Musk or an indication of innocence. Musk has since accused the SEC of ""unrelenting harassment."" 
""Twitter has been intertwined with Musk's global reach, which is why he feels so passionately about the platform,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""But for the Twitter board this is a living nightmare because unless they want to eat lawsuits for breakfast they have to find another bidder.""

(Reuters) - Automaker Stellantis has signed a multiyear deal to use Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s next-generation connected-car technology in its vehicle lineup, the companies said on Thursday.
Fourteen Stellantis brands, including Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat and Jeep, will use Qualcomm's vehicle cockpit and 5G telematics technology starting in 2024 with the Maserati brand being the first out the gate, said the companies, which did not disclose the deal value.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a statement the collaboration helps the company more closely manage the complete electronics supply chain. 
Qualcomm general manager of automotive, Nakul Duggal, told Reuters more automakers are working directly with chip makers rather than just relying on their other suppliers to act as a go-between.
“If you go back even a couple of years, it was quite uncommon for (automakers) to make a decision like this,"" Duggal said. ""This is now becoming much more common.""
He added Qualcomm’s recent acquisition of self-driving tech software company Arriver gives its so-called ""digital chassis"" the ability to offer a full set of driver assistance and self-driving capabilities in addition to cockpit and telematic technology. But the deal with Stellantis this time does not include that newer offering.
Qualcomm said that since it first unveiled its driver assistance and self-driving system - called Snapdragon Ride - in 2020, its automotive business deal pipeline has increased to $13 billion last year from $3 billion in 2017.

In a statement the two companies said the in-car communication and infotainment systems for Stellantis is being designed and engineered together with tech giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn. 
(The story is updated to correct spelling of Qualcomm automotive general manager's last name to Duggal)

LONDON (Reuters) - Crypto entrepreneur Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Estavi made headlines in March 2021 when he paid $2.9 million for an NFT of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) boss Jack Dorsey's first tweet. But his efforts to re-sell it have run aground, with a top bid of just $6,800 as of Thursday.
The initial purchase was at the time among the most expensive sales of a non-fungible token, or NFT, and came amid a flurry of interest in the niche crypto assets which have since generated billions of dollars in sales.
Estavi put the tweet up for resale on the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea last week, initially asking for $48 million.
That price tag was removed after offers in the first week were in the low hundreds of dollars. As of Thursday, the highest bid was 2.2 of the cryptocurrency ether - equivalent to around $6,800.
""My offer to sell was high and not everyone could afford it,"" Estavi, who was recently freed from jail in Iran, told Reuters via Twitter direct message, adding that he was no longer sure if he would sell the NFT.
""It's important to me who wants to buy it, I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not think everyone deserves this NFT,"" Estavi said. 
NFTs are a form of crypto asset which can record the ownership of a digital file such as an image, video or text.
There is no guarantee of an NFT's value and the market is rife with scams, fraud, counterfeits and market manipulation.
But Estavi was confident in the value of his purchase.
""This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world,"" he said.
""VICTIM OF CRYPTO""
Estavi, who lives in Malaysia, said he had been arrested last May during a trip to Iran and held in solitary confinement until he was freed in February. Iranian state media reported in May 2021 that he was accused of ""disrupting the country's economic system"".
Estavi said he had been arrested because of the growth of his crypto exchange, Bridge Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and described himself as a ""victim of crypto"". 
Reuters was unable to independently verify these details. 
""I need the support of the cryptocurrency community,"" Estavi told Reuters. 

While announcing the NFT sale in a tweet on April 6, he pledged to give 50% of the proceeds - which he expected to be at least $25 million - to charity.
He said the rest would go to support Bridge Oracle.

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks finished lower while bond yields and the dollar rose on Thursday as investors worried about the potential for aggressive U.S. policy tightening as other central banks around the world moved to reduce support. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped, following two days of declines, after a flurry of U.S. economic data such as retail sales and jobless claims and the European Central Bank's announcement of less aggressive than expected tightening plans. 
New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Reserve should reasonably consider raising interest rates by a half percentage point at its next meeting in May, which was seen as a further sign that even more cautious policymakers are on board with bigger rate hikes. 
This was after the ECB said it plans to cut bond purchases - known as quantitative easing - this quarter, then end them at some point in the third quarter.
Investors also eyed hefty rate hikes by New Zealand's central bank and the Bank of Canada, and a surprise rate hike by the Bank of Korea as well as policy tightening by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
These moves all exacerbated bond yield increases and stock price declines, according to Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones who also noted that Thursday's data showed the Fed's need to act fast.
""All systems are go for the Fed to move pretty aggressively,"" said Mahajan. ""Generally it's a global battle to fight inflationary pressures.""
U.S. stocks had gained on Wednesday on hopes that price increases could be peaking. But Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut, saw Thursday's trading action as a sign that there was little conviction behind those hopes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.36 points, or 0.33%, to 34,451.23 while the S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.21%, to 4,392.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51 points, or 2.14%, to 13,351.08.
After the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.67% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71%.
""Today's probably the right reaction,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""Until inflation is under control, it's not under control. There's too much uncertainty.""
Samana also pointed to the tone of the ECB's comments about threats to growth heading in the wrong direction will risks to inflation are ""to the upside.""
Meanwhile in forex, the euro plunged to a two-year low against the dollar as comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde were viewed as a sign that the bank was in no rush to raise interest rates.
The dollar index rose 0.524%, with the euro down 0.52% to $1.0828.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.21% versus the greenback at 125.94 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3076, down 0.30% on the day. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 36/32 in price to yield 2.8275%, from 2.689% late on Wednesday.
Along with the moves by Seoul and Singapore, New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points on Wednesday, the biggest hike in over two decades. The Bank of Canada also raised rates by the same level, making its biggest single move in more than two decades and flagging more hikes to come.

U.S. crude rose 2.02% to $106.36 per barrel and Brent was at $111.41, up 2.42% on the day.

Gold eased on Thursday after the dollar strengthened and yields rose as investors geared up for U.S. interest rate hikes, but safe-haven demand triggered by the Ukraine crisis and mounting inflation kept bullion on track for a weekly gain.

Investing.com -- The Dow stumbled Thursday to close our the shortened U.S. trading week with a loss as mostly better-than-expected quarterly results from major Wall Street banks failed to spark a revival amid a sea of red in tech. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.33%, or 113 points lower, the S&P 500 fell 1.22%, the Nasdaq slipped 2.1%.
Major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. But  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell more than 4% after reporting a decline in quarterly report.
The fall in bank stocks comes in the wake of rising Treasury yields, which tend to boost the margins on loans made by banks, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lean aggressive on monetary policy tightening to curb inflation pressures.
The pace of the surge in yields has placed growth sectors of the market in the crosshairs, with big tech leading the decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were down more than 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) failed to hold onto its gains as many doubt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk’s $54.20 a share offer to take the social media company private will succeed.
“In our view, the deal does not get done at this level, and Twitter's Board will not view this offer, or Mr. Musk leading a change in the company as in the best interest of the company or shareholders,” Wedbush said in a note..
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Group, a major Dow component, ended the day in the red despite better-than-expected quarterly results and an increase in full-year guidance.
Energy sidestepped the selloff, underpinned by rising oil prices on fears about tightening global supplies as Russia and Ukraine look set to engage in a massive land battle in Eastern Ukraine.
On the economic front, investors digested a weaker picture as data showed initial jobless claims rose more than expected, while the latest retail sales report flagged the impact of red-hot inflation on the consumer.
Still economists remain sanguine on the strength of the consumer, citing excess savings built up during the pandemic.  
“[W]e remain quite constructive on the outlook, because of the combination of excess savings and robust wage growth, particularly in the bottom half of the income distribution” {{Jefferies said in a note.}}

GDANSK (Reuters) - Polish video game maker CD Projekt said on Thursday it would release an expansion of its flagship ""Cyberpunk 2077"" game next year, after announcing full-year net profit that topped expectations.
The studio also behind the Witcher franchise said its full-year net profit reached 208.9 million zlotys ($48.7 million), compared with 194 million expected by analysts.
Cyberpunk, which took eight years to make and cost 1.2 billion zlotys, was one of the most anticipated games of 2020, but after a bug-ridden start it was kept off  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation Store for six months.
The company's revenue came in at 888.2 million zlotys, driven by Cyberpunk sales, but was 58% down from the record 2020 figure it reported in the game's debut year.
""We think the (profit) beat may have been driven by solid sales of CP77 and Witcher titles, as gamer engagement appears to be improving across the industry,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a note.
Still, the planned 2023 release of the Cyberpunk expansion after a delay to ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" version for next-generation consoles announced on Wednesday, may further worsen sentiment around the stock, they said.
CD Projekt had said it had taken work on the version back in-house and postponed the release, previously planned for the second quarter, though it said on Thursday there was no ""monumental"" delay.
The Polish company has been working on fixing Cyberpunk ever since its launch, and has released eight updates so far.
It said it had sold more than 18 million copies of the game so far, compared with more than 13.7 million it earlier said it had sold in its debut year.
""We are now satisfied with the game and encouraged by the gamers' reception of its next-gen console edition, which launched this February,"" Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said in a statement.
Cyberpunk is rated an average 6.5 out of 10 on review aggregator website Metacritic for its version on PlayStation 5, compared with a 3.7 score for the older generation version.

CD Projekt also said it had so far sold more than 65 million copies of its medieval fantasy The Witcher franchise, including more than 40 million copies of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.""

Investing.com -- Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rose, then fell Thursday afternoon following a report from Bloomberg that said the connected fitness company is cutting hardware prices but upping the cost of its subscription.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 03:06PM ET</span>",Citigroup reduces forecast for potential Russia losses,"By David Henry and Manya Saini
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc could lose as much as $3 billion from its Russia exposures, $2 billion less than previously forecast, the bank said on Thursday while reporting a nearly halving of its first-quarter profit. 
The bank said it had reduced its total exposure to Russia since December by $2 billion to $7.8 billion and that it would now lose no more than $3 billion in a severely adverse scenario, down from the nearly $5 billion estimated last month.
The disclosure came as Citi - the most global of the U.S. banks - added $1.9 billion to its reserves in the quarter to prepare for losses from direct exposures in Russia and the economic impact of the Ukraine war.
That pushed credit costs to $755 million, a contrast with the $2.1 billion benefit a year ago when it freed up loss reserves built during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The turn was a key factor in driving net income down 46% from a year earlier.
Still, the resulting earnings per share of $2.02 per share beat the $1.55 estimate from analysts who had feared worse.
Citi shares rose on the report and were up 1.4% in afternoon trading.
""This was in line with our hopes for what we would see,"" said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management and a long-time investor in the bank who said he was ""pleasantly surprised.""
The reduced Russia exposure was a plus. ""They appear to have navigated and managed down their risk,"" Kaser said. 
Revenue fell 2% to $19.2 billion, less than some analysts had expected. 
A key factor was a 43% slump in investment banking revenue as last year's rush of deals involving blank-check companies tapered off, drying up underwriting fees. Equity underwriting revenue plunged 78%.
Revenue from Treasury and Trade Solutions - Citi's crown jewel business - rose 18% due to higher net interest income and fee growth.
""While the geopolitical and macro environment has become more volatile, we are executing the strategy we announced at our recent Investor Day,"" Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said in the results announcement.
Fraser later told analysts she had personally felt the added challenge of the pandemic when she had what she called ""a brief encounter with COVID."" 
Fraser is leading an overhaul of Citi, which lags the financial performance of peers and has to carry out orders from U.S. banking regulators to fix its risk and compliance systems.
Her push has, however, driven up costs, with expenses rising 10% in the quarter excluding those for divestitures of the Asia consumer business.
BUYBACKS
Citi has been using excess capital to buy back shares. Unlike other big banks, its stock trades at a discount to its net worth, making buybacks attractive.
The bank returned $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1 billion in dividends, and its share count was 6% lower than a year earlier.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects to do a ""modest"" level of buybacks in the second quarter that would be less than the $3 billion in the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters after the bank posted results. 
The first quarter repurchases came as Citi's capital account was hurt by unrealized losses on securities as a result of the recent rise in interest rates. 
Its Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio fell to 11.4% from 12.2% in December. The bank expects to have the ratio back up to 12% by year-end as earnings add to its capital, Mason said.
Citi needs about $7 billion of capital to meet that goal and expects about $4 billion to come as it closes previously announced sales of consumer banking businesses in Asia, Mason told analysts.
A similar, but worse, capital ratio decline was reported by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday, deepening concerns among investors that bank buybacks would be constrained this year.

Citigroup expects additional capital to come from the sales of its consumer businesses outside of the United States.
In Mexico, the bank is finding ""significant interest"" from potential buyers of its Citibanamex franchise, Fraser told analysts. It could still take ""a few quarters"" to dispose of the asset, she said.
 
"
69,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>",Citigroup in preliminary talks on selling Mexico business -execs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc is in early talks with possible buyers of its Mexico consumer banking business Citibanamex, executives said on Thursday, while cautioning that the sale process would be complex and could take a few quarters to complete.
Citi disclosed in January that it was looking for a buyer for the unit, Mexico's No. 3 consumer bank, which has struggled to trim costs to become more competitive with rivals like Spain's BBVA (BME:BBVA) and Santander (BME:SAN). 
Analysts have estimated that the bank, which Citi bought for $12.5 billion in 2001, could fetch between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Citi Chief Executive Jane Fraser told analysts that the bank was ""attracting a lot of attention"" in the talks with buyers, calling the sale a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""
Various potential bidders for the business have already surfaced, including Mexico's Grupo Financiero Banorte as well as Santander. 

Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters that recent geopolitical events could make the franchise more appealing to others than when Citi first announced its intention to sell.
Mason and Fraser both said the exit process was complex and could still include an initial public offering, with the CEO adding that it was unclear whether a deal would be completed this year or next.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Thursday as a wave of mostly better-than-expected quarterly results from major Wall Street banks failed to lift investor sentiment as tech stocks resumed their trend lower.
The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%, or 101 points lower, the Nasdaq slipped 1.4%.
Major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. But  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell more than 5% after reporting a decline in quarterly report.
The fall in bank stocks comes in the wake of rising Treasury yields, which tend to boost the margins on lending for banks, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lean aggressive on monetary policy tightening to curb inflation pressures.
The pace of the surge in yields has placed growth sectors of the market in the crosshairs, with big tech leading the decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 2%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were down more than 1%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) turned negative as many doubt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk’s $54.20 a share offer to take the social media company private will succeed.
“In our view, the deal does not get done at this level, and Twitter's Board will not view this offer, or Mr. Musk leading a change in the company as in the best interest of the company or shareholders,” Wedbush said in a note..
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Group, a major Dow component, was up 0.5% after cutting intraday losses following better-than-expected quarterly results and an increase in full-year guidance.
Energy, up about 1%, attempted to cushion the broader decline, underpinned by rising oil prices on fears about tightening global supplies as Russia and Ukraine look set to engage in a massive land battle in Eastern Ukraine.
On the economic front, investors digested a weaker picture as data showed initial jobless claims rose more than expected, while the latest retail sales report flagged the impact of red-hot inflation on the consumer.
Still economists remain sanguine on the strength of the consumer, citing excess savings built up during the pandemic.  
“[W]e remain quite constructive on the outlook, because of the combination of excess savings and robust wage growth, particularly in the bottom half of the income distribution” {{Jefferies said in a note.}}

Investing.com --  Redfin  Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN) stock tumbled 4% Thursday after it told investors that early-stage homebuying demand continues to falter this spring. 
New listings fell 7% from the previous year, according to the company's latest report. 
""At the same time, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate shot up to 5% and the median asking price climbed to $397,747, sending the typical homebuyer’s monthly payment up 35% year over year to an all-time high of $2,288,"" the technology-powered real estate brokerage explained.
Redfin pointed to ""key early indicators"" that show a softening of demand, including fewer Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""homes for sale,"" Redfin's seasonally adjusted Homebuyer Demand Index has declined 3% in the past four weeks compared to a 5% rise in the previous year, and mortgage purchase applications falling 6% year-on-year.
""There really is a limit to homebuyer demand, even though the market over the past few years has made it seem endless,” said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather. 
“The sharp increase in mortgage rates is pushing more homebuyers out of the market, but it also appears to be discouraging some homeowners from selling. With demand and supply both slipping, the market isn’t likely to flip from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market anytime soon.”
A Redfin real estate agent in Boston was quoted as saying that every recent offer has faced multiple other offers, but some people have finally had enough and are pulling out as they become less willing to make a risky offer.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 01:51PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo profit beats estimates on reserve release; revenue misses,"By Sohini Podder and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co posted a 21% drop in first-quarter profit but beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, as the release of funds set aside to cover potential pandemic-related loan losses cushioned a decline in mortgage lending. 
The fourth-largest U.S. lender posted a $3.67 billion profit, or 88 cents per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of 80 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. Total revenue fell 5% to $17.59 billion, compared with estimates of $17.8 billion.
Shares in the bank fell more than 3%. Analysts said that reflected investor worries that the bank's profits were flattered by the release $1.1 billion in reserves it set aside for pandemic-related losses that did not materialize, while the bank also failed to meet expectations on reducing expenses.
""Total revenue was slightly below expectations, with mixed results,"" wrote Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.
Big U.S. banks are unveiling first quarter results as the Federal Reserve moves to hike interest rates to tame surging inflation and as the conflict in Ukraine is causing volatility and uncertainty in the broader global economy. That could start to dampen consumer spending and loan growth, analysts said. 
So far, however, the American consumer remains healthy and is spending, and inflation is not currently a credit risk, said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo. 
Consumer spending has been rising for months as the United States emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and many make up for lost time traveling, shopping and dining out.
""People come into this in a pretty healthy position to deal with any potential challenges,"" he said on a conference call. ""Inflation is definitely having an impact on people. But so far that hasn't translated into any real stress from a credit perspective,"" said Santomassimo. 
Those factors, along with 3% loan growth and Fed rate hikes, led the bank to raise its guidance for full-year net interest income (NII) to around 15% from 8% last quarter. NII, a closely-watched measure of how much money banks make from lending, rose 5% during the quarter. 
Wells Fargo leans heavily on revenue from its consumer and corporate banking business, as it does not have a large capital markets division compared with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).
Overall average loans grew 3%, boosted by credit card and auto lending, which rose 6% and 10% respectively. Debit card purchase volumes were up 6%, while credit card point-of-sale volumes grew 33%. Mortgage loans, however, fell 33% from a year ago on lower originations and gains from home sales.
""They had some headwinds from mortgage banking. But loan growth was broad based - in consumer and commercial - and asset quality remains pristine,"" said John Mackerey, senior vice president in DBRS Morningstar's global financial institutions group.
The bank's non-interest expenses fell 1% on headcount cuts and real estate divestitures. While that was in line with Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf's plan to save about $10 billion annually over the long term, analysts were expecting more progress and noted the bank incurred charges related to remediating consumers for past sales practice misconduct. 

That may have dented investors' confidence that the bank can move beyond its scandals and be released from a Federal Reserve asset cap which restricts its loan growth, wrote Sanders. 
""While today was a fresh reminder that WFC still has a lot of work to, we expected some setbacks along the way in the long-term turnaround story we see at the company,"" Sanders added.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 01:25PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley to lead Intel's Mobileye IPO -sources","By Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) has tapped investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead preparations for the initial public offering of the self-driving car unit, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
The stock market flotation, which is set to launch later this year, could value Mobileye at as much as $50 billion, the sources said, cautioning that the timing, valuation and size of the IPO are subject to market conditions.
The amount to be raised in the IPO could not be learned and the sources requested anonymity because details of the IPO preparations are confidential. 
Representatives for Intel and Mobileye did not respond to requests for comment. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Mobileye's preparation is coming at a tough time for the IPO market. Stock market volatility triggered by a sell-off in technology stocks and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced several high-profile firms, including GoPuff and Chobani, to postpone their plans to go public this year. 
The IPO freeze followed a record-breaking 2021 in which more than $300 billion was raised through flotations. 
Only 21 companies, excluding listings of special purpose acquisition companies, have been listed on U.S. exchanges this year so far, according to Dealogic. Other major IPO hopefuls preparing for a listing this year include SoftBank-owned chip designed Arm and social media platform Reddit. 
Intel bought Mobileye for about $15.3 billion in 2017. The Israeli company uses a camera-based system with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance in driverless cars. Founded in 1999, Mobileye plans to eventually build its own lidar sensor to help its cars map out a three-dimensional view of the road. 
Mobileye, which counts BMW, Audi, Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and General Motors (NYSE:GM) as its clients, has been a bright spot for Intel, which faces stiff competition in the chip-making segment from rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.

The decision to list Mobileye is part of Intel's broader strategy under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger to turn around its core business. Intel expects to receive the majority of the proceeds from the share sale and use some of the funds to build more Intel chip plants, Gelsinger said in December.
Intel has said it will retain a majority stake in Mobileye after the IPO.

(Reuters) -A third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech produced significant protection against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in healthy children ages 5 to 11, the companies said on Thursday.
Blood serum analysis of 30 pediatric participants who received a booster dose in a study showed a 36-fold increase in Omicron neutralizing antibodies, the drugmakers said.
Neutralizing antibodies against the original version of the virus for which the vaccine was designed rose six-fold following the booster shot.
The companies said they plan to apply for U.S. emergency use authorization of a booster dose for the age group in coming days, with additional submissions to global regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency to follow.
The mid- to late-stage study was testing the safety and immunogenicity of a 10-microgram booster dose in 140 healthy children aged 5 through 11 years. Adults receive a 30-microgram does of the vaccine.
It is unclear how much demand there is for a third vaccine dose in the age group. Just 28% of children in the age group - around 8 million - are fully vaccinated, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Health experts called the data ""promising"" but cautioned that the study size was very small and said there was need for more data to understand the extent to which this booster prevents severe illness and hospitalization in children, and how it will fare against future variants.
""So overall, (the data) is very positive. But it also raises a number of questions. How durable will the response be? How well will it hold up to the future variants?,"" said Dr. Anna Bershteyn of NYU Langone Health.
There has been some scepticism on need for boosters in younger children given the reduced risk of severe infection and hospitalization in the age group.
Still, Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General Hospital for Children, said many parents have been asking for them.
""What we keep finding with the pandemic is that when we make available vaccines and boosters, even when they don't offer perfect protection against infection, they often are very protective against severe illness and hospitalization,"" Hadland told Reuters.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration authorized a third dose of the vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 and those aged 5 through 11 who are immunocompromised.
The agency at the time said it will weigh boosters for 5- to 11-year olds after more children have received two doses.

The New York state probe will focus on major companies that supply oil to the state, and refineries that turn crude into gasoline and independent operators of pipelines and terminals, the representative said, confirming a report on CNN https://cnn.it/3xsQixl.
The investigation will examine the state's entire supply chain, the representative said. 
Crude prices have hit 14-year highs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent U.S. sanctions on Moscow, including a U.S. ban on Russian energy imports.

U.S. President Joe Biden last month accused U.S. oil companies of enjoying record profits while Americans pay high gasoline prices. He called for increased output and service to benefit consumers instead of investors, and announced a record release of crude oil from strategic reserves.
Oil executives defended themselves https://reut.rs/37SerTz in the U.S. Congress last week from charges by lawmakers that they were gouging Americans with high fuel prices, saying they were boosting energy output and no one company sets the price of gasoline.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.7%, broadening a rise of 0.1% from earlier in the day, while euro zone shares advanced 0.6%.
The European Central Bank stuck to its plans of finally ending its stimulus programme in the third quarter, but avoided mentioning a precise schedule, stressing uncertainties around the Ukraine war. Short-dated yields and the euro were driven lower. [GVD/EUR] 
""With rate hikes expected to start some time after the end of asset purchases, this sequence provides the ECB flexibility and optionality for the coming months depending on economic developments,"" said Adrien Pichoud, chief economist at Syz Bank.
ECB President Christine Lagarde said the bank will only start raising interest rates ""some time"" after it has ended its net asset purchases. Money markets trimmed their rate hike bets, pricing in about 65 bps of rate hikes by year-end from 70 bps earlier. [IRPR]
The ECB is facing a tough policy trade-off that is far more complex than in other developed markets, said Anna Stupnytska, global macro economist at Fidelity International.
""As the growth shock becomes more evident, the ECB's focus will likely shift away from high inflation towards trying to limit economic and market distress... Contrary to market pricing, we do not expect the ECB to hike rates until the fourth quarter of this year or early 2023,"" Stupnytska said.
The ECB is lagging most other major central banks, which started raising interest rates last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Devin Nunes, the former California congressman and an ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, cannot revive his defamation lawsuit against CNN over reports he was involved in efforts to uncover damaging Ukraine-related information about Joe Biden.
In a 2-1 decision on Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Nunes failed to seek a correction fast enough, or show he deserved ""special damages"" for economic loss.
Circuit Judge William Nardini said the trial judge ""did not err"" in finding that Nunes did not comply with applicable California law governing retractions, and thus his $435 million lawsuit should be dismissed with prejudice.
CNN is a unit of Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) Inc.
A lawyer for Nunes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNN's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Nunes sued over a Nov. 22, 2019 article that said Lev Parnas, a then-indicted associate of former Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, was willing to testify before Congress that Nunes met in 2018 with a former Ukrainian prosecutor to discuss ""digging up dirt"" on Biden, a Democrat and now U.S. president.
The former Republican congressman also objected to a broadcast of CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" where the reporter and host Chris Cuomo discussed his alleged role in ""looking for dirt"" on Biden and his son Hunter.
Nunes denied the accusations, said his reputation was damaged, and branded CNN ""the mother of fake news.""
Circuit Judge Steven Menashi dissented from Thursday's decision, saying the laws of New York, where the reporter and Cuomo worked, governed Nunes' claims.
Trump appointed all three judges on the appeals court panel.
Nunes has sued several news organizations in recent years.
On April 1, another federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of Nunes' $250 million lawsuit claiming the Washington Post defamed him by implying he lied to Trump about who attended a Feb. 2020 intelligence briefing concerning Russia.

Nunes left Congress in December to become chief executive of the social media venture Trump Media & Technology Group.
Parnas is awaiting sentencing after being convicted in October on campaign finance charges.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Volkswagen on Thursday warned that it had started to feel the impact of the war in Ukraine on supply chains and raw materials prices in the first quarter, with the longer-term effects on its business difficult to predict. 
The company indicated an 8.5 billion euro ($9.27 billion)operating profit for the first three months of the year, but noted that 3.5 billion euros of that was attributable to commodity hedges amid soaring raw material prices.
Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) shares were 2.1% lower at 147.9 euros by 1054 GMT.
Its operating return on sales jumped to 13.5% in the first quarter, according to the preliminary figures, from 7.7% in the same period of 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic and semiconductor shortages were weighing heavily on results.
A spokesperson said in March that the company had long-term measures in place with suppliers to secure raw materials, including an ""extensive and forward-looking purchasing and hedging program for important precious metals"".
Nonetheless, Volkswagen warned at its annual results conference last month that the outbreak of war in Ukraine called its annual forecast of an 8-13% boost to revenue with a 5-10% increase in deliveries into question.
Volkswagen Group deliveries were down 21.9% in January to March, totalling just over 1.89 million vehicles, with brand deliveries down 25.6%. Still, deliveries of all-electric vehicles grew 65% to 99,100, with the biggest increase in China. 
Carmakers have prioritised their electric line-ups amid a shortage of semiconductors as a way to boost revenue and remain on track to meet tightening European climate regulations.
BMW reported last week that its deliveries in the first quarter had fallen 6.2% while Mercedes-Benz saw a drop of 15% from last year. 

Volkswagen is due to publish first-quarter results on May 4.

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group Inc on Thursday modestly raised its 2022 profit forecast, saying demand for healthcare procedures deferred during the pandemic was approaching normal levels but had not increased as feared.
Shares of the largest U.S. health insurer rose as much as 3% to touch a record high of $553.29 in early trading before slipping back to $542.86, up 1%.
While the company has seen pressure on earnings from costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment, some of that was offset by people avoiding non-urgent care during the pandemic.
And some U.S. hospitals were again compelled to defer elective surgeries during the record Omicron-fueled surge in COVID-19 in the first quarter. Cases have since dropped sharply from a pandemic peak in January.
Demand for certain procedures, such as cancer screenings, have picked up pace, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) said. However, emergency department and pediatric visits, which add to the health insurer's costs, were trending below normal levels, it said.
""What we haven't seen though is an expectation we had that incidence rates might come up because of missed treatments over the earlier period,"" Chief Financial Officer John Rex told analysts on a conference call.
UnitedHealth raised both ends of its 2022 profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects adjusted earnings of $21.20 to $21.70 per share.
Revenue at its Optum unit rose nearly 19% in the first quarter, with much of the boost coming from its medical services, the company said, adding that it was focused on improving value-based care offerings - under which healthcare providers are paid based on their value to patients - and expanding digital care and at-home services. 
""The continued strength of the OptumHealth business with the ongoing transition to value-based care probably was the most noteworthy trend,"" said Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) outperformed rival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in M&A advisory and its traders fared better than expectations, helping the investment banking powerhouse beat first-quarter profit estimates by a wide margin.
The bank's dealmakers nearly doubled advisory revenue even as Russia's invasion of Ukraine unsettled equity markets and forced companies to hold off on dealmaking and stock market listings.
The war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", and the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, however, boosted volatility in markets, helping the bank clock in a smaller-than-expected 6% fall in trading revenue.
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said inflationary pressures, tightening of monetary policy and the invasion of Ukraine ""injected significant uncertainty into the markets.""
Like other Wall Street banks, Morgan Stanley's underwriting business also took a hit, with revenue at its equity underwriting business falling nearly 83% percent from a year ago when it generated handsome fees from a spate of high-profile IPOs.
According to Refinitiv data, equity underwriting deal volumes fell 80% in the first quarter for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two most dominant financial advisers on initial public offerings (IPOs) globally.
""Results from Morgan Stanley were pretty good, in my opinion, reflecting considerable resiliency given the geopolitical events and substantial volatility in equity, fixed income and commodities markets,"" said James P. Shanahan, senior equity research analyst, North American financials, at Edward Jones.
Morgan Stanley also reported a steep decline in fixed income underwriting revenue, hurt by lower bond issuances.
Return on tangible equity, a closely-watched metric for profitability that measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit, was 19.8% during the quarter. The figure was well above the bank's two-year target of between 14% and 16%.
The bank's shares rose 3.2% in morning trading, after falling more than 11% this year.
DEAL BOOST
Morgan Stanley's dealmakers brought in $944 million in advisory revenues in the quarter, compared with $480 million a year ago, helped by the completion of deals that were initiated last year.
By contrast, Goldman Sachs' revenue from advising on deal remained largely unchanged at $1.13 billion in the first quarter.
Morgan Stanley's Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said investment banking pipelines remained healthy, but cautioned that macro economic uncertainties could delay deal closings.
Overall investment banking revenue slumped 38% to $1.76 billion. The unit consists of the bank's advisory, equity underwriting and fixed income underwriting businesses.
Morgan Stanley's profit fell 11% to $3.54 billion, or $2.02 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of $1.68 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Total expenses fell to $4.83 billion from $5.3 billion a year earlier.
Net revenue fell 6% in the quarter to $14.8 billion, but beat estimates of $14.27 billion.

WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the feature would bring together groups, which are capped at 256 users, under bigger umbrellas where administrators could send alerts to a community of thousands. 
""This is really oriented at the communities you're already a part of in your life that are doing private communication,"" said Cathcart in an interview with Reuters, citing Salesforce-owned Slack or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams as comparable types of communication.
He said there were no current plans to charge for the new feature, which is being beta tested with a small number of global communities, but did not rule out offering ""premium features to enterprise"" in the future.
The messaging service, which is end-to-end encrypted and has about 2 billion users, said the Communities feature would also be end-to-end encrypted. 
WhatsApp has grappled with abuses including bulk messaging and the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Cathcart said users would not be able to search for different Communities on WhatsApp and that it would use anti-abuse tools and safeguards like forwarding limits for the new feature.
WhatsApp said there would also be changes to its Groups feature before the launch of Communities. It said it was adding the ability for group administrators to remove problematic messages from everyone's chat, introducing voice calling for up to 32 people, increasing file sharing to 2 gigabytes and adding emoji reactions to messages. 

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that Communities would be rolled out over the coming months. He said Meta would be building community messaging features for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Messenger and Instagram.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>",Berliners' reliance on Russian fuel exposes German dilemma on Ukraine,"By Vera Eckert, Shadia Nasralla and Ron Bousso
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - People on the streets of Berlin have waved Ukrainian flags in demonstrations of support since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. But those who drove to the rallies did so largely in cars powered by oil from Russia, which provides most of the fuel to the German capital.
Just over a third of Germany's crude oil came from Russia last year, official data shows. Until the invasion of Ukraine in February, the dependence of Europe's largest economy on cheap energy from Russia – in part, a legacy of the Cold War – was not viewed as problematic by the authorities. 
Now, German politicians say it may threaten the country’s security and want to wean Germany off Russian oil.
A Russian-owned refinery at Schwedt, a 90-minute drive from Berlin, has become a focus of the debate. 
Nine out of 10 cars in the capital and the surrounding state of Brandenberg are powered by its fuel, and 50% of the electricity it generates is fed into the state grid. ""We drive Berlin and Brandenburg,"" the refinery says on its website.
The refinery, PCK Schwedt, is majority-owned and operated by Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. All the oil it refines comes from Russia. 
The refinery was thrust into the political spotlight on the eve of the war by Rosneft's plan to increase its stake substantially, a request that Germany’s government has placed under review amid concerns that its energy reliance on Russia has grown too acute.
""It now turns out to have been a mistake to give a Russian state-owned company such a responsibility for the economy,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of the Greens party, told reporters in late March, when asked about the future of the Schwedt refinery.
A spokesperson for PCK Schwedt did not respond to a request for comment about officials’ concerns over fuel security. 
The refinery’s capacity of 233,000 barrels per day amounts to about one-tenth of Germany's pre-pandemic consumption. The nearby Leuna refinery, owned by France's TotalEnergies and with a similar capacity, also relies on the same pipeline from Russia for most of its oil. [L2N2W50OH]
Graphic: German crude oil imports - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/GERMANY-OIL/movanbklkpa/chart.png
Calls for the 27-nation European Union to impose an outright oil embargo on Russia have gained impetus in recent weeks, after images of civilian killings in Ukraine prompted the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into alleged war crimes. 
Moscow, which calls its campaign a ""special operation,"" says it has not targeted civilians. 
EU governments said on Monday the bloc's executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude but diplomats said Germany - which has already reduced its consumption of Russian oil and gas - was not actively supporting an immediate embargo. 
Ukraine's president has said Moscow is making so much money from oil exports that it does not need to take peace talks seriously and has called on Germany to cut its energy ties with Russia quickly.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Opinion polls over the past few weeks show less than half of Germans want to halt the import of Russian oil and gas. Several Berliners buying petrol on a recent morning questioned whether an embargo would hurt Russia.
""It's a conflict of conscience: of course we want to help the Ukrainians but even if we were to accept higher prices, would it actually help them?"" said Melanie Barthel, 29.
Berlin's mayor, Franziska Giffey, told German newspaper Handesblatt on April 7 she was worried that such a large share of eastern Germany's fuel supply depended on the Schwedt refinery. 
Referring to Schwedt, Giffey told the newspaper there may be cases where nationalisation ""is unavoidable."" She did not respond to a request for further comment. 
Asked about the debate in Germany over whether to halt Russian fuel supplies, Rosneft said in a statement to Reuters it has owned assets there for more than 10 years and has invested 4 billion euros in modernization during that time, helping to lower fuel prices for consumers and to guarantee German energy security. 
Rosneft said that any illegal seizure of its assets would be a gross violation of private property rights and would destabilize the investment climate in Germany, jeopardizing the interests of foreign investors.
FROM FRIENDSHIP TO THREAT
The PCK Schwedt refinery, like Berlin itself, used to be the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. It was built in the 1960s to process Russian oil shipped to satellite states of the former Soviet Union. 
The oil is pumped through one of the world’s longest pipelines. Its name, ""Druzhba"", means friendship: Moscow built it to supply its import-dependent allies.
Refineries in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic also rely on Russian oil.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Western oil companies bought into Schwedt, but Rosneft owns 54% of the plant and controls it. 
In March, Germany's Economy Ministry said it was reviewing a plan for Rosneft to purchase Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC's stake in the refinery, which would leave the Russian oil giant holding nearly 92%.
""The Russian attack changed our whole security evaluation,"" a German government source told Reuters. ""In this context, Rosneft's control was considered a possible threat.""
The review, a confidential process, comes under a foreign trade law designed to protect German security, technology and intellectual property from non-European Union investors. 
People familiar with the situation could not say how long the Schwedt review would take or what Germany would do if it concluded Rosneft's role is a security threat. 
Shell said in a statement to Reuters it had been clear about its intent for a phased withdrawal from Russian hydrocarbons following the invasion, and was in discussions with governments about how to maintain supplies to consumers. 
""Ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made,"" the statement said. 
Habeck, the Economy Minister, told reporters this month the government was working flat out to resolve the refinery’s situation in order to achieve ""oil independence from Russia"".
The German government took temporary control of another Russian energy business on April 4: it put Russian gas giant Gazprom’s local unit - Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Germania - under the control of the regulator after Gazprom attempted to sell its subsidiary to two other Russian companies. 
Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment. 
The stalled sale leaves Shell in a quandary. A senior Shell source told Reuters it would be surprising if the German regulator approved the disposal of its stake in Schwedt to Rosneft: ""We will have to figure out what to do next, but for now there isn't much we can do,"" said the source.
The remaining shares in the refinery are owned by Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA, which said it had been looking to sell them before the invasion. After Russia invaded, Eni, like many oil companies, said it would not sign new supply deals with Russia.
ALTERNATIVES
For Germany, replacing Russian oil will be a mammoth task. Germany imports oil through other pipelines, including one from Italy, but Russia is by far its largest supplier. The second biggest, the United States, delivered just 13% of its total imports.
In addition to Schwedt, Rosneft owns minority stakes in two other German refineries and supplies them with some crude, although they also purchase oil from elsewhere. 
Finding alternative supplies for PCK Schwedt will be a challenge, industry experts say. 
The refinery was built to process Russian urals crude via the Druzhba pipeline and the only other duct supplying it - from the Baltic Sea port of Rostock - can transport just a fraction of the oil it needs.
The Baltic ports receive oil imports from other producers - such as Saudi Arabia and the United States - but Schwedt would have to compete for that as eastern European refineries hunt for alternatives to Russian crude. 

Rosneft said in a statement that shifting to alternative crude supplies at Schwedt would increase costs considerably and would raise fuel prices for German consumers.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank's Chief Executive Bharat Masrani on Thursday criticized the Canadian Liberal government's planned tax on banks and called for policymakers to ensure Canada plays a ""meaningful role"" in supporting energy security.
Canada plans to raise corporate taxes for the most profitable banks and insurers to 16.5% from 15% on all taxable income over C$100 million ($79.6 million), and imposed a one-time 15% tax on income over C$1 billion.
The proposal, first floated as a campaign promise by the Liberals in August, was detailed in last week's federal budget. The proposal had already drawn the ire of bank executives and investors even before the budget announcement.
In his prepared remarks to the bank's annual shareholder meeting, Masrani said the government's decision to single out the banking sector was not good tax policy and could lead to ""unintended consequences"".
""One of our greatest advantages is that we have among the strongest and most stable financial systems in the world,"" he said. ""We must extend our leadership on the world stage as a global banking centre.""
Masrani also called for Canada to play a ""meaningful role"" to support energy security across North America and globally, saying a transition to a low-carbon future will take years.
TD and other Canadian banks have been criticized by climate-conscious investors for their continued support of fossil fuel companies. Up for a vote at the meeting is a shareholder proposal calling for the bank to stop financing new fossil fuel supplies by the end of this year, which the board of directors recommended investors vote against. 

""Without a reliable and responsible energy supply to meet current and future demand, progress may stall, with devastating economic and social consequences,"" he said. ""The pressure on energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine is a clear example of the risks.""

Teladoc acquired Livongo in August 2020 in a deal worth $18.5 billion.
""We counted 71.8K Livongo app downloads in 1Q22. This is up 56% vs. the 46.2K downloads recorded in 4Q21, but down (21)% y/y from 1Q21 when we recorded 91.0K downloads,"" wrote Tassan.

Market reaction:
Euro zone bond yields fell after the policy statement, with German two-year bond yields falling more than 10 bps on the day. 
The euro slipped into negative territory, down 0.8%
Money markets also trimmed expectations of rate hikes by the end of the year. 
Here is a summary of analyst comments:
ANNA STUPNYTSKA, GLOBAL MACRO ECONOMIST, FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL:
""Recession in Europe is already our base case, but its magnitude and duration crucially depend on the nature of further sanctions on Russia. As a full energy embargo is becoming more likely, so is the worst-case recession scenario. 
We believe as the growth shock becomes more evident in the data over the next few weeks, the ECB's focus will likely shift away from high inflation towards trying to limit economic and market distress as the invasion of Ukraine and its consequences continues to ripple through the system. 
Contrary to market pricing, we do not expect the ECB to hike rates until Q4 this year or early 2023.""
CARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO AT ING:
""Interest rates remain unchanged, and there was no new hint at the future path of rates. To probably tackle the recent debate on how the ECB could deal with widening bonds spreads and rumours about a new asset purchase programme, the ECB stressed that the reinvestments of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme could be used to tackle market fragmentation.""
""Europe is different and the ECB is different. Instead of any panic reaction, the ECB continues with its very gradual normalisation, which in our view is bringing an end to net asset purchases over the summer and an end to the era of negative interest rates before the end of the year.""
KENNETH BROUX, FX STRATEGIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, LONDON:
""The knee-jerk pullback in the euro/dollar suggests some were positioned for something more hawkish from the European Central Bank.""
MARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS:
""It was a more dovish press conference than markets were expecting. Inflation has overshot their projections and we should get an upward revisions in June, and they are comfortable in winding down QE.""
But beyond that, they are not ready to push policy further.
A big part of the press conference was focused on the deteriorating outlook and the hit to confidence triggered by the war in Ukraine. There's also concern about a tightening in monetary conditions, so there is a sense that markets are tightening policy in the absence of the ECB doing it and that could choke off the recovery.""
STEVE RYDER, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AVIVA INVESTORS GLOBAL SOVEREIGN BOND FUND:
""Downside risks to growth are increasing and uncertainty around Ukraine and the impact on inflation will continue to weigh on confidence. With markets already pricing a significant degree of rate normalisation we see the rate outlook from here as much more balanced.""
STUART COLE, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON

""We have had confirmation that the asset purchase programme will end in Q3. That leaves open the possibility of an interest rate rise being delivered before year-end and accordingly market expectations of a first hike coming in December are likely to firm.
""But they are also keeping open the possibility of providing more support if needed, noting that the PEPP can be restarted in the event of another COVID crisis - and you can probably add to that if the economic fallout from the Ukraine war turns out to be worse than anticipated.""

101,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 09:50AM ET</span>","Benettons, Blackstone buyout proposal values Atlantia at $63 billion","By Francesca Landini and Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Benetton family and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) have proposed a 58 billion euro ($63 billion) buyout offer for Atlantia, to take it private and stave off rival interest for the airport and motorway operator. 
Highlighting the appeal of the infrastructure sector, the deal would be this year's second-biggest M&A transaction globally after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). 
Alessandro Benetton, chairman of the family holding company Edizione since January, said one of the aims was to preserve the integrity of Atlantia and its Italian identity, adding they had found in Blackstone a long-term co-investor and partner.
Edizione owns a third of Atlantia.
The bid heralds a new phase for Atlantia which is selling its domestic motorway unit to draw a line under a political dispute sparked by a deadly bridge collapse in 2018.
The sale, which will cut Atlantia's end-2021 debt of 38.6 billion euros, will bring 8 billion euros into its coffers. Net of debt the offer values the group at 19 billion euros.
""The gargantuan Benetton and Blackstone-led Atlantia deal redefines how investors will think about infrastructure investments due to its sheer size alone,"" said Wylie Fernyhough, senior private equity analyst at PitchBook. 
The Benettons and Blackstone said on Thursday they would offer 23 euros per share, a premium of 24.4% to the share price on April 5, before speculation about the offer fuelled gains.
The premium rises when taking into account that investors who tender their shares will still receive a proposed dividend of 0.74 euros a share.
Blackstone, which is also part of a consortium led by Italy's state-owned lender CDP expected to complete the purchase of Atlantia's domestic motorway business next month, said it believed in the strength of the Italian economy and the future opportunities it would offer.
Shares in Atlantia, which have gained almost a fifth over the past 10 days, rose 4.4% to 22.85 euros each on Thursday.
Analysts said the bid's price appeared adequate and, with shares aligned to it, deemed a counterbid unlikely for the moment.
The Benettons last week said they were in talks with Blackstone after they rejected an approach by investment funds Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield to acquire Atlantia and hand its motorway concessions to Florentino Perez's Spanish construction group ACS. 
GIP, Brookfield and ACS were not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
NEW CHAPTER
The Benettons and Blackstone are set to spend up to 12.7 billion euros, financed partly with 8.2 billion euros in debt.
""The deal illustrates the depth of private markets and how attractive infrastructure assets have become in this inflationary environment,"" Fernyhough said.
Atlantia's delisting would open a new chapter for the company after the threat of being stripped of its motorway concession put its business at risk, while the death of 43 people in the bridge disaster tarnished its reputation.
Atlantia runs five airports and nearly 10,000 kilometres of motorway around the world.
With 33% of Atlantia already in the hands of the Benettons, the bid targets 66.9% of the group's share capital and is conditional on reaching a 90% acceptance threshold.
""There is a good chance of reaching the targeted ... threshold,"" Bestinver analyst Marco Opipari said.
UKRAINE CLAUSE
The offer is also subject to a clause that would allow bidders to walk away in the event of major unfavourable circumstances arising, including in relation to the Ukraine conflict.
""The material adverse change condition ... specifically carves in potential developments in Russia/Ukraine,"" vice president Alastair Mankin at Cowen investment bank said.
Under Italian rules, Atlantia will be allowed to give its opinion on the bid only once market regulators approve the offer's prospectus and the document is officially published. 
Edizione will have 65% of the investment vehicle launching the offer for Atlantia, with the U.S. company holding the rest.
Italian banking foundation CRT, a long-time investor in Atlantia, is expected to tender its full 4.5% stake under the offer, reinvesting the proceeds into the bid's vehicle if the offer goes through.
Alessandro Benetton on Thursday said the proposed deal was open to other current investors in Atlantia, suggesting that relevant shareholders who decide to join the offer could in turn get a stake in the delisted Atlantia.
Other investors in the group include Singapore's sovereign fund GIC, with a 8.3% stake, and HSBC Holding, with a 5% stake, according to Atlantia's website. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), UBS, UniCredit are acting as financial advisers for the Benettons and Blackstone. Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici, Legance, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP are legal advisers.

The fee raise is set to come into effect on April 28 and will apply to apparel as well as non-apparel items, the company said.
The move comes a few months after Amazon hiked fees in January due to rising costs including higher hourly wages, hiring expenses, and construction of new warehouses. The e-commerce giant claims it hiked fees only to offset permanent costs and to remain competitive with other fulfillment services providers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS).
“In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as COVID-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges,” Amazon said.
Inflation rose 8.5% in March, reaching the fastest rate in over 40 years, while gas prices are up 48% over the past 12 months.
Sellers paid $103 billion in fees to Amazon in 2021, accounting for roughly 22% of its revenue.
The surcharge will affect items ordered prior to April 28 but shipped and delivered after that date, Amazon said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak shared his 3 takeaways from the report:
UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley is positive on the news.
“We think Amazon’s fuel and inflation surcharge on FBA fees adds ~$2.5B in incremental offsets to higher fuel prices, and more important, underscores its commitment to driving margin improvement in 2H 2022, in our view. We think investors had, appropriately, started to worry about the margin story this year with rising fuel prices and, now, the threat of unionization (which could spur more wage hikes). This move, in our view, bolsters the margin story considerably, particularly given how unprecedented the move is coming from Amazon,” Walmsley said in a client note.

(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 43% drop in profit but beat Wall Street expectations on Friday, as strong performances in its wealth management and trading businesses partly offset a slump in equity underwriting as stock market listings dried up.
Wall Street banks have come under pressure amid a slump in dealmaking globally, but volatility fueled by concerns around interest rate hikes and the economic fallout of the Ukraine war helped Goldman's trading desks smash expectations.
The bank's global markets segment reported net revenue of $7.87 billion, a 4% jump from last year when accommodative monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve led to bumper levels of trading activity. The robust performance was driven by a 21% rise in fixed income revenue, the bank said.
The Wall Street bank has also been taking measures under Chief Executive David Solomon to diversify its revenue stream and earn more from predictable sources like consumer banking, wealth and asset management. 
Consumer and wealth management recorded a 21% jump in net revenues to $2.10 billion, helped by higher management fees and credit card balances.
Investment banking revenue, however, dropped 36% to $2.41 billion, as fees from advising on stock market listings and debt underwriting declined against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. 
""It was a turbulent quarter dominated by the devastating invasion of Ukraine,"" Solomon said. Goldman was the first major U.S. bank to retreat from Russia.
""The rapidly evolving market environment had a significant effect on client activity as risk intermediation came to the fore and equity issuance came to a near standstill,"" Solomon added.
Goldman's revenue from advising on deal remained largely unchanged at $1.13 billion, in sharp contrast to rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), whose revenue from the business doubled. 
With the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning to wean the economy off pandemic-era support, dealmaking slowed in the quarter and cast a pall over some of Goldman's most lucrative businesses. 
Goldman also cut operating expenses by 18% in the quarter, chiefly due to lower spending on compensation and benefits.

The bank posted profit applicable to common shareholders of $3.83 billion, or $10.76 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected $8.89 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total net revenue fell to $12.93 billion in the quarter, down nearly 27% from last year.

Musk said that this is his best and final offer and if not accepted, he would reconsider his position as a shareholder.
Twitter then confirmed it has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Elon Musk, which will be carefully reviewed “to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.”
Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli says the offer is “too low” given that Twitter shares were at about $70 less than a year ago.
Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster believes the current offer to be Musk’s final one.
“Welcome to the world of Elon Musk -- unpredictable by design. His approach is to think big, he’s doing that here,” Munster told Bloomberg.
Finally, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives believes Musk will eventually get what he wants.
“We believe this soap opera will end with Musk owning Twitter after this aggressive hostile takeover of the company. It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,” Ives said in a client note.
He urged investors to prepare for a soap opera as he expects “many twists and turns in the weeks ahead as Twitter and Musk walk down this marriage path.”
Twitter stock price is up 6% in pre-market after initially soaring 13%.

WDC stock is downgraded to Neutral from Positive with a $50.00 per share price target, down from $80.00. On the other hand, STX shares are cut to Negative from Neutral with a PT of $65.00, down from $93.00.
Hosseini expects quarterly cloud spending to peak in the second half of this year, followed by weaker demand into 2023.
“On the NAND/SSD side, we expect blended ASPs to rebound in June/Sep quarters, following a shallow correction in 2HCY21 and flattish trend in the Mar-Q. However, with the overall Cloud/Enterprise demand waning into YE22, we expect NAND ASPs to flatten out and actually decline again by YE22. Enterprise SSD is estimated to account for 38% of the overall NAND bit demand, followed by 25% attributed to Client SSD, and 20% to smartphones. All in all, we are updating estimates, with our overall CY23 EPS estimates for both STX and WDC 30%+ below the current consensus,” Hosseini said in a client note.
While the analyst takes into consideration that both STX and WDC are down 28% YTD, he still sees a downside risk, especially for the former, given “the extent of deceleration in Cloud capex spend by YE22 and into 2023, and its impact.”
Despite a relatively stronger Nearline shipment in 2HCY22, we believe the 30% downside risk to CY23 is the biggest overhang that cannot be avoided,” the analyst concluded.

Barrick said gold output was lower at its Carlin and Cortez mines due to depletion of stockpiled higher grade underground ore after the mechanical mill failure at a roaster facility, which processes the gold ore, in the second quarter last year.
The Carlin and Cortez mines are part of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Corp. 
The company, which is scheduled to release its first-quarter results on May 4, said the average market price for gold in the quarter was $1,877 per ounce, up from $1,795 per ounce in the prior quarter.
Barrick said it expects the company's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for gold, a key industry metric, to be 19% to 21% higher from the fourth quarter, while AISC for copper is expected to be 1% to 3% lower. 
Miners have been hit hard by a pandemic-led rise in expenses as they implement prevention measures to ensure the safety of workers and surrounding communities, with supply-chain issues due to global restrictions on movement adding to their woes.
Barrick said its gold production in 2022 is expected to increase through the year, while copper production is expected to be higher in the second half.
The company's copper production during the quarter was 101 million pounds, down 19.84% from the previous quarter, hurt by lower output at its Lumwana mine, while total preliminary gold production was down 17.7% at 990 million ounces. 

Analysts on an average expected gold production of 1.025 million ounces, according to Refinitiv IBES.
U.S.-listed shares of the company, which have gained nearly 34% so far this year, were down 0.9% in premarket trading.

BBBY reported 4Q EPS of -$0.92 on -12% comps, a big miss compared to the Street consensus of $0.13 on -8.3% comps.
Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández downgraded BBBY stock to Underperform from Market Perform with a $15.00 per share price target, down from $18.00. The analyst believes BBBY shares are overvalued by the market as they don’t reflect “weakening financial performance.”
Fernández adds that BBBY faces “a more challenging US consumer backdrop and ongoing supply chain challenges in 2022.”
“Both the 4Q21 result and 1Q22 quarter-to-date sales trend came in well below expectations, resulting in a significant downward revision to our 2022-2023 sales and earnings estimates and further eroding confidence in the turnaround. While the management team has made progress on rolling out private label brands and remodeling stores, there have been execution missteps around marketing and promotions. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond's legacy supply chain infrastructure limits the ability to move inventory around quickly and efficiently and offset the financial impact during a period of disruption. All in, the company's performance gap vs. home furnishings peers continues to widen,” Fernández said in a client note.
BofA analyst Jason Haas cut the price target to $8.00 per share from $9.50 on the Sell-rated BBBY stock after “meaningfully cutting our estimates following BBBY’s disappointing 4Q results and outlook.”
“We’re increasingly concerned by BBBY’s leverage and cash burn,” the analyst added.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs) analyst Kate McShane reiterated a Sell rating and slashed the price target by 50% to $7.00 amid “the ongoing weakness in quarter-to-date comp trends that is expected to remain till at least 1H and continuously challenged store comps.”

Before making its decision, the health agency wants to look at additional data submitted by Regeneron on using the antibody cocktail as a preventive treatment.
The FDA has not asked for any extra studies to complete its review and will now decide on the drug by July 13, Regeneron said.
Regeneron's ""cocktail"" of two monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, had received an emergency use authorization in the United States in late 2020 to treat patients who were 12 years and older with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
The therapy, called REGEN-COV, was later also authorized in the country for the prevention of COVID-19 in certain people exposed to an infected individual, or who were at high risk of such exposure.

However, data showed that REGEN-COV and a rival monoclonal antibody drug from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) were unlikely to be effective against the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant. That led the U.S. FDA to revise the emergency use authorizations for both therapies to limit their use.
Regeneron is collaborating with Roche, which is primarily responsible for the development and distribution of the treatment outside the United States.

The analyst argues that IBM offers a shelter for investors looking to “hide” amid growing macro risks. He reminds investors that IBM is negatively correlated with PMIs and historical late-cycle outperformance.
“While a recession isn't yet the base case, our US Economics team sees rising risk of a US recession and forecasts decelerating PMIs, indicative of a late cycle when IT Hardware stocks typically underperform the S&P 500. What's more, our recent AlphaWise CIO Survey and VAR checks suggest hardware budgets are about to be cut as companies maneuver geopolitical uncertainty and rising costs,” Woodring said in a client note.
Woodring reiterates that the IBM upgrade is a relative call as the company is well-positioned to “weather macro storm.”
“IBM is likely to outperform in a scenario of IT hardware budget cuts, with over half of revenue derived from more defensive recurring revenue streams and only 20% of IBM's revenue directly tied to hardware and related OS revenue. In fact, IBM shares have historically been negatively correlated with PMIs and shares typically outperform our IT Hardware coverage late cycle on a combination of lower earnings risk and far less multiple compression. These factors combined with the fact that IBM will be entering mainframe and ELA cycles in 2H give us confidence the business is positioned to outperform through the rest of this year,” the analyst added.
BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan is also bullish on IBM although he lowered estimates ahead of the company’s Q1 earnings report that is due next Tuesday.
“Investors are looking for IBM to report consistent quarters of revenue beats, which we believe is achievable (provided no macroeconomic shock to global economies). Reiterate Buy on expectations that the company will achieve its mid-term rev/FCF targets,” Mohan wrote in a memo.
IBM stock price is up nearly 2% in pre-open Thursday.

Investing.com -- Earnings from three of the U.S.'s biggest retail lenders all exceeded expectations in the first quarter, offering some reassurance for the coming earnings season after a disappointing lead from bellwether JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said adjusted earnings per share were 88c in the quarter, some 10c higher than forecast, while PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) beat expectations by over 20% and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) beat by 5%. 
However, initial reactions to the announcement were negative, as participants focused instead on the fact that Wells Fargo's revenue - arguably a better reflection of ongoing trends in its everyday business, fell short of expectations at $17.59 billion. Analysts had expected on average $17.8 billion. Both figures were down from an exceptional first quarter a year ago. 
Wall Street's blue-bloods also managed to deliver a positive surprise: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs both reported annual declines in profit, but both banks' numbers came in ahead of expectations.
Goldman's (NYSE:GS) earnings per share fell 43% on the year to $10.76, while revenue fell by just over a quarter to $12.93 billion. For  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the decline in earnings was a gentler 7%, while revenue fell 6% to $14.8 billion. For both banks, somewhat better-than-expected trading results helped to offset a sharp decline in revenue from dealmaking.  
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), meanwhile, also reported a 44% drop in earnings but it, too, performed better than expected, thanks largely to its consumer lending and credit cards business.
“We like where this business is headed,"" Citi CEO Jane Fraser said. She acknowledged however that the bank's efforts to scoop up more wealth management mandates from the ultra-rich around the world had suffered due to ""geopolitics"".
On Wednesday, JPMorgan stock had finished at a 52-week low after it reportedmp a 42% year-on-year drop in net profit. While that had been largely expected, the reality of cooling financial markets and a warning about future uncertainties from CEO Jamie Dimon both weighed heavily on the stock's performance. 
As with Dimon, Wells's CEO Charlie Scharf warned that the Federal Reserve's planned monetary policy tightening and the Ukraine war represented substantial risks to the outlook. 
""Our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers’ financial position, but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth,"" Scharf said in a statement. He added that he expected a rise in credit losses from their current level, which are low by historical comparison. The bank released a net $1.1 billion in provisions for credit losses in the quarter as the risks related to the pandemic faded.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) has appointed a new manager to oversee a $2 billion Asian high yield fund, the Swiss bank said in a statement, after a five-month hiatus in top leadership at the fund that was hit hard by China's property sector debt crisis.
Raymond Lin Gui will join UBS' asset management arm in Hong Kong on May 2, as head of portfolio management for Asia fixed income, according to the statement on Thursday. 
Gui, who previously worked as co-chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at Hong Kong-based Income Partners Asset Management, will be the lead manager of the Asian High Yield fund, the statement said.
He will report to Hayden Briscoe, head of global emerging markets and Asia pacific fixed income.
Gui's predecessor, Singapore-based Ross Dilkes, left UBS late last year. The Asian High Yield fund lost around 18% in 2021, according to its factsheet, mainly dented by a market rout in China's embattled property companies.
At the end of 2021, the fund held large positions in dollar-denominated bonds issued by several troubled Chinese developers, including China Evergrande Group, Kaisa Group and Sunac China, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the development. 
The three developers have missed payment deadlines on some of their debt and their shares have been suspended from trading in Hong Kong. 
The UBS fund has lost another 16% so far this year, with more than 30% of the portfolio exposed to the Asia real estate sector at the end of February, according to its factsheet.

Assets under the fund have tumbled by more than $1 billion since the beginning of this year.
Gui will work with Smit Rastogi, who has been at UBS for more than five years and was appointed as co-portfolio manager for the fund in January this year, said the statement.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country’s anti-graft watchdog, was involved in the investigation that sought to understand the links between Jack Ma’s fintech giant and state-backed banks and companies.
The agency was one of the regulators that sent queries to state enterprises in February as a part of Beijing's investigation of the former head of the Hangzhou party, Zhou Jiangyong.
Earlier this week, China’s prosecutors charged Jiangyong, accusing him of receiving substantial bribes.
While state-owned banks and companies involved in the investigation have sent their reports on their relationship with Ant, there has not been any action from the regulators yet, according to the report by Bloomberg.
A few months ago, state media released a documentary that showed Jiangyong leveraging his relationship with Chinese tech companies to support his younger brother’s business. One of the companies received an investment from a firm managed by Ant Group.
CCDI’s investigation of Ant comes as a part of Xi Jinping’s unrivaled battle against graft within the Communist Party. Beijing has recently encouraged the CCDI to investigate officials in the financial industry, a probe that has resulted in ensnaring numerous executives in the sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The owner of Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo on Thursday flagged a big profit drop in China due to COVID-19 restrictions, while its chief executive sounded alarm about the weakening yen's potential to drive up costs.
Fast Retailing is a rare bellwether for both global retailers in China, its biggest foreign market, and consumer demand in Japan, where it has carved out a dominant position by offering casual clothing to famously price-conscious shoppers. 
It and other multi-national retailers are now being forced to deal with lockdown measures in China. Fast Retailing has 863 stores on the mainland and almost 90 outlets in Shanghai, where strict measures, introduced in late March, remain in place to contain the country's worst outbreak of the pandemic.
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which each have dozens of outlets in Shanghai, have also been impacted as has production for retailers such as H&M, and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Fast Retailing said it expects revenue declines and a large drop in profit in its Greater China segment in the second half and for the whole of fiscal 2022 due to COVID restrictions.
Sales in the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, were hit in March, as up to 133 stores were temporarily shut.
It has more Uniqlo stores in China than in Japan. It opened a flagship store in Beijing in November, and plans to open in 100 locations in the country each year.
Separately, luxury brand Hermes said it had a strong start of the year in China until the beginning of March and is confident stores closed in Shanghai will reopen quickly.
'NO MERIT'
But the weakening yen and higher costs have forced Fast Retailing to consider price rises, a major shift for a company that has long competed on price. 
""There's absolutely no merit to a weak yen,"" Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai told reporters.
""Japan is engaged in the business of importing raw materials from all over the world, processing them, adding value to them, and selling them. In this context, there is no advantage if the value of a country's currency weakens.""
The yen has been hammered this year, falling to the weakest level in almost 20 years against the dollar. For many Japanese companies that manufacture offshore - like Fast Retailing - the weak yen is less of a benefit than for traditional exporters.
The company reported a record half-year profit on Thursday, buoyed by sales growth in North America, Europe, and other parts of Asia, while revenue and profit declined in Japan and China.
Operating profit climbed 18% to 189 billion yen ($1.51 billion) in the six months through February from a year earlier.
The company maintained its full-year profit forecast at 270 billion yen. That compares with a consensus forecast for annual profit to total 278 billion yen, according to a Refinitiv poll of 11 analysts.
The Ukraine crisis has created another headwind, leading the company to close its 50 stores in Russia, after it initially resisted calls to exit the market along with other major brands.

Prior to the earnings release, shares in Fast Retailing closed up 2.1%, versus a 1.2% gain in the broader market. But they have fallen nearly 9% so far this year.

130,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 05:49AM ET</span>","Volkswagen Falls After March Deliveries Slump, Hedges Turn Sour","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) stock fell in morning trading in Europe on Thursday after the world's second-biggest carmaker said deliveries slumped 31% in March due to Russia's war in Ukraine and ongoing problems in its supply chain.
It also warned of a potential financial hit from volatility in ""unpredictable"" commodity markets, saying that developments there could have ""significant impacts on the valuation of hedging operations.""
The warning comes a day after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) admitted it had lost $120 million due to the price spike in nickel on the London Metals Exchange. Prices for other battery metals and copper have also been volatile so far this year. However, VW didn't give any further details of its exposures. 
Volkswagen preferred stock fell 1.6% on the news, making it one of the worst performers in the benchmark DAX index on the day. 
At a group level, deliveries were down 31% on the year in March at 655,800. 
The idling of its plant in Kaluga, Russia, and the interruption of supplies of wire harnesses from facilities in Ukraine due to the war led to deliveries falling 43% in eastern Europe and 24% in western Europe, its biggest market. Sales were hurt most at its mass-market brand, as the company prioritized its higher-margin Porsche and Audi businesses for scarce inputs. 
However, its operations in China also appeared to be heavily disrupted, against a backdrop of spreading lockdowns of industrial and logistics facilities to stop the Covid-19 virus. Sales in China fell 37% to 217,800 and appear under threat for the foreseeable future, after President Xi Jinping on Wednesday reaffirmed the country's commitment to its aggressive ""Dynamic Clearing"" policy for fighting the coronavirus. Nomura analysts estimate that nearly 400 million people in China are currently under restrictions on mobility due to Covid-19.
The alarming development in deliveries overshadowed more positive news showing that the company made an operating profit of some 8.5 billion euros in the first quarter, and an operating margin of around 13.5%. "
131,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 05:47AM ET</span>",BlackRock expects 75% of company and govt assets to be net zero-aligned by 2030,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Thursday projected that by 2030 at least three quarters of its investments in companies and governments will be tied to issuers with a scientific target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, up from 25% currently.
It was the first time BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager with $9.6 trillion in assets, has said how its portfolio could look in 2030 as far as emissions are concerned, but it remains an expectation rather than a firm target.
The forecast covers emissions tied to 77% of its total assets at the end of September 2021, some $9.5 trillion, but excludes those such as municipal bonds for which there is currently no reliable data.
Setting a 2030 goal is a central requirement for members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI), a sector-wide group of money managers aiming to get to net-zero emissions across their assets. BlackRock joined the NZAMI in March 2021 
In Thursday's statement BlackRock avoided using the word ""target"", though, reiterating instead that the pace of change would be determined by the scale of decarbonisation in the real economy and clients' investment decisions.
""As the transition proceeds and issuers and asset owners continue to position themselves in front of it, we anticipate that by 2030, at least 75% of BlackRock corporate and sovereign assets managed on behalf of clients will be invested in issuers with science-based targets or equivalent,"" the statement said.
However, Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment manager at non-profit Reclaim Finance, said BlackRock needed to use its financial muscle to ensure companies make the cuts in emissions needed to ensure the world hits its climate goal.
""The world's largest asset manager cannot get away with vaguely defined commitments. It must act with urgency, especially with respect to the fossil fuel expansionists in BlackRock's portfolio that are leading us to climate catastrophe,"" she said in a statement.
The bulk of BlackRock's assets are in funds that track stock and other indexes, often containing high-emitting companies such as those in the oil and gas sector, although it is launching new climate-aligned products for clients that want to shift.
""BlackRock's role in the transition is as a fiduciary to our clients. Our role is to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities, not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy,"" it said.
Key to that change would be concerted policy action from governments as well as technological advances to help hard-to-abate sectors decarbonise, it added.

""Our clients' portfolios – which reflect the global economy – cannot reach net zero without sustained and consistent government policy, accelerated technological breakthroughs, and substantial adaptation in corporate business models,"" it said.
""These portfolios will reflect the regulatory and legislative choices governments make to balance the need for reliable and affordable energy, and orderly decarbonisation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boosting enforcement of antidiscrimination and antitrust laws, raising the federal mininum wage and higher unionization rates could substantially boost U.S. economic growth, a new report by President Joe Biden's top economic advisers concludes.
The annual Economic Report, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers, argues for restoring the public sector as a partner in long-run growth, and adoption of policies aimed at curbing the disproportionate market power of companies and employers that limits economic equality.
“The government has a role to play in reducing inequality,” Cecilia Rouse, who chairs the council, told Reuters, stressing that ending lingering disparities in the U.S. labor market and racial wealth gaps would ""absolutely"" boost U.S. growth and competitiveness after years of weak progress.
“The real point is that these imperfections in the market have real economic costs in terms of our GDP growth,"" she said, citing research https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-economic-gains-from-equity by San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, which concluded that systemic disparities cost the U.S. economy nearly $23 trillion over the 30-year period from 1990-2019, and providing more equitable access to labor markets would add $790 billion to the U.S. economy annually.
Biden welcomed the report in a statement, and vowed to continue working to deliver ""more equitable growth"" and expand the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.
The report delves deeply into the impact of non-competitive labor markets, the market power of employers and monopolies in maintaining inequality in wages, and unfair hiring practices that ultimately curtail economic growth for all.
""The costs of ignoring these structural forces are increased inequality and reduced economic growth and output,"" the report concluded, citing inefficient labor market outcomes, misallocated talent, suppressed innovation and reduced incentives for investment in human capital.
It noted that nearly 20% of U.S. workers reported being bound by noncompete agreements that limited an employee's ability to join or start up a competing firm, and said employer market power was responsible for keeping wages 15% below where they would be in a perfectly competitive market.

It said government actions could curtail these market forces through increased enforcement of current labor protection and antidiscrimination laws, support for greater unionization, which can lead to higher wages, and raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, where it has been fixed since 2009.
It also underscored the beneficial impact of providing affordable childcare and early childhood education, as well as paid family and medical leave, and a child tax credit - all measures included in Biden's ill-fated $1.7 trillion Build Back Better spending package that floundered in Congress last year.

PARIS (Reuters) -Sales at Birkin bag maker Hermes beat estimates in the first quarter, lifted by strong appetite for its luxury accessories, particularly in the United States and Europe, as the sector powers through turbulence from the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.
Hermes, which also sells silk scarves and porcelain tableware, had a strong start of the year in China until the beginning of March, when restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus prompted some store closures, including three in Shanghai, Executive Vice President for Finance Eric du Halgouet told journalists in a call.
“We are confident and hope that these stores in Shanghai will reopen quickly – in any case the fundamentals are excellent in China,"" he said. 
The French luxury group said revenues at constant exchange rates came rose 27% to 2.8 billion euros ($3.06 billion) in the three months to March, ahead of a consensus forecast of 15%organic growth.
The results confirm ""the year is off with a bang,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein.
Hermes shares rose as much as 4.5% and traded up 1.3% at 0900 GMT. 
All divisions clocked double-digit growth, including the leather goods and saddlery activity known for its Birkin and Kelly handbags, which accounts for nearly half of annual sales and reported 15.8% sales growth.
Other divisions grew even more, with ready-to-wear and accessories division up 44% and sales of watches up 62%.
Hermes is in close contact with its 60 employees in Russia, continuing to pay their salaries while providing training and psychological support, du Halgouet said. Some have relocated to countries nearby.
The group last month said it was suspending commercial operations in Russia, closing its three stores in Moscow and putting plans to open one in St. Petersburg on hold. All exports to the country have been halted and Hermes is complying with rules banning sales to sanctioned oligarchs, the executive added. 
Production of leather goods, which is based in France, has normalized after COVID-related disruptions at the start of the year, and production of other goods, including porcelain and silk has also increased since January, the finance chief said.
At the end of last year, Hermes missed market forecasts - a rare instance of underperforming rivals - as self-imposed production caps kept the group from meeting demand for its prized handbags.

Hermes limits volume growth in its leather goods production to 6% to 7% annually, preferring to have long waiting lists for its products rather than speed up production.

""The gargantuan Benetton and Blackstone-led Atlantia deal redefines how investors will think about infrastructure investments due to its sheer size alone.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp plans to launch a sport utility vehicle version of its Crown sedan for Japan, China and North America, three people said, revamping a car that has been a showpiece of Japan's market for nearly seven decades.
The SUV - which will come in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full-electric models - marks an attempt to bring the 67-year-old Crown more in line with market trends as consumers shy away from sedans, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
Sales of the hybrid are expected from the summer of 2023 and will include exports to China and North America, while the plug-in hybrid is intended for the domestic market, they said. 
The electric model is due to launch in early 2024 and the automaker has yet to finalise export plans, two of the people said.
As part of the overhaul, Toyota will also roll out a fully remodelled sedan version of the Crown from this summer, the people said. 
Both the SUV and the sedan will be manufactured at factories in Toyota City, Japan. 
A Toyota spokesperson declined to comment.
Largely sold in the domestic market for much of its history, the Crown was the first passenger car developed and built entirely in Japan, marking a pivotal moment in the country's rise to become a global automaking giant.
It was also the first car Toyota exported to the United States, in 1958. Two years later Toyota was forced to suspend exports as the Crown engine wasn't capable of speeds needed on American freeways.
Toyota sold more than 200,000 of the sedans in 1990 at the height of Japan's economic boom, but by last year domestic annual sales had dwindled to 21,000.

The Crown revamp also comes as Toyota - like other Japanese automakers - looks to shed the perception it has been slow to embrace battery electric vehicles.
The carmaker said last year it would invest around $70 billion to electrify its automobiles by 2030.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish telecom provider Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said on Thursday it would likely be fined by U.S. regulators for its handling of a bribery investigation in Iraq and reported a slide in quarterly earnings due to its suspension of business in Russia.
The company disclosed in February that an internal investigation had found it may have made payments to the Islamic State militant group in Iraq - misconduct it said ""started at least back in 2011"".
Shares in Ericsson tumbled 7% in early Thursday trade, bringing the stock's losses since news of the scandal broke to around 30%.
The U.S. Department of Justice could take a range of actions, it said. These ""may likely include additional monetary payments,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in a statement, adding that the company could not reliably estimate the size of the fine. 
Ericsson reported an 11% drop in adjusted operating earnings for the first quarter to 4.7 billion Swedish crowns ($500 million). It was hurt by a $95 million provision for its indefinite suspension of business in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.
Ongoing patent litigation with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a delay in the renewal of a 1 billion crown annual software contract to the current quarter also weighed on the results.
But revenue rose 11% to 55.1 billion crowns on higher demand for 5G telecom equipment, beating estimates of 53.36 billion crowns.
A fine would come on top of a $1 billion fine paid to the DOJ in 2019 to settle bribery cases in several countries. At the time, Ericsson also agreed to supervision by the regulators for three years.
""A fine is, in our view, the best Ericsson can hope for, as much worse scenarios have been discussed in the market recently,"" said Mads Rosendal, analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research.
Market speculation about possible penalties has ranged from sanctions on the company to a ban on selling in the United States to legal action being taken against top Ericsson executives.
In a public rebuke for the scandal, last week shareholders representing more than 10% of Ericsson shares voted against discharging board members of liability for the previous year. That means Ekholm and other board members could be held personally liable for their actions.
Ericsson has also been spending heavily to boost inventory for critical parts in the face of a global chip shortage.

""We do see that certain vital components need extra attention... we have decided to invest in buffer inventory for some of those vital components,"" Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with investors cautiously awaiting a key policy-setting meeting from the European Central Bank.
By 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%.
The European Central Bank will be in the spotlight Thursday, as its policymakers meet to decide the path of monetary policy against a backdrop of record-high inflation as well as concerns about a war-related recession.
As it stands the ECB plans to end its emergency bond buying at some point in the third quarter, with interest rates going up ""some time"" after that. However, many of the central bank's peers have already started tightening policy, and investors will be looking to see if the central bank provides a clearer schedule for unwinding its extraordinary stimulus.
European markets had received a positive handover from Wall Street Thursday, as falling U.S. Treasury yields helped interest-sensitive growth stocks close substantially higher. 
Still, any gains are likely to be limited as geopolitical risks cap market optimism. Ukraine warned on Wednesday of an expected substantial Russian assault in the east of the country, while U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance.
In the corporate sector, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock slumped over 8% after the Swedish telecoms gear maker said its earnings fell in the first quarter and warned of further hits due to its withdrawal from Russia and a fresh U.S. fine for sanctions-busting. 
Publicis (PA:PUBP) stock rose 1.2% after the world's third-biggest advertising group beat market expectations in the first quarter, while Hermes (PA:HRMS) stock rose 2.3% after the French luxury group benefited from strong appetite for its accessories, particularly in the United States and Europe, in the first quarter.
Dunelm (LON:DNLM) stock rose 2.5% after the British homeware retailer reported strong sales growth in the third quarter, helped by the reopening of stores after coronavirus curbs were eased.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, handing back some of the week’s substantial gains after the release of a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories.
Data released Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. oil stocks rose more than 9 million barrels last week, substantially more than expected, even as U.S. gasoline stocks fell 3.6 million barrels.
Still, both benchmarks are well over 7% higher over the course of the week as worries over tightening global supply continue to weigh on sentiment.
The International Energy Agency on Wednesday warned that from May onwards roughly 3 million barrels per day of Russian oil could be shut-in due to sanctions or voluntary embargoes.
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $103.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $107.81.

The company, which sells furnishings ranging from cushions and bedding to kitchen equipment, also reported a better-than-expected rise of 30 basis points in gross profit margins, thanks to a smaller proportion of sales from discounted lines. 
""Whilst the macro environment remains uncertain, with significant headwinds and increasing pressures on the consumer, our wide product range offers choice for every budget,"" Chief Executive Officer Nick Wilkinson said in a statement. 
The group, one of Britain's largest homeware retailers with 176 stores and an online presence, said it continued to temper inflationary cost pressures in the quarter. In February, Dunelm said it was hiking retail prices to battle rising costs. 
Margins for the full year are expected to be in line with the previous year, it said.
The company reported a 69% increase in sales to 399 million pounds ($524.17 million) for the 13 weeks ended March 26.
Analysts at Peel Hunt said Dunelm's success in the quarter suggests consumers are not retreating yet, but there are clearly tougher times ahead.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 03:21AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Central banks flying into storm clouds,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
After a hectic period, traders (and reporters) will be looking forward to the long Easter weekend but they must first get through what promises to be an eventful Thursday. 
Already in Asia, the normally staid Bank of Korea delivered a surprise rate hike -- despite not having a governor in place -- and warned inflation could top 4%, up from its February forecast of 3.1%. 
It also cut economic growth forecasts, part of a pattern where most central banks are acting against inflation, even at the cost of growth. Canada and New Zealand on Wednesday delivered half-point rate rises, while later on Thursday, the European Central Bank may set out a date to end bond purchases, even as high energy prices threaten recession. 
Despite data pointing to soaring inflation, bond yields have taken a tumble in recent days on fear that central banks' inflation battle will drag economies into a slowdown, or even recession.
Markets were unnerved by Wednesday's downbeat message from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s straight-talking CEO Jamie Dimon about ""storm clouds on the horizon"" for the economy. His bank also posted a 42% profit slump in the first quarter. 
Q1 earnings were always going to be a bit of a let-down after the post-COVID bounceback in early-2020, but JPM's 30%-70% fee declines from dealmaking, equity and investment banking still had the capacity to shock, as did the $1 billion it set aside against loan losses.
With share buybacks now in question, JPM shares fell 3%.
Investors clearly fear similar messages from other banks reporting on Thursday. Watch Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), tipped to see a 32% revenue decline in Q1. Given Goldman has beaten forecasts in each one of the past eight quarters, anything worse could weigh heavily on shares already down 16% this year.
So, want to see where the profits are? The world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor posted a 45% jump in Q1 net profit, benefiting from the global chip crunch. 
Meanwhile, falling Treasury yields are lifting stock markets; European and U.S. equities look set to follow Asia higher. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-Singapore tightens monetary policy for third time in six months
- Fed speakers: Philadelphia President Patrick Harker, Cleveland President Loretta Mester
-U.S. retail sales March/weekly jobless/University of Michigan inflation expectations 

-Turkey to hold rates steady despite 61% inflation
-Earnings: Bancorp, Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), State street,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Citi

146,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 03:04AM ET</span>","Ericsson's Woes Continue With Russia Hit, Looming U.S. Fine","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Swedish telecoms gear maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) said its earnings fell in the first quarter and warned of further hits due to its withdrawal from Russia and a fresh U.S. fine for sanctions-busting. 
Börje Ekholm, who was censured along with the rest of the company's management last week for his handling of an investigation into possible payments made to Islamic State affiliates in Iraq, said in a statement that it may be fined by the U.S. Department of Justice for breaking the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement.  
""The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated."" Ekholm said. 
Ekholm's admission accompanied news of an 8% drop in net profit in the first quarter to 2.9 billion Swedish kronor ($308 million), well below expectations for 4.8 billion kronor. That was despite an 11% rise in sales to 55.1 billion kronor. The results included a 900 million kronor charge that the company announced earlier this week as it suspended its business in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Around one-third of that charge will hit cash flow, with the rest coming as non-cash impacts.
Before the invasion, Russia had been a key growth market for the Swedish company, but it already faced substantial costs in relocating manufacturing production to the country under the requirements of a law that was scheduled to come into force next year.
The company's quarterly update wasn't without its positive elements. Gross margin was roughly stable at 42.3%, while it also reported strong demand for its Cradlepoint wireless product for enterprises, thanks to the rollout of 5G services in the U.S. However, its margin before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) remained stuck at 11%, well short of its medium-term target of 15%-18%. Ekholm said the company expects to need ""2-3 years"" to reach that target.
Ericsson stock had lost some 34% of its value in response to the disclosure of the Iraq issue in February, but has since retraced one-third of those losses.

An affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Ant has been subjected to a sweeping restructuring by China, which derailed its $37 billion initial public offering in late 2020.

Bloomberg reported the anti-corruption watchdog was involved in queries sent to state firms in February about their exposure to Ant, as part of its investigation of former Communist Party Secretary of the technology hub of Hangzhou, Zhou Jiangyong, who was later expelled from the party.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd said it will shut down a service that allowed Chinese gamers to access overseas platforms to play unapproved foreign games, in a sign of tightening compliance as Chinese regulators more closely scrutinize the industry.
The country's largest social and gaming firm said late on Wednesday it will on May 31 update its games speed booster mobile and desktop apps to new versions that would only support games operating in China. The new versions will no longer allow users to access foreign games.
Tencent first launched the apps in 2018. Such apps, which other companies like NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc also offer, act as network acceleration tools that help users boost their internet speeds.
Unlike most countries, gamers in China are only allowed to play titles approved by the government and are not allowed to play with foreigners on foreign servers. While such foreign games are not explicitly blocked by online curbs, local internet speeds are generally too slow for gamers to access them. 
As such, many gamers in China used such apps in practice to access unapproved foreign games such as Grand Theft Auto or Nintendo Co Ltd (TYO:7974)'s smash-hit Animal Crossing. The apps also over the years became grey-area channels for foreign game developers to reach users in the world's largest gaming market. 
Tencent declined to provide further comment on why it had decided to make changes to the app.
The move was greeted by Chinese gamers with dismay but also many said it was not surprising.

""This is expected given the direction things are going. It is harder to be a gamer in China by the day,"" a Chinese internet user wrote on microblogging site Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). 
The move comes days after China lifted a nine-month freeze on gaming licences. During this period gaming companies including Tencent made major adjustments to their business practices to comply with regulatory requests.

Home to ad agencies Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, the French company posted net revenue of 2.80 billion euros ($3.05 billion), up 10.5% organically, against a 6.3% increase forecast by analysts in a consensus compiled by Publicis.
""We started the year very strongly, both financially and commercially,"" Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun said in a statement as he shared his confidence in coming in at the upper end of an unchanged 4%-5% full-year organic growth target.
""These good results should not conceal the macroeconomic uncertainties the world is facing today,"" he however told journalists in a call. ""We have to remain agile.""
While the beat should have led Publicis to upgrade its objectives, the group expressed reservations on the consequences the global health situation, the conflict in Ukraine and the rise in raw materials and energy prices could have.
Publicis also needs to navigate a shift in sector trends as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google is looking to phase out use of what it described as privacy-invasive cookies.
Because the coming disappearance of third-party cookies raises the complexity of digital media, our role with customers becomes all the more essential, the group wrote in an email to Reuters, emphasising the competitive advantage of its data company Epsilon.
The latter's CORE ID solution does not depend on third-party cookies but relies on advertisers' ""first-party"" data, allowing their activation on publishers' sites directly.

In a cookie-less future, we believe Epsilon will actually grow its market share, Publicis noted.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Russian companies and global banks including BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could profit if Moscow moves to de-list Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The potential windfall is due to the fees that bank issuers of depositary receipts can contractually charge investors when they cancel the product. 
It is unclear how much companies and banks could make or if banks will charge the fees and risk angering investors who say it would be unfair given the extraordinary circumstances which have been triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, the fees could potentially translate into hundreds of millions of dollars according to Reuters' calculations based on fee data provided by the sources.
Assailed by Western sanctions, Moscow is preparing to de-list Russian company depositary receipts from foreign exchanges and convert them into local Russian securities in a bid to reduce foreigners' control over these companies.
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. They allow investors to dabble in overseas stocks in their own geography and time zone.
There are more than 30 depositary receipts on Russian companies including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Rosneft, Lukoil and Norilsk Nickel issued by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan, among others, trading on U.S. and European markets. 
Under standard agreements, depositary receipts can be canceled by the issuer or the investor. When that happens, the investor typically gets cash from the sale of the underlying shares, although they have the right to take custody of the shares instead. 
Banks charge an administration fee, typically around $0.05 per receipt, which may be shared with the companies, two sources said. 
If Moscow de-lists Russian depositary receipts, banks will have to cancel the products. Banks could still charge the fees, even though their hand was forced, according to three sources. 
For example, an investor in Rosneft with 150 million depositary receipts representing the same number of shares in the company could be on the hook for $7.5 million in cancellation fees, according to Reuters' calculations. 
Sweeping Western sanctions could make it challenging for banks to transfer the cash to some companies. 
Regardless, some investors say the fees should not apply. One global asset manager told Reuters that if Russia passes the de-listing law there should be no fees as investors would have no choice in the matter. The other two sources, however, say banks still have to cover their costs.
BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. Russian companies did not respond to a Reuters emails seeking comment.
MARKET FREEZE
As Western sanctions pummeled Russian stocks from late February, the Moscow exchange closed and the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring shares out of their custody accounts. It also barred foreigners from selling Russian shares. 
The restrictions made it nearly impossible for banks to cancel receipts when asked by investors anxious to slash their Russia exposure. 
With curbs on custodians recently lifted, BNY Mellon, Citi and JPMorgan have resumed processing cancellations. But because the foreign banks still can't sell the shares, investors have to take custody of them instead. To do that, investors need an account in Russia, which many don't have.
As a result, a lot of investors are likely to hold onto the receipts for the time being, according to three people. 
Many investors are worried, however, about the de-listing bill which Russia is preparing. 

Aside from the potential cancellation fees, investors are worried about what will happen if they can't open a local custody account.
In a note to clients, JPMorgan said clients may be able to open a Russian account under some unspecified circumstances if the new law is passed.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund on Thursday signed two agreements to invest in toll roads on the islands of Sumatra and Java worth more than 39 trillion rupiah ($2.72 billion), President Joko Widodo said.
The Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) signed a heads of agreement with state construction firm Hutama Karya to invest in three parts of the Trans Sumatra toll road, said Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who also attended the signing ceremony in Jakarta. 
INA also signed a confirmation on the start of a transaction with Waskita Toll Road, a unit of another state-owned construction firm, Waskita Karya , for two parts of the Trans Java toll road, she said. 
The signings are INA's first concrete steps since forming a toll road fund last year of up to $3.75 billion, with Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), APG Asset Management (APG) and a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) as co-investors.
The signings and INA's good governance would create greater trust in infrastructure financing in Southeast Asia's largest economy, from both domestic and international investors, Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said. 
""I think this kind of financing scheme we will continue to develop,"" he said. ""God willing, bigger investors will come to Indonesia via the INA and not just (investing in) toll roads but also big projects that will affect the economy.""
INA's chief executive Ridha Wirakusumah said other projects that the fund is considering to invest in this year include sea ports, geothermal and healthcare projects.
The wealth fund's assets under management amounted to nearly $6 billion, but it aims to grow the figure to between $15 billion to $20 billion within three years supported by help from co-investors, the CEO told Reuters last month.

Unlike many other sovereign wealth funds, which manage excess oil revenues or foreign exchange reserves, the INA seeks foreign funds as co-investors to finance the country's economic development.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, as China hinted that it would loosen monetary policy further and the bond market dialed back bets on aggressive interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.12% by 11:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.05%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.45%, with employment data showing that the employment change was 17,900, the full employment change was 20,500, and the unemployment rate was 4% in March 2022.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.31%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.66% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.35%.
The People’s Bank of China is expected to cut the one-year policy loans interest rate on Friday, the second time it would be doing so in 2022 to date. The central bank could also lower the reserve requirement ratio soon, as the lockdowns to curb the country's latest COVID-19 outbreak impact the economy.
An upward trend in shorter maturity U.S. Treasuries could also indicate that investors are readjusting their bets on how fast the Fed will tighten monetary policy. Tuesday’s consumer price index data spurred cautious optimism that inflation is peaking, although producer price index (PPI) data released a day later reminded investors not to jump too quickly to conclusions.
The PPI rose 11.2% year-on-year and 1.4% month-on-month, while the core PPI rose 9.2% year-on-year and 1% month-on-month, in March.
Oil traded near the $104 mark as concerns about tight supply continue. Commodity-driven inflation, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine precipitated by Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, continues to impact the economy and investor sentiment.
Inflation and the conflict were creating “significant” challenges, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, with the firm among the first big U.S. banks reporting earnings for the first quarter of 2022.
“Fed rate hike expectations will get tested in the coming months” partly on geopolitical risks, OANDA senior market analyst Ed Moya said in a note.
The European Union warned its member states that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand that “unfriendly countries” pay for Russian gas in rubles would violate sanctions. Putin has threatened to halt gas supplies to buyers who do not comply with the request. For its part, the U.S. is looking to provide a new $800 million package of military assistance to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea hiked its interest rate to 1.5% as it handed down its latest policy decision. The European Central Bank will hand its own policy decision, while in the U.S. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak, later in the day.
U.S. data, including retail sales and University of Michigan consumer sentiment, is also due later in the day. Australia, Hong Kong, and the U.S. are among the markets closed for a holiday on Friday."

The CSI 300 Index rose as much as 1.3%, with consumer stocks leading the advance. The onshore yuan rose 0.05% to 6.3643 per dollar, while the 10-year government bond yields were steady. 
Bets for easing have risen as China’s largest Covid-19 outbreak in two years worsens the growth outlook and saps investor sentiment already hurt by persistent regulatory headwinds and rising global borrowing costs. Still, investors say unless China loosens grips on its tight Covid-19 containment policy, a rate cut by itself won’t be enough to turn the tide on stocks.  
READ: Xi Says China Must Stick to Covid Zero Even as Costs Mount
The negative overhang from “persistent fears” of consumers and businesses to borrow implies that cuts to interest rates will not be enough to trigger a significant rally, according to Kelvin Wong, an analyst at CMC Markets (Singapore). “The best-case scenario is some sort of stabilization in the equity market because of the rate cuts.”
Fifteen of the 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the People’s Bank of China will lower the interest rate on one-year policy loans on Friday -- 11 of them forecast a 10 basis-point reduction to 2.75% and four expect a 5-point drop. The rest see no change.
The PBOC is also likely to reduce the reserve requirement ratio -- the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve -- in the coming days after the State Council, China’s cabinet, hinted strongly of a cut on Wednesday, saying it would lower the ratio “at an appropriate time.”
‘Limited Boost’
Even with Thursday’s gains, the benchmark is on course for a second week of losses. Traders have been debating whether the market have hit the bottom after a sweeping set of promises from authorities in mid-March saw shares stage a dramatic rebound following a historic rout.
“This will help the market from being utterly disheartened by the lack of monetary easing action, but I think it will give only a limited boost,” said Wang Zhuo, fund manager at Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management Co. “I would like to see how much of a cut, and whether a rate cut follows, before becoming more upbeat, but at least its a small comfort.”

(Reuters) -A federal judge said on Wednesday Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was liable to a Black elevator operator who said the electric car company ignored racial abuse at the factory where he worked, but reduced a nearly $137 million jury award to $15 million.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco ruled after jurors last October found that Tesla subjected Owen Diaz to a hostile environment at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California by allowing and failing to stop the racism he faced.
Diaz, who worked at the plant for nine months in 2015 and 2016, said other employees used racist slurs when speaking to him, and scrawled swastikas and slurs including the ""N-word"" on bathroom walls. He also said one supervisor drew a racist caricature near his workstation.
In a 43-page decision, Orrick said the evidence amply supported the jury's finding Tesla liable for the ""profound"" emotional harm Diaz suffered and the ""often inadequate"" disciplinary steps the company took.
But the judge reduced Diaz's compensatory damages to $1.5 million from the ""excessive"" $6.9 million that the jury awarded, and lowered punitive damages to $13.5 million from the ""unconstitutionally large"" $130 million jury award.
Bernard Alexander, a lawyer for Diaz, in an interview said his client plans to appeal the lowered damages award.
""We're pleased that the court upheld the jury's finding that Tesla's conduct was absolutely reprehensible,"" Alexander said.
""The award of $15 million is substantial but does not come close to reflecting the harm caused to Mr. Diaz, or the reprehensibility of Tesla's conduct,"" he added.
Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The company had sought to limit compensatory and punitive damages to $300,000 each.
Led by billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla faces similar claims in other lawsuits.
In one such case, California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged in February that Black workers at the Fremont plant endured constant harassment, but saw their complaints ignored.

(Reuters) - Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) Corp said on Wednesday that its Peruvian mine remains closed after six weeks of a standoff with protesters, accusing Peru's government of failing to intervene to guarantee security for its 1,300 workers and their families.
A recent deal aimed at ending protests at the Cuajone copper mine required the company to withdraw complaints against protest leaders, amid a continuing blockade of its railway to transport minerals and supplies, the company said in a statement. Production has been suspended since Feb. 28.
Peru's Energy Ministry said in a separate statement that it had also reached an agreement with Southern Copper to start talks to find common ground with local communities.
""If we closed for a year, the government would stop receiving more than 3.1 billion soles ($830 million) in taxes and royalties, and 8,000 direct and indirect jobs would be lost. That's what we want to avoid,"" the Southern Copper statement added.
Peru is facing a wave of protests from indigenous communities that accuse mining firms of not providing enough jobs and money to impoverished locals.
Central bank official Adrian Armas said last week that protests hitting copper mines such as MMG's Las Bambas and Southern Copper's Cuajone are weighing down the economy.
Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer and mining is a key source of tax revenue.
Protests hit several mining companies in Peru when leftist President Pedro Castillo took office last July after winning the election with support from the country's impoverished mining regions.

Speaking as the carmaker celebrated the successful test drive of its EQXX prototype vehicle over more than 1,000 km from Sindelfingen in Germany to the Cote d'Azur on a single charge, CTO Markus Schaefer said efficient design was key to maximising an electric car's range.
""First we optimise efficiency, and then we can see how many battery modules we put in the car,"" Schaefer said at a media roundtable, adding that customers should be able to decide the size of the battery they want based on their needs.
Carmakers from Mercedes-Benz to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to China's Nio (NYSE:NIO) are in a neck-to-neck race to produce higher range cars that dispel consumer anxiety over the lack of widespread charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
Mercedes unveiled its Vision EQXX prototype, boasting a 1,000 km-range with a battery half the volume of its flagship EQS model, in January, promising that some of the car's components would make their way into series vehicles in 2-3 years time.
The car spent 8.7 kilowatt hours of energy per 100 km on its 11-and-a-half hour drive to France, Mercedes-Benz said, about twice as efficient as Mercedes models on the market and Tesla's longest-range car on offer, the Model S 60.

Mercedes' EQS has the highest range on the market as of yet, according to car comparison portal carwow, with 768 km, followed by Tesla's Model S Long Range with up to 652 km.
""There'll be a further increase for some time before a fall, which will happen once charging infrastructure is as available as petrol stations,"" Schaefer said, although he declined to state what range Mercedes was targeting in future models.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied to end sharply higher on Wednesday, powered by a recovery in interest-sensitive growth stocks as investors digested hot inflation data and a mixed bag of quarterly results.
Falling U.S. Treasury yields helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq lead all three major U.S. stock indexes higher, with semiconductors outperforming the broader market. [US/]
The Nasdaq jumped over 2% while the S&P 500 and the Dow gained more than 1%.
""Bond yields may have gotten ahead of themselves and they're dropping lower today,"" said David Carter, managing director at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. ""This helps almost all equities, but particularly growthy areas like tech."" 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) set the first-quarter earnings season off to an inauspicious start, reporting a 42% drop in quarterly profit. The downbeat results from the biggest U.S. lender sent its shares down 3.2%. 
On the brighter side, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)' results beat expectations and it forecast a current-quarter return to profit due to ""historically high"" demand. Its 6.2% share jump was contagious; the broader S&P 1500 airline index surged 6.8%.
""It’s great that demand is so strong,"" Carter added. ""However, drive inflation higher, which will force the Fed to continue to raise rates, resulting in a weaker stock market.""
""Business is good. Almost too good."" 
Strong demand also drove the Labor Department's producer price index to a blistering 11.2% year-on-year growth rate, the hottest annual reading since the Labor Department started tracking annual data in 2010.
Core PPI and other major indicators have risen beyond the Federal Reserve's average annual 2% inflation target.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, consumer discretionary stocks enjoyed the largest percentage gains, jumping 2.5%.
Analyst estimates for the corporate earnings season have grown less optimistic. Aggregate annual S&P 500 earnings growth for the first three quarters of 2022 is estimated at 5.4% as of Wednesday, down from 7.5% at the beginning of the year.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:00PM ET</span>",U.S. says advanced hackers have shown ability to hijack critical infrastructure,"By Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Advanced hackers have shown they can take control of an array of devices that help run power stations and manufacturing plants, the U.S. government said in an alert https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a on Wednesday, warning of the potential for cyber spies to harm critical infrastructure.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other government agencies issued a joint advisory saying the hackers' malicious software could affect a type of device called programmable logic controllers made by Schneider Electric (EPA:SCHN) and OMRON Corp.
OMRON did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A Schneider spokesperson confirmed it had worked with U.S. officials to defend against the hackers, calling it ""an instance of successful collaboration to deter threats on critical infrastructure before they occur.""
The controllers are common across a variety of industries - from gas to food production plants - but Robert Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, which helped uncover the malware, said researchers believed the hackers' intended targets were liquefied natural gas and electric facilities. 
In its alert, the Cybersecurity Agency urged critical infrastructure organizations, ""especially Energy Sector organizations,"" to implement a series of recommendations aimed at blocking and detecting the cyber weapon, named Pipedream. 
Although the government warning was vague - it did not say which hackers were behind the malware or if it had actually been used - it sent concern coursing across the industry.
In a sign of how seriously the discovery was being taken, CISA said it was making its announcement alongside the Energy Department, the National Security Agency and the FBI.
Programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, are embedded in a huge number of plants and factories and any interference with their operation has the potential to cause harm, from shutdowns to blackouts to chemical leaks, wrecked equipment or even explosions. 
Lee said the tool developed by the mystery hackers was ""highly capable"" and had likely been in the works for several years.
""It is as dangerous as people are making it out to be,"" Lee said in an interview.
Western cybersecurity officials are already on edge over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the deployment of malware aimed at causing electrical outages.
Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos' vice president of threat intelligence, said Pipedream could be understood as a ""toolbox"" of different hacking tools. Each component offers a different way to subvert normal controls, giving the hackers a variety of options to launch attacks. 

For example, Caltagirone said that one of the tools within Pipedream would have allowed the attackers to damage Schneider Electric's PLC in such a way that it would need to be entirely replaced. 
""Because of existing supply chain challenges it could take longer to get replacement controllers after such an attack,"" Caltagirone said. ""What this means is a liquefied natural gas facility might be out of commission for months.""

By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - San Francisco police were left scratching their heads after they pulled over a car earlier this month for driving without headlights at night and found no one inside.
In what otherwise would have been a great April Fools' Day joke, San Francisco police officers pulled over a driverless car operated by General Motor Co's Cruise unit on April 1 and found no one behind the wheel. The resulting video footage has gone viral online.
The two officers, who were not identified, pulled the car over and were puzzled by the lack of humans inside, according to a video posted on Instagram that has been viewed almost 80,000 times. 
""Ain’t nobody in it. This is crazy,"" said one of the officers, who tried to open the vehicle door before walking back to his cruiser. The car subsequently drove through the intersection and stopped again in the next block as bystanders laughed.
The video illustrated what Cruise Chief Executive Kyle Vogt previously said was one of the biggest challenges for autonomous vehicles - how to interact with humans. 
Cruise, which blamed human error for the lack of headlights, said it works closely with the police on how to interact with its vehicles and has a dedicated phone number for police to call. Once the officer was clear of the vehicle, Cruise said the car relocated to the nearest safe location.
Cruise is operating a small number of vehicles to give full driverless rides to the public free of charge at night in San Francisco. The company is seeking the last regulatory approval required to launch commercial driverless service in the densely populated city.
Ironically, Cruise CEO Vogt last month had said a scenario where a police officer pulls over a driverless car has to go smoothly.
""You are kind of papering over all the weird stuff that can happen when there's no driver,"" he said at a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) conference. 
The San Francisco police department said the officers were able to make contact with the vehicle's remote operator and a maintenance team took control. Cruise was lucky in another respect.
""No citation was issued during the traffic stop,"" the police department said. 
Social media had fun with the incident.
""Insane that no citation was issued,"" Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user Theodectes said. ""Why was this driverless car behaving as if it was completely drunk?""

""IT WAS DRIVING WITHOUT ITS HEADLIGHTS!!! Cops weren't confused, they we're probably questioning why cutting edge technology somehow can't turn its own lights on,"" Albino Guidedog said on YouTube.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) showed assets under management back below $10 trillion, hurt by the market rout in the first quarter, and cautioned that fees could come under pressure over the rest of the year because of volatile markets.
Still, BlackRock posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit as the world's largest asset manager benefited from investors continuing to pour money into its various index-traded and active funds.
""Our clients are trying to understand the implications of the rapidly changing investment environment,"" said Laurence D. Fink, chairman and chief executive, who pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as creating ""a supply shock in commodities that is further increasing inflation."" 
Adjusted profit rose to $1.46 billion, or $9.52 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.2 billion, or $8.04 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $8.75 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The New York-based firm ended the quarter with $9.57 trillion in assets under management. While that was up from $9.01 trillion a year earlier it was down from its record $10 trillion in the fourth quarter 2021. 
The quarterly drop occurred mainly due to the sell-off in equities and fixed income markets, although there were also some outflows in retail fixed income and cash management. That was driven by redemptions from offshore prime and U.S. government money market funds, BlackRock said, in line with the broader money market fund industry. 
As investors anticipate that the U.S. Federal Reserve will aggressively hike rates to combat sky-high inflation, bond yields have shot higher and the yield curve has inverted, which many see as an omen for a pending recession. 
""Across the board, you're seeing portfolios are being navigated around fixed income,"" Fink said, adding that clients ""are reevaluating where they should be across the yield curve."" 
Flows into the asset manager's funds remained positive, attracting total net flows of $86 billion in the first quarter, down from $172 billion a year earlier, primarily due to seasonal cash management outflows of $27 billion.
BlackRock predicted recent market volatility could result in lower performance fees from liquid alternatives and long-only products during the remainder of the year, according to Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin.
Despite the results beat, BlackRock's shares closed down marginally at $715.74. They fell nearly 17% in the first quarter.

""The risk for this year is that visibility is low, and there's a lot of uncertainty and that's a negative for the stock,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA, adding over the longer term, there still remains several positive growth catalysts at the firm. 
Total revenue rose about 7% to $4.69 billion, helped by higher investment advisory and administration fees. That compared with estimates of $4.73 billion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%, or 344 points, the S&P 500 rose 1%, and the Nasdaq added 2%.
Technology was in the ascendency, supported by rising megacap stocks, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), both up more than 2% leading the charge as Treasury yields slipped for a second-straight day.
Chip stocks were also doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after New Street Research upgraded the chipmaker to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock $280 from $255, citing the strength of its data center business.
Sentiment in the sector was also boosted by Bloomberg data showing that investors have been piling into chip stocks. Investor inflows into semiconductor ETFs jumped to $6.8 billion, topping the $5.2 billion of inflows seen in all of 2021.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the sectors leading the broader market higher, underpinned by a rally in travel-related stocks including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and Carnival (NYSE:CCL), after better than feared results from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) pointed to strong travel demand. 
Delta forecast a return to profit in the second quarter after reporting a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss.
Financials, however, bucked the trend higher, ending the day marginally lower amid pressure from a 3% decline in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
JPMorgan reported first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates owing to higher than expected provisions for bad debt, with the bank citing “higher probabilities of downside risk.”

Asset management firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) reported quarterly results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, supported by a jump in assets under management.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) cut intraday losses to trade about 1% lower after posting a surprise quarterly loss as rising shipping costs weighed. 
Energy stocks were boosted by ongoing climb in the oil prices after The International Energy Agency forecast a slight deficit in supplies this year amid weaker demand and the impact of sanctions on Russia oil.
The forecast of a deficit comes in the wake of the weekly data showing U.S. crude stockpiles rose by a more than expected 9.4 million barrels last week.

Investing.com – Stocks rebounded on Wednesday despite new data on producer prices that showed inflation running at multi-decade highs.
Investors appear to have gotten used to seeing hot inflation. Falling bond yields are energizing tech investors, who have swooped in to buy big tech names. 
After JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)’s earnings miss today, there will be another spate of banks tomorrow, including Goldman Sachs and  Citigroup . This is the start of earnings season, with many S&P 500 companies expected to report a surge in both revenue and costs. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) cast a note of positivity on the travel sector, saying huge demand for travel is helping it offset rising fuel costs. That is expected to bode well for other airlines, as well as hotels and other travel and leisure stocks.
Thursday will be the last trading day of the week in the U.S., as investors take a long holiday weekend pause. Then markets return next week for an onslaught of earnings. Congress is also on holiday until later this month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Goldman earnings
After JPMorgan reported on its latest quarter today, other banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Citigroup, are set to report on Thursday.
Focusing on those two specifically, Goldman's will report before the open with analysts polled by Investing.com expecting earnings per share of $8.97 on revenue of $11.98 billion.
2. Citigroup earnings

Investing.com -- Shares of  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) fell 5% in Wednesday's session after the announcement that Vice Chairman and President Michael Severino would be leaving the company.
In a regulatory filing, AbbVie said Severino will be joining a ""bioplatform innovation company as CEO-Partner and as CEO of one of its companies,"" effective May 31.
However,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mohit Bansal said in a note to clients, quoted by TheFly, that he believes the weakness in AbbVie's shares is a buying opportunity. 
The analyst, who has an overweight rating and $165 price target on the stock, thinks the weakness was because some investors viewed Severino as a potential successor to Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez. 
Bansal added that AbbVie told him that Severino's departure would not affect its succession planning process and that it is still on track for 2023.
Severino departing will not be ""hugely disruptive to either succession planning or R&D strategy,"" wrote the analyst.
Despite Wednesday's fall, AbbVie stock is still up 17.35% in 2022."

SpiceJet, which currently operates 11 MAX aircraft and has 144 pilots to fly them, said the pilots have been restricted from operating the jets until they undergo retraining to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) satisfaction.
Indian media reported that the restrictions were imposed after flaws were discovered at a simulator facility near Delhi where they had received training for the Boeing jet.
The pilots continue to remain available for other Boeing 737 aircraft and the restriction does not impact MAX operations, a SpiceJet spokesperson said.
The airline is Boeing's biggest customer in the South Asian nation for MAX planes. 
""We are working closely with all parties involved including our supplier and the DGCA to ensure the maintenance and operation of this specific device complies with all regulatory requirements,"" Boeing said in a statement.
""We are committed to ensuring our customers receive high quality simulation experiences in accordance with all regulations.""
The pilots need to retrain successfully and we will take strict action against those found responsible for the lapse, Arun Kumar, the directorate general at India's air safety watchdog DGCA, said.

In August, the regulator cleared the 737 MAX aircraft to fly after a near two-and-a-half-year regulatory grounding following two fatal crashes in 2019.
As part of the conditions for returning the plane to service, Boeing and regulators agreed to beef up training for pilots to include simulator training.

The government has cancelled the work permit of Jean-Christian Bergeron, who has led the company for three years, the Nation said.
Bergeron did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment and Rubis Energie's offices in France were closed. Reuters reached out to the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, which is charged with immigration, but it had closed by the time of publishing this report.
Kenya's fuel crisis that has led to long queues at service stations has put pressure on government officials to clamp down on rising domestic prices.
Rubis Energy Kenya is owned by Rubis Energie, a subsidiary of the Rubis Group which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange, following the full acquisition of both KenolKobil and Gulf Energy Holdings in 2019. 
Andrew Kamau, Principal Secretary at Kenya's ministry of petroleum and mining did not answer his phone when Reuters tried to reach him.
Quoting senior government sources, The Nation said Rubis was among several fuel distributors accused of ""having some queer shortages and rationed sales.""

On Tuesday, the Energy and Petroleum regulatory Authority (EPRA) said it would crack down on fuel companies ""giving priority to export loadings while the local market was left to suffer intermittent supply.""
Kenya's government last week said it would pay subsidy arrears to petrol retailers to allay fears of potential fuel shortages and forestall a crisis. Frustrated motorists have been queuing in long lines at petrol stations for days due to the biting shortages.

(Reuters) -Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares on Wednesday took a bullish stance on the U.S. market despite rising fears of a downturn, as the carmaker's shareholders voted against the 2021 compensation package for top executives.
Speaking at the carmaker's annual shareholders' meeting, Tavares said Stellantis was confirming its forecast for double-digit operating income margin this year, and added that expected sales in North America, especially in its highly profitable U.S. business, should rise 3%.
The company, whose brands include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat, Opel and Maserati, reported an above-target adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8% last year, with a record 16.3% in North America, where it sells highly-profitable Jeep and Ram pickup truck models.
Despite these results, just over 52% of Stellantis shareholders voted at the meeting against the 2021 executive remuneration report for senior managers, including Tavares. 
However, the vote will not affect planned compensations for last year, based on legislation in the Netherlands, where Stellantis is based.
""Today's vote on remunerations is only consultative, so the remuneration report for 2021 will be implemented,"" a source close to the matter told Reuters.
Chairman John Elkann said Stellantis would take into account the shareholder vote, which he described as a recommendation.
""It is our conviction as a board that in a meritocracy, rewarding on the basis of performance criteria is a fundamental element of our policy,"" Elkann told shareholders. ""We will take on this vote which is, again, a recommendation"".
French state investor BPIFrance, which owns a 6.15% stake in Stellantis, was among those who voted against the 2021 pay package, which added up to around 19 million euros ($20.6 million), plus a stock package worth some additional 32 million euros and long-term compensation of about 25 million euros.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tavares' package was ""excessive"" but added that France could not cap executive pay on its own for fear of losing top corporate talent.
""This salary is excessive and must lead us to think about the level of CEO pay compared to staff salaries, but we must do it on a European level because otherwise we will lose all the good CEOs who are able to deliver strong results,"" he said on France 5 television. 
Stellantis said later on Wednesday it was taking note of the feedback resulting from the advisory vote on the remuneration report and would explain in the 2022 remuneration report how this vote has been taken into account.
Tavares also said the company expected sales to be up or stable in all of its major markets in 2022 and reiterated a forecast for a positive cash flow at the end of this year.

Light vehicle sales fell 17% in the United States in the first quarter, as a global chip shortage and the Ukraine crisis squeezed inventories and rising prices pushed less affluent buyers out of the market.

Litt's investment firm Land & Buildings notified the U.S. warehouse-focused real estate investment trust in a letter on Tuesday that he had withdrawn his director nominations, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
A Land & Buildings spokesperson did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of the nominations. 
Litt had nominated himself and Donna Brandin, a former chief financial officer of Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), as director candidates to LXP's eight member board in December.
The move comes after the company said on April 8 that it ""determined to suspend"" its review process, citing macroeconomic, geopolitical and financing conditions. LXP's stock price has dropped 14% since the announcement.
LXP began its review process in early February, after Litt, whose hedge fund invests roughly $500 million, told the company that he would be willing to pay $16 a share in cash, without offering details on how he would finance a potential bid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global investor optimism lifted shares on Wednesday despite blurry inflation forecasts as bank earnings and oil supply concerns boosted trading sentiment.
The Japanese yen weakened past the 126 yen per dollar mark on Wednesday for the first time since 2002, while the euro was pinned at a one-month low as investors bought the U.S. currency after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials.
The prospect of fast and aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes and growing market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep rates ultra-low in the near term have fueled the Japanese currency's declines against the dollar.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields fell - and data on inflation did not dissuade investors from believing that inflation may have peaked.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.03% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.79%.
Equity markets have suffered from hawkish moves from the world's top central banks in response to inflation, analysts said.
But data on Wednesday showed no let-up for Britain after inflation hit a 30-year high of 7%, although this came a day after a lower-than-expected U.S. print had given some traders cause to hope policy would be tightened more slowly.
""Another month, another jump in inflation figures around the world,"" said Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at asset manager Janus Henderson.
""The increase in prices further ratchets up the pressure on the Bank of England to respond to dampen the squeeze on real incomes. However, fading growth forecasts show the danger to the economy from tightening too quickly or too far.""
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.74%, the S&P 500 gained 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.75%.
Investors, poised for lackluster earning results from the largest U.S. banks, have been eyeing investment banking revenue, which has stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. In the first quarter, the total value of pending and completed deals fell to its lowest since the second quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv data.
Overnight in Asia, much weaker-than-expected import data from China weighed on the outlook, but added to views that Beijing could ease policy further, helping MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.89% higher.
Japan also posted weak machinery orders data, although its stocks closed higher on the U.S. inflation data that had shown consumer prices rose by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as war in Ukraine boosted the cost of gasoline to record highs, although underlying inflation pressures moderated.
OIL, GOLD FIRMER 
After the prior day's fall, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose on Wednesday and was last down 5.3 basis points to 2.674%, compared to an over three-year peak of 2.836%, before the inflation data. 
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 5.5 basis points at 2.334%. 
""The most important issue this year is how the Federal Reserve is going to respond to the rising levels of inflation,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Short-term interest rate expectations have jumped and long-term interest rates have moved higher.""
In the euro zone, meanwhile, a key gauge of long-term inflation briefly breached 2.4% on Wednesday, above the European Central Bank's 2% target ahead of its next meeting on Thursday. 
In response, bond yields in the bloc climbed, with Germany's 10-year yield at 0.810%.
Oil prices rose after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that on-and-off peace talks with Ukraine had hit a dead end, fuelling supply worries, with U.S. crude recently rose 3.51% to $104.13 per barrel.
Brent was at $108.64, up 3.82% on the day.
Gold bounced off its lows to add 0.6% to $1,978.03 an ounce. 
In currency markets, the euro was last up 0.52% to $1.0882. The U.S. dollar soared to a nearly 20-year high against a sluggish yen on Wednesday, as aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve contrasted sharply with the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.
The greenback rose as high as 126.32 yen, its strongest level since June 2002. However, the dollar index last fell 0.455%, with the euro up 0.53% to $1.0883. (FRX) 
The New Zealand dollar was down 1.1% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised interest rates by 50 basis points -- its most aggressive hike in over two decades -- but tempered its rate outlook. 

Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point - its biggest single move in more than two decades - and promised more hikes to fight soaring inflation that is being driven in part by the war in Ukraine.
The central bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to 1% from 0.5%. It also said it would allow government bonds it amassed during the COVID-19 pandemic to roll off as they mature from April 25, beginning what is known as quantitative tightening.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, which agreed last month to be acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, was sued on Wednesday by a shareholder who accused the insurance company of making inadequate and misleading disclosures about the $11.6 billion takeover.
In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the plaintiff Shiva Stein said Alleghany failed in a proxy statement to adequately explain the financial basis for the ""fairness opinion"" issued by its bankers at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which assessed whether the deal was fair to shareholders.
Absent additional disclosures, ""plaintiff will be unable to make a fully-informed decision regarding whether to vote in favor of the proposed transaction, and she is thus threatened with irreparable harm,"" the complaint said.
Stein wants to block Berkshire from buying New York-based Alleghany unless more disclosures are made, and also seeks unspecified damages. The New Jersey resident has not argued that the takeover price is too low.
Alleghany did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to a similar request. Berkshire is not a defendant.
Shareholders like Stein often sue to block corporate mergers when they find the terms unfair or the disclosures too sparse.
On April 1, Stein sued Mandiant Inc to block the cybersecurity company's $5.4 billion takeover by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, also citing an alleged lack of disclosures to support a Goldman fairness opinion.
Berkshire agreed on March 21 to pay $848.02 per share for Alleghany, a 25% premium.
Goldman's fairness opinion called that price ""fair from a financial point of view"" to Alleghany shareholders.

The purchase would expand Berkshire's large portfolio of insurers, including Geico and General Re. It would also reunite Buffett with Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008.
The case is Stein v  Alleghany Corp  et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03057.

It is Amazon's first such surcharge and follows months of higher wage and labor-related expenses that have chipped away at the online retailer's profit.
Effective April 28, Amazon will charge an average 24 cents more per unit it stores and ships through its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service. The surcharge, which is not permanent, is ""a mechanism broadly used across supply chain providers,"" Amazon wrote in a message to merchants, which it shared with Reuters.
""We have experienced significant cost increases and absorbed them, wherever possible, to reduce the impact on our selling partners,"" the message said. ""In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as COVID-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges.""

So far, Amazon has only announced a surcharge in the United States, its biggest market. While sellers can avoid the higher cost by shipping goods to customers directly, many rely on FBA for eligibility in Amazon's fast-delivery club Prime.
Amazon said its fulfillment service ""continues to cost significantly less than alternatives.""

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%, or 258 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.8%.
Technology stocks were in the ascendency as investors swooped into big tech, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) leading the charge up more than 1% as Treasury yields slipped for a second-straight day.
Chip stocks were also doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after New Street Research upgraded the chipmaker to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock $280 from $255, citing the strength of its data center business.
Sentiment in the sector was also boosted by Bloomberg data showing that investors have been piling into chip stocks. Investor inflows into semiconductor ETFs jumped to $6.8 billion, topping the $5.2 billion of inflows seen in all of 2021.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the sectors leading the broader market higher, underpinned by a rally in travel-related stocks including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and Carnival (NYSE:CCL), after better than feared results from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) pointed to strong travel demand. 
Delta forecast a return to profit in the second quarter after reporting a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss.
Financials, however, bucked the trend higher, weighed down by a more than 3% decline in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) after first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates owing to higher than expected provisions for bad debt, citing “higher probabilities of downside risk.”

MILAN (Reuters) -Iliad is considering buying into  Telecom Italia  (BIT:TLIT)'s (TIM) domestic consumer services operations as part of the French phone group's push to strengthen its Italian business, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Iliad is weighing the investment as TIM works on a turnaround plan centred around a split of the debt-laden former phone monopoly's wholesale fixed network from its services business.
Iliad targets in particular the domestic consumer service unit TIM would create as part of its reorganisation process. 
Such a unit would include TIM's fixed and mobile consumer businesses, which last year accounted for 73% of its 9.9 billion euro ($11 billion) domestic service revenue. It would also include mobile frequencies.
TIM and Iliad declined to comment.
Founded by French billionaire Xavier Niel, Iliad launched low cost mobile services in Italy in 2018, intensifying already ferocious price competition in the country's crowded telecoms market.
Top executives at Iliad have repeatedly stated the group's interest in an Italian peer if anything came up for sale. 
One of the sources said Iliad had informed TIM's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) of its interest in the consumer business. A spokesperson for Vivendi said the French media group had not had any contact with Iliad.
A third source close to the matter said TIM had not received any proposal from Iliad so far.
The French group has shifted its focus to TIM after a failed approach for Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s Italian operations in February.
At the time Iliad teamed with Apax Partners to submit an 11.25 billion euro non-binding bid which the British operator swiftly rejected.
Apax, which is looking at a potential investment into TIM's services business, is not working with Iliad at present, a fourth source familiar with the situation said, dismissing reports in some Italian newspapers of the pair teaming up again.
TIM has been drawing the attention of investment funds as it looks to unlock value by carving out assets.
Last week it effectively blocked a takeover approach by KKR, but the U.S. fund could still play a role in the spin-off of TIM's network in which it is an investor.
The spin-off would facilitate a mooted merger of TIM's network assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber, with state lender CDP in control.
CDP is TIM's second-biggest investor after Vivendi. The French media group would shift its focus on TIM's services business, which has already attracted interest from investment fund CVC. 
""With the odds of a KKR bid now virtually at zero, the breakup scenario seems to involve more and more options given the string of potential interested parties for certain portions of TIM's business"", broker Banca Akros said in a note.

Akros said TIM's consumer services business could be worth around 4 billion euros.

187,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 01:56PM ET</span>","Ford CEO Jim Farley Says 'It's Time', Announces F-150 Lightning Launch Date","Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley announced via tweet today, ""it's time,"" announcing that the F-150 Lightning ""strikes"" on April 26th at 1:30PM ET. Ford also added a countdown clock to its website along with the announcement.
Last month, Ford confirmed the final EPA-estimated battery range for F-150 Lightning. The truck's range on a single charge is between 230 miles and 320 miles, depending on trim level and battery pack.
The automaker will mark the launch with an event at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, where the electric truck is assembled.
Pricing for the electric F-150 starts at just under $40,000 for the work truck version, excluding destination charges. The base MSRP for the Platinum model is $90,874. These prices do not take into consideration federal incentives for electric vehicle buyers.
However, if you haven't already pre-ordered, Ford isn't even letting you put your name on the list at the moment. Ford had previously said the F-150 Lightning would begin deliveries sometime this spring and stopped taking deposits on the truck in December after receiving 200,000 reservations ahead of launch.
The American automaker has already taken steps to prevent dealers from jacking up prices and to keep buyers from quickly reselling them to the highest bidder, but the supply will likely be tight. Ford is already making moves to double the annual production capacity of the Lightning to 150,000 units per year, a target it expects to reach sometime next year.

The new surcharge, the latest sign of companies grappling with rising costs, will apply to U.S. sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon, a service in which Amazon stows, packs and ships products on behalf of independent merchants. Amazon intends to notify sellers about the fee later Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.
Inflation has skyrocketed in recent months, and gasoline prices have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). each added fuel surcharges last month to offset the added costs.
In the email to be sent to Amazon sellers, the company said it has made big investments since the start of the pandemic to meet surging demand. Those include doubling capacity, adding 750,000 employees and raising the average Amazon warehouse employee wage to $18 from $15.
“Like many, we have experienced significant cost increases and absorbed them, wherever possible, to reduce the impact on our selling partners,” according to the email. “In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as Covid-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges. It is still unclear if these inflationary costs will go up or down, or for how long they will persist.”
For Amazon, the marketplace business represents nearly a quarter of sales. The company had seller services revenue of $30.3 billion in the quarter that ended in December.

It signals the latest move by crypto and incumbent financial networks to join forces as digital assets become more mainstream.
Nexo said the card, available in selected European countries initially, allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets such as bitcoin, which are used as collateral to back the credit granted.
Most traditional credit cards are unsecured and have a set credit limit.
The card is linked to a Nexo-provided, crypto-backed credit line and can be used at 92 million merchants worldwide where Mastercard is accepted, allowing investors to spend up to 90% of the fiat value of their crypto assets, Nexo said.
""The card requires no minimum repayments, monthly, or inactivity fees. There are no FX fees for up to 20,000 euros per month,"" Nexo said.
There are no restrictions on how much a customer can spend or withdraw from the open credit line and interest is only paid on the amount of credit actually used. Interest remains at 0% for customers who maintain a loan-to-value ratio of 20% or below.

""Mastercard recognizes that digital assets are revolutionizing the financial landscape,"" said Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain products and partnerships.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 01:01PM ET</span>",Delta sees 'meaningful' profit as travel demand hits 'historic' levels,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc on Wednesday forecast returning to profit in the current quarter, after posting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, on the back of a booming travel demand, sending its shares higher.
The company said robust consumer demand not only translated into a ""solid"" profit in March, but is also allowing it to offset soaring fuel costs with higher fares.
As a result, Delta said it expects to post a ""meaningful"" profit this year. In the quarter through June, it estimates to generate an adjusted operating margin in the range of 12% to 14% and ""strong"" free cash flow. Company revenue in the quarter is forecast to increase by about 14-18 points from a quarter ago.
""The demand environment that we have today is at a historic high,"" Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian told Reuters in an interview. ""The last five weeks have been the strongest period of bookings that Delta has ever seen in our history.""
After a speed bump caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, travel demand has roared back. U.S. passenger traffic has been averaging about 89% of the pre-pandemic levels since mid-February, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.
The Atlanta-based carrier said its domestic consumer revenues are above 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel has accelerated with the reopening of offices.
Delta's shares were up 4.6% at $40.39 in mid-day trade.
SOARING COSTS, HIGHER FARES
A run-up in fuel costs and rising wages, however, are also driving up industry's operating expenses. Jet fuel prices in North America have gone up by more than 30% in the past month, since Western countries slapped sanctions on Russian exports.
Delta's fuel bill in the March quarter was 33% higher than a quarter ago and is projected to increase by at least 15% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to end-June.
Fuel is the airline industry's second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. carriers do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. Instead, they typically look to offset fuel costs with higher fares.
Airline fares were up about 24% year-on-year in March, among the biggest contributors to a jump in U.S. consumer prices. Delta's average fares are up about 33% from a year ago, according to data from Cowen.
Some analysts are concerned that rising fares and higher inflation could dent travel spending. But Delta said higher fares have not impacted consumer demand, thus far. It expects the demand to stay strong even in the fall. 
""Right now, I'm optimistic that our consumers will be in a very good place to continue to travel,"" Bastian said.
Yet, the company is mindful of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and plans to be disciplined in ramping up capacity.

Its capacity in the June quarter is estimated to inch up to about 84% of the 2019 level. Bastian said the carrier is not expected to be at full capacity this year.
Adjusted loss for the first quarter came in at $1.23 per share, smaller than $1.27 per share estimated by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 12:55PM ET</span>",JPMorgan's Dimon downbeat as profit drops 42%,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and David Henry
(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned of economic uncertainties arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation, after first-quarter profits at the largest U.S. bank slumped 42%. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) had reported record profit during the first quarter last year, benefiting from a dealmaking boom after the Federal Reserve pumped liquidity into capital markets to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This year, however, investment banking revenues declined as companies delayed takeovers and stock market listings amid a surge of volatility in equity markets. The bank also set aside $902 million to cover potential loan losses. 
JPMorgan is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy and its lackluster results set the tone for first-quarter earnings from Wall Street banks as the Fed looks to rein in inflation and the trading bonanza banks enjoyed during the pandemic tapers off.
""Inflation and Ukraine are powerful forces that threaten the economy,"" Dimon said on a call with media, underscoring a change in his bullish outlook for the U.S. economy. 
""The Fed needs to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible.""
Pressed on whether the U.S. could face a recession, Dimon said: ""I am not predicting a recession. Is it possible? Absolutely.""
JPMorgan shares were down 2.8% in afternoon trading. Other bank stocks also fell.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were both down 0.9%. 
JPMorgan's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to 11.9% from 13.1% in December. That could hamper its ability to buy back shares, analysts said.
The bank will buy back less stock this year than in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts.
Questioned by analysts about the broader outlook for the current year, Dimon said there were ""storm clouds on the horizon,"" including the war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
""Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them,"" he said.
Dimon's tone on the economy was less optimistic than in the past and that weighed on the stock, said Christopher Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""Jamie is one of those people who will tell you what you need to hear, not necessarily what you want to hear,"" he said. ""A lot of people want to hear that everything is fine and he's not telling you that.""
INCREASED VOLATILITY
Trading was better than anticipated, analysts said, but still down 3% on a record quarter last year. 
Dimon warned of increased volatility ahead, which bankers have said could be good for Wall Street trading desks.
""There is almost no chance you won’t have volatile markets, that can be good or bad. But I think people should be prepared for that,"" he said.
JPMorgan reported a 28% drop in investment banking revenue for the first quarter, dragging net revenue down 5% to $30.72 billion. The fall also reflected markdowns related to Russia-linked derivatives. 
Investment banking fees plunged 32% to $2.01 billion, driven by a 69% decline in equity underwriting fees. The number of deals where JPMorgan acted as a bookrunner declined 39% compared with last year.
UP AGAINST INFLATION
The big U.S. banks are reporting results at a time of surging inflation, which could lead the Fed to hike interest rates more aggressively this year.
While that can benefit big lenders by increasing what they earn from loans, rapid rate hikes could slow the economy and scupper a nascent recovery from the pandemic.
Net interest income from JPMorgan's core banking businesses, excluding the markets business, increased 9% from a year earlier. That figure is expected to be more than $53 billion for 2022, the bank said, roughly in line with its February guidance. 
JPMorgan reiterated its full-year expenses would increase nearly 10%.

Markets revenue came in stronger than had some had feared, falling 3% to $8.8 billion, with fixed income trading down only 1% compared to exceptionally strong levels last year.
Other large U.S. banks including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will report results on Thursday.

By Jan Wolfe
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An April 2023 jury trial has been scheduled in Dominion Voting Systems Inc's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit accusing Fox News of trying to boost its ratings by falsely claiming the voting machine company rigged the 2020 U.S. presidential election against former President Donald Trump.
In a short written order issued on Friday, Delaware state court judge Eric Davis said he was scheduling Denver-based Dominion's lawsuit for trial on April 17, 2023. Fox, part of Fox Corp, had asked Owens for a trial date in early 2024.
Davis set aside five weeks for the trial, which could be the first of several involving baseless claims made by a variety of news outlets and individuals about Dominion's technology. Dominion filed its lawsuit against Fox News in March 2021.
People associated with Trump's campaign, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, floated conspiracy theories that Dominion rigged vote totals in the weeks after the Nov. 3, 2020, election in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Trump.
Dominion has filed defamation lawsuits against several Trump allies, including Giuliani and Powell, as well as conservative television networks Newsmax and One America News. Another election technology firm at the center of conspiracy theories, Smartmatic, has filed similar lawsuits.
The defendants have said they were commenting on matters of public concern and their remarks are free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Davis in December ruled against a Fox News request that he dismiss Dominion's lawsuit. Owens wrote in his ruling that it was ""reasonably conceivable"" that Dominion has a viable defamation claim, and allowed the company to continue to seek documents and witness testimony from Fox.
Fox News representatives have called Dominion's lawsuit ""baseless"" and have said the network remains committed to defending itself.

""As we have maintained, FOX News, along with every single news organization across the country, vigorously covered the breaking news surrounding the unprecedented 2020 election, providing full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear-cut analysis,"" a Fox spokesperson said in December.
Fox News and Dominion representatives did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Tuesday.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Benetton family and investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are talking to banks to put the final touches to a bid for Italy's Atlantia, sources said on Wednesday, as the two get ready to launch one of this year's biggest takeover deals.
Benetton holding company Edizione, which already owns 33% of Atlantia, is expected later on Wednesday to give the green light to a deal which could value the roads and airports group at more than 48 billion euros ($51.90 billion) if 30 billion euros of net debt is included.
If successful, it would be the second-biggest global deal of 2022 so far, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
The move comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the enforced sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a deal aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
The takeover will mark a new phase for the infrastructure group after almost four years during which Atlantia's business was put at risk and its reputation wrecked following the death of 43 people in the bridge disaster.
Edizione last week said it was in talks with Blackstone regarding Atlantia after it rejected an approach by Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield to acquire Atlantia and hand its motorway concessions to Spain's Florentino Perez.
""The funds proposed the Benettons to completely exit the business and indicated their intention to break the group up,"" one source told Reuters, adding this sounded like a slap in the face for the family who had stood by their investment throughout the aftermath of the bridge crisis. 
The Benettons and Blackstone now aim to delist Atlantia to shield it from rival suitors who have partnered with Perez.
The Spanish business tycoon Perez controls construction company ACS which in turn runs Spanish road group Abertis with Atlantia.
Sources said Perez and the funds backing him were in a 'wait and see' mode after their offer was rebuffed by the Benettons, but had not pulled out of the race.
""We would see as unlikely a counter bid... given the low chances to be successful given Edizione's stake... and government intervention in the case of a foreign bid,"" Italian broker Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) said on Wednesday.
At 1330 GMT Atlantia shares were up 0.9% at 21.92 euros.

On Tuesday, one source told Reuters Edizione and Blackstone were considering an offer between 22 and 23 euros per share, a premium of around 30% over Atlantia's average stock price in the last six months.

TASS news agency had cited Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov as saying it was in talks with Mercedes-Benz to acquire the carmaker's stake in Kamaz.
""We cannot confirm the TASS report,"" a Mercedes-Benz spokesperson said. ""As far as we are aware there are no talks ongoing with Rostec,"" a  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck spokesperson added.
Rostec holds 49.9% of Kamaz shares, according to Kamaz's website. Mercedes-Benz, formerly Daimler AG (ETR:MBGn), holds 15%. The remaining 20.81% are held by Cyprus-registered company Avtoinvest.
Avtoinvest could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mercedes-Benz AG, which at the time was Daimler AG, took over a 15% stake in Kamaz from Daimler Truck in September 2021 with a view to returning it to Daimler Truck after the truckmaker was spun off from the carmaker in December last year.
After the spin-off, Daimler AG was renamed Mercedes-Benz AG.
However, approval was needed from Russian regulators, as well as Kamaz's other shareholders, before the share could be returned to Daimler Truck, its CEO Martin Daum said in late March.

A spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz said talks with Russian regulators had not been finalised.
Like many other companies, Daimler Truck froze its business in Russia in February following Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, suspending its joint venture with Kamaz, which produces trucks, buses and Mercedes-Benz passenger cars.

Peloton, a market darling during the COVID-19 pandemic as people flocked to its bikes, treadmills and popular streamed workouts, hired former Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) executive Barry McCarthy as CEO in February to replace Foley who was named executive chairman.
In a presentation published on Wednesday, Blackwells said the new management team has failed to make ""meaningful changes"" and that shareholders have lost nearly $2 billion of value since McCarthy was hired.
Peloton's stock price, which had come under pressure as people returned to gyms as the pandemic eased, has fallen nearly 40% since McCarthy arrived. The company is now worth $7.8 billion, down from nearly $50 billion at its peak during the pandemic. The stock price climbed 5% to $24.91 after the presentation was published.
Peloton said it appreciates investors views and has ""acted, and will continue to act, in the best interest of all Peloton shareholders.”
Blackwells' founder, Jason Aintabi, said the $800 million expense reduction plan does not appear to go far enough and that there was room to ""further rationalize the business.""
Aintabi also criticized Foley's decision in February to sell roughly $50 million in Peloton stock to Michael Dell's MSD Partners at a 12% discount. The move exacerbates ""misalignment with other shareholders,"" the presentation said.

Aintabi again said Peloton should be sold. It could bring at least $75 a share in a sale and companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have complementary businesses that would mesh with Peloton, Aintabi said.
""For Peloton to garner a similar share price would likely take years through the acquisition of millions more subscribers,"" the presentation said.

202,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>","Microsoft Gets Antitrust Complaints From Aruba, Danish Firms Over Cloud","(Bloomberg) -- Italian cloud provider Aruba SpA and a group of cloud providers in Denmark are part of a high-profile complaint made against  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). to the European Union’s antitrust watchdog.
European cloud companies have called on regulators to investigate the U.S. tech giant, arguing that Microsoft undermines competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market. The complaint was filed last year but only one of the three cloud providers who were on it was named, France’s OVH.
Microsoft customers have complained that they pay more to use its must-have programs like Windows and Office when they’re run through rival cloud-computing systems instead of Microsoft’s Azure, and the practice shows Microsoft is using its power in one market to undermine competitors in another, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
A spokesman for Aruba confirmed to Bloomberg that it’s part of OVH’s complaint. Danish Cloud Community, a group of cloud providers in Denmark, is also part of the complaint, according to a people familiar with the matter.  
Microsoft President Brad Smith pledged the company will talk with customers and rivals, saying in an interview “there definitely are some valid concerns” and “it’s very important for us to learn more and then make some changes.”
European cloud trade group CISPE said Smith’s remarks demonstrate the need for “urgent action, not only vague commitments to talk,” and called on European Union officials to hold the company to account. The group’s members include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., whose Amazon Web Services dominates the market for cloud computing, followed by Azure.
“Microsoft’s steady pattern of amendments to license terms has ratcheted up pressure on rival vendors and led to increasing costs for customers over several years,” a CISPE spokesman said in a statement. “We urge regulators to continue investigating forcefully.”
The bloc’s officials have been asking regional cloud companies about Microsoft’s practices, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.
A spokesman for Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the CISPE remarks. Danish Cloud Community declined to comment.

The stock climbed as high as $24.68 in New York following the release of a new presentation by Blackwells pushing for changes. Peloton had been down 34% this year through Tuesday’s close.
New CEO Barry McCarthy took the helm in February and has vowed to turn around the company, which had been thriving during pandemic lockdowns but is now struggling with slowing demand. But he has dismissed the idea of selling the business -- irking investors like Blackwells, which says that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and other could be bidders.
Peloton co-founder John Foley was removed from the CEO job in February’s shake-up, but he remains executive chairman and is part of a group that controls the company with super-voting stock. That limits the power of an investor like Blackwells to force Peloton’s hand.
“Peloton will continue to be poorly valued for as long as a close-knit group of insiders, who have proven themselves incapable of creating value, continue to wield voting power far in excess of their economic interest,” Blackwells Chief Investment Officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement. “No shareholder should want Mr. Foley to still sit atop the management pyramid or control the board through his super voting-stock. He lost his entitlement to both positions when he destroyed $40 billion of shareholder wealth in less than a year.”
McCarthy, a former finance executive at Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), has been working to boost Peloton’s revenue from services -- as opposed to hardware. This month the company slashed the price of a new strength-training device that just went on sale. It also is testing a program that lets customers buy its signature bikes through a subscription program.
But Spotify has lost an additional $2 billion in market value since the overhaul in February and it’s time for bigger changes, Blackwells said.
“Blackwells calls upon Mr. Foley to recognize his own limitations and the dampening effect his control has on public market investors by immediately eliminating the dual class structure,” Aintabi said.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:51AM ET</span>",Elon Musk is sued by shareholders over delay in disclosing Twitter stake,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by former  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shareholders who claim they missed out on the recent run-up in its stock price because he waited too long to disclose a 9.2% stake in the social media company.
In a proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court, the shareholders said Musk, the chief executive of electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, made ""materially false and misleading statements and omissions"" by failing to reveal he had invested in Twitter by March 24 as required under federal law.
Twitter shares rose 27% on April 4, to $49.97 from $39.31, after Musk disclosed his stake, which investors viewed as a vote of confidence from the world's richest person in San Francisco-based Twitter.
Former shareholders led by Marc Rasella said the delayed disclosure let Musk buy more Twitter shares at lower prices, while defrauding them into selling at ""artificially deflated"" prices.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
A lawyer for Musk had no immediate comment. Tesla is not a defendant.
U.S. securities law requires investors to disclose within 10 days when they have acquired 5% of a company, which in Musk's case would have been March 24.
Twitter announced on April 5 that Musk would join its board of directors, but this week said he had decided not to.
By not joining the board, Musk, a prolific Twitter user, can keep buying shares without being bound by his agreement with the company to limit his stake to 14.9%.
Some analysts have suggested Musk could push Twitter to make changes, or even pursue an unsolicited bid for the company.

Rasella said he sold 35 Twitter shares for $1,373, or an average price of $39.23, between March 25 and 29. Musk is worth $265.1 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
The case is Rasella v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03026.

The Street is looking for EPS of $2.90 on sales of $7.93. Analysts from three top Street firms discuss their expectations for Netflix shares.
BMO’s Daniel Salmon (Outperform, $640 down from $650): “Subscriber growth still matters, but the market is bringing far greater scrutiny of the path to profitability for more recent streaming entrants, and the trajectory of now-positive FCF estimates for NFLX. We remain above consensus on FCF, as we see continued optimization of content spending driving top-line growth, while the total rate of spending eases. We are below sell-side consensus on paid net member additions near-term, but we think buy-side expectations are more muted, and that APAC could surprise owing to the mobile-first gaming strategy in this mobile-first viewing region.”
Barclays’ Kannan Venkateshwar (Equal Weight, $380 from $425): “Based on the average predicted value across various short and long term models, Netflix appears to be on a path to ~4mm subs, better than company guidance, but still weak in the absolute for a Q1.”
Monness, Crespi, Hardt’s Brian White (Neutral, N/A): “Although the content on Netflix has been exceptional over the past couple of years, nefarious forces appear to be lurking beneath the surface of Netflix’s post-lockdown recovery, either in the form of a slower-than-expected healing process after the pandemic-driven pull forward, a weaker-than-expected global economy, or a platform that has simply hit a near term, growth wall.”

Russian actions in Ukraine, which Moscow calls ""a special military operation"", remained in focus, along with a risk of new Western sanctions and expectations that the economy is heading for its sharpest contraction since 1994.
At 1438 GMT, the rouble eased 0.3% to 79.91 against the dollar, after rallying to 71 last week, which was its strongest since Nov. 11.

""There will be several periods of strong turbulence on the market by the year end,"" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank, adding that even though the rouble may firm in the coming month, there is substantial room for its weakening in the longer run.
The rouble eased this week after the central bank scrapped a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages and promised to lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18.
But the rouble retains support from export-focused companies that are obliged to convert 80% of their forex revenues on the domestic market.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>",Mexico's new airport still lacking basics despite big opening splash,"By Kylie Madry
SANTA LUCIA, Mexico (Reuters) - After a grandiose inauguration ceremony of Mexico City's newest airport last month, not a single suitcase was in sight there on a recent Friday afternoon, with just one flight flashing across the display board: Aeromexico, arriving from the Mexican city of Merida, delayed. 
Three weeks after the opening, Felipe Angeles International Airport (AIFA), 28 miles (45 km) north of the current Mexico City hub, was still under construction.
The teething problems risk embarrassing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who made the airport a key project of his presidency, and giving ammunition to the opposition that have long criticized the new airport as a vanity project.
Chain-link fences covered with green tarps lined the entrance to the airport, and dust painted the sky a reddish hue as construction crews continued excavation.
The reality contrasts starkly with the pitch sold by Lopez Obrador, who called it ""one of the best airports in the world"" ahead of the inauguration.
The leftist rattled investors when he canceled his predecessor's $13 billion partially built airport before even taking office just over three years ago, arguing that the project was riddled with graft, too costly and poorly located.
Instead, he ordered the Army to build a commercial airport on the grounds of the Santa Lucia military air base.
Lopez Obrador inaugurated the airport on March 21, the birthday of 19th century Mexican hero Benito Juarez and ahead of a recall vote on the president's rule, which he handily won despite low voter turnout.
""I think the airport is 100%. It's completely finished,"" Lopez Obrador said at the grand opening. 
As well as the uncompleted construction work, the airport also suffers from congested roadways linking it to the city and will not have a train connection until next year. For the moment, the airport does not allow pick-ups through ride-hailing services.
A new highway connection to the airport is still under construction, though one employee said what had been built cut her commute time in half.
TOURISTS ARRIVE, BUT NOT TO TRAVEL
Of the 14 arrivals and departures confirmed at AIFA that day, compared to the close to 900 daily flights at the main Mexico City International Airport, a handful were military flights, according to flight records.
Since its opening, the AIFA has averaged around a dozen flights a day, flight records show. Around 2,000 passengers use the airport a day, presidential spokesman Jesus Ramirez told Reuters. The AIFA estimates that it will serve 2.4 million passengers this year and double that in 2023, he said.
The AIFA has yet to appoint a spokesperson, officials told Reuters, and the Army and Mexico's Transportation Ministry had no immediate comment for this story. 
Inside the new airport, check-in booths stood empty, even as Mexican carriers Volaris, Aeromexico and VivaAerobus as well as Venezuela's Conviasa have announced routes to and from here. 
An airport employee who works with the airlines said flights using AIFA were estimated to cost about half of those to and from the original Mexico City airport due to a lower airport usage tariff and government incentives. 
Volaris told Reuters that flight costs would be lower, though it said it was not receiving subsidies. The other airlines did not comment. 
The airport should at some point have two commercial runways, public construction plans show, though only one is currently in operation.
""Being able to land two planes at once or have two take off at the same time ... not even the Mexico City International Airport has that,"" said Victor Manuel Pena Chavez, an aeronautical engineering professor at the National Polytechnical Institute.
Past security, staff worked at a Krispy Kreme stall and a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), while a smattering of storefronts - such as a Mexican-themed gift store and a pastry shop - had already opened. Most spots remained shuttered, plastered with ""coming soon"" signs.
By late afternoon, plenty of people were milling about the 3,800-acre grounds, though not to travel.
They were curious neighbors or employees on their day off, families that stuck around as the sun went down, hoping to see the delayed Aeromexico flight land. 

In the almost four hours that a Reuters journalist spent at the airport, the plane was the only one seen occupying the runway, which flight records confirmed.
""Once we get to mid-year, I really hope there'll be more flights,"" one of the employees said.

Esper, who served as Trump's defense chief from June 2019 to November 2020, will lead businesses in the areas of defense, cyber security, international affairs, space and aerospace, Red Cell said in a statement.
The company, founded in 2020, backs technology-led companies in the healthcare and defense sectors.
The appointment of Esper, who was fired as defense secretary over a range of differences on policy issues, comes a month after U.S. President Joe Biden sought a record peacetime national defense budget of $813 billion, including the largest research and development budget in history.
The fiscal budget has earmarked $130 billion to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.
""I believe the key to accelerating and expanding the U.S. military's overmatch in the years ahead is through the rapid, sustained, and aggressive modernization of the joint force,"" Esper said in the statement.

Tysons, Virginia-based Red Cell was co-founded by healthcare and defense technology entrepreneur Grant Verstandig, investment management veteran Josh Lobel and venture capitalist and defense entrepreneur John Tenet.

JPMorgan reported a Q1 EPS of $2.63, down from $4.50 in the year-ago period and below the consensus estimates of $2.72 per share. Adjusted revenue came in at $31.59 billion, down 4.6% YoY and beating the consensus projection of $31.44 billion.
The bank reported $1.07 trillion in loans in the quarter, up 6.1% YoY and almost in line with the expected $1.08 trillion. Total deposits came in at $2.56 trillion, up 12% YoY and above analyst expectations of $2.45 trillion. Compensation expenses were reported at $10.79 billion, missing the consensus projection of $10.98 billion.
Return on equity stood at 13% in the period, compared to the estimated 12.5%. Return on tangible common equity was 16%, above the expected 15.7%. JPMorgan reported assets under management of $2.96 trillion, also below the $3.07 trillion consensus.
Going forward, the bank expects 2022 adjusted expenses of roughly $77 billion. JPM anticipates net income interest (NII) excluding markets of more than $53 billion, compared to the previous outlook of $50 billion.
JPMorgan also confirmed a new share repurchase plan of $30 billion, which will come into effect on May 1.
Results also reflect $524 million losses “within Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties ($0.13 decrease in EPS),” the bank said.
Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden commented:
“We estimate that the core ROTCE came in at 18.5% for the quarter versus our expectations of 16.2%. All in, we believe that the market will see these results as broadly in-line, with stronger trading results, NII and the margin, but significantly more pressure on capital ratios, which should weigh on capital return,” Ramsden wrote in a memo.
Seaport analyst Jim Mitchell says that shares are down on “negative implications for the buyback and more cautious view on the macro outlook.”

The analyst argues that FY23 estimates need to be reset materially, hence his revised estimates now sit at a Street-low ($5.25).
Moreover, “building conviction on an inflection in growth next year is challenging amidst the worsening affordability backdrop, suggesting the stock is likely close to a near-term peak at current levels (~16x FY2 EPS of $6.25) with potential downside to $75 (~14x NTM EPS of $5.25) in the near-term,” Gupta said in a client note.
For these reasons, Gupta finds it hard to “recommend this trade anymore given the material cut needed to near-term estimates in a likely worsening affordability backdrop before it gets better.”
The analyst is more positive on KMX in case a mild near-term recession occurs due to the company’s better BS leverage and FCF support.
A new price target is $110.00 per share, down from $135.00.

As of 9:44 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 77 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.5%.

Big banks are expected to show subdued results because of a slump in investment banking and capital markets activity in the first quarter.

The brand new Lucid Air Grand Touring Performance will be priced at $179,000 and will hit the markets in June. Lucid’s previous Air sedan has impressed drivers and critics around the world, partly thanks to the remarkable performance of the 1,111 horsepower Dream Edition.
However, Lucid capped production of that model to just 520 vehicles, while the new Grand Air Touring Performance, even though will cost $10,000 more than the Dream Edition, will not be as limited in production.
The new Air sedan is still in the early phases of production, said Lucid. The electric vehicle (EV) maker produced roughly 400 vehicles since its production began in September, adding it had around 25,000 reservations for the Air.
The carmaker expects to ship between 12,000 and 14,000 cars in 2022, down from its original outlook of 20,000 as global supply chain challenges have weighed on the Air production.
The company decided to build the new version of Air after seeing increasing demand for the powerful luxury sedan, said Lucid’s CEO Peter Rawlinson. The carmaker was able to develop the new, even faster model; thanks to its “vertical integration,” Rawlinson added.
Following the announcement, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli commented:
“The introduction of new trims is fairly common and so we don’t view this as major news. However, if Lucid does see healthy demand for this new Performance trim, it could benefit ASPs/mix later this year,” the analyst said in a client note.

The overall charge comprises of 30% hardware platform fee for sales made through Meta Quest Store, where it sells apps and games meant for its virtual reality headsets, and a further 17.5% cut as its Horizon platform fees, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.
On Monday, the tech giant said it would start testing tools for creators to sell digital assets and in turn make money on Horizon Worlds, a key part of its plan for creating a metaverse.
Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been a critic of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s app store fees of 30%, but Meta's latest move to charge creators nearly half their sales on its own platform has angered many of them.

The Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.
Meta's Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.

RBC analyst Brad Erickson lowered the price target to $240.00 per share from $245.00 to reflect lower estimates.
“Another round of SMB ad agency channel checks raises our conviction that FB is likely to see another rocky quarter upcoming prompting lower estimates and PT to $240. Digital ad spend decisions remain in flux with many SMBs considering new channels away from FB for the first time and we detected no perceived improvement to FB's targeting algo or performance. We'd expect some reversion at some point given FB's audience size and relative scaled conversion advantage (which keeps us at Outperform), but we see that narrative as unlikely to materialize near-term,” the analyst said in a client note.
Similarly, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein also cut the price target to $305.00 per share from $375.00 to reflect lower estimates, which mirror impacts from Russia, a weaker European economy, and continued headwinds to performance ad-targeting on FB/IG from IDFA impacts.
“Based on FB's CFO comments at the most recent industry conference, 1Q guidance was largely driven by softening e-commerce demand, since exacerbated in Europe, as Russia/Ukraine further affects consumer spending. Lowering 1Q22E revenue 4% and core EBITDA 6%. Lowering '22E/'23E revenue 9% each and core EBITDA 13%/10%, respectively.

“The market has widely believed that NIO is undertaking a complete production halt. However, according to NIO management, the halt is limited to weekends only, and production lines will still be running on weekdays, albeit on a limited scale.

Rainey serves as PayPal’s head of finances and is expected to take on his role at Walmart on June 6, succeeding Bret Biggs, who announced his decision to step down in November.
Biggs will step down from his duty in June, though he will remain the company’s advisor through January 31.
Rainey “has a proven track record of leading change at scale in customer service organizations innovating in their fields,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.
Before joining PayPal, Rainey served as the CFO of United Airlines.
“I’m confident that John’s mix of financial and digital acumen, coupled with his experience leading finance in complex, highly competitive industries, will help us deliver for our customers and shareholders as we continue to transform our company,” McMillon said.
The appointment comes as Walmart continues to identify and unlock new revenue-driving opportunities, such as its plan to expand its third-party marketplace and upgrade its advertising business.
The retail giant has also recently created and backed a financial technology startup spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs bankers.
Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman commented that Rainey is a “high quality hire.”
“Positives: strong reputation, fintech/tech background, established CFO track record at two large public companies. Negatives: lack of direct Retail experience and omni-channel/store operational expertise,” Gutman said in a client note.
On the other hand, Gutman’s colleague and PYPL analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), James Faucette, says that Rainey’s exit is a “mixed update.”
“John Rainey's departure may be perceived as negative signaling, and could potentially refresh fears around the company's ability to sustain above market growth and reach financial targets, which include rapidly accelerating revenue growth throughout 2022 and a medium-term outlook for ~20% revenue growth and ~22% EPS growth. At the same time, there may be some relief among investors as there had been speculation around a change in senior leadership given recent earnings misses and related selloffs of PayPal's stock,” Faucette wrote in a memo.
Bank of America) analyst Jason Kupferberg is more negative on PYPL than Faucette.
“Notably, PYPL did not reiterate guidance in today's announcement, which adds uncertainty heading into earnings on 4/27. Though valuation remains near all-time lows, we see limited visibility on PYPL's 2H ramp & normalized earnings power,” Kupferberg wrote in a memo.

Bigger rival TCS on Monday reported a 7.4% increase in fourth-quarter profit to 99.3 billion rupees, as rising employee costs partly offset higher demand.
India’s outsourcers are seeking to maintain the momentum they gathered during the pandemic as enterprises across the world scaled up their online presence, boosting demand for services ranging from cybersecurity to cloud and payments.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>",Former Swiss 'banker of the year' jailed in high-profile fraud trial,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) -Former Raiffeisen Switzerland Chief Executive Pierin Vincenz was jailed for nearly four years on Wednesday at the end of a fraud trial which exposed his huge strip club bills and misuse of company expenses.
After one of Switzerland's highest-profile corporate crime trials in decades, Zurich's district court convicted Vincenz, a former Swiss 'banker of the year' who was charged with making millions through illicit deals while he was CEO of the bank.
Vincenz, who was acquitted on several counts, was fined 840,000 Swiss francs ($900,600) and ordered to pay nearly 1.6 million francs in damages to compensate firms in which he was involved, as the court also found the 65-year-old guilty of using business expenses for private purposes.
His lawyer told Reuters that Vincenz, who denies any wrongdoing, would appeal the verdict after he was sentenced to 3-3/4 years in prison.
Vincenz had told the court that a near 200,000 Swiss franc expenses bill for strip club visits was largely business-related, while a 700 franc dinner with a woman he met on dating app Tinder was justified because he was considering her for a real estate job.
But Judge Sebastian Aeppli told the court that the expense claims went too far and were not in his employer's interests.
""(His) understanding, whereby practically all expenditures of a business person fall under disposable company expenses so long as any remote connection to the business activity exists, clearly went too far,"" Aeppli said.
""The relationship maintenance he carried out in cabarets, strip clubs and contact bars was no longer in the primary interest of Raiffeisen,"" the judge said, adding prudent handling of Raiffeisen's money would have meant limiting tabs to 1,000 Swiss francs or less per occasion.
The trial, which was moved from a courthouse to Zurich's Volkshaus theatre due to the intense public interest, centred around conflicts of interest on deals between a number of firms in which Vincenz and another defendant were involved. 
All seven defendants in the trial, which began in January, had denied the allegations against them.
Vincenz was ordered to pay Raiffeisen more than 260,000 Swiss francs over expenses he charged to the bank, while he was ordered to pay a further 1.3 million francs to compensate damages incurred by another firm over a corporate transaction.
Prosecutors had sought nearly 70 million Swiss francs in total in assets from the defendants, as well as pursuing financial penalties and prison sentences ranging from two to six years for all but one of them.

Prosecutor Marc Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel told reporters that his office would await the written verdict as well as other parties' next moves before deciding on any possible appeal, but noted the court had largely supported the prosecutors' charges.

241,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>","Apple: iPhone SE is Shaping to Be Another 'Mini' Disaster, Overall Demand for iPhone 13 Strong - KeyBanc","KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told clients today that demand for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone lineup remains resilient with an expectation of iPhone SE.
KeyBanc’s checks showed that the customer demand for iPhone 13 remained “healthy” in March and “largely in line with store expectations.” The domestic iPhone sales likely soared 12% in March on a MoM basis, but still flat y/y.
According to Vinh, the strong demand has been fueled by: 1) better supply; 2) tax refunds; and 3) the release of the green iPhone, which is tracking slightly above store expectations.
“Store inventory levels for Pro/Pro Max increased further, and all the stores we surveyed have either Pro or Pro Max inventory vs. ~70% in February. In aggregate, Days of inventory (DOI) increased m/m to just over two days but remain lean and well below targeted levels,” Vinh said in a client note.
On a more negative note, Apple is experiencing another disappointing campaign, this time for the iPhone SE model.
KeyBanc’s data shows “disappointing” SE3 sell-through, or below store expectations. Lower-than-expected sales have resulted in high inventory for this model, which is available for walk-in customers.
The analyst explains why this may be the case.
“Promotions on other models overshadow the price advantage of the new SE3, such as AT&T offering iPhone 12 discounted at $365 amortized over 36 months vs. $430 for the SE3, both of which are 5G capable and without trade-in. Customers’ awareness for the release is relatively low and consumers’ preference for larger form factor continues to grow, despite SE3 retaining the Home button,” Vinh added.
Overall, Vinh adjusted estimates to reflect key findings from this report. The Q2 iPhone unit sales estimates remain at 58.3 million, above 57.7 million but iPhone revenues are boosted by 1.1% to $49 billion.
“Our Key First Look Data suggests AAPL is tracking somewhat in line with consensus. Historically, C1Q (Apple's F2Q) Apple Hardware is -35% q/q over the last three years, which compares to the current C1Q22 q/q consensus estimate of -29% and our estimate of -30% q/q. Our data is not currently pointing to material upside, where the main weakness we expect is around more discretionary purchases in the wearables and accessories segments. With the iPhone SE3 initially disappointing and AAPL build forecast being lowered and being replaced with iPhone 13, we slightly revise our iPhone mix assumptions,” Vinh concluded.

(Reuters) - Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) sought to bolster its cancer business on Wednesday by agreeing a $1.9 billion deal to buy U.S. drug developer Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA), the latest move to fend off pressure from activist shareholder Elliott.
GSK has been facing mounting calls to shore up its drug pipeline since Elliott built up a significant stake in the company last year.
The company is also pressing ahead with plans to spin off its large consumer healthcare business, which includes brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, in July.
Shareholders in Sierra, a cancer drug developer, will receive $55 per share of common stock in cash, which is a 39% premium to the company's closing price on Tuesday. 
GSK's shares were up 0.9% at 1043 GMT, while Sierra’s shares jumped 37% in U.S. premarket trading. 
The deal’s price tag doesn't look unreasonable given it is roughly three times consensus peak sales expectations of $630 million for Sierra’s lead experimental drug, momelotinib, J.P.Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
Momelotinib, which Sierra acquired from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) in 2018, is designed to treat anaemic patients with a type of bone marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. It is expected to be submitted for U.S. marketing approval this quarter. 
Results from a late-stage trial in January showed the drug was successful in reducing disease symptoms and cut patients' dependence on blood transfusions.
“We see the key risk around the acquisition as being commercial execution on the launch, given the number of competitors targeting the myelofibrosis space, and momelotinib’s mixed historical data, prior to the recent positive .... study results,” the analysts added. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter and will complement Blenrep, GSK’s treatment for another form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma. 
There's about a 70% overlap in customer base between momelotinib, Blenrep and other haematology products, said Luke Miels, chief commercial officer at GSK.
GSK, whose oncology business last year accounted for about 2.8% of total pharmaceutical sales, recently suffered trial setbacks on two cancer compounds that were once touted as potential blockbusters.
Patent exclusivity on its HIV drug dolutegravir is also due to expire at the end of 2027, worth about 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in annual sales.

Miels signalled GSK continues to have an appetite for deals like Sierra. “They could be anywhere ranging from cancer, anti-infectives, vaccines, renal, autoimmune,” he said.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>",Barry Callebaut says staying in Russia 'feels right' for now,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut will keep operating in Russia to help customers and employees there, even though images from the war in Ukraine create ""enormous pressure,"" it said on Wednesday.
Shares in the Zurich based-group fell more than 5% as some analysts worried about its - albeit small - exposure to the turbulent Russian market, as well as flattish first-half earnings per tonne of chocolate sold. 
The company reported higher first-half profits and sales volumes overall, helped by a recovery in the global chocolate market. But Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has forced all consumer goods companies with a presence in Russia to rethink strategies.
While customer Nestle has stopped selling most foods, including KitKat chocolate bars, in Russia, Barry Callebaut's three Russian factories and 500 staff are still working.
""We are under enormous pressure just watching the images we get from the war and we cannot not look into the boardroom of other companies,"" Chief Executive Peter Boone told reporters.
He said the question of whether to stay in Russia was raised ""internally and externally"" and even by his children, but it was important to protect the jobs of staff in Russia. 
""It feels right because we are in contact with our 500 colleagues in Russia, they clearly have not asked for this decision by the Russian government. For us, it feels like the right thing to do to stay close for our employees and our customers,"" he said, adding the company's chocolate and cocoa went into all kinds of products including drinks and breakfast cereals.
He said the business in Russia - the fourth-largest chocolate confectionery market, according to Euromonitor - represented less than 5% of group volumes and the company was taking a 5 million Swiss franc ($5.4 million) impairment to reflect the increased risk of customer default there. It has also stopped new capital investment in the country.
Shares in the group were down 5.7% at 1123 GMT, underperforming the European food sector index.
""The exposure to Russia with close to 5% of the group’s volume as well as the flattish EBIT per tonne despite strong volume growth could partly explain the share price drop,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said in an emailed comment. 
Boone said it was difficult to get raw materials to Russia, but still possible as food is not covered by Western sanctions. 
The company confirmed its goals for 5-7% sales volume growth and earnings before interest and tax above volume growth for the three years to August 2023. 

Strong chocolate sales and a recovery in its gourmet business with restaurants helped sales volumes rise 8.7% in the six months to the end of February. Net profit climbed 3.1%.

244,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:53AM ET</span>","Dow Futures Rise 160 Pts; PPI Data, JPMorgan Earnings in Focus","By Peter Nurse    
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, with investors digesting the latest consumer inflation report as the quarterly earnings season starts in earnest.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 160 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 100 points, or 0.7%.
The major indices are down sharply this week, and year to date, on concerns that soaring inflation will cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy, potentially causing a slowdown in growth.
Data released on Tuesday showed the highest U.S. consumer inflation since late 1981, however, there was a small glimmer of hope that price pressures may have peaked, as core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, came in below expectations.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points when it next meets in May, while also starting to cut back its $9 trillion balance sheet. But the core data raised the possibility that the central bank might not need to be as aggressive in the second half of this year as originally expected.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at 2.756% Wednesday, falling back from the over-three-year peak of 2.836% seen before the inflation data.
The March producer price index is due at 8:30 AM ET, with analysts expecting the annual figure to climb 10.6%, growing 1.1% on the month.
Additionally, the companies of the S&P 500 are set to start reporting earnings, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) starting the ball rolling before the open Wednesday.
Banks are seen as beneficiaries of a rising rate environment, but market volatility could dampen capital markets and investment banking activity for the big Wall Street firms, while Delta forecasts a profit in the second quarter as surging volumes and prices more than made up for rising costs.
Oil prices traded higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s hefty gains amid concerns of Russian supply being further reduced, and helped by signs the lockdown of Shanghai and other regions of China may soon be at least partially lifted.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that peace talks had come to a dead end have raised fears that the European Union could embargo Russian crude to further punish Moscow.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 7.8 million barrels last week, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute released Tuesday, but gasoline inventories fell by 5 million barrels, an indication of strong U.S. fuel demand.
The official crude oil supply data from the EIA is due later in the day.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $101.89 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $106.11. Both benchmarks climbed more than 6% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,978.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.0826."
245,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:50AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Earnings Fall 42% as Dealmaking Slows From Exceptional 1Q 21,"Investing.com - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said its first-quarter earnings fell 42% on the year in the first quarter, as rising inflation, a fresh wave of Covid-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine all combined to make a difficult comparison with the extraordinary gains of a year earlier.
Earnings per share fell some 3% short of expectations at $2.63, while revenue was broadly in line with expectations at $30.72 billion, down 7% from a year earlier.
However, the bank softened any disappointment by approving a new buyback program of $30 billion.
""We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term – consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels – but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,"" chief executive and chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. That caution was reflected in $902 million of net new provisions against possible loan losses, ending a sequence of quarters that has been hallmarked by the release of previous provisions as the pandemic has receded.
The bank also notched a $524 million hit due to the revaluation of various positions as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through global commodity and debt markets.
Global dealmaking revenue fell 31% from a year ago, while global markets revenue was down 3%.
In addition to a slowdown in dealmaking and capital markets revenues, the bank's results also showed signs of strain from the rising interest rate environment and supply chain problems in key sectors of the economy.
Auto loans rose 3% on the year but the bank said the lack of vehicle supply continues to hurt its new loan business, which fell 25%. In Home Lending, originations of $25 billion were down 37%, primarily due to the rising rate environment, it added. That comes at a time when mortgage rates are at their highest since the end of 2018, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
JPMorgan stock is down 16% from the beginning of the year, still down 24% from its 52-week high of $172.96 set on October 25, 2021. It is underperforming the S&P 500, which is down 7.7% from the start of the year.

246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>",Airbnb’s 135% Rally Takes IPO Crown With Room to Run ,"(Bloomberg) -- With shares skyrocketing since its trading debut, Airbnb Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABNB) initial public offering was well-timed. That rally shows little sign of abating.
It has soared 135% since it went public in December 2020. The timing was auspicious: Covid-19 vaccines were just arriving, sparking a revival in travel and also demand for lodging where travelers could isolate more easily than in a hotel. Employees also embraced a work-anywhere environment, encouraging the use of temporary homes. 
Airbnb’s climb to $103 billion in value has made it the world’s biggest online travel company, eclipsing Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc.,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc., and hotel operator Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc. 
“It is evolving, and becoming an interesting play with respect to work-from-home and long-term rental trends,” said Thomas George, a portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which owns the stock. “Those are additional levers it can unlock for growth.” 
Airbnb’s post-IPO performance has also given it the title of best performer of any listing to raise $1 billion or more since its debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This comes at a time where weak trading in recent IPOs have weighed on the pipeline for new listings.
Some caution is warranted. Its stock rally has surpassed its peers by a mile in the travel industry since it went public, which could mean its upside is minimal. Booking has climbed 3.5%, Marriott is 25% higher and Expedia is up 39% in that time period. 
And it isn’t cheap. Airbnb sells for about 12 times its estimated sales. That’s well above its peers with Booking sitting at 5.3, and both Expedia’s and TripAdvisor’s are below 3. 
But investors have more reasons to stay bullish. Airbnb’s stock is expected to climb by an average of 24% over the next 12 months with a majority of the 41 analysts covering the firm recommending investors hold on to their shares or buy more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Brokerages on average predict the company next month will report a 64% jump in first-quarter sales. Airbnb, which was profitable on a net-income basis the past two quarters, probably lost money again in the first three months of this year, analysts say. 
Airbnb’s revenue grew 78% to $1.53 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ projections as people spread out over thousands of towns and cities and stayed for weeks and months with workers no longer having to be in traditional offices five days a week. 
“The benefits seen over the past year or so are expected to continue, especially as traveling increases with the pandemic hopefully continuing to wane,” said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge. 
Tech Chart of the Day
The cloud continues to darken around Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc. Its shares fell 1.1% on Tuesday, rounding out a sixth day of losses. Its losing streak, which has erased $55 billion in market value, is its longest since May 2019. All eyes will be on the company’s quarterly results slated for April 27, where investors will be looking for any guidance on future growth and its metaverse strategy.

The aircraft maker said it made changes to its order backlog in monthly orders and deliveries, which also showed that the company delivered 41 jets last month.
Data showed that Boeing delivered 34 737 MAX single-aisle aircraft, two 767 freighters for FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and one 777 freighter for China Airlines.
Boeing’s March deliveries almost double the 22 the company delivered in February and 29 in the year-ago period, suggesting a sharp recovery in travel and cargo demand. The aerospace company has delivered 95 jets since the start of 2022.
On the other hand, Boeing’s deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner model are still suspended as the company continues to examine and repair the twin-aisle jetliners that were grounded due to production issues.
The number of orders in the first three months surged to 167 from 114, said Boeing. Excluding deliveries that were canceled or swapped, the number of orders totaled 145, up from 107.
Excluding jets that were unlikely to be delivered, net orders for the quarter year to date totaled 76, down from 179. Ultimately, Boeing’s official order backlog stood at 4,231, down from 4,375 overall.
The adjustment also included 141 jets Boeing put in accounting limbo due to the invasion of Ukraine and the consequent global sanctions against Russia.
The company noted the majority of questionable orders included jets for Russian and Ukrainian airlines, most of which were 737 MAX models and some 777 and 787 widebody units.
In March, clients canceled orders for 15 Boeing aircraft, including a 737 MAX for Aviation Capital Group, 11 737 MAX units for an undisclosed buyer, as well as two 787-9 Dreamliner jets for Air China (OTC:AIRYY) and Avolon.
Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak has reflected positively on the report as he expects deliveries to accelerate over the coming months as air travel recovers.
“Boeing continues to deliver no 787 aircraft, reflecting the ongoing temporary halt following the FAA requesting more information about Boeing's proposed solution to the previous quality issues. The FAA is at various stages of the process on their end, in an ongoing dialogue with Boeing that may require some additional input from the company. However, Boeing has a recommended fix for every currently identified issue on the aircraft, and does not expect to find any new issues. We expect deliveries to resume in 2Q22,” Poponak said in a client note.
Wolfe Research analyst Mike Maugeri is more cautious than Poponak.
“We continue to see the fundamental demand backdrop for commercial OEM deliveries as favorable, particularly for narrowbody aircraft, but BA still has idiosyncratic issues to work through. BA seems to be the most polarizing name in our A&D coverage based on our conversations and the results of our quarterly survey of investors published this morning. BA was voted both top long/overweight and top short/underweight in our survey,” the analyst said in a client note.
Boeing stock price closed at $176.28 yesterday.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Tesco warns of lower profits as UK inflation squeeze tightens,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, warned of a drop in profits this financial year as surging inflation piles pressure on the supermarket group and its customers alike.
Shares in the company, which has a more-than 27% share of Britain's grocery market, were down 5% at 0931 GMT, the biggest decline of a blue-chip stock in Europe.
That dragged down other grocery stocks, including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and Ocado (LON:OCDO), as well as retailers such as JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports.
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) reported retail adjusted operating profit of 2.65 billion pounds ($3.45 billion) for the year to Feb. 28, up 36% and in line with guidance. It sees profit of between 2.4 billion pounds and 2.6 billion pounds for 2022-23. 
""Given the significant uncertainties in the external environment, we believe it is appropriate to provide profit guidance in the form of a wider than usual range,"" Tesco said.
Britain's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 7% in March, even before April's sharp increase in utility bills. Surging prices are causing the biggest squeeze on household incomes since at least the 1950s.
Tesco said three factors would influence its performance - the return to more normal customer behaviour after the COVID-19 pandemic, its ability to offset higher costs with savings elsewhere in the business, and the investment required to keep prices competitive.
""Inflation is very real for everyone. It's household expenses going up and finances stretched. It has been many years since we last saw living costs rise at the rate they are today,"" CEO Ken Murphy told reporters.
COST OF LIVING CRISIS
A cost of living crisis and supply chain disruptions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are weighing on Britain's grocers.
Last week, No. 4 supermarket group Morrisons warned its annual profit could be hit by the conflict and rising inflation. No. 7 player, the Co-operative Group, pointed to ""stark"" economic headwinds.
The war in Ukraine has hurt supplies of sunflower oil, and has driven-up animal feed and wheat prices, which has had a knock-on effect on meat, dairy and bakery.
Soaring energy prices, as well as increased labour costs, have added to the cost of doing business.
Murphy said Tesco was ""laser focused"" on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check and noted cheaper, own-brand products would play an important role. He said Tesco was in ""great shape"" to deal with the crisis.
Market data suggests shoppers have started to shift their buying habits to save money, opting for more own-label foods.
Tesco's group sales rose 3.0% to 54.8 billion pounds in 2021-22, while UK like-for-like sales rose 0.4% as it gained market share. Industry data has shown Tesco consistently outperform its three biggest rivals - Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons.
Analysts say Tesco is benefiting from its strategy of matching prices at discounter Aldi on 650 key lines, the popularity of its 'Clubcard Prices' loyalty scheme and the unrivalled scale of its store network and online operation.
Tesco raised its full-year dividend 19.1% to 10.9 pence a share and committed to return a further 750 million pounds to shareholders by April 2023 through a share buyback programme.

""Tesco has proven its ability to adeptly navigate tricky periods and few would bet against it doing so again,"" said Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's accelerated timeline to fully embrace electric vehicles (EVs) presents a threat to some auto suppliers and auto mechanics, with the latter pinning hopes on a key legislation to adapt to the changing needs of the industry.
Last month, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government set out a mandatory target for all new light-duty cars and passenger trucks to be zero-emission by 2035, from an earlier goal of 2040. Recent investments by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in their Canadian units to primarily boost EVs give the parts industry some hope in the immediate future.
""Where there's risk is on the parts manufacturers that make parts for internal combustion components like engines and transmissions,"" said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufactures' Association. 
Volpe noted these parts will disappear in future years, and there are concerns the companies won't be capable of adapting, if they even remain the suppliers after new competition enters the market. 
Auto parts are Canada's fifth-biggest export industry, employing roughly 71,400 workers as of January, according to official data. Volpe is still confident many established parts makers will be preferred, given their track record.
Industry groups say the switch to EVs is a bigger threat to auto mechanics, who may struggle unless the 'right to repair' bill is passed in Canada. 
That bill was reintroduced in the Parliament in February, after it was killed in the House of Commons in August 2021 ahead of the federal election. The bill would force big automakers to share the parts, software and training used to repair products.
Failure to pass the bill could result in the closure of many mechanics down the line and substantial job losses in the sector, said Jean-Francois Champagne, president of the Automotive Industries Association of Canada, which represents automotive after-market supply and service chains.
Roughly 109,816 Canadians are employed in the automotive repair and maintenance industry, according to a 2022 report by Statistics Canada. A move to EVs that are loaded with technology that allows greater automation and over-the-air software updates could lead to the loss of as many as 53,707 jobs by 2051 in the worst case scenario, according to the Conference Board of Canada.
FIGHT FOR DATA
Currently, computers in EV makers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are connected in a 'closed ecosystem,' making them inaccessible to typical mechanics.
""If you have a Tesla today, pretty much Tesla will determine where you go to get your car serviced, they'll determine which parts you put on and how much you're going to pay,"" said Champagne.
Tesla did not offer an immediate comment. But in 2020, Tesla urged its Massachusetts customers to vote against the updated ‘right to repair’ legislation, arguing it would pose security concerns. Tesla already has an open-source philosophy for much of its patented intellectual property, it said. Yet, Massachusetts voters approved the ‘right to repair’ bill.
Jamie Keeler, owner and sole mechanic of Keeler Automotive in Ontario, said the Canadian legislation will ensure customers have the freedom to choose who repairs their car.
""If you're a licensed mechanic, you should be able to fix anything that’s on the road, and have access to the software to do it,"" said Keeler, who on average services 50-60 cars a week.
Keeler, who has been a licensed mechanic for three decades, said if a petition for 'right to repair' comes around, he will happily sign or vote for it.
The United States already passed a ‘right to repair’ policy in July of 2021, as part of sweeping executive order signed by President Biden. With the contents of Canada's bill already formed, and previous support established, its biggest hurdle will be automakers fighting to quash it in coming months.

Alliance for Automotive Innovation did not offer an immediate comment when asked about Canada’s ‘right to repair’ bill.
""Automakers want to control the data in the car, because that's what's going to get monetized down the road, the same as your cell phone did,"" said Champagne. ""So, it's a fight to control the data, and they've been very active in fighting those legislations everywhere they can.""

254,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>",Stellantis rejigs China financing ops in latest reboot plans,"By Tassilo Hummel and Giulio Piovaccari
PARIS (Reuters) -Fiat parent Stellantis will sell its stake in an auto financing joint venture to its Chinese partner Dongfeng and set up its own financial services unit in China, the latest step to overhaul its business in the world's top car market.
The move comes after the world's fourth-largest carmaker expanded its credit business in the United States and launched a major reorganisation in Europe, as CEO Carlos Tavares aims to boost profitability and simplify the company's structure.
Stellantis, formed at the start of 2021 through the merger of France's PSA with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), has struggled to sell cars in China and has been looking to reshuffle its strategy in the country where it has joint ventures with Dongfeng and GAC.
""As we continue our push to drive profitable growth in China, we need to also reset our financial services offering in the country,"" said Tavares in a statement.
Under the deal, one of Stellantis' financing units and car maker DPCA - co-owned by Stellantis and Dongfeng - have entered into an equity transfer agreement with Dongfeng aimed at transferring the whole of their joint auto financing assets to the Chinese company. 
In return, Stellantis said it would create a new structure called Auto Finance Co (AFC).
JOINT VENTURES
Stellantis through its China-based joint ventures represents just 0.5% of the Chinese auto market. DPCA, the joint venture with Dongfeng, sold 100,567 vehicles in 2021, more than doubling annual sales. Its joint venture with GAC sold 20,123 units last year, a 50% decline.
The proposed transaction should be completed during the second half of 2022, pending regulatory approval, the car maker added.
In its business plan to 2030 outlined last month, Stellantis said it would adopt an ""asset-light"" model there - keeping only one fully-owned plant and opening up other manufacturing capacity to third parties to lower fixed costs.
It is aiming for Chinese revenue to reach 20 billion euros ($22 billion) by 2030. Revenue for ""China, India and Asia Pacific"" totalled 3.9 billion euros last year. 
In November, Stellantis bought First Investors Financial Services Group for around $285 million as it seeks to build a full-service captive finance arm in the United States, where owning 100% of such structures is a common feature.
The business offers U.S. customers, dealers and partners financing options, including retail loans, leases and floorplan financing.
It took a different approach in Europe. Late last year, the company agreed to set up financing and leasing joint ventures with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Santander (BME:SAN).

The aim was to cut the number of entities it inherited from PSA and FCA.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive - China's oil champion prepares Western retreat over sanctions fear,"By Ron Bousso and Chen Aizhu
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd. is preparing to exit its operations in Britain, Canada and the United States, because of concerns in Beijing the assets could become subject to Western sanctions, industry sources said.
Ties between China and the West have long been strained by trade and human rights issues and the tension has grown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which China has refused to condemn.
The United States said last week China could face consequences if it helped Russia to evade Western sanctions that have included financial measures that restrict Russia's access to foreign currency and make it complicated to process international payments. 
CNOOC did not immediately comment.
Companies periodically carry out reviews of their portfolios, but the exit being prepared would take place less than a decade after state-owned CNOOC entered the three countries via a $15 billion acquisition of Canada's Nexen, a deal that transformed the Chinese champion into a leading global producer. 
The assets, which include stakes in major fields in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and large Canadian oil sand projects, produce around 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), Reuters calculations found.
Last month, Reuters reported CNOOC had hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to prepare for the sale of its North Sea assets, which include a stake in one of the basin's largest fields.
CNOOC has launched a global portfolio review ahead of its planned public listing in the Shanghai stock exchange later this month that is aimed primarily at tapping alternative funding following the delisting of its U.S. shares last October, the sources said.
The delisting was part of a move by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in 2020 that targeted several Chinese companies Washington said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military. China condemned the move.
CNOOC is also taking advantage of a rally in oil and gas prices, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, and hopes to attract buyers as Western countries seek to develop domestic production to substitute Russian energy.
As it seeks to leave the West, CNOOC is looking to acquire new assets in Latin America and Africa, and also wants to prioritise the development of large, new prospects in Brazil, Guyana and Uganda, the sources said.
'A PAIN'
CNOOC is seeking to sell ""marginal and hard to manage"" assets in Britain, Canada and the United States, a senior industry source told Reuters.
All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The industry source said last month that CNOOC's top management, including chairman Wang Dongjin, found managing the former Nexen assets was ""uncomfortable"" because of red tape and high operating costs compared with developing nations.
CNOOC has faced hurdles operating in the United States in particular, such as security clearances required by Washington for its Chinese executives to enter the country, the source added.  
""Assets like Gulf of Mexico deepwater are technologically challenging and CNOOC really needed to work with partners to learn, but company executives were not even allowed to visit the U.S. offices. It had been a pain all along these years and the Trump administration's blacklisting of CNOOC made it worse,"" said the source. 
In its prospectus ahead of the initial public offering, CNOOC said it could face additional sanctions.
""We cannot predict if the company or its affiliates and partners will be affected by U.S. sanctions in future, if policies change,"" CNOOC said.

In the United States, CNOOC owns assets in the onshore Eagle Ford and Rockies shale basins as well as stakes in two large offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Appomattox and Stampede.
Its main Canadian assets oil sands projects are Long Lake and Hangingstone in Alberta Province.

Google said the investment will create at least 12,000 full-time jobs in 2022 and focus on data centers in several states including Nevada, Nebraska and Virginia. 
The company will open a new office in Atlanta this year, and expand its data center in Storey County, Nevada, it added.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:07AM ET</span>","Vegas, Macau...Dubai? Global casinos raise bets on gambling in the Gulf","By Lisa Barrington and Farah Master
DUBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - It's been the subject of quiet speculation among diplomats and executives for years, but now global casino bosses are setting their sights on a once improbable prize: gambling in the United Arab Emirates
Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), one of the smaller and lesser-known of the seven emirates, said earlier this year that it planned to regulate gaming in some resorts. On the same day, Las Vegas casino giant Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) said it would build a resort licensed for gaming, or gambling, on a man-made island. 
The announcements could mark a watershed moment for the Gulf, a region that has traditionally imposed stricter Islamic rules than other parts of the Middle East, and one where gambling has long been off-limits. 
Currently, those seeking a flutter head to the likes of Lebanon's Casino du Liban or some upmarket Egyptian hotels.
Yet times may be changing. 
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that gambling in some form would be permitted in the UAE, but that it would be up to each emirate to decide whether and how to regulate it, similar to how Sharjah prohibits alcohol sales unlike other emirates. The sources said it would happen soon, without providing a specific timeframe.
Other global casino and hotel brands which have moved into the UAE could benefit should RAK pave the way for other emirates to follow – with many eyes on the bigger and glitzier jackpot of Dubai, a global tourist magnet, where gaming is currently banned.
Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Palace, which opened in Dubai in 2018 and is the only one of U.S. giant Caesars Entertainment' resorts globally without a casino - told Reuters that it would examine any possibility of offering gambling in Dubai.
""That acceptance now that there is going to be the potential of gaming in the UAE, in whatever form it's going to be, allows people like Caesar's and MGM as well to look at that closely,"" said Anthony Costa, regional president at Caesars Palace. ""I think it's wonderful."" 
""Like anybody, if a license is able to be bid for, any global gaming company is going to want to be actively involved in the conversation,"" he added.
About 10 km along Dubai's coast from the Caesars resort, digging has begun on another artificial outcrop to support a luxury resort by Las Vegas gambling stalwart MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International. 
When asked whether it would consider introducing gaming at the resort, MGM said ""gaming has not been part of the planning and there are no updates to our plans"".
A year ago Dubai, traditionally the most liberal emirate, denied rumours circulating on social media and among the business community that several hospitality venues had been granted gambling licences. 
The UAE government media office, as well as the media offices of the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, did not respond to requests for comment on RAK's plan to regulate gambling and whether they planned to make similar shifts. 
EMIRATES VS SAUDI
The prospect of casinos plays out against the backdrop of intense competition in the Gulf, with business and tourism hub UAE vying with rapidly-opening Saudi Arabia to become the go-to destination in a region pivoting away from oil. 
The UAE, where foreigners make up 90% of the population, has already moved in other areas to keep first mover advantage over Saudi Arabia, the largest and most conservative Gulf state.
The Emirates switched to a Saturday-Sunday weekend this year to move closer to global markets, from the Friday-Saturday break common in many Muslim nations. In the past 18 months, the UAE has overhauled laws and regulations, including decriminalising alcohol consumption and pre-marital cohabitation. 
The country has also found ways to offer some potentially lucrative games of chance.
In 2020 a national ""Loto"" was launched, for example. Players purchased a ""collectable"" picture of an iconic UAE scene, such as the Burj al Arab hotel, for 35 dirhams ($9.50) and were entered into a draw. Now players seeking to enter the draw purchase a bottle of water to be donated to charity to win a top prize of 10 million dirhams.
The game was deemed Sharia compliant by virtue of there being an ""exchange of value"" in the purchase of the collectable or bottle.
Horse racing fans at some UAE racecourses can also enter for free a 'pick six' competition across a number of races for the chance to win 40,000 dirhams. 
Yet, while RAK's intentions are clear, big question marks remain over how it or other emirates would actually license gaming, until a prohibition is removed from the federal penal code, which was overhauled as recently as January.
RAK stressed that its regulations, being developed by the recently created Department of Entertainment and Gaming Regulation, would push for responsible gaming.
""Gaming is a responsible form of entertainment and leisure tourism that takes into consideration community, cultural and social norms,"" the Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority told Reuters. 
It did not answer questions about how its plans would work alongside the federal prohibition. 
Wynn told Reuters that the definition of gaming and types of games permitted would be determined by the regulator. 
FOREIGNERS ONLY?
RAK's gaming regulations are being shaped by those of Singapore and the United States, according to Wynn Resorts and Vitaly Umansky, a gambling industry analyst at the Sanford C Bernstein investment company in Hong Kong who is familiar with the Wynn project.
""Like Singapore, the country is looking to gaming to help drive tourism and has allowed gaming to occur in an integrated resort format for just such purpose,"" Umansky said.
He added that gaming in RAK would likely be limited to foreigners. 
The UAE also appears unlikely to develop resorts that rely primarily on gaming revenues, or foreground gaming, with slots and tables forming part of a wide entertainment offering. 

""The regulatory environment would be the kind that hides the casino, kind of like Singapore but even more so. It won't be like Vegas where the casino is out there,"" Umansky said of Wynn's proposals, which are currently in the design phase.
Caesar's Costa said big resort brands did not necessarily need to operate their gaming side: ""They are great hotels in themselves.""

China is Fast Retailing's biggest overseas market, with 863 stores on the mainland, almost 90 outlets in Shanghai, where stringent lockdown measures, introduced in late March, remain in place to contain the country's worst outbreak of the pandemic.
Fast Retailing is due to report six-month results through end-February, and COVID conditions in China have only worsened since the first quarter, when the company said profits from China slid dramatically.
The restrictions impact global brands like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which each have dozens of outlets in Shanghai, but also disrupt the production hubs of major clothing retailers including Fast Retailing, H&M, and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Retailers have tried to speed up transportation of their goods out of Asian production hubs following log jams at ports in the United States last year. 
But now the same thing is happening in Asia, with container ships lined up outside ports waiting to get in, said Keith Jelinek, managing director of performance improvement for the Berkeley Research Group. 
""These lockdowns in China have shut down a lot of production for manufacturing, so there's going to be this long timeframe to build all that back up, and that's a concern,"" he said. 
Fast Retailing has more Uniqlo stores in China than in its home market of Japan. The fast fashion retailer opened a flagship store in Beijing in November, its third megastore in mainland China, and plans to open 100 locations in the country each year going forward.
China makes up about 60% of Fast Retailing's overseas revenue. The company decided to close about 50 stores in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

""The Shanghai lockdowns will impact current quarter more than last quarter,"" said Mark Chadwick, a Japanese equity analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.
""I wonder to what extent (Fast Retailing) saw these lockdowns coming and were able to adjust production. If not, expect to see markdowns and lower gross margins going forward,"" he added.

Investing.com -- Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) shares plunged to their lowest in six months on Wednesday after the U.K. grocery giant said operating profit will fall in the next 12 months as it battles to contain the effects of runaway inflation. 
By 4:54 AM ET (0854 GMT), Tesco stock in London was down 5.6%, the second-worst performer in the benchmark FTSE 100 index, as the market fretted about its ability to offset higher input costs. 
The company said it expects adjusted operating earnings, its preferred metric of profitability, to fall to as little as 2.4 billion pounds ($3.12 billion) over the 12 months through next March, due to an acceleration of investments to cut operating costs. Tesco's ability to raise prices is constrained by intense competition, notably from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, and the company has stuck by its commitment to match Aldi's prices on a list of 650 items. 
""Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months,"" Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy said in a statement. ""Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check – working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs.”
Adjusted operating profit for the year ended in March rose 58% to 2.83 billion pounds, supported by a strong economic rebound as the pandemic receded. That enabled Tesco to raise its full-year dividend by 19% to 10.9 pence. The supermarket chain now faces headwinds from the normalization of consumer spending in the coming year, as a population no longer locked down diverts more of its spending back to services.
Tesco's results come on the same day that consumer inflation in the U.K. surged to a 30-year high of 7%, with prices rising 1.1% on the month alone, well ahead of expectations.
""Tesco has already pledged to increase staff wages in its efforts to retain service levels, raising salaries by 6%, while rising fuel prices are likely to increase the costs of maintaining its delivery and logistics operations,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said in a flash note."

The purchase of the 21.2 million shares via a call option raises Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s stake in T-Mobile US to 48.4%, within touching distance of a majority stake, from below 47%, the German company said on Wednesday.
As part of a deal agreed with Softbank in 2020, Deutsche Telekom paid a fixed price of $101.46 per T-Mobile US share for 11.8 million of the shares, and $128.68 per share for the rest, based on the stock's weighted average price.

That means the average price for the deal was $113 per T-Mobile US share, compared with Tuesday's closing price of $131.44.

Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle over the board and the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet. Shareholder Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali, has put up his own candidates for the top jobs.
""We are talking about a (debt) leverage to use only in the case of an operation that would truly create value. At the moment (Generali's) leverage is 20%, Allianz (DE:ALVG)'s at 25% .... We propose to bridge a part of the gap with Allianz,"" Luciano Cirina told daily La Stampa in an interview.
He added that any decision would ""not put at risk the rating of the company"" and that a capital increase ""was not on the table"". 
""The true key to an acquisition is to integrate. And it's not easy. For this reason at the moment it's impossible to talk about possible targets,"" Cirina said. 
The challengers to Generali's current management pledged to increase earnings by a double-digit percentage and free more cash for takeovers.
In their plan - dubbed ""Awakening the lion"" - they aim to boost average annual growth in earnings per share, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8%. They also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Cirina, a veteran executive of the insurer who was fired at the end of March after he sided with Caltagirone, added that his lawyers were analysing how to contest Generali's decision to terminate his contract.

""I have also given them a mandate to pursue a legal action for the not indifferent reputational damage. It certainly was not elegant to use my sacking to get ahead in this race,"" the former head of Austria and the CEE countries at the insurer said.
Investor advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders at Generali back the proposal by the Italian insurer's outgoing board to hand Donnet another term at the helm, documents showed.

262,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 03:46AM ET</span>","European Stocks Mixed; Inflation Concerns, Tesco Woes in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Wednesday, with investors weighing the risks associated with soaring inflation, central bank policies, and the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
By 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%.
Hopes for a prompt end to the war in Ukraine received a blow late Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue the invasion, stating that peace talks with Ukraine were “at a dead end,” while suggesting the seven-week offensive is going to plan.
U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, and the United States is reportedly set to announce an additional $750 million in military assistance, in a sign the war is expected to drag on.
The conflict and the associated sanctions levied on Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, have roiled commodity markets, adding to inflationary pressures and prompted central banks to consider tightening monetary policies.  
The highly anticipated U.S. consumer price index rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981, virtually cementing a 50 basis point hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in May.
The U.K. equivalent CPI rose to a 30-year high, data showed Wednesday, climbing 7% on the year in March, up 1.1% on the month.
The Bank of England has already started on its tightening path, hiking at three consecutive meetings for the first time since 1997, and the focus now turns towards the European Central Bank, which is set to hold its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday.
In corporate news,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) stock fell 5.3% after the U.K.-based supermarket chain warned its profit was likely to fall in the current year, outweighing its plans to buy back 750 million pounds ($975 million) worth of shares.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock rose 1.6% after the French luxury goods maker reported robust demand for Louis Vuitton and Dior products, helping boost first quarter sales.
Oil prices edged lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s hefty gains with concerns remaining about the market becoming even tighter if Russian supply is further reduced.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that peace talks had come to a dead-end have raised fears that the European Union could embargo Russian crude to further punish Moscow.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 7.8 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday, but gasoline inventories fell by 5 million barrels, an indication of strong U.S. fuel demand.
The official crude oil supply data from the EIA is due later in the day.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $100.30 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $104.23. Both benchmarks climbed more than 6% in the previous session.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 03:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BlackRock plans first China ETF product this year -sources,"By Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) plans to launch its first product in China's $220 billion onshore exchange-traded fund (ETF) market later this year and has started hiring staff accordingly, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The world's largest money manager, which thrives on the rise of passive investing with 70% of its $10 trillion global portfolio in ETFs and index funds, will be the first wholly owned foreign fund manager to tap the onshore Chinese ETF market.
Currently, the U.S. firm manages overseas assets of a handful of China's large state-backed investors such as the country's sovereign wealth fund and national pension fund via offshore units, as all products sold are foreign-domiciled. 
The first BlackRock ETF product launch is scheduled for the fourth quarter, said the people, which will add to 6.8 billion yuan ($1.07 billion) worth of assets BlackRock manages through two mutual funds with investments in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks.
Several index providers have started talks with BlackRock but the fund manager is yet to decide which index to track for the first ETF product, the people said. 
Options under consideration include a carbon neutrality-themed index composed by China Securities Index Co, one of the people said. China has seen dozens of environment-linked ETF launches in the last two years betting on buoyant new-energy stocks.
""BlackRock is committed to helping more Chinese investors achieve their financial goals by bringing them a broader suite of investment products and solutions, including ETF and index investments,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
It said it is ""investing in more local talent"" to support its ""growth priority"".
China Securities Index did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BlackRock's planned foray into the fast-growing Chinese ETF market comes against the backdrop of continued opening up of the financial market in the world's second-largest economy.
The move will also bolster the fund manager's presence in China, after it became the first global asset manager licensed to start a wholly owned onshore mutual fund business in the country last year. 
BlackRock's ETF operation in China is set to open doors to local institutional as well as retail investors.
LUCRATIVE MARKET 
China's nascent $220 billion ETF market with over 600 products as at the end of 2021 has only in recent years started contributing meaningfully to a global passive fund boom that catapulted the sector beyond $10 trillion in value.
Assets in China's onshore ETFs expanded 30.5% in 2021, almost on a par with the 31.9% growth rate of U.S. ETFs, but better than European peers' 24.7% growth, showed data from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
BlackRock's iShares, which ""remained a significant growth driver"" in 2021, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink, drew in $306 billion assets last year, accounting for 57% of new money into all of the firm's active and passive offerings.
For its China ETF foray, BlackRock is recruiting for roles across ETF portfolio management, operations and focused marketing, said the two people. The firm initially plans to form a team of five to six employees, they said.
Measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have largely curbed business activity in Shanghai, with candidate interviews being moved online, one of the people said.
BlackRock's Shanghai office currently has at least 70 staff, showed fund association data, and is set to recruit over 15 more, excluding the ETF hires, company job adverts showed.
Since China allowed fully foreign-owned fund units in 2019, a flurry of foreign fund houses, including U.S.-based ETF specialist VanEck, has applied for licences to operate in the local fund market.
Most of the equities ETFs in China charge a 0.5% management fee per annum, higher than 10 to 20 basis points charged by managers of such products in the U.S. and Europe, making it a lucrative market for foreigners.

The country's 10 largest ETF providers, most of them local players, control over 80% of market share.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 02:51AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Peak hawkishness?,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Saikat Chatterjee. 
Hopes raised by latest U.S. CPI numbers that surging inflation may finally be peaking appear to have finally halted a rout in bond markets, meaning even hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve's James Bullard have not caused a stir. 
And note that while New Zealand's central bank just hiked interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in its biggest hike in over two decades, it tempered its hawkish stance by keeping its previous forecast for rates to peak around 3.35% by-end 2023.
So, that's kept the kiwi dollar from rallying sharply.
The dollar's march higher too has stalled and yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes are holding below 3-year highs.
Even mixed Chinese trade data with imports unexpectedly declining in March failed to dent broader sentiment with an Asian stock market gauge up more than 1%, while U.S. stock index futures are pointing higher.
European stock index futures are struggling to advance meaningfully after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that on-and-off peace negotiations with Ukraine ""have again returned to a dead-end situation for us."" This also weighed on the euro.
Oil consolidated gains after a hefty overnight rally with Brent crude futures settling comfortably above the $105 barrel, pushing inflation expectations higher across the board. Expected inflation in Germany via breakeven rates have jumped above 6%, the highest since data going back to 2009. 
In geopolitics, U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide. His public approval ratings declined to 41% according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.
Closer to home, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised but defied calls to resign after being fined for breaking coronavirus lockdown rules by attending a gathering in his office to celebrate his birthday. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- UK inflation jumps to 30-year high of 7.0% in March
- Data corner: US PPI

268,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 02:05AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Mixed; Inflation Data, Ukraine War in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Wednesday, with investors weighing the risks associated with soaring inflation, central bank policies and the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
Hopes for a prompt end to the war in Ukraine received a blow late Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue the invasion, stating that peace talks with Ukraine were “at a dead end”, while suggesting the seven-week offensive is going to plan.
U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, and the United States is reportedly set to announce an additional $750 million in military assistance, in a sign the war is expected to drag on.
Elsewhere, the highly-anticipated U.S. consumer price index rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981. However, U.S. yields weakened on Tuesday, snapping seven straight sessions of gains, as some traders saw the CPI release as not as bad as previously feared. 
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.75% early Wednesday, compared with an over-three-year peak of 2.836% before the inflation data.
The U.K. equivalent CPI rose more than expected Wednesday, up 7% on the year in March, to a 30-year high, up 1.1% on the month. 
These inflationary pressures are likely to keep the Bank of England on its tightening path, with the U.K. central bank having already lifted interest rates back to pre-pandemic levels, hiking at three consecutive meetings for the first time since 1997.
The European Central Bank is set to hold its latest policy setting meeting on Thursday, and the pressure is mounting on the policymakers to tighten its monetary policy with data released Tuesday showing German consumer price inflation rising 7.3% on the year.
In corporate news, European auto conglomerate Stellantis (PA:STLA) said it would sell its entire stake in an auto financing joint venture with Dongfeng to the Chinese car maker as part of its plans to consolidate its own financial services.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s hefty gains with concerns remaining about the market becoming even tighter if Russian supply is further reduced.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that peace talks had come to a dead end have raised fears that the European Union could embargo Russian crude to further punish Moscow.
OPEC cut its forecast for growth in world oil demand in 2022 on Tuesday, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast that U.S. power consumption will rise in 2022 and 2023 as the economy grows.
While U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 7.8 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday, gasoline inventories fell by 5 million barrels, an indication of strong U.S. fuel demand.
The official crude oil supply data from the EIA is due later in the day.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $100.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $104.99. Both benchmarks climbed more than 6% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,970.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0841.

Between January and June last year, Honda Australia told customers of Brighton Automotive (Astoria) in Victoria and Tynan Motors in New South Wales that the dealerships would no longer service Honda vehicles, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged.
""The ACCC alleges that in emails, text messages and phone conversations, Honda informed Astoria and Tynan customers that these businesses had closed and directed customers to contact a Honda dealership or Honda Service Centre to book their next service,"" the watchdog said.
But the dealerships continued to service vehicles, including Honda cars and operate independently after ending agreements with Honda Australia in January 2021 following a restructuring of the carmaker's unit in May 2019, the ACCC said.

The regulator accused Honda Australia of causing ""harm"" to the business of Astoria and Tynan by falsely claiming they had closed or would close, resulting in lower customer footfall, and sought penalty against it in the court.
Honda Australia declined to comment on the claims as it was reviewing the filing, but said in an email to Reuters it has cooperated with the ACCC's investigation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese firms including Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and Mitsubishi Corp will face resolutions from activist shareholders urging greater commitment to tackling climate change at their annual meetings this year.
Five climate activist groups, including Japan's Kiko Network and Australia's Market Forces, said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they had submitted shareholder resolutions for consideration at AGMs of four Tokyo-listed companies this year. Utility Chubu Electric Power completes the quartet.
Activist investors are increasingly turning their attention to Japanese companies, using resolutions that have been deployed in Europe and the United States to push companies and banks away from investing in, or financing, fossil fuel infrastructure.
The lifetime emissions from 10 proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) power projects involving the four companies are estimated to be 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide or its equivalent, the groups said.
This is almost double Japan's 2030 absolute emission reduction target under its nationally determined contributions towards achieving the Paris climate accord, they said.
SMFG, Tepco and Chubu Electric all confirmed they had received the shareholder resolutions, saying that their boards plan to discuss them.
A spokesperson at trading house Mitsubishi said the company would discuss and respond to the proposal appropriately.

Last year, Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, Japan' biggest bank, and trading house Sumitomo Corp faced similar climate resolutions, although the proposals were voted down.
Mizuho Financial Group became the first listed company in the country to hold such a vote in 2020. The resolution was defeated though it garnered 35% support.

Investing.com -- Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, while U.S. Treasuries fell, as investors continued weighing the risks from high inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.31% by 10:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.33%. The country’s trade data for March 2022 is due later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.31%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.64% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.17%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Investors continued to digest Tuesday’s U.S. inflation data, which showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981. The CPI rose 1.2% month-on-month, while the core CPI rose 6.5% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month.
U.S. Treasuries trimmed a rally that was sparked by the core CPI figure. The figure also prompted traders to scale back bets on how aggressively the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, but some investors warned that cost pressures continue to remain a big risk.
“We’re hopeful that this is where it’s going to peak,” Allspring Global Investments head of active equity Ann Miletti told Bloomberg, referring to U.S. inflation. However, markets continue to face a wall of worry from rising interest rates to the impact of China’s COVID-19 lockdowns, she added.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard also said the U.S. central bank will move “expeditiously” to hike interest rates to a level that neither stimulates nor slows the economy in 2022. She added that a decision on paring the Fed balance sheet could come as soon as May, with reductions starting a month later.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak on Thursday.
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked its interest rate to 1.5% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The Bank of Canada follows later in the day, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Korea following on Thursday.
A rally in oil, as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue the invasion of Ukraine and China partially eased COVID-19 lockdowns, also highlighted inflation concerns.
Putin said peace talks with Ukraine are “at a dead end” and vowed to continue the invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. His Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy again appealed for further European Union sanctions on Russia to include oil as well as all banks.
On the data front, U.S. data, including retail sales and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is due on Thursday.

In a report provided by a representative, ISS also backed a call for a report on racial equity at the big California-based bank but supported all company director nominees and recommended votes ""against"" a shareholder proposal that would sharply curtail lending for fossil fuel projects. 
CEO Scharf received total compensation of $21.4 million in 2021, up from $20.4 million in 2020, according to Wells Fargo's proxy statement. Last year only a narrow majority of investor ballots, 57%, backed the 2020 compensation in an advisory vote, part of a wave of critical investor feedback on the topic. 
Wells Fargo spoke with shareholders in response and said they wanted things like more detail about how it determined compensation and that more of Scharf's pay be tied to performance. 
But ISS said changes the bank made then still left concerns, such as that financial accomplishments the bank highlighted for setting 2021 pay ""are not entirely consistent with those highlighted in the prior year without specific rationale provided,"" according to its report.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Phillips 66 on Tuesday said Mark Lashier, its chief operating officer, will take over the fourth largest U.S. oil refiner from Chief Executive Greg Garland on July 1. 
Garland, who has led the refining, petrochemical and pipeline company since it spun off from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) 10 years ago, will step down as CEO but remain executive chairman until his retirement in 2024, according to a company statement. 
Lashier, a chemical engineer who joined the company three decades ago in its chemicals group, was promoted to president and COO a year ago after having run  Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co, its joint venture with Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) , since 2017. 
Garland has viewed refining as a mature business and focused on growing its energy pipeline, chemicals and carving out a role in electric-vehicle battery components. Last year, it paid about $150 million for a 16% stake in Novonix Ltd, an Australian supplier of materials for lithium-ion batteries. 
Garland “created a leading diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company, while investing for the future and delivering strong financial returns,” said Glen Tilton, Philips 66's lead independent director. 
The Houston company's non-refining investments have delivered strong shareholder returns but more recently its shares have lagged larger rivals that benefited from soaring fuel margins as motor fuels demand emerged from pandemic lockdowns. 
Lashier is likely to continue Garland's strategy of diversifying into biofuels, hydrogen and battery component. But he must show he can match shareholder returns of rivals Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) and  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) lifted returns by spinning off retail arms and jumping into renewable diesel, analysts said.

""Lashier's challenge is to improve the company's valuation,"" said Matthew Blair, analyst at investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. ""He will face questions about the valuation and what he can do to improve stock price performance and capitalize on the potential valuation"" of its non-refining operations.

The department had asked for the sanction based on Google's ""Communicate with Care"" program, which asked employees to add a lawyer to many emails. The government said it was sometimes a ""game"" to shield communications that should not have been protected. 
Judge Amit Mehta said last week that he was not convinced he had the power to sanction a company for actions taken before the lawsuit was filed. Mehta on Tuesday asked the government and Google, which had opposed the sanction, to identify any cases that would buttress their arguments for or against the sanction. 
Mehta also ordered Google to produce a random sample of 210 of the 21,000 emails for review.

""Upon completing its review, the court will determine whether an order compelling disclosure of the full set of the disputed emails or some other course of action is appropriate,"" Mehta said in his order.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street turned rally to sell-off on Tuesday, reversing earlier gains as impending monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve once again pulled growth stocks back into red territory.
All three major U.S. stock indexes turned from positive to negative early in the afternoon, weighed down by healthcare and financials. 
The turnabout began in earnest shortly after remarks from Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who reiterated the need for the central bank to ""expeditiously"" take on decades-high inflation.
""The comments coming out from Fed officials have been more hawkish than the markets have anticipated,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""(Brainard) has generally been nondescript, but now she’s more forceful in her commentary, and that’s getting people to sit up and take notice.""
The Labor Department's CPI report showed the prices urban American consumers pay for a basket of goods posted the biggest monthly jump since September 2005, and an annual surge of 8.5%, the hottest year-on-year inflation number in more than four decades.
Much of the topline CPI growth was attributable to an 18.3% monthly surge in gasoline prices, to a record high of $4.33 per gallon.
The report did little to budge the needle of expectations regarding impending interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:06PM ET</span>","China gaming firms toe the line, paving the way to end licence freeze","By Josh Ye
HONG KONG (Reuters) -China lifted a nine-month freeze on gaming licences after companies, including industry leader Tencent, made major adjustments to their business practices and due to the ban's economic fallout, industry sources and analysts said.
The watchdog of the $47 billion video games market, the world's largest, stopped issuing publishing licenses, which are key to monetising games, in August following a crackdown that curbed game-playing time for minors. That freeze was lifted on Monday when 45 games were granted licences. 
Sources and analysts said while the timing of the relaxation was unexpected, companies had bent over backwards after facing heavy criticism from authorities for being non-compliant.
""Regulations this time around are certainly the strictest they have been,"" said Chenyu Cui, senior analyst at research firm Omdia, ""Every company is scared of falling out of compliance.""
A source at a game studio of which Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is a major shareholder said it was requested by Tencent to remove English words from its game, avoid the colour red and scrap wordings such as “headshots” or “death” to be compliant. 
And the studio also delayed the title's international launch fearing that it could been seen as circumventing Chinese rules, the source said, declining to be named because he is not authorised to speak to media. 
During a similar freeze on licences in 2018, some projects opted to release their games – including Tencent’s Bladed Fury and Iris.Fall - overseas, while waiting for the domestic situation to be resolved.
Tencent declined to comment. 
China's regulators have also been proactive in ensuring compliance in a sector state media once called ""spiritual opium"".
Two sources said that during the suspension companies were still able to submit games for approval and received regular feedback on changes needed on their content or monetisation features.
In September, a state-backed gaming association organised a training programme for developers at which it emphasised that games had to highlight ""a correct set of values"" and could not contain any violent or religious elements, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners, said that over 5,000 game companies were now connected to the national anti-addiction system, numerous firms have made changes to in-game content and non-compliant ones have been investigated and fined by the relevant regulators.
""Concerns have been adequately addressed,"" he said.
Tencent, smaller peer NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and over 200 other firms pledged in September to self-regulate to combat gaming addiction.
ECONOMIC HIT
While companies were getting their house in order, the worsening economic impact of the gaming crackdown could no longer be ignored by Beijing.
During the licence freeze, about 14,000 video gaming-related firms – including those involved in merchandising, advertising and publishing - shut, according to business registry firm Tianyancha.
Some highly anticipated projects have also been spiked, such as Lilith Games’ Eden Apocalypse. A representative said this was due to a change in the business's direction.
Three gaming industry sources said many projects have been hit by a hiring freeze as they are under pressure to cut their size and budget. 
Tencent, a big employer of fresh graduates, said during its results its hiring pace would slow, and Reuters has reported that it and other peers plan to cut jobs. 
""They are doing this to protect jobs,"" one industry executive told Reuters, referring to the lifting of the freeze and declining to be named as he was not permitted to speak to the media. 
The game industry's regulator, National Press and Public Administration, did not respond to a request for comment. 
LOOKING OVERSEAS
Chinese gaming shares soared on Tuesday after the regulatory relaxation, with some analysts saying it showed the government's commitment to the sector.
But some were also cautious, pointing out that only 45 games were approved this time, versus the 80 to 90 usually greenlighted once a month prior to the freeze.
And the landscape has changed completely, prompting some to diversify or to consider leaving the Chinese market altogether. 

Small gaming firms in China are considering pivoting towards blockchain gaming in the West, even though it could mean abandoning the China market since Beijing bans unapproved cryptocurrencies, said Greg Pilarowski, head of law firm Pillar Legal.
""The current environment in China is very challenging for gaming companies,"" Pilarowski said. ""So a lot of folks are asking how they could get into blockchain games… because crypto and blockchain have been very profitable for many people in the US.""

""When we stop looking at market share all week, we get more free to work on the long term,"" said the CEO during the first of two days of company presentations to investors and analysts.
""We are now obsessed with growth. In the past we were addicted to market share...we are now looking at the long term, understanding places where we should grow more, understanding clients and consumers better,"" the executive added.
The first day of the company's presentations was focused on the various business digitalization initiatives that Ambev, part of Belgium's Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, is implementing to expand its revenue base beyond simply selling beverages.
The strategy, according to Jereissati Neto, is to create an ""ambidextrous"" company, capable of operating with solutions that include the platforms Ze Delivery, which sells directly to consumers, and Bees, through which it bets on growth among retailers.
When questioned about market share, the CEO said, without detailing numbers, that 2021 ""was, by far, the year in which we gained the most market share"".

""It was a market share gain in a depressed environment and now we seem to have the wind in our favor,"" said the executive, referring to the social isolation measures that ended last year in Brazil.
Ambev's plans for the Bees platform is to keep the business separate from the brewery, gaining scale over time while reinforcing its operations in markets where it is already present and looking into additional service offerings such as ""click & collect"".

The confectionary group's North American division last week recalled Kinder Happy Moments Chocolate Assortment and Kinder Mix Chocolate Treats basket because they were manufactured in a facility where Salmonella was detected.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The law firm that defended Martin Shkreli against antitrust charges said it has not been paid, and on Tuesday asked a U.S. judge for permission to withdraw from representing the former pharmaceutical executive best known for hiking the price of a lifesaving medication more than 40-fold.
Duane Morris LLP said Shkreli's former company Phoenixus AG agreed to cover his legal fees but has refused to pay the $2.04 million owed through March 31, after exhausting the limits of an insurance policy covering the fees in October.
In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Duane Morris also said Shkreli ""has no assets"" to pay its fees, and would not be harmed if it withdrew because the antitrust trial is over. The law firm said Shkreli did not oppose its withdrawal.
Lawyers for Phoenixus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shkreli, 39, became known as ""pharma bro"" after raising the price of the anti-parisitic drug Daraprim overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50 in 2015, and appearing unrepentant when criticized.
In January, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan banned Shkreli from the drug industry for life and ordered him to pay $64.6 million, finding he illegally sought to keep generic Daraprim rivals off the market.
The case had been brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and seven U.S. states.
Shkreli is serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2017 of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran and scheming to defraud investors in another company.

He is eligible for release on Nov. 7.
In February, the Brooklyn judge who oversaw the criminal case and a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case permanently banned Shkreli from serving as an officer or director of public companies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce as soon as Wednesday another $750 million in military assistance for Ukraine for its fight against Russian forces, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The equipment would be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. 
One of the officials said final determinations were still being made about the mix of equipment. 
A senior congressional aide said the equipment to be announced would likely include heavy ground artillery systems to Ukraine, including howitzers.
White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine that Russia calls a ""special military operation.""The congressional aide said some lawmakers had been informed within the last 24 hours about the upcoming announcement, which was expected within the next 24 to 48 hours.
Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armor. 
U.S. and European leaders are being pressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to provide heavier arms and equipment to engage Russia in Ukraine's eastern region, where Russia is expected to intensify its military efforts.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co,  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. consumer watchdog on Tuesday sued  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) and one of its former executives, accusing the credit reporting agency of tricking consumers into making recurring payments after the company was fined in 2017 for similar activity.
The lawsuit, filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in federal court in Illinois, accuses John Danaher (NYSE:DHR), who headed one of TransUnion's subsidiaries, of failing to ensure that the company stopped the deceptive activity. 
The suit seeks monetary relief for consumers, injunctive relief and fines.
""TransUnion is an out-of-control repeat offender that believes it is above the law,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. ""I am concerned that TransUnion's leadership is either unwilling or incapable of operating its businesses lawfully.""
The company in a statement called the CFPB's claims ""meritless."" 
Danaher retired from TransUnion in 2021, according to a company filing. Attorneys for Danaher also described the claims as without merit, saying in a statement that ""the CFPB is focused more on politically expedient headlines than the facts or the law.""
The bureau is asking a court to order the defendants to refund money to customers, pay restitution to harmed consumers and pay back ill-gotten gains for unjustified enrichment. 
The lawsuit underscores the bureau's more aggressive posture under President Joe Biden's administration. Chopra said last month the CFPB was looking at ""structural remedies"" to hold big companies more accountable for repeat offenses. 
Tackling corporate recidivism has emerged as a key priority under Biden, who entered the White House nearly 15 months ago, with the Justice Department last year rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at better deterring repeat misconduct.
In its complaint, the CFPB said TransUnion failed to address shortcomings identified in a 2017 enforcement action under which the company paid $16.9 million to settle charges that it deceptively marketed its products, tricking customers into recurring-payment products and making canceling them difficult.

The CFPB said Danaher, who headed a subsidiary called TransUnion Interactive, sought to delay compliance with the 2017 order to try to boost revenue. For example, Danaher told the company to stop requiring customers to check a box to confirm enrollment in a paid product, which had been required by the order, the CFPB said. 
TransUnion in its statement said it remains in compliance with the order, adding that the CFPB failed to honor its own obligations to respond to a plan for compliance that the company filed shortly thereafter.

PARIS (Reuters) -Robust demand for Louis Vuitton and Dior products boosted first-quarter sales at the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, kicking off earnings season for the industry with a show of resilience despite geopolitical tensions, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and volatile stock markets.
High-end fashion brands drove a 30% rise in sales of its largest division, fashion and leather goods, on a like-for-like basis, beating analyst expectations of 17%, according to consensus estimates cited by RBC.
""The year starts on a high note,"" said Luca Solca of Bernstein, citing ""another material beat"" of consensus expectations, particularly the fashion and leather goods activity.
Dior and Celine grew faster than other labels, while Louis Vuitton ""is never very far from the average for the division,"" LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts in a call.
The group will continue to raise prices at its fashion labels - but reasonably - to reflect the cost of business, said the executive.
Luxury industry prices have increased over the last six months by around 8 percent since September last year, with hikes in the range of 20%-23% at Louis Vuitton and Tiffany, according to recent estimates from HSBC.
Watches and jewellery labels also performed strongly, with sales for the high end products up 19%, boosted by Tiffany, particularly in the United States. The American luxury brand is undergoing a renewal drive led by its new French owner targeting younger audiences, with marketing campaigns featuring K-pop star Rose wearing chunky gold jewellery.
Traffic in Sephora stores in the U.S. and France helped push up sales at the selective retail division, which clocked 24% organic sales growth. But the luxury group's DFS travel retail business continued to suffer from travel restrictions in Asia, including Hong Kong where tourists have not yet returned.
Turnaround efforts at DFS could help it break even this year, predicted Guiony. 
The executive sought to reassure investors concerned about disruptions in China from restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus, although he cautioned that in addition to lockdowns in Shanghai and Shenzhen, traffic is down in cities that are not affected by such measures, with people travelling less.
""Obviously this is an impact - it's a fairly recent impact so you don't see it in the numbers,"" he said, noting that the effects seen in April so far are similar to the second half of March. Drawing on experience from previous lockdowns in China, the executive predicted that demand would return quickly once restrictions ease.

""It is probably worth looking beyond 2Q China disruption,"" said Citi, which plans to retain a buy rating on shares. Overall sales at LVMH rose by 23% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the effect of currency changes, in the three months to March to 18 billion euros, beating a consensus estimate for 18% growth, cited by Jefferies.
Hermes reports first-quarter sales on April 14 and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) on April 21.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.26%, or 87 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.33%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.30%.
The consumer price index, or CPI, climbed to 8.5% in the 12 months through March, above economists’ forecasts of 8.4%, but it was the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, that dominated investor attention.
The core CPI rose 0.3% in March, slower than economists’ forecast for a rise of 0.5%, led by a “larger-than-expected decline in core goods prices alongside a surprising miss in rents,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Some on Wall Street aren’t getting carried away, warning that there is still a long way to go for inflation to return to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
“[W]hile today's report is encouraging, the Fed is a long way away from claiming victory and will have to remain in inflation-fighting mode,” Jefferies said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields took a breather following the data, briefly helping growth sectors of the market including tech catch a bid. 
Energy stocks were the biggest gainer in the wake of surging oil prices as global demand worries eased after Shanghai curbed some of its Covid-19 restrictions.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) led the gains in the energy sector.  
Losses in consumer discretionary stocks were limited by rising restaurant stocks after Citi highlighted Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), and  Texas Roadhouse  (NASDAQ:TXRH) as opportunities with the most upside that can ride out the waning reopening boost and the impact of labor shortages.
CarMax (NYSE:KMX) fell more than 9% after reporting mixed quarterly results as earnings fell short estimates on declining sales volumes.
Bank stocks struggled a day ahead of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) quarterly results as falling Treasury yields weighed. 
In other news, PG&E (NYSE:PCG) rose 3% after it agreed to pay a $55 million settlement over two fires in Northern California.
Sentiment was also hurt by fading hopes of the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire as both sides prepare for an intense battle in the eastern Ukraine region of Donbas.

Investing.com – Stocks went on a rollercoaster ride on Tuesday that left them in the red as of late trading, even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury eased back.
Tech stocks had surged earlier in the session on the rollback in the 10-year yield, which moves inverse to price.
The move comes just as a spate of S&P 500 will report earnings, starting with JPMorgan and Delta Air Lines on Wednesday. 
Banks are seen as beneficiaries of a rising rate environment, but market volatility could dampen capital markets and investment banking activity for the big Wall Street firms, most of which report this week. The flip side is surging energy and commodity prices could have boosted trading.
Airlines are also benefiting from the rebound in travel, though it has had its disruptions as well.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) updated its outlook to be slightly more positive than expected, and Delta is expected to give an outlook on summer travel trends.
Inflation is running at 40-year highs, and the Federal Reserve is likely to take that into account when it meets in a few weeks to decide its next policy action. Most agree that will be a half-point rate hike and a plan to start cutting back its $9 trillion balance sheet. 
Much of the uncertainty in the markets since February has been the economic repercussions of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said peace talks with Ukrainian counterparties hit a “dead end” and he promised to continue Russia’s fight, sending oil prices back up above $100 a barrel.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. JPMorgan earnings
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will also report on its latest quarter before the open, with analysts tracked by Investing.com forecasting earnings per share of $2.70 on revenue of $30.63 billion.
2. Delta Air earnings
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will report earnings before the opening bell Wednesday, and while international travel trends seem to be on the up, Delta shareholders will be looking for a boost. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect Delta to report earnings per share of $1.33 on revenue of $8.74 billion.
3. Producer prices
At 8:30 AM ET the U.S. will report the month over month producer price index for March. Analysts expect PPI to grow to 1.1%, above the previous reading of 0.8%.

The crowd-sourced review platform for restaurants and other businesses will provide travel benefits to its U.S. employees who need to travel out of states like Texas and Oklahoma that have restricted access to abortion services.
“As a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, this new benefit allows our U.S. employees and their dependents to have equitable access to reproductive care, regardless of where they live,” Miriam Warren, Yelp's chief diversity officer, said in a statement.
Other companies have pledged to offer similar support to their Texas-based employees. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) in March started covering travel expenses for employees who go out of state for abortions, becoming the first major U.S. bank to make that commitment.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill that makes it illegal to perform an abortion in the state except in medical emergencies, penalizing those who do with up to $100,000 in fines and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law that gives its conservative majority a chance to undermine or even repeal the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday questioned whether allowing Mexico to sue U.S. gun manufacturers for facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels would open the door to other countries suing them, including Russia over firearms used by Ukrainians in the ongoing war.
U.S. District Judge F. Dennis Saylor in Boston raised that prospect as he weighed whether to dismiss Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold gun makers including Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co responsible for a deadly flood of weapons across the border.
Mexico in a lawsuit filed in August accused the companies of undermining its strict gun laws by designing, marketing and distributing military-style assault weapons in ways they knew would arm drug cartels, fueling murders and kidnappings.
It said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the gun makers it sued, which also include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt's Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc.
""They know how criminals are getting their guns,"" Jonathan Lowy, a lawyer for Mexico, argued during the 90-minute virtual hearing. ""They could stop and they choose to be willfully blind to the facts.""
But Saylor questioned whether Mexico's stance would mean the protections gun makers typically enjoy under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) from lawsuits over their products' misuse is ""completely hollow.""
He asked why if Mexico could sue the gun makers other countries could not too, such as Italy over mafia killings, Israel over attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas, or even Russia over the deaths of its soldiers in Ukraine if the companies' guns were used.
""If Ukrainians are using United States manufactured military weapons or Smith & Wesson revolvers for that matter to defend themselves, can the government of Russia come in and say you have caused us harm?"" he asked. ""I mean, why not, if your theory is right?""
Steven Shadowen, another lawyer for Mexico, said other foreign counties could sue too if they met the requirements, though he said U.S. courts could refuse to hear a case if it presented a political question.
But Andrew Lelling, a lawyer for Smith & Wesson, said it would be ""absurd"" to conclude the federal law only bars lawsuits over injuries in the United States and not Mexico's allegations over the trafficking of guns to Mexican criminals.
He said it was too much of a reach for Mexico to sue the companies over gun sales that were legal in the United States to wholesalers who in turn sold them to retailers before criminals smuggled them. 
""They would have to argue that Congress intended for this robust statute to apply if an independent criminal actor shot somebody in San Diego, but not if he slips over the border and shoots somebody in Tijuana,"" Lelling said.

Alejandro Celorio, the Mexican foreign ministry's legal counsel, said the court's resolution would likely take weeks, and noted that the complexity of the case made a nuanced, rather than a simple ""yes or no"" ruling more likely in the end.
Speaking in a video conference, Celorio said if the court ruled against Mexico, the government would likely appeal. A negotiated settlement was ""always an option"", he added, but stressed Mexico had no plans to change its strategy for now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global equities reversed earlier gains on Tuesday, while U.S. Treasury yields slipped as data showing a jump in U.S. inflation was in line with expectations gave investors some relief.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 1.2% last month, the biggest increase in 16-1/2 years and cementing the case for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
However, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last down 6.1 basis points to 2.721%, its first decline in eight sessions, as the inflation number had been priced in and also reflecting the market's unease that an aggressive policy response to inflation from the Federal Reserve could undermine economic growth.
""Inflation is still a really big part of the macro narrative here (but) we're seeing some encouraging signs beneath the surface,"" said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.'
""Market has been picking up today on the fact that the CPI was a bit softer than expected... Anything that indicates a softening momentum on the inflation front is going to mean that the Fed perhaps may not have to go as aggressively in tightening monetary policy.""
Oil prices climbed on Tuesday as Russian oil and gas condensate production fell to 2020 lows and OPEC said it would be impossible to replace potential supply losses from Russia. [O/R]
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02% and the S&P 500 lost 0.02%. 
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.35% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.24%.
""Markets have decided that central banks are late and need to do more to tame inflation, and moderate volatility in equities is not enough to stop this,"" said Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich. ""The reason for the wobble in equity markets is higher rates and geopolitics.""
While U.S. 10-year Treasury yields pulled back from their highs, they are up almost 45 basis points so far this month.
More disconcerting for equities is the move in real or inflation-adjusted yields, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) approaching 0%. 
In Europe, German Bund yields climbed to almost 0.88%, their highest level since 2015, British gilt yields rose to fresh multi-year highs.
Germany's ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index fell to -41.0 points from -39.3 in March, declining less than expected.
Investors also await Wednesday's first-quarter earnings season for big banks, many of which are expected to report a sharp decline in earnings from a year earlier, according to analysts, who noted many lenders benefited from exceptionally strong deal-making, trading and funds set aside for loan losses being released.
ASIA MARKETS GAIN GROUND
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six peers, rose 0.26%, after earlier in the week touching its highest level in almost two years.
Japan's yen, however, has been hurt by the Bank of Japan's commitment to maintaining ultra-easy policy even as the Fed embarks on tightening monetary policy.
The latest warnings from Japanese policymakers, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida saying on Tuesday that rapid currency moves are undesirable, failed to shore up the yen, which has shed over 3% this month.
""Markets at this point are not sure policymakers are genuinely inclined to intervene on the yen and that's why we have most likely seen a limited impact,"" said James Lord, global head of FXEM Strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""Typically verbal intervention doesn't have much impact on currency markets, and that's not specific to the yen.""
The euro traded down 0.53% to $1.0825, unable to hold gains from a mini-relief rally on Monday, after French leader Emmanuel Macron beat far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the first round of presidential voting.

A relaxation of China's regulations on the gaming sector also gave investors heart after a multi-year crackdown on parts of the country's technology industry.
China's blue chip CSI300 Index dipped into negative territory mid-session but roared back later to rally almost 2%.

U.S. crude rose 7.17% to $101.05 per barrel and Brent was at $105.12, up 6.74% on the day.
The European Union has yet to agree any embargo on Russian oil over the war in Ukraine, but some foreign ministers have said the option is under discussion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight U.S. weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry's capacity to meet Ukraine's weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years, two people familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday.
Demand for weapons has shot up after Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 spurred U.S. and allied weapons transfers to Ukraine. Resupplying as well as planning for a longer war is expected to be discussed at the meeting, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The Pentagon's office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense, will host the 90 minute meeting and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was expected to attend, one of the people said.
The Pentagon has said that the most useful weapons are smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington and allies have been shipping to Ukraine on a nearly daily basis.
The intense usage, as well as the battlefield effectiveness displayed by Ukrainian forces, has driven interest in restocking these weapons.
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX). 
The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including over 5,000 Javelins and more than 1,400 Stingers.

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Administration is having weekly meetings of its European Crisis Management Team to review specific requests related to Ukraine.
To speed up U.S. government approval for sales and transfers of arms produced by American defense contractors, the Pentagon has re-established a team to respond to the increased demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest remained bullish on top holding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Tuesday despite growing fears of a U.S. recession and shutdowns of the car maker's Shanghai factory due to spiking coronavirus cases. 
""What we said during COVID about innovation solving problems will move into overdrive,"" she told a webinar, with Tesla poised to ""deliver truly exponential growth for many, many years"" as it expands its autonomous driving programs.
Wood's bullish stance on technology comes as yields of two-year Treasuries have moved above those of 10-year Treasuries in recent weeks, which is often considered a precursor to a recession. 
Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund in 2020, said that she expects ""truly disruptive innovation"" will come back into favor as investors turn to technology to solve economic problems. 
Tesla is down 6% for the year to date, while Wood's second-largest position, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, is down nearly 26% over the same time. 
Overall, ARK Innovation is down 36.7% for the year to date, a performance that puts it in the worst percentile among the 615 U.S. Mid-Cap Growth funds tracked by Morningstar. Shares of the fund rose 0.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

(Reuters) - The BA.2 Omicron subvariant of the coronavirus is now responsible for 86% of U.S. COVID-19 cases and more than 90% of infections in the Northeast, according to data on Tuesday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
COVID-19 infections have been back on the rise during the last few weeks, particularly in Northeast states such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, although overall cases have dropped sharply nationally since hitting record levels in January, according to data from the agency.
A resurgence in COVID-19 cases in parts of Asia and Europe has raised concerns that another wave could follow in the United States, as has been the case with previous surges during the pandemic.
Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of division of infectious diseases at Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital, said the trend of an overall decline in cases has now reversed. 
""It's clear that there is now a trend towards an increasing number of cases across the country and particularly in the Northeast,"" Kuritzkes said. 
The seven-day moving average of U.S. COVID-19 cases stood at 28,339 as of April 9, up nearly 10% from a week earlier, the CDC said, with BA.2 accounting for 85.9% of infections. 
For the week ending April 2, BA.2 made up 75.4% of the variants identified in the country, up from a previous estimate of 72.2%, according to CDC estimates. 

Philadelphia, in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania, will reimpose indoor mask mandate from April 18, as a response to a fresh wave of cases, making it the first major U.S. city to take that step. 
""I think it's likely that if the numbers pick up in the same way, individual cities will reimpose masking requirements,"" said Kuritzkes. ""I don't think it's likely that will happen at the state level.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo said on Tuesday that the automaker's plans to create a separate division for its electric (EV) assets could eventually lead to a separate listing.
""This could mean a separate listing. This is a conditional, this is precisely what we are reviewing,"" De Meo told a news conference.
The plan to separate the combustion engines activity could interest Nissan (OTC:NSANY) or long-term investors, he added.
De Meo wants to press ahead with plans to create separate divisions for electric (EV) and combustion engine vehicles despite potentially costly uncertainty over its interests in Russia, three sources told Reuters last week.
Playing catch-up with rivals like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the French automaker first outlined its strategy shift in February, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying its turnaround plan was ahead of schedule.
De Meo on Tuesday said  Renault  (PA:RENA) was ""very confident"" to deliver on its turnaround plan as it was financed despite the impact of the Russian assets suspension.
The war in Ukraine has resulted in Western powers imposing extensive sanctions against Russia, leaving Renault, majority owner of Russia's biggest carmaker Avtovaz, faced with what de Meo has called a ""very complex situation"".

After announcing the suspension of its activities in Russia, Renault is reviewing its options for the Moscow plant and its shareholding in Avtovaz.
""We are well armed to try to find a solution in the long term that can protect our assets and our employees, and in fact not to completely insult the future because life goes on and we hope the situation on the ground returns to normal,"" De Meo said on Tuesday.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Major U.S. airlines are enjoying the strongest travel demand in three years, yet investors will focus on how they are mitigating mounting inflationary pressures when they report quarterly earnings starting on Wednesday.
After a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, travel demand has roared back, with some airlines reporting the highest ticket sales in their history. U.S. passenger traffic has been averaging about 89% of the pre-pandemic levels since mid-February, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data. 
But jet fuel prices in North America have gone up by more than 30% in the past month, since Western countries slapped sanctions on Russian exports. Carriers also must pay more to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), due to report first-quarter earnings on April 21, on Tuesday revised up estimates for jet fuel expenses. Overall, it projected costs in the quarter through March would be at least 16% higher than in the corresponding period of 2019.
The Texas-based carrier is tipped to report a loss of $2.42 per share for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Soaring fuel costs have raised concerns among investors at a time when the airline industry has spent two years trying to recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19.
HIGHER FARES 
Fuel is the industry's second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. airlines do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. 
Instead, they typically look to offset fuel costs with higher fares. Airlines fares were up about 24% year-on-year in March, among the biggest contributors to a jump in U.S. consumer prices.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) has said it is passing along most additional fuel costs to customers. Its average fares are up more than 100% from a year ago, according to data from Cowen.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), which will report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, last month said it needed to raise ticket prices by about 10% each way to cover the fuel costs.
Historically, the U.S. airline industry has offset around 60% of changes in fuel expense with higher revenue, analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note. As a result, demand needs to stay strong for sustainable profitability, analysts say.

Some are concerned that rising fares and higher inflation could dent travel spending.
Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, said consumers might hit the brakes in the second half, making it tougher for airline revenues to rebound to 2019 levels.

(Reuters) - Airbus urged Europe on Tuesday not to block imports of titanium from Russia, saying sanctions on the strategic metal would damage aerospace while barely hurting Russia's economy.
Widening the action taken after Russia's invasion of Ukraine to titanium, used in airplanes and jet engines, would ""not be appropriate,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said at an annual shareholder meeting.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on Western governments to impose stronger economic sanctions on Russia.
The European Union said on Monday more sanctions were an option and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday Kyiv's allies would continue to tighten pressure on Moscow. 
Russia is the largest producer of titanium, a strategic metal prized for its strength relative to its weight.
The EU has so far avoided banning Russian commodities other than steel and coal, and titanium remains exempt from restrictions on trade with Russia.
""Airbus is applying and will continue to apply the sanctions fully,"" a company spokesperson said.
""Sanctions on Russian titanium would hardly harm Russia, because they only account for a small part of export revenues there. But they would massively damage the entire aerospace industry across Europe,"" the spokesperson added.
Airbus is accelerating a search for non-Russian supplies in the long term, while its needs are covered in the short and medium term, Faury said.
In March, Airbus said it ""is directly sourcing titanium from Russia as well as from other countries"" and indirectly acquiring Russian titanium via suppliers. 
On Tuesday, it reaffirmed this in answer to a Reuters query but declined to say when it had last received Russian titanium.
OUTLOOK CONFIRMED
Airbus has said it relies on Russia for half its titanium needs, while state-backed VSMPO-AVISMA provided a third of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s needs under a deal renewed last November. Last month, Boeing said it had suspended buying Russian titanium.
VSMPO-AVISMA is 25%-owned by state defence conglomerate Rostec. It relies on aerospace for three quarters of its sales. 
Aerospace officials say Airbus is partly concerned about the reliance on Russia at suppliers like France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), which uses titanium to make jet engine parts and landing gear. 
Safran said in February it had reserves for several months and depended on Russia for less than half its needs. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it shared Airbus' worries about possible sanctions.
Aerospace is not the only industry wrestling with Russia's commodity clout. U.S. utilities have lobbied the White House not to ban Russian uranium, Reuters reported last month.
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since war started on Feb. 24, according to researchers. About 80 have kept a presence, while suspending new investments. 

Faury reaffirmed Airbus' 2022 profit guidance but said it was clear the war in Ukraine was ""making it harder as we now have a more challenging risk profile"" due to economic risks.
""That being said, we still have three quarters ahead of us and we continue to believe we can achieve it,"" he said.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 01:31PM ET</span>",Benetton team working on premium of around 30% to buy out Atlantia - sources,"By Francesca Landini and Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - The Benetton family and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are working on a premium of around 30% over Atlantia's average stock price in the last six months, as they ready a bid that could land as early as Wednesday, three sources said.
The two partners are considering an offer between 22 and 23 euros per share, one of the sources said, but cautioned no final decision had been taken. 
While a significant premium on the six month average share price, that would be a more modest increase over the current price of about 21.7 euros, and would value the whole of Atlantia - in which the Benetton family already owns a 33% stake - at about 18.1-19.0 billion euros ($19.7-$20.7 billion). 
Shares in the Italian infrastructure group have gained nearly 20% since April 6 when speculation first emerged about an approach involving Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Brookfield and Florentino Perez, head of Spain's ACS. 
The stock hit a two-year high of 22.5 euros on Monday as investors waited for a move that could take the group private.
""The offer could land very soon, even early Wednesday morning,"" one of the sources said.
Blackstone and Benetton holding company Edizione declined to comment. 
GRAPHIC - Atlantia's bumpy ride https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjbylxve/ATLANTIA_BID_WAR.png 
Edizione and Blackstone want to delist Atlantia to shield it from the appetite of rival suitors, who approached the Benettons last month with a proposal to buy the group and hand over Atlantia's motorway concessions to Perez. 
GIP, Brookfield and the Spanish tycoon are in a 'wait and see' mode after the Benetton family and Atlantia's long-time investors CRT and GIC rebuffed their offer, sources have said.
The takeover offer comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a deal aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
It also puts the spotlight on Alessandro Benetton, 58, who was appointed chairman of Edizione earlier this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments.
After parting ways with its Autostrade per l'Italia, Atlantia will continue to run airports in Italy and France, motorways in Europe and Latin America and digital toll payment company Telepass.

The Italian government so far has been silent on the latest developments, but it has special vetting 'golden' powers over strategic assets, such as the country's airports and their ownership.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 01:10PM ET</span>",Boeing says 141 jet orders in limbo amid war in Ukraine,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co on Tuesday moved orders for 141 of its airplanes into accounting limbo due to the war in Ukraine and international sanctions against Russia, among other contractual issues, meaning it no longer expects the jets to be delivered.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) unveiled the adjustment to its order backlog in monthly orders and deliveries data that also showed it had delivered 41 jets to customers in March.
The monthly deliveries tally included 34 of its cash-cow 737 MAX single-aisle jets, two 767 freighters for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and a 777 freighter for China Airlines.
The 41 March deliveries - nearly double the 22 it delivered in February and up from 29 a year ago - reflect rebounding travel and pandemic-driven cargo demand. Boeing said year-to-date deliveries stood at 95 aircraft. 
Deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner remained frozen due to inspections and repairs for production flaws. 
In March, Boeing booked orders for 53 planes, while customers canceled orders for 15 jets - including three of its 787s. Net of canceled orders and swapped models, Boeing had 38 orders, it said. 
For the first three months of the year, Boeing's orders rose to 167 from 114, Boeing said. Taking out cases where customers canceled orders or swapped models, orders stood at 145, up from 107, Boeing reported. 
After adjustments for deals deemed unlikely to result in actual delivery, net orders year to date dropped to 76 from 179, Boeing said. 
Overall, Boeing's order backlog fell to 4,231 from 4,375.
Boeing said the accounting adjustment included 141 aircraft removed from its backlog for financial and contractual considerations. 
Most of the aircraft removed were due to the war in Ukraine, which prompted international sanctions against Russia and ruined Ukraine's airline industry. 
The orders were mainly for Russian carriers and included 138 of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX, and more than a dozen 777 and 787 widebody models. 
Jet orders could return to the backlog if Boeing's assessment changes. 
Boeing rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) said it delivered 142 planes in the first quarter, up more than 13% on the year.

Airbus said it sold a total of 253 jets in the first quarter, or a net total of 83 after cancellations.
Airbus does not publish a figure comparable to Boeing's accounting adjustment, but industry sources said the European planemaker also has an internal filter for screening out orders that are unlikely to be delivered and does not place them into its production plan.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 01:00PM ET</span>",Proxy firms advise against granting Credit Suisse managers 2020 liability discharge,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - Proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have recommended  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s shareholders vote against discharging the bank's board and management from liability for the 2020 financial year at its annual general meeting on April 29.
Glass Lewis said in a report on Monday that shareholders ""could reasonably hold the board and executives accountable for the identified deficiencies in the Company's risk and control framework that were in place during fiscal year 2020"".
ISS noted in a report on Tuesday that the same issues had entailed ""entailed substantial monetary and reputational costs for the company, and by extension its shareholders.""
Shareholders are set to scrutinise the performance of Switzerland's second-largest bank during 2020 and 2021, when a series of scandals prompted ousters, investigations and losses.
Credit Suisse's board will leave managers potentially liable for its Greensill-linked funds' collapse when it asks investors to grant them a discharge for other activities.
The bank racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.7 billion) 2021 loss, partly as a result of a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos.
It was also hit by the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill for which it is still trying to recover funds.
Votes at this year's AGM will cover two financial years as Credit Suisse withdrew an agenda item from its meeting in 2021 while it investigated the Greensill and Archegos matters.
Both ISS and Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote in favour of discharging Credit Suisse directors from liability for the 2021 financial year. 
While the bank still had ""a long way to go to effect a convincing turnaround and materially reduce its exposure to reputational and litigation risk,"" it had taken meaningful steps to improve its culture and risk governance, Glass Lewis said.
ISS said a ""qualified vote"" in favour of management's performance for 2021 was warranted due to ""significant levels of personnel refreshment and remedial measures implemented"".
""Nevertheless, some concern is still raised for 2021 considering the actions of the former board chair during the year,"" it added.
Credit Suisse said it took note of the recommendations, adding that Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended shareholders support the board's positions on all but one proposal.

Shareholder groups have submitted two proposals running counter to the board of directors, asking investors to approve a special audit examining the bank's actions, and separately to strengthen its climate change strategy.
Glass Lewis and ISS recommended shareholders reject both.

Scores of foreign companies have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia or said they were leaving for good since Russia began what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
A bill submitted to the lower house of parliament on Tuesday showed that Russian lawmakers proposed appointing VEB or other entities, as per authorities' and courts' decisions, as external administration at companies where foreign ownership exceeds 25%.
The external administration could be set at companies playing a critical role in infrastructure or monopoly supplies of certain goods if their decision to leave Russia poses a threat to supply chains or could result in job cuts.
Earlier on Tuesday, telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) said it was pulling out of the Russian market, going a step further than rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which said on Monday it was indefinitely suspending its business in Russia.
Russian authorities have previously suggested that Russia may nationalise assets held by Western investors who decide to depart.

Last week, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin asked foreign companies to keep their production operating in Russia to save jobs, even if companies decide to leave.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made clear he wants to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the unit, floating names of Mexican billionaires like Ricardo Salinas of Banco Azteca and Carlos Hank Gonzalez of Banorte as potential buyers.
""It's completely reasonable that the government has a vision of who is the best manager for one of the country's largest financial entities,"" Paco Ybarra, chief executive of Citi's Institutional Clients Group, told local newspaper El Financiero. 
""It's one more factor in the decision process, not something that we consider to be decisive and it is open to as many options as possible,"" said Ybarra, underscoring the sale is open to foreign buyers. 
Citi country head Manuel Romo announced in March that Ybarra will lead the sale.
The executive is currently in Mexico City ahead of the bank's announcement of sale terms, several outlets reported.
In February, Romo said Citibanamex could be sold directly or through an initial public offering, but not piecemeal.
Ybarra also told local outlet El Economista that for Citi, ""it's important for the buyer to pay what we know (the unit) is worth."" 

Analysts have said Citibanamex could go for $4 billion to $8 billion, though Citi, which paid $12.5 billion for the unit in 2001, has not yet named a price.

(Reuters) -European shares fell on Tuesday as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) slumped after a big stake sale, while a U.S. reading on inflation kept aggressive Federal Reserve tightening bets from ramping up. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3%, paring some losses from earlier in the day, with healthcare stocks leading losses, and banks among the worst hit. 
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank fell 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively, after an undisclosed investor sold stakes of more than 5% in Germany's top lenders. 
The appetite for shares firmed slightly from earlier in the day after U.S. data showed consumer prices in the world's largest economy rose largely in line with estimates, pushing U.S. Treasury yields lower. [US/]
After a strong rebound from March lows, the STOXX 600 has been stuck in a range on worries about the fallout of the Ukraine war, aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation and rising coronavirus cases in China.
""That sinking feeling hit European shares amid concerns that inflationary pressures are still mounting and growing evidence that consumer confidence is suffering amid the cost of living squeeze,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""The increasingly entrenched Ukraine conflict has already sent commodity prices soaring... The sanctions screw expected to be turned tighter on Russia, and the European Union is thought to be inching closer towards agreeing a Russian oil embargo,"" she said, adding that the associated supply fears were pushing up crude prices.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 12:26PM ET</span>","Sri Lanka unilaterally suspends external debt payments, says it needs money for essentials","By Uditha Jayasinghe and Jorgelina do Rosario
COLOMBO/LONDON (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's central bank said on Tuesday it had become ""challenging and impossible"" to repay external debt, as it tries to use its dwindling foreign exchange reserves to import essentials like fuel.
The island nation's reserves have slumped more than two-thirds in the past two years, as tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic badly hurt its tourism-dependent economy and exposed the government's debt-fuelled spending.
Street protests against shortages of fuel, power, food and medicine have gone on for more than a month.
""We need to focus on essential imports and not have to worry about servicing external debt,"" Central Bank of Sri Lanka's governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, told reporters.
""It has come to a point that making debt payments are challenging and impossible.""
Weerasinghe said the suspension of payment would be until the country came to an agreement with creditors and with the support of a loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sri Lanka starts formal talks with the global lender on Monday for emergency loans.
The country has foreign debt payments of around $4 billion due this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond maturing in July. A coupon payment of $78 million is due across two of its bonds maturing in 2023 and 2028 on Monday, though there is a 30-day grace period. 
""It is a default. This was inevitable,"" said Murtaza Jafferjee, the chief executive of brokerage J.B Securities.
""This is a positive for the economy because we were using scarce foreign exchange resources to service our debt when we could not afford to. This will release funds for our own citizens. It was displaced vanity at the cost of our population.""
He said Sri Lanka’s decision covers about $25 billion in bilateral and commercial debt, which includes about $12 billion of international sovereign bonds.
""The memorandum today should pave the way to an IMF program, in our view,"" said Milo Gunasinghe at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note to clients, though warned that political uncertainty remained high. 
With the government only having begun the process of selecting advisers for debt talks over the weekend, formal negotiations with creditors might only start once appointments have been made, Gunasinghe added. 
BlueBay Asset Management's senior emerging markets sovereign strategist, Timothy Ash, said the ""only surprise is that it took the administration in Colombo so long to come to terms with the reality on the ground"".
""It's logical to declare a payment moratorium until they work out a programme with the IMF and agree terms with bondholders,"" he said.
Sri Lanka's sovereign dollar-denominated bonds enjoyed healthy gains on Tuesday, with many issues up nearly 2 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.

Its hard currency bonds mostly trade at deeply distressed levels of just under 40 cents in the dollar while the bond maturing on July 25 last traded at just over 50 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Governor Weerasinghe said the call on repayment was being taken in good faith, emphasising that the country of 22 million people had never defaulted on its debt payments.

The analyst says valuation and rising rates still offer a risk to tech stocks, however growth/cycle “should matter more.""
“Surging labor issues point to big upside in IT/software spend. Software & Svcs are favored over Semis, over Tech Hdwr. REITs upgrade is driven by solid growth amid inflation, better pricing vs lower cost exposures, and a cycle stage setup that should be relatively supportive,” Parket said in a client note.

The analyst argues that Crypto.com, and other fast-growing crypto exchanges, are gaining market share at the expense of Coinbase. This makes Dolev “increasingly worried about looming retail pricing pressure and the long-term sustainability of COIN's business model.”
“We found that COIN's share has fallen from a peak of 12% in the fall of 2021 to just 8% currently, with a steep drop in between March and April. We believe that had COIN not added as many tokens in 4Q, the same-store share of volume per token may have been even worse. As a reminder, in 2021 COIN added trading for 95 new tokens, 36 of which were added in 4Q alone (i.e. 38% of the newly added tokens),” Dolev said in a client note.
The analyst adds that Crypto.com’s aggressive marketing campaign (naming rights to the home arena of the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, partnerships with UFC and LeBron James, Super Bowl ads, etc) is paying dividends as its volumes are now on par with Coinbase.
The lowered price target reflects 2022 revenue estimates that now stand at $6.8 billion from $7.0 billion previously.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 11:10AM ET</span>",Honda to spend $64 billion on R&D as it revs up electric ambitions,"By Satoshi Sugiyama and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to spend $64 billion on research and development over the next decade, the company said on Tuesday, laying out an ambitious target to roll out 30 electric vehicle models globally by 2030.
Its goals include producing some 2 million electric vehicles a year by 2030, aiming to gain share in the fast-growing market for electric vehicles, led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, while Japanese automakers risk falling behind European and U.S. rivals.
""As far as resource investments over the next 10 years go, we're going to invest about 8 trillion yen in research and development expenses,"" said Honda Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe, referring to the equivalent to $64 billion.
Honda said it wanted to establish a dedicated electric vehicle production line in North America, where it will also procure Ultium batteries from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
It is also considering a separate joint venture company for battery production there, aside from its GM partnership.
Last week Honda said it and GM would develop a series of lower-priced electric vehicles based on a new joint platform, expanding on plans for GM to begin building two electric SUVs for Honda starting in 2024.
The push towards electric vehicles has prompted it to hunt for partners to optimise costs and share technology.
""This puts them in good company with a lot of other makers that have made big battery announcements ... ultimately the world is going to leave internal combustion engines behind,"" said Christopher Richter, an analyst at CLSA. 
""Given their size, I am glad they are cooperating with General Motors.""
The bulk of the 8-trillion-yen investment is earmarked for electrification and software technologies. That includes about 43 billion yen on a demonstration line for production of solid-state batteries, targeted to start in spring 2024.
HYBRID 'WEAPON'
Honda and other Japanese automakers have long said that even as they go electric, they will not give up on older, hybrid technology.
Proponents of hybrids point to the many markets, especially in emerging countries, where the infrastructure to support battery electric vehicles will be a long time coming.
""By no means is this the end of hybrids and the replacement of all hybrids with EVs,"" Mibe told the presentation.
""We will develop our current hybrids and use them as a weapon in our business.""
Honda's plan to make 2 million EVs annually was within expectations, said analyst Seiji Sugiura of Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
This is because  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has already targeted sales of 3.5 million such vehicles by 2030 and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co has aims for half its cars to be electric by the end of the decade. 
Just a year into the job, Honda boss Mibe has already made a number of bold pronouncements.
In March, the company said it would team with Sony Corp (T:6758) to develop and sell electric vehicles, aiming to start selling the first model in 2025.
Last year he unveiled a 2040 target for electric and fuel cell vehicles to make up all of global sales. 

Shares of Honda finished down 0.2% on Tuesday, outperforming the Nikkei 225 index, which fell 1.8%.

(Reuters) - Franchise Group (NASDAQ:FRG) Inc, owner and operator of retail stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Buddy's Home Furnishings, has entered the race for Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) with a $9 billion indicative offer, three people familiar with the matter said. 
Franchise Group has informed Kohl's it would be willing to pay $69 per share to acquire the department store retail chain, subject to due diligence, the sources said.
Franchise Group's bid is not the highest offer, however. Luxury department store operator Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Company has indicated it is willing to pay at least $70 per share for Kohl's, the sources said. Kohl's shares ended trading on Monday at $57.24.
The sources declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
Still, Franchise Group's entry in the process gives Kohl's more options as it explores a sale under pressure from activist hedge funds. The buyer will have to secure committed financing to assume Kohl's debt pile, which totaled $6.8 billion at the end of 2021, including operating leases.
Franchise Group has a market value of $1.6 billion and carried long-term debt of $1.9 billion as of the end of December. Its ability to carry out the deal would largely depend on the backing of Vintage Capital Management LLC, an investment firm run by retail investing veteran Brian Kahn. Vintage owned a 12.3% stake in Franchise Group as of December and Kahn was its chief executive.
A consortium backed by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, which includes Authentic Brands, has also made a bid for Kohl's, the sources said.
Private equity firm Sycamore Partners and a group that includes Acacia Research Corp, a holding company for business controlled by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, made offers for Kohl's during the first round of bidding, the sources said. It is unclear whether these parties remain in the process. 
Representatives for Franchise Group, Hudson's Bay, Leonard Green, Sycamore and Acacia did not respond to requests for comment. 
A representative for Kohl's could not be reached for comment.
Kohl's, which operates more than 1,100 stores in the United States, is fighting to fend off a board challenge even as it considers selling itself. Hedge fund Macellum Advisors GP in February nominated 10 directors to the company's 14-member board, arguing it has not done enough to improve its business and that it should sell itself.

Last week, Macellum urged the company to be more open about the sales process and give bidders and shareholders a fuller financial picture of itself. 
In response, Kohl's said it is thoughtfully and thoroughly evaluating proposals. Its investment bankers had held conversations with more than 20 potential buyers, the company has disclosed.

The report discusses PC/CPU/GPU models and semiconductor content trends in the PC supply chain.
The three key takeaways from the report are:
1) Retail GPU pricing has indeed collapsed, as the markup over MSRP has fallen from +77% to +41% QOQ;
2) ODM builds and discussions with the channel indicate a potential slowing in demand, although likely exacerbated by Chinese COVID shutdowns; and
3) Intel’s Alder Lake gained share in the quarter, as the more competitive CPU and aggressive pricing appear to be slowing AMD’s share gain trajectory.
Elsewhere, AMD has gained some GPU market share from Nvidia while the latter captured discrete GPU share in laptops. On the other hand, Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) SSD controller share fell by 5% QOQ
“Overall, underlying trends were modestly negative for PC suppliers (INTC, AMD, NVDA). We continue to highlight 'the unknowns' in 2022 regarding the sustainability of the demand environment (volatile crypto prices, end of WFH) and the ever-evolving supply issues (COVID outbreaks/China lockdowns, war in Ukraine, earthquakes in Asia),” Rolland said in a client note.
New price targets on AMD and NVDA are $160.00 and $320.00, down from the prior $180.00 and $360.00, respectively.

PUNE, India (Reuters) -Germany's Mercedes-Benz is betting that an expanding pool of young new millionaires will drive demand for luxury cars in India, creating faster sales growth than for mass market cars, a top company official said.
India's increasing numbers of ""dollar millionaires"" include young entrepreneurs or high-earning professionals who appreciate the luxury element and technology of the cars, said Martin Schwenk, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz India. 
""The base is getting broader and gradually moving beyond our traditional customers,"" Schwenk told Reuters in a recent interview in the western industrial city of Pune, home to Mercedes' India headquarters and manufacturing plant.
""Going forward we will see higher growth rates in the luxury segment than we see in the mass market,"" he said, adding that buyers' average age had also fallen below 40, from more than 45 earlier.
Mercedes is the top-selling luxury car brand in India, with a market share of more than 40%, says auto market data provider JATO Dynamics, and it competes with Audi, BMW and  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM)' Jaguar Land Rover.
Global carmakers' biggest growth hurdle is a shortage of semiconductors and logistics woes worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For Mercedes India, this has led to an order backlog of 4,000 cars and wait times of more than six months in some cases, Schwenk said.
""We have very good sales momentum, the concerns are on the supply side. You have congestion at the ports that cause really significant delays and that is hampering our output,"" he said. 
India's start-up frenzy and stock market boom are creating a new breed of wealthy splurgers on luxury brands such as Rolex, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, the 2021 Hurun India Wealth Report showed.
The number of Indian households with a net worth of at least a million dollars grew 11% in 2021 to 458,000 and is expected to increase by 30% over the next five years, the report said. 
India is largely a small and low-cost car market in which luxury models account for just over 1% of total annual sales of about 3 million. 
Mercedes' India sales rose more than 40% to 11,242 cars in 2021, coming off a low of 7,893 during the pandemic-hit year of 2020.
But the carmaker saw growth of 80% in top-end models such as the GLS, S-Class and GLS Maybach, all cars costing more than 10 million rupees ($131,337).
Schwenk said while the pandemic had driven some of this demand, as more people ""spent for their own pleasure"", India's luxury car market showed potential for higher growth, a feature missing over the last six to eight years.
To capitalise on the momentum, the company plans to launch 10 models in 2022, including its locally assembled electric sedan EQS.
While growth in India's luxury and mass markets are not directly comparable, Mercedes' high-end models doing well reflects the wealth of the nation, said Ravi Bhatia, president for India at JATO.
""The rich have become richer and some of them have ended up upgrading their lifestyle,"" Bhatia said. 
JATO's analysis also showed that Mercedes' product mix and pricing led to a lower average weighted price of its cars, putting upgrades to the luxury segment within reach of more customers, he added.

Mercedes' sales in India in 2021, however, were still lower than its peak of more than 15,500 cars in 2018. Schwenk said sales could approach 2018 levels this year if there were no further supply chain disruptions because of COVID or geopolitical issues.
Lowering Indian taxes on luxury cars, which he said were among the highest in the world, would also help grow the segment and benefit the car market.

As a result, the analyst downgraded the industry view to Cautious.
“While Q4 earnings and TMT presented a more optimistic outlook that supported this take, we are now starting to see signs of weakness accumulate, in particular, a more cautious flash survey on hardware, and most notably, reseller checks noting softer 2H pipelines. Resellers have been noting in recent checks that a combination of 1) Ukraine conflict, 2) higher underlying costs of doing business and 3) strong IT spending over the last year are making customers more weary on larger capex orders, causing smaller 2H pipelines to build than expected,” Marshall said in a client note.
Moreover, Marshall downgraded shares of F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with price targets of $250.00 and $91.00, respectively.
“We believe that over a multi-year period, FFIV and NTAP will still likely outperform the market and their respective networking and storage comps. However, with ~25% of FFIV's business still being hardware driven, a more difficult 2H FY setup and weakening macro demand data points, we think it will be more difficult to focus attention in the NT on the software story, particularly with 35-40% software growth targets already established,” Marshall added.
The analyst also downgraded Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) from Equal Weight to Underweight with a price target of $15.00 per share, down from $17.00.
“While valuation of HPE is not challenging at 7.5x 22e P/E and 11x 22e P/FCF, and cash balance provides meaningful optionality, a combination of weak CIO data, VAR commentary, exposure to servers / storage (60% of revenue) with less backlog buffer, and European concentration (37%), we expect the stock to underperform over the next 12 months,” Marshall concluded.

However, metals to make batteries that last longer hard to come by due to supply chain disruptions, which has led to automakers rushing to secure supplies of lithium, nickel and cobalt.
The prices of these rare metals have soared to multi-year highs. 
Cobalt, a metal that makes up 0.001% of the earth's crust, ensures cathodes do not easily overheat or catch fire and helps extend the life of batteries, which automakers usually guarantee for eight to 10 years.

Nvidia stock price closed 5.2% lower yesterday, fueled by a Baird downgrade call. This way, Nvidia shares are down roughly 25% in the last 2 weeks.
However, Arya believes that selling is likely done. He also addressed investor key concerns that facilitated a sharp drop in Nvidia stock recently.
“The key concern relates to NVDA’s gaming business (44% of sales) that could face weaker demand from customers in Europe (Russia turmoil), China (lockdowns) and crypto mining (Ethereum price declines, change to proof-of-stake which does not require graphics cards). We flag these headwinds, but argue investors could be underappreciating other supportive trends including: (1) strength in data center, pro-viz and 2H autos ramp; (2) upcoming new Hopper-based gaming product cycle in 2H; (3) low gaming channel inventory so any end- user slowdown could be used by channel to restock inventory,” Arya said in a client note.
When it comes to a slowing demand in the PC gaming market, the analyst acknowledged headwinds related to Europe, China, and Ethereum. However, these headwinds imply “only a 7-9% EPS impact to FY23/FY24E (roughly CY22/23E) pf-EPS.”
On the other hand, the analyst sees a greater upside potential as “incremental capacity can be directed to the more profitable (data center, pro-viz) parts of NVDA’s business.”
With these headwinds mostly priced in NVDA stock, Arya continues to advocate for a recovery in shares.
“We continue to see NVDA as one of the most important growth companies in semis, perhaps in tech given its ability to grow sales in high entry-barrier computing markets at a 20-25% CAGR (3x semis industry growth), while maintaining industry leading 45%+ EBIT mgns. Balance sheet is solid, and the company is just starting to embark on large new metaverse, enterprise AI and software opptys. Rising interest rates bring the trading multiples under scrutiny, but we assume that volatility should be reflected in the market over the next few weeks, helping to drive a recovery in NVDA stock,” he concluded.
Nvidia stock price is up nearly 1% in pre-open Tuesday.

The Richmond, Virginia-based company cited declining consumer confidence and affordability, among other factors, for a 6.5% drop in the number of used cars it sold last quarter in stores that have been open at least 13 months. The average price of a car rose 40%, or $8,300, in the period ended Feb. 28 compared with a year ago, CarMax said in a statement Tuesday.
The results are yet another sign that higher costs and worries about the economy are starting to take a toll on consumer behavior. Used car prices have been a major contributor to elevated inflation readings, though they have begun to slip this year.
Shares of CarMax fell more than 4% in premarket trading.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:46AM ET</span>","J.P.Morgan slaps 'sell' rating on Rolls-Royce, shares drop","(Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY)'s plan to focus on the development of electric aero engines and greener fuel options raises doubts over the prospects of its mainstay civil aviation business, J.P.Morgan said in a note on Tuesday.
Lowering the stock to ""underweight"" from ""equal-weight"" in its first rating change since March last year, the U.S. bank said Rolls-Royce's move implied weak confidence in the company's biggest unit and could raise execution risks in the coming years.
The warning sent the British aero-engine maker's stock tumbling 5% to its lowest in a month, piling pressure on a company whose shares have already lost a quarter of their value this year.
After being floored by the COVID-driven collapse in air travel in 2020, Rolls-Royce has tried to repair its balance sheet by cutting more than 1 billion pounds ($1.30 billion) in costs and said recently that it expected to be modestly cash flow positive for 2022 as airline customers fly again.
The company has also sharpened its focus on developing less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen-powered engine options, which could eventually replace traditional engines. 
Those efforts have, however, met with some scepticism. 
""Most aviation experts believe it will not be possible to have a large commercial aircraft that is powered electrically, at least for many decades to come,"" J.P.Morgan analyst David Perry said.
The greener engine options belong to the ""New Markets"" reporting segment that also includes a project to build the company's small modular reactors unit, which could eventually replace sustainable aviation fuel. The project has been backed by Qatar and Britain.

Perry's ""sell"" recommendation on Rolls-Royce is echoed by 4 other analysts, while 10 brokerages have a neutral rating on the company, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Haas also reminded investors that BBBY stock is one of the top Underperform ideas for 2022 at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as the company continues to lose market share to rivals.
“BBBY’s 4Q comp guidance of down high single digits implies comps down roughly 10% on a 3-year basis vs. +23% 3-year home furnishings industry growth per the US Census. BBBY has been losing share for years as consumers have increasingly consolidated purchases at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other mass retailers. The share losses accelerated further following a turnaround strategy which included coupon reductions and private label expansion. We think mgmt. moved too quickly, core customers were lost and now more sharp promotions are being used to recuperate sales including 20% off entire orders, free same day shipping ($10 value) and $10 gift cards for $50 spent,” Haas said in a client note.
The analyst is especially vocal about BBBY’s decision to introduce a $1 billion stock buyback program, which has “materially worsened” the balance sheet.
“This will make completion of BBBY’s turnaround more difficult, as there is much heavy lifting still ahead including standing up a distribution center network and implementing modern IT systems. BBBY has cut capex plans this year from $400mn+ to $350mn. BBBY has also opened one buybuy BABY (“BABY”) store as of 3Q21 despite plans to open 50 from ’21-23. BBBY’s turnaround could work, but will take many years in our view, and activist investor, RC Ventures, who recently obtained three board seats is already advocating for a strategic change,” Haas added.
Finally, the analyst has reflected on BBBY stock price which trades over 100% higher compared to his price target of $9.50. Haas adds that BBBY shares are “disconnected from the fair value” after Ryan Cohen, co-founder of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), got involved.
“Retail investors are looking for a short squeeze following the sale of BABY which Cohen believes is worth “several billion.” We value BABY at just over $500mn. The company may announce a new buyback authorization with earnings, but it could be hard to complete with less cash on the balance sheet and our expectation for negative free cash flow over the next several years. The fiscal year has likely started off weak; we expect a “hockey stick” guide,” the analyst concluded.
BBBY stock price is down 0.4% in pre-open Tuesday.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. investor Capital Group sold big stakes in Germany's two top banks -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) - a person familiar with the matter said, dealing a blow to both lenders as they seek to rebuild investor confidence.
Shares in the two banks traded sharply lower on Tuesday after the previous day's sale of more than 5% in each of them by what had been an undisclosed investor.
The exit follows a similar move by U.S. private equity firm Cerberus in recent months and comes as both banks implement turnaround strategies to lift profitability and the value of their shares.
Capital Group, based in Los Angeles, is one of the few holders of such sizeable stakes in both banks, but it has declined to comment on the matter.
The person confirming the name spoke on condition of anonymity.
Deutsche Bank shares were down 8.8% and Commerzbank had lost 8% by mid-afternoon in Frankfurt.
A statement from Deutsche Bank said that it remained ""confident"" in its strategy. 
""Our focused business model and risk-management capabilities have proven their resilience in challenging times,"" it said.

After saying he would become the largest individual shareholder of Twitter, Musk was invited to join Twitter's board of directors by the company’s CEO Parag Agrawal.
Twitter was so confident about Musk joining the board that it even listed the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO as a board member on its investor relations webpage.
Furthermore, Agrawal said he will arrange a Q&A session with Musk and Twitter employees this week after some of them were concerned about Musk’s addition to the board.
However, Musk unexpectedly changed his mind and rejected the invitation to the board, causing panic among Twitter employees who are concerned that the billionaire will continue publicly criticizing the social media company without having to act in its best interests, Bloomberg reported.
Agrawal canceled the Q&A session and said he believes Musk’s change of heart is good for Twitter, though he warned of “distractions ahead.”
Some Twitter employees said their colleagues are feeling super stressed and are “working together to help each other get through the week.”
Musk’s decision not to join the board frees him from restrictions on how many Twitter shares he can purchase and allows him to continue criticizing the company in his tweets. Joining the board would restrict Musk from increasing his Twitter stake beyond 14.9%, however, his change of mind now raised concerns about his end game.
“This decision by Elon does not bode well for Twitter,” said Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, arguing that the Tesla CEO can now continue buying Twitter shares while criticizing the platform.
“Twitter thought having Trump on the platform was tough. Elon Musk is going to be a corporate nightmare,” he added.

""This is the first time the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) Importers (GIIGNL) has issued such an urgent message, underlining the sense of crisis,"" Michiaki Hirose, GIIGNL's vice president for Asia told reporters on Tuesday.
The Paris-based group, whose members account for more than 90% of global LNG trade, issued a statement a day earlier after a meeting of its executive committee, saying governments should provide protection mechanisms to reduce the exposure of LNG importers and consumers to potential procurement cost increases.
It also said governments should encourage technological development and LNG contracts through policy and financial support to underpin final investment decisions in the LNG value chain.
""In the midst of the current global energy crisis, the stabilisation of LNG trade is a matter of urgency,"" said Hirose, who is also Chairman of Tokyo Gas Co Ltd.
Japan, the world's second-biggest LNG buyer after China, should consider boosting the capacity of LNG storage tanks and tankers, Hirose said.
""Holding LNG reserves has been a taboo subject as it is physically and technically difficult to store...But some measures similar to national petroleum reserves may be needed,"" he said.
Unlike some European countries that can store months of natural gas supplies in underground salt caverns or depleted gas fields, Japan can only store around three weeks of its LNG requirement in superchilled storage above ground near import terminals.

Cooperation among LNG buyers within Japan and each region are also key in the event of any supply disruption, Hirose said.
""It would be ideal if Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which have long collaborated over LNG, could cooperate if some emergency happens,"" he said.

The April edition of the survey shows investors are expecting 7 rate hikes from the Fed with the tightening cycle expected to end in the first half of 2023.
Similarly, the risk of a monetary policy mistake is at an all-time high (83%). The FMS also showed that surveyed investors see the Fed “put” at 3637 on S&P 500.
“April FMS is bearish as fear of fast & furious Fed sends global growth optimism to all-time low, keeps Wall St stability risks high; though not as bearish as war-shocked March FMS, sentiment is poor (BofA Bull & Bear Indicator back down to 2.0 “buy signal”); we remain in “sell-the-rally” camp as Profit-Policy set-up means Jan/Feb sell-off was appetizer, not main course of ’22,” Bank of America’s Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote.
Investors also named 4 key tail risks at the moment: 1) recession, 2) Hawkish central banks, 3) Inflation, and 4) Russia/Ukraine war.
Elsewhere, the survey showed that long oil/commodities is the most crowded trade at the moment with allocation to commodities at 38%.
“Modest April rotation to banks & tech, but biggest “longs” are cash, commodities, resources, healthcare, biggest “shorts” are bonds & cyclicals such as industrials & discretionary,” Hartnett added.
Hartnett’s fellow BofA strategist Jill Carey Hall reflected on last week’s flows when the S&P 500 closed 1.3% lower. Overall, the bank’s clients were net sellers of US stocks ($2.8 billion).
“All three client groups were sellers, led by hedge funds (sixth consecutive week of sales). Institutional clients were net sellers for a second week, and retail clients were net sellers after two weeks of buying (and for only the second time YTD),” Carey Hall said in a separate memo to clients.
Clients were selling large caps and buying small and mid caps. As far as stock buybacks are concerned, corporate clients moderately accelerated activities on this front.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",European cosmetics makers face supply crisis amid scarcity of Ukraine resources,"By Mimosa Spencer, Valentina Za and Francesco Zecchini
PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) -European perfume- and cosmetics-makers face shortages of paper, glass, and some key oils and alcohols, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds further disruptions to the supply chains for beauty products, driving prices higher amid robust demand.
Like the food industry, the $500 billion global cosmetics sector is grappling with fallout from the war because producers use alcohol derived from grains and organic beets to make perfumes, and sunflower-seed oils to make cosmetics - all key crops from Ukraine.
At the same time, the energy crisis sparked by the war has pushed glass and paper prices through the roof, while China's COVID-19 lockdowns have thwarted companies' ability to obtain packaging components for $100-a-bottle scents and $30 lipsticks. 
""We're in crisis management mode when it comes to these subjects of sourcing,"" Emmanuel Guichard, secretary general of French cosmetics association FEBEA, told Reuters in an interview. 
Consultancy firm Bain & Company calculates higher prices for packaging, energy and raw materials have driven up production costs in the cosmetics industry on average by 25%-30%, posing a challenge to mass cosmetics producers, though demand for personal care products remains strong, according to partner and EMEA luxury practice leader Federica Levato.  
Italian fragrance manufacturer ICR expects sales this year to surpass pre-COVID levels, but the family-owned maker of Bulgari and Salvatore Ferragamo perfumes is wrestling with a yearly 30% spike in the cost of alcohol, on top of a 10% rise in the cost of glass and paper, Vice President Ambra Martone said. 
Sales of beauty products globally are seen topping the 2019 level of $538 billion this year, up from $518 billion in 2021 and $458 billion in 2020, a McKinsey report showed.
That is still a fraction of other industries that have been disrupted by the war, including the global packaged food industry, which is forecast to be worth over $2 trillion this year, according to the latest estimates from Euromonitor. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused turmoil in markets for staple grains and edible oils, pushing world food prices to new highs.
While larger companies with higher profit margins have more financial firepower and flexibility to cope - L'Oreal's luxury division, which sells Giorgio Armani and Valentino branded makeup and perfume, for example, has an operating margin of 22.8% - the challenge is particularly acute for small- and medium-sized companies in Europe. 
""We face scarcity and price increases every step of the way: from essences and alcohol to glass and paper - even for spray dispenser pumps and Surlyn plastic used for caps,"" said Marco Vidal, managing director of Venetian fragrance manufacturer Mavive, owner of the Merchant of Venice brand. 
The challenges are flaring up as consumers continue snapping up higher-priced beauty products, including perfumes made with a stronger concentration of oils and more unusual raw ingredients.
Sales of fragrances have been rising steadily over the past three years, and were up by 15% in 2021 in the United States, with perfumes priced at more than $175 a bottle more than doubling in unit sales, according to the latest data from NPD Group. 
""It's a disaster, and you just can't find glass,"" said Alba Chiara De Vitis, founder of Florence-based Alchemia Essenze whose fragrances sell for up to 180 euros ($196) a bottle.
European cosmetic makers, which exported 22.6 billion euros ($24.6 billion) of goods in 2020 according to industry association Cosmetics Europe, found competing demand for packaging materials after the coronavirus pandemic which has boosted e-commerce, driving paper consumption amid efforts to reduce use of plastic.
Glass makers, on their part, have struggled to cope with demand for vaccine vials after scaling down production in the early stages of the pandemic, turning off furnaces in Italy for the first time in decades.
Now gas prices are exacerbating problems for both industries, forcing paper mills in Italy to temporarily halt production to renegotiate selling prices.
A doubling in the cost of paper it uses to make rigid luxury boxes for clients including Dolce & Gabbana, Ferragamo and Givenchy has led Italy's Isem Group to hike the price of its products of between 10% and 40%, CEO Francesco Pintucci told Reuters.
Italian glass-maker Bormioli Luigi, which makes bottles for spirits, perfumes and cosmetics with yearly revenue of 480 million euros, expects 80 million euros in extra energy costs this year, half of which borne by its beauty division whose clients include French brands Chanel and Dior, head of fragrances Simone Baratta told Reuters. 
""Before the war the cost of a flacon from distributors was 0.75-1.40 euros, now it's 1.00-1.50 euros,"" De Vitis said.
Glass makers in France, where larger cosmetics companies began placing orders months earlier than they had in the past, have struck a more reassuring note, said Guichard, who predicts they, too, will likely soon feel the pinch of the energy crisis.
""I think we'll have a hard time obtaining gas to make perfume bottles,"" he said, noting there wouldn't be enough time to convert gas-powered ovens to electric systems.  
Meanwhile, executives at Intercos, an Italian cosmetics supplier for brand names, which on Tuesday signed a five-year commercial deal with Dolce & Gabbana, said it had raised prices by around 5% in late 2021 and was considering a further hike in the summer. 

""In the luxury beauty sector, we expect that the consumers will carry the burden of these higher costs after a transition period that could last a few months,"" Levato said.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.
Global companies, from phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.
According to Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission, as of April 7 a total of 161 listed Taiwanese companies reported their operations in Shanghai and Kunshan have stopped, 41 of them make electronics.
""In the best-case scenario, complete resumption of production may not be possible until late April or early May,"" analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities said, adding that Apple could minimise the impact due to its strong supply chain and relationship with the Chinese government.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Staffing, logistics and transportation issues are forcing manufacturers to rely on available inventory, barely meeting the needs of production lines and exacerbating component mismatches, according to data provider TrendForce.
A surge in shipments and demand for materials after lockdowns are lifted could also gridlock customs authorities, causing potential delivery delays, according to the TrendForce report.
Demand for iPhones could also be hit as consumers divert funds from phones and gadgets to everyday essentials.
Pegatron said the resumption of work depended on the two plants being given clearance by the government.

The company said it will maintain close contact with customers and suppliers and ""actively cooperate"" with local governments to resume work as soon as possible.
The far larger Taiwanese firm Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, also assembles iPhones in China. Its operations in the southern city of Shenzhen were disrupted last month by a COVID-19 outbreak there.

Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have fared better than peers this year, falling 6.7% versus the 14% drop of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. That’s despite reports of production difficulties that Suva says “could provide a near-term stock pullback which we would use as a buying opportunity.”

Last month, American billionaire investor and Warren Buffet’s business partner Charlie Munger stepped down after serving as Daily Journal’s chairman for 45 years.
The publishing company said Munger will remain a director and will be involved in the business operations he already worked on.
Munger is also the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) since 1978 and the one who led the conglomerate’s 7% stake purchase in the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD.
Alibaba stock fell 1.91% yesterday to close at 101.55.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, with investors bracing for a key inflation report which could cement a rapid pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up just 3 points, largely flat, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.2%.
The main focus of Tuesday’s session is the latest consumer inflation release, due at 8:30 GMT (1230 GMT), which is widely expected to show price gains running at their hottest in four decades.
The March release is expected to show an annual gain of 8.4%, the highest level since December 1981, while the core number, which excludes food and energy prices, is seen up 6.6% on the year.
“We expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s price hike,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, as last month’s 7.9% figure didn’t include the majority of the jump in oil and gas costs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
This is the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting, when it is expected to raise rates by a half point, upping the pace of its tightening after the quarter-point move in March.
Also of interest will be comments from Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard later in the session, after she said last week the Fed could start reducing its balance sheet as soon as May at a rapid pace, while Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin is also set to speak. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield last traded at a yield of 2.80%, just off the 2.83% level seen earlier in the session, which is the highest level since December 2018, as investors positioned for the Fed to aggressively lift interest rates throughout the year.
In corporate news, CarMax (NYSE:KMX) is likely to be in focus, with its quarterly earnings coming at a time when the market for used cars is starting to show signs of softening.
Oil prices rose Tuesday, rebounding after recent losses after China eased some of its Covid-related lockdowns, lifting some of the worries about oil demand from the world’s largest importer.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will update its forecasts for global supply and demand in its monthly report later, the U.S. will release its Short-Term Energy Outlook, while the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly estimate for U.S. crude stocks.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.2% higher at $98.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 4.5% to $102.93. Both benchmarks dropped around 4% on Monday, after recording last week their second consecutive losing week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,955.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0866."

Apple spent roughly $81 billion in the last 12 months on buying back its shares, Juva adds. Furthermore, the Cupertino-based titan could also raise its dividend by 5-10%, Citi analyst said.
As far as fundamentals are concerned, Suva sees several positive drivers for Apple‘s products and services.
“While supply chain headwinds are likely to linger, we see demand driven by mix shift away from lower priced Android phones towards more mid end and premium pricing products. We note recent media news of production cuts is nothing unusual at this point in the product cycle given Apple tends to overshoot on build estimates to ensure sufficient supply,” the Citi analyst wrote in a client note.
News concerning regulatory risks could eventually act as a “major overhang” on Apple shares, however, the analyst says this is a headline risk rather than a fundamental risk.
Still, he recognizes that Apple stock could correct lower on such headlines but these pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities.
The analyst also reflected on the recent media report that Apple is working on subscription offerings for its hardware products.
“Many technology companies are offering more as a service offerings rather than full purchase price. We believe at some point in the future Apple may do this with its Mac, iPads, Apple Watch, and other devices. This is not that dissimilar to the iPhone leasing program, but will make these other devices more affordable as they will not require the large upfront cash outlay,” Suva added.
Apple shares closed at $165.75 yesterday.

The STOXX Europe 600 index slipped 1.2% in the morning, while the German DAX and the banking market declined by 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. According to the reports, an undisclosed investor offloaded large stakes in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) (OTC:CRZBY).
The sale reportedly includes 116 million shares of Deutsche Bank and 72.5 million shares of Commerzbank, which translates to over 5% of the two banking giants.
Deutsche Bank said it feels “confident” about its strategy after its shares initially fell 9.5% before recovering.
“As we said during our investor day, we have had a promising start into the year and our objectives remain unchanged,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesperson.
According to Bloomberg data, only two investors have large enough stakes for a sale of this scale including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Capital Group. However, BlackRock is mainly a passive investor whose stake is related to Deutsche Bank’s membership in multiple stock indexes and cannot be sold as one.
Nigel Bolton, a co-chief-investment officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, said that traders should pay close attention to large investor flows.
The sharp selloff in European banks comes on the heels of significant stake sales in the likes of E.ON (OTC:EONGY), Airbus (OTC:EADSY),  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG), and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), among others.
The decline in the European market comes ahead of the U.S. consumer price index reading for March on Tuesday, and the producer price index a day later.

Investors are particularly fearful of a downward revision cycle that may come after markets suffered three big shocks - rates, Ukraine, and commodities.
“Single stock put-call skew is in its top quartile relative to the past year, suggesting elevated investor risk aversion. Our studies show that when fear is high, the S&P 500 tends to see elevated returns. Based solely on this metric, we would expect the S&P 500 to trade up +3.6% in the next three months,” Marshall said in a client note.
Still, Goldman Sachs expects stocks to finish this quarter over 6% higher and around 15% upside over the next 12 months.
“Our analysis of nine statistically significant flow variables suggests the S&P 500 should be 6% higher than current levels. Strong ETF flows have continued and incremental hedge fund flows have turned positive over the past two weeks,” Marshall added.
Goldman strategists picked 25 stocks that could outperform during the earnings season, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG).
“Our analysts see increased potential for upward revisions in Financial and Industrials, while they expect lower margins to pressure many Consumer stocks.”

PARIS (Reuters) - In the final hours of 2021 Airbus officially delivered two A350s to Russia's Aeroflot, helping the jetmaker meet annual delivery targets. Months later, the jets remain in French storage limbo after sanctions forced Airbus to abandon physical handover.
The setback sheds new light on workarounds used by the European planemaker under prevailing accounting rules to support deliveries during the pandemic, as well as the scramble to hit targets at the close of each year, industry sources said.
Airbus reached delivery targets during the crisis, in part due to auditor-approved deals that allowed carriers to delay accounting for some new planes on certain conditions.
The use of such acceptance and delivery agreements (ADA) to smooth deliveries was revealed by Reuters in July.
Industry sources say the system was used for as many as 10-15% of deliveries at the height of the pandemic as the world's largest planemaker fought to contain a drop in deliveries at a time of severe shock for the industry.
But the arrangement has fallen under the spotlight after sanctions against Russia interrupted the choreographed handover sequence. Airbus declined to comment on contractual details or on whether other ADA deals may be disrupted.
Even in ordinary times, a delivery spans 4-5 days of tests and paperwork, according to a recent Airbus filing. Last on the list before jets fly away is ""Transfer of Title"" or ownership.
Under the ADA agreements, the process can stretch out for months after deliveries are announced, the sources said.
Airlines must pay everything owed except for a token four-figure sum on a $50-150 million jet - enough to ring up a sale and record a delivery for Airbus auditors, but just short of the final tally needed to hand formal ownership to the airline.
The advantage for Airbus is that it is able to book the revenue due on delivery, while the airline can delay taking the jet for 3-6 months and pause costly charges like depreciation.
SANCTIONS IMPACT 
Airbus' auditors agreed during the crisis to book such transactions as revenue-earning deliveries strictly on the basis that there is an ""irrevocable commitment"" to transfer ownership at a specific date, three people familiar with the system said.
In the case of the two Aeroflot jets, war in Ukraine and swift European sanctions against Russia fell in the middle of this sequence, cutting away the certainty required by auditors.
On Friday, Airbus took the rare step of reversing the two deliveries that contributed to forecast-beating 2021 results and put aside money to be refunded whenever sanctions allow. The jets, stored in central France, are back on sale.
Some see the U-turn as a potential turning point as aviation switches focus from urgent crisis management towards recovery.
""With what happened to Aeroflot, auditors might start looking at the ADA process differently,"" an airline source said. 
An Airbus spokesperson said any policies were a matter for auditors EY, whose UK-based global office had no immediate comment. EY typically does not discuss individual cases. Airbus is due to hold its annual shareholder meeting later on Tuesday.
The episode also highlights longstanding internal pressure to avoid deliveries being skewed towards the end of the year.
While most Western businesses wind down on New Year's Eve, Airbus works flat-out to meet annual delivery targets after a summer break. That included Aeroflot's A350s booked on Dec. 31.
The chronic end-year pattern was already under internal review after Airbus signed a $175,000-a-day compensation clause to secure an A350 delivery to Qatar Airways exactly a year earlier on Dec 31, 2020, reflecting flaws on a separate jet. 
The agreement unlocked a crucial delivery as one year ended, but now stands at the centre of a $1-billion compensation battle with the airline over 23 jets with similar flaws.

The two sides disagree whether the clause applies but the potential impact of the last-minute deal could speed changes in the way end-year deliveries are managed, industry sources said.
The Airbus spokesperson said deliveries are agreed with customers, and peaks and troughs are normal throughout the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet said it was yet to see an easing of crew sickness that is causing it to cancel flights and disrupt the Easter plans of thousands of travellers, but it was confident it would be able to return to a near pre-pandemic schedule this summer.
The British low-cost carrier had no option but to preemptively cancel hundreds of flights in recent days as COVID-related crew absences reached 20% at some of its bases, Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters on Tuesday.
""You would expect that the spike that we're seeing in COVID infections that really exists here in the UK and also in parts of the network is going to come down, but this is something that we don't see yet,"" he said.
""And (until) that moment in time, we'll just continue to monitor the situation.""
The airline has flown 94% of its planned schedule in the last seven days, and Lundgren said daily cancellations were currently about 4% of flights, with the majority of customers able to rebook for the same day.
He said easyJet (LON:EZJ) was flying around a quarter of a million customers each day over Easter on up to 1,600 daily flights, the highest number operated since 2019.
The carrier expects to operate about 90% of its pre-pandemic schedule in the April-June quarter, Lundgren said, and to return to near-2019 levels this summer, for which it was seeing strong customer demand.
""We are not worried to that extent for the summer and the things that sit inside our control, we have the crew in place,"" he said. 
Lundgren said despite COVID-19 and rising fuel prices, easyJet had outperformed expectations in the six months to the end of March, and would report a loss before tax of between 535 million and 565 million pounds ($696 million-735 million) for the period.
For the same period last year the carrier reported a headline loss before tax of 701 million pounds. 

Shares in easyJet, which have fallen 31% in the last 12 months, were trading down 1.5% in early deals.

Investing.com --Deliveroo (LON:ROO) shares fell 2.6% by mid-morning in London on Tuesday, after the food delivery company warned of a tough year ahead. 
Deliveroo said that its gross transaction value rose by 11% on the year in the first quarter, on a 16% rise in orders. That was against a tough comparison quarter, given that the first quarter of 2021 saw lengthy lockdowns in all of its major markets, boosting the demand for food delivery.
However, the company's more recent momentum appears to have weakened as lockdowns have eased and restaurants have reopened. The number of monthly average users of its service flatlined from the final quarter of 2021 in the U.K. and Ireland, which account for over half of sales, and the company only posted a minimal increase of 100,000 in the rest of Europe. 
Deliveroo repeated the guidance that it gave last month, in expecting gross transaction value to grow by between 15% and 25% this year, adjusted for foreign exchange swings. It still remains far from profitability, however, in a marketplace where it has to compete with the likes of Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) and, increasingly, Just Eat Takeaway. The company expects its adjusted EBITDA this year to be negative, at between 1.5% and 1.8% of GTV. 
The company said its retention rate for its couriers had been ""robust"" in the first quarter, despite a cost-of-living squeeze that is forcing companies to pay higher wages. Deliveroo didn't break out its staff costs but U.K. data released earlier on Tuesday showed that average earnings including bonuses rose 5.4% on the year in February. Food price inflation, meanwhile, hit 5.1% on the year in March. 
Deliveroo shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value since listing in London last year, as investors have turned skeptical about its path to profitability. The stock is currently only 7% above the all-time low it hit in March. "

LONDON (Reuters) -Optimism among fund managers over global economic growth has hit an all-time low while concerns of possible stagflation have risen to the highest since August 2008, a monthly survey by investment bank BoFA Securities showed on Tuesday.
The survey, which took the views of firms managing a total of more than $833 billion, is one of the biggest regular tests of fund manager views and comes as inflationary pressures rise even as the risk of recession increases in major economies.
Asked about their expectations for global growth in the coming months, a net 71% of survey respondents were pessimistic about prospects, the most since the survey records began in the early 1990s. 
The European edition of the survey found investors continuing to cut their European growth projections, with a net 81% of survey respondents expecting the region's economy to weaken over the coming year compared with 69% in the March edition. 
Though fund manager holdings of cash - traditionally an indicator of investor caution - eased to 5.5% in the April edition of the survey from 5.9% in the previous month, prospects of a global recession remain the top ""tail risk"" for global markets, the survey found. 
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has receded to fourth place, after aggressive central bank interest rate actions and inflation.
Allocations to commodities jumped to a record 38%, with investments into oil and commodities zipping up the charts to become the top most ""crowded trade"". 
Other ""long"" positions were in resources stocks and healthcare, while ""short"" bets - by investors expecting a decline in prices - were evident in bonds and cyclical stocks whose performance is most linked to economic growth, BoFA said.
Participants in the survey expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by as many as seven times in the current cycle, compared with four times in the previous edition, with a majority of investors expecting inflation to soften over the next 12 months.
Global profit expectations deteriorated to their weakest levels since March 2020, BoFA said.
In terms of regional stock market allocations, investors were most bullish on U.S. equities, while European and UK equities were the top bearish bets.
Despite the growing recession concerns, a majority of survey respondents expect European equities to mark new highs in the currency economic cycle, with less than 30% of survey respondents expecting market weakness.

The UK remains the favourite equity market in Europe, while Germany and Italy are the least preferred, the European edition of the survey said. 
The survey was conducted between April 1 and April 7.

Bosch said it had paused production at a Thermotechnology factory in Shanghai and an automotive components site in Changchun in northeastern Jilin province. 
Two other auto parts plants in Shanghai and neighbouring Taicang city are maintaining ""closed-loop"" operations, in which workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of society to prevent virus transmission, the manufacturer said.
""We are currently seeing temporarily effects on logistics and supply chain sourcing,"" Bosch said in a statement. ""In this situation, we are doing everything we can to maintain the supply chains as much as possible and to serve the demands.""
China has imposed strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, including in Jilin province and Shanghai.

Auto sales plunged in March as the country's curbs to rein in COVID-19 outbreaks took their toll, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota were among automakers feeling the impact of limits on production.
The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said on Monday it had sent a letter to the country's cabinet detailing how the country's COVID control measures had disrupted European companies and urged it to revise its policies, such as by allowing home quarantine for some COVID patients.

LONDON (Reuters) -Supply chain snags hammered first-half profit at ASOS (LON:ASOS) and the British online fashion retailer warned its expectations for a much better second half could be disrupted by surging inflation. 
Shares in the company, which sells fast-fashion aimed at 20-somethings, dropped as much as 6% in early Tuesday trading after it reported an 87% plunge in first-half adjusted earnings. 
However, they bounced back to last trade over 2% higher after it said stock levels - heavily affected in recent months by industry-wide supply chain problems - were much improved. 
ASOS, which had warned on full-year profits in October when parting ways with then CEO Nick Beighton, said it was sticking with its latest annual guidance - excluding the already-flagged impact of quitting Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. 
But it cautioned there was a greater risk to forecasting that normal as the full impact of recent inflationary pressure on consumers was yet to be felt.
Chief operating officer Mat Dunn said he expected analysts to trim about 14 million pounds ($18 million) from full-year profit guidance of 110-140 million pounds, to take account of the withdrawal from Russia. ASOS made an adjusted profit of 193.6 million pounds in its 2020-21 financial year.
The company said its forecasts reflected an improved stock profile, the easing of comparative growth rates, the return of event and holiday-led demand, increased marketing investment and improved lead-times as supply chain pressures ease.
""We've opened the (spring/summer) season with a very good level of stock,"" Dunn told Reuters.
""There is some uncertainty around (supply from) China, but we're in a much better situation than we were at the start of autumn/winter.""
Dunn said ASOS had raised prices by a low to mid-single percentage in January, but not since.
""We're making sure that our value proposition is as attractive to customers as it can be and we've definitely absorbed some of the inflationary pressures in order to do that,"" he said.
Dunn said the process to recruit a new CEO was ongoing.

Adjusted profit before tax was 14.8 million pounds for the six months to Feb. 28, down from 112.9 million pounds a year earlier. Revenue was up 4% to 2.0 billion pounds.

(Reuters) - Britain's Deliveroo said on Tuesday that consumer spending could slow for the remainder of the year after the food delivery firm reported higher order values for the first quarter.
The warning comes as Europeans face a cost-of-living squeeze due to higher energy bills and soaring inflation, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 
The quarterly 12% growth in gross transaction value (GTV), the money value of all food orders on its platform, was higher compared to a year earlier, but shares fell 3% in early trading and analysts turned sceptical.
""For a growth company like Deliveroo, this (quarterly GTV growth) is not a stellar figure. Actually, it is a warning that the rest of the year is going to be quite volatile,"" said AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson.
During the peak of the pandemic last year, Deliveroo, which competes with the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Just Eat Takeaway, had enjoyed strong orders from people stuck indoors.
""Consumer behaviour may moderate during the year, and this is reflected in our guidance,"" Deliveroo Founder and Chief Executive Will Shu said even as the company stuck to its annual GTV growth of 15%-25% that it provided last month. 
""We remain confident in our ability to adapt financially to any further changes in the macroeconomic environment.""

Britain and Ireland account for nearly 54% of the company's overall GTV.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's finance minister will lobby for the country to be included in the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Capital International (MSCI) developed market index when he meets the index provider next week, he said on Tuesday. 
""Inclusion in the developed market index is necessary and already overdue,"" Hong Nam-ki said at a news conference with foreign media in Seoul. 
Hong said the won - currently at around 1,230 to the dollar - is at one of the weakest levels he has ever seen and that the government is ready to deploy market stabilizing measures if needed.
Asia's fourth largest economy is seeking inclusion on an MSCI watchlist by June. 
The absence of an offshore currency market for the won has been one of the main obstacles South Korea has faced in its efforts to be promoted from the MSCI emerging market index to the developed market. 
The outgoing finance minister said some of the measures on the table for discussion would be extending trading hours and allowing overseas FX dealers to participate in the market, but he did not provide further details when asked. 
Currently, onshore trading hours are 00:00 GMT to 06:30 GMT and only locally licensed financial institutions can participate.
Asked whether further opening up the USD/KRW spot market could increase volatility at a time when rising interest rates and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are adding to uncertainties, Hong said those are obstacles the country needs to cope with. 

""There are concerns over opening up the FX market for 24 hours, but we will have to bear what we have to,"" Hong added. 
The won's one-month contract jumped to as high as 1,227.4 per dollar in non-deliverable forward (NDF) trading immediately after Hong's comments were released at 0630 GMT, strengthening 0.72% from its onshore spot market close of 1,236.2.

""We have proactively engaged all of our index providers on the risks associated with ADR delisting,"" said Brendan Ahern, CIO of Krane Funds Advisors, which manages China-focused ETFs based on CSI and MSCI indices.
""Passive ETF managers will want their index providers to transition from ADRs to the HK share classes in order to avoid tracking error,"" he said, referring to the unwelcome performance difference between an ETF and the index it tracks. 
""Index providers are moving at varying speeds,"" he added.
ETF managers including CSOP Asset Management and Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management said they have also nudged their index providers to swap Chinese ADRs into Hong Kong-traded peers, where available.
Some smaller index companies, such as China Securities Index Co, said they have started the switching but the likes of S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI are more cautious, citing the need for further clarity around Sino-U.S. audit talks, and concerns over relatively low liquidity levels in Hong Kong. 
Also, many active fund managers, unfettered by index-tracking needs, have already dumped ADRs, or made the transition to Hong Kong shares.
TRACKING ERRORS
ADR exposure of the S&P New China Sector Index ETF, run by CSOP, has decreased to 6% from over 30% a year ago after discussions between the Hong Kong-based asset manager and its index provider, portfolio manager Wang Yi said.
Last month, Chinese index publisher China Securities Index started prioritising inclusion of Hong Kong-listed stocks for its CSI Overseas China Internet Index, when a company has multiple listings eligible for selection. 
The index is tracked by a $6 billion ETF run by KraneShares and many other index funds.
Others are also holding out.
Earlier this month, China proposed rules that would potentially give U.S. regulators access to Chinese companies' audit working papers, as Beijing seeks to reach a deal to keep Chinese ADRs listed.
Mike Shiao, Invesco's chief investment officer, Asia ex-Japan, said the overhang on U.S.-listed Chinese companies was ""partially"" removed, but Invesco, which runs an ETF heavily invested in ADRs, would continue to monitor the U.S. response.
S&P Dow Jones declined comment on potential changes to methodologies, while MSCI and FTSE Russell also declined comment.

Underscoring some investors' impatience, the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF said last month that it aimed to fully transition to Hong Kong shares in coming months.
""Could an ETF convert without the index provider? Yes, though it would create tracking error,"" KraneShares' Ahern said. ""Obviously one would rather have tracking error versus holding a stock through a delisting,"" he said.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 03:45AM ET</span>","S.Korea's SK weighs investing in small nuclear reactors, eyes Bill Gates' TerraPower","By Joyce Lee and Byungwook Kim
(Reuters) - South Korea's SK Group said on Tuesday it was mulling investments in small-sized nuclear reactors and that one of the candidates was TerraPower, a U.S. venture founded by Bill Gates.
A spokesperson for SK Inc, the holding company of the No. 3 conglomerate in South Korea, confirmed that TerraPower is a potential investment target among many but nothing had been decided, including details such as the possible investment amount, stake size or partners.
Founded by Bill Gates in 2006, TerraPower designs small modular reactors (SMR) and plans to build its first reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming by 2028. The $4 billion project is scheduled to begin in 2024, according to the company.

The interest in SMR and TerraPower comes after SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won last year pledged to cut 200 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions in 2030, which is roughly 1% of the global carbon elimination goal of 21 billion tons by 2030, according to SK Group.
President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol has pledged his support for nuclear power, which generated 27% of the nation's electricity as of 2021, signaling a grand U-turn from incumbent President Moon Jae-in's nuclear phase-out policy.

There it is: an admission from a central banker that rapid policy tightening may cause a hard landing for economic growth -- Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller described rate hikes as a ""blunt force"" tool that may act like a ""hammer"", causing collateral damage to the economy.
Well, markets at least have already been enduring the collateral damage. Global stocks are down 8.5% this year while Treasury 10-year yields are up around 130 basis points. Yields climbed on Tuesday to a new three-year high, while German 10-year borrowing costs are already at seven-year peaks.
The worst of the growth damage is still confined to Europe. Germany's ZEW investor confidence index due later in the day is projected to fall further, after last month posting the biggest monthly drop on record.
The hope now is that the threat of rate hikes and tighter financial conditions will start to put a lid on inflation. March U.S. consumer inflation is expected later on Tuesday at above 8 year-over-year, following a 7.9% reading for February. 
U.S. factory inflation, on Wednesday, is seen surging above 10%, though many reckon this could be the peak. In any case the data is likely to seal a 50 basis-point Fed rate hike next month. 
Inflation expectations rise https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/CONSUMER-EXPECTATIONS/gdpzyjgxevw/chart.png
Inflation pressures are everywhere, in fact, even in Japan which earlier in the day reported record wholesale price growth, while Britain's three-month jobless rate fell to 3.8% -- it last fell below that level in 1974.
Markets appear set for another brutal session -- European bourses are opening as much as 1% lower. 
Investors will keep a close watch on U.S. ""real"" interest rates; deeply negative rates have made stock market investments a no-brainer. Now though, real 10-year rates (after inflation is stripped out) are now steadily climbing toward 0%, a level last touched in 2020.

-Australia business conditions surge in March, inflation runs hot
-UK jobless rate falls further
-UK retailers see sales slow as cost pressures rise

- Germany ZEW index

- U.S. Treasury 10-yr bond sale

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is pulling out of the Russian market, its CEO told Reuters, going a step further than rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which said on Monday it was indefinitely suspending its business in the country. 
Hundreds of foreign companies are cutting ties with Russia following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and after Western sanctions against Moscow. 
While several sectors, including telecoms, have been exempted from some sanctions on humanitarian or related grounds, Nokia said it had decided that quitting Russia was the only option.
""We just simply do not see any possibilities to continue in the country under the current circumstances,"" CEO Pekka Lundmark said in an interview.
He added Nokia would continue to support customers during its exit, and it was not possible to say at this stage how long the withdrawal would take. 
Nokia is applying for the relevant licences to support customers in compliance with current sanctions, it said in a statement.
Both Nokia and Ericsson made a low single-digit percentage of sales in Russia, where Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) have a bigger share.
Nokia does not expect this decision to impact its 2022 outlook but said it would lead to a provision in the first quarter of about 100 million euros ($109 million).
Russia is also at loggerheads with Finland and Sweden, the home countries of Nokia and Ericsson respectively, over their interest in joining the NATO military alliance.
Russia had also been pushing for companies to start building networks using only Russian equipment, seeking to persuade Nokia and Ericsson to set up factories in the country.
Lundmark said Nokia would not implement a plan announced in November to set up a joint venture with Russia's YADRO to build 4G and 5G telecom base stations.
Nokia's decision to leave Russia will affect about 2,000 workers, and some of them might be offered work in other parts of the world, Lundmark said. 
Nokia has about 90,000 employees globally.

""A lot would have to change before it will be possible to consider again doing business in the country,"" Lundmark said.

More than 100 jobs could also disappear at Novartis's Swiss sites in Rotkreuz and Basel, the paper reported.

Novartis, which employs about 108,000 people worldwide, said last week it was integrating its pharmaceuticals and oncology units into an innovative medicines (IM) business to simplify its structure, targeting savings of at least $1 billion by 2024.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Just Eat Takeaway.com, Europe's largest online food ordering service, said on Tuesday it will partner with supermarket operator Ahold's flagship Dutch Albert Heijn chain to deliver groceries and convenience products.
Financial terms were not disclosed. 
While a tie up between the country's biggest food delivery service and its biggest grocer had seemed logical, Ahold also operates its own grocery delivery service, as well as e-commerce site Bol.com, which is more popular than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Netherlands.
The companies said the partnership will focus on a smaller range of around 1,200 products, with a focus on fresh produce and convenience products -- items that usually have higher margins.
""Fast grocery"" services such as Gorillas, Flink and Getir saw blistering growth in the Netherlands during the coronavirus pandemic.
However in recent months, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other major cities have imposed bans on new distribution centres, the ""dark stores"" they rely on, in residential areas.

Ahold and Takeaway said they would target a 30 minute delivery time for orders, slightly longer than the 10 or 15 minutes promised by some of the fast grocery startups.
Takeaway shares, which have lost two-thirds of their value since October 2020, were trading flat at 30.50 euros at 0709 GMT.

Givaudan and its peers have limited exposure to Russia and Ukraine, including for ingredients coming from these countries, but are pushing through price increases to make up for higher raw material and energy costs.
""With higher input costs in 2022, the company is continuing to implement price increases in collaboration with its customers to fully compensate for the increases in input costs,"" the Swiss group said in a statement.
Sales at its taste & wellbeing business increased by 6.4%, while sales of its fragrance & beauty unit that faced a tougher comparison base were up 2.7%.
It saw strong demand for its fine fragrances for perfumes as well as for flavours for beverages, dairy and snacks, while sales of fragrances for consumer products like toothpaste or soap decreased after benefiting strongly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group said.
Givaudan confirmed its mid-term target of 4-5% underlying sales growth and free cash flow of at least 12% on average over a five-year cycle. Group sales were 1.78 billion Swiss francs ($1.91 billion), a 6.4% rise in Swiss francs.

Germany's Symrise said last month it was eyeing acquisitions and expected sales to grow by 5-7% this year on a like-for-like basis. U.S.-based IFF announced price increases across all divisions last month.

Investing.com -- EasyJet (LON:EZJ) said Tuesday it has experienced a ""strong, sustained recovery"" in bookings since the U.K. lifted its COVID-19 restrictions but still expects to have lost over half a billion pounds in the six months through March.
Europe's second biggest discount flyer said that bookings over the last six weeks have run ahead of the same period in 2019, the last comparable period before the outbreak of the pandemic and that it expects to fly at nearly 90% of its capacity over the current quarter and at close to its pre-pandemic capacity in the summer quarter.
The company was able to record a steady improvement in operations throughout the quarter as the wave of Omicron-variant COVID-19 swept through Europe before starting to ebb at the end of January. Load factor increased from 68% in January to 81% in both February and March.
The total number of passengers flown was over nine times the level of a year ago, at 11.545 million, while the company also succeeded in squeezing more revenue out of each booking by selling ancillary services such as vacations and car rentals. Ancillary revenue per seat sold rose to 19.56 pounds in the first half from 12.47 a year earlier.
Even so, the toll taken by COVID over the winter is high. The company said it expects a net loss for the first half of its fiscal year of between 535 million and 565 million pounds ($696 million-$736 million).
In contrast to rival Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ), EasyJet has no direct exposure to routes into and out of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. But while its exposure to that risk is minimal, it can't escape the problem of higher fuel costs that are affecting all airlines right now. 
The airline said it has hedged nearly two-thirds of its fuel requirements for the next six months at a price of around $571 a metric ton ($78.11 a barrel). That compares to a spot price for jet fuel of $1,100 currently. Crude oil has traded well above $100/barrel since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, it's hedging for the periods beyond September is much lower, at only 42% for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 15% for the second half. Since currently c.64% hedged for fuel in H2 of FY22 at c.US$571 per metric ton, c.42% hedged for H1 FY23 at c.US$654, and c.15% hedged for H2 FY23 at c.US$766."

Eugene Leow, a strategist at DBS Bank, said an unrelenting rise in the dollar rates due to a restrictive Federal Reserve affected Asian bonds last month. 
""With U.S. rates no longer low in absolute terms, there are collateral damage to EM/Asia government bonds,"" he said.
The U.S. dollar index jumped 1.7% last month, posting its biggest gain in four months, on expectations of two half-point rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year. 
The Fed raised its interest rates for the first time in three years last month. 
Foreigners sold Indonesian bonds worth $3.37 billion and Thai bonds worth $3.08 billion last month.

Malaysian bonds and Indian bonds also faced outflows of $958 million and $741 million, respectively. 
Meanwhile, South Korean bonds saw inflows of $279 million, the lowest since December 2020.
South Korea has raised interest rates three times since August last year, and some analysts expect more such tightening measures from Asian central banks to counter foreign outflows this year. 
""With inflationary pressures rising due to elevated commodity prices, Asian central banks are increasingly mulling rate hikes,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ Bank. ""This, coupled with the Fed about to embark on quantitative tightening, will keep portfolio flows in the region volatile in the near term.""

China will encourage social security funds, pension funds, insurers, trust firms and wealth management firms to allocate more money to equity assets, and invest more in quality listed companies, the CSRC added. 
The government will also improve the financing mechanism for private companies, and support corporate fundraising, acquisitions and restructurings in areas badly hit by COVID. 
BOOST CONFIDENCE
To boost investor confidence, CSRC said it will encourage listed firms to buy back their shares to stabilise prices. Major shareholders and senior executives are also encouraged to actively buy shares when prices fall sharply.
Meanwhile, state shareholders should actively buy undervalued stocks, and support share buy-back and cash dividend plans by listed firms, according to the statement, which was jointly published by the CSRC, China's state assets supervisor, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
China is also stepping up efforts to woo foreign investors, amid signs of capital outflows. 
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said late on Monday that it had held a virtual roadshow with nearly 200 representatives from global investors including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to promote index investments tracking China. 
The promotion came after Institute of International Finance (IIF) data showed outflows of $6.3 billion from China equities in March, and $11.2 billion out of China bonds.
""Investor sentiment toward Chinese equities remains negative amid elevated regulatory risk and concerns that the asset class provides limited hedge against stagflation risk,"" Manulife Investment Management said in a note on Tuesday.

The money manager expects slower growth in China, citing challenges including the rising economic costs of zero-COVID policies, which damp consumption.
Also citing the ""substantial"" costs of China's strategy to fight COVID, Nomura said late on Monday China is facing a rising risk of recession.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning and bonds extended a selloff, which left the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield at the highest since 2018. Investors continue to monitor high inflation, tighter monetary policy, and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.32% by 10:41 PM ET (2:41 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.93%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.58%, with the National Australia Bank business confidence index for March 2022 at 16.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.11%. The country approved the first batch of new video game licenses since July 2021.
U.S. Treasuries fell, with the 10-year yield at 2.80% and reflecting expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten its monetary policy at the fastest rate since 1994. Australian and New Zealand debt also fell.
Oil erased most of its gains sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and lockdowns in China are also impacting fuel demand. Investors also await the U.S. consumer price index, due later in the day.
“What we’re faced with this year is stagflation,” Bulltick LLC head of global macro research Kathryn Rooney Vera told Bloomberg.
“It’s a very complicated environment that the Fed has found itself in” and the market is pricing in potentially 50 basis points of interest rate hikes at each of the next two policy meetings, she added.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said an accelerated pace of rate hikes to combat inflation is worth debating. The central bank is doing all it can to avoid “collateral damage” from raising interest rates, a “brute-force tool” that can act as a “hammer” on the economy, Fed Governor Christopher Waller added.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin will speak later in the day, followed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker following on Thursday.
One of the more dangerous scenarios for markets “is that we have to raise rates at such a pace that it will clamp down on growth,” AlphaSimplex Group chief research strategist Kathryn Kaminski told Bloomberg.
“That’s the scenario that most people are worried about.”

The National Press and Publication Administration published a list of 45 domestic titles on its website late Monday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. While leaders Tencent and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. were noticeably absent from a lineup of mostly casual games, the long-awaited resumption in licensing quelled investors’ worst fears about Beijing’s intentions for the gaming sector, which had come under fire for encouraging addiction and undesirable behavior among youths.
Analysts expect Tencent and NetEase to eventually get games approved. During a previous major suspension in 2018, Tencent was also excluded from the first crop of licensed titles.
Tencent gained the most in about three weeks in Hong Kong on an intraday basis. Video and game streaming service Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. soared as much as 15%, while NetEase gained more than 6%. Video platform  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) Ltd. rose 2.4% in U.S. trade.
“The resumption of game approval is a positive development to China’s games industry,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a note. It “will help boost investor confidence that the government remains supportive of cultural and innovative aspects of the games industry and could signal resumption of a more regular approval process.”

Beijing’s far-reaching tech crackdown -- which has ensnared sectors from e-commerce to fintech and even online education -- spread to online gaming in August, when regulators introduced stringent measures capping play time for minors and imposed new requirements aimed at curbing addiction. 
The media watchdog has also been reviewing new titles to determine whether they meet stricter criteria around content and child protection, an effort that’s slowed rollouts, Bloomberg News has reported.
The titles approved Monday were only from domestic companies, including a Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). game, XD Inc.’s “Flash Party” and iDreamSky Technology Holdings Ltd.’s “Watch Out For Candles.” The line-up also included 37 Interactive Entertainment and Youzu Interactive Co.
Of the 45 approved titles, five are for PC, one for the Nintendo  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) console, and the rest are mobile games. Many of them appear to be casual games with lower player spending.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",Elon Musk drops Twitter board seat in new U-turn,"By Abinaya V and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk disclosed on Monday he had abandoned a plan to join  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s board just as his tenure was about to start, the latest move by the world's richest man that defied corporate America's norms.
Musk revealed last week he had accepted a board seat at Twitter, contradicting a regulatory filing he had published a day earlier in which he described himself as a passive investor.
Sources told Reuters at the time that Musk asked Twitter for a board seat weeks before the social media company agreed to the arrangement. 
Musk and Twitter did not disclose the reason for the u-turn. Musk said in a regulatory filing on Monday he could now increase his 9.1% stake in Twitter or push the company to pursue transactions, even though he has no such plans at this time. 
There was no sign that Twitter was worried that a hostile bid from Musk was imminent. In announcing the development, Twitter disclosed no shareholder rights plan, known as a ""poison pill,"" that would force dilution if Musk tried to raise his stake above a certain threshold.
However, Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal warned Twitter employees in a tweet on Sunday of ""distractions ahead,"" a possible reference to Musk's criticism of the company through tweets. He added that he believed Musk's withdrawal was ""for the best.""
A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Twitter shares were up 2.6% at $47.48 in afternoon trading in New York on Monday. They are up more than 20% since Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter on April 4. Wall Street analysts say Musk's involvement attracted legions of retail investors to the stock.
Securities experts have pointed out that by delaying and mischaracterizing the disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk bought the shares more cheaply, saving himself $143 million by one estimate. It is unclear whether this would be a consideration for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $274 billion.
Musk could not be reached for comment.
Musk deleted on Monday many of the tweets he posted over the weekend about the social media platform. It was not clear what prompted the move. The tweets ranged from a call to remove advertising on Twitter to dropping the letter ""w"" in the social media company's name.
Jacob Frenkel, a former enforcement attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said Musk's reversal was unconventional but did not appear to violate any rules.
""Merely being extended an offer to join the offer to board, contemplating doing so and deciding not to is not a violation of securities laws,"" said Frenkel.
A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.
Other experts pointed out that Musk's public criticism of Twitter would have been difficult to reconcile with his fiduciary duties as a board director.
""Once on the board, most people, including activist shareholders, traditionally don't talk publicly,"" said Gregory Taxin, managing director of activist investor advisory firm Spotlight Advisors.
'FUNDING SECURED'
It is not the first time that Musk performed a high-profile U-turn. In 2018, he tweeted that there was ""funding secured"" for a $72-billion deal to take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private, but did not move ahead with an offer.
He and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors. Musk has since challenged an agreement he entered into with the SEC for some of his tweets to be vetted by a lawyer.
Securities experts have also questioned Musk's compliance with his arrangement with the SEC. In early November, Musk posted on Twitter that he would offload 10% of his Tesla stake if users approved. A majority did, and the poll sent Tesla shares into a slump. Musk has since sold $16.4 billion of Tesla stock.
News of Musk taking a board seat last week had some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media company's ability to moderate content, company sources told Reuters.
Charles Elson, founding director at the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, said Tesla, an electric car marker, and SpaceX, a space rocket developer, were already keeping Musk very busy, and he would have had little time to contribute to Twitter meaningfully as a board director.

""The shareholders of Tesla should be quite concerned about his involvement here because it simply takes time and energy away from his primary venture,"" Elson said.
A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) met on Monday to seek an end to a three-week-old strike by 500 workers at the company's Richmond, California, refinery, a union official said. 
B.K. White, first vice president of USW Local 12-5, said the union had received a proposal from the company and was preparing a reply.
Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich did not reply to a request for comment. 
Monday's meeting is the first face-to-face discussion between the two sides in two weeks.
Chevron has continued operating the 245,271-barrel-per-day (bpd) with managers and supervisors but has begun advertising for temporary replacement workers in ads placed online. 
The ads list pay of $70 an hour for the temporary replacement workers who will be hired for up to five months, according to the advertisements.
""Our personnel working onsite are being compensated appropriately for their time and expertise,"" Kruzich said prior to the meeting between the two sides. 
The national average pay for a union refinery worker after four years is about $45 an hour, the USW has said. 
""They are throwing money at the scabs trying to break our union,"" White said.

Retirees, former employees and recent graduate of process operations programs are among those usually recruited to be temporary replacement workers.
The strike began after the Local 12-5 twice rejected contract offers from Chevron.

The tools will be available initially to a handpicked set of users who are creating virtual classes, games and fashion accessories within the company's immersive platform, which is accessible via VR headsets, Meta said in a statement.
Using one tool, those select users will be able to sell their accessories or offer paid access to specialized digital spaces they have built, the company said.
The social media giant is also testing out a ""creator bonus"" program for a small set of Horizon Worlds users in the United States, through which it will pay participants each month for using new features the company launches.
""We want there to just be tons of awesome worlds, and in order for that to happen there needs to be a lot of creators who can support themselves and make this their job,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conversation with early adopters, held inside Horizon Worlds using avatars.
The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play. 

The company is competing with up-and-coming virtual world players where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold as non-fungible tokens, or blockchain-based virtual assets. The market for these assets exploded last year, with sales sometimes fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Meta's Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 08:05PM ET</span>",Hedge funds eye U.S. bond boost after bruising Q1: McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -For the U.S. bond market, the first quarter was marked by historically high volatility and the poorest performance in decades. Hedge funds scored badly, and will be hoping for a better showing in the second quarter.
U.S. futures market positioning in the first week of the new quarter showed that funds generally got it right on the move up in short-dated rates and yields, but didn't anticipate the spike higher in the 10-year yield.
It was a mixed bag on the relative value trade between two- and 10-year Treasuries, the closely watched ""2s/10s"" yield curve. The curve flattening that funds positioned for came to pass, but only briefly.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed that funds cut their net short 10-year Treasuries position in the week to April 5 by 113,682 contracts to 362,875, and increased their net short position in two-year bonds to 72,194 contracts from 59,202.
That was essentially a bet on the 10-year yield falling, and the two-year yield rising. 
The 10-year yield rose to 2.55% from 2.40% in that week and has continued to soar, reaching a three-year high on Monday of 2.77%. The two-year cash yield jumped by around 30 basis points to 2.60% in the week to April 5. 
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
Taken together, these CFTC position shifts were a collective bet on a flatter ""2s/10s"" curve. The curve inverted by as much as 8 basis points on April 4 before rapidly steepening to +20 bps a few days later. 
Q1 CURVE TRADES CRUSHED 
Hedge funds often take long-term directional bets and thrive on the arbitrage opportunities created by rising volatility. While funds seemed to get it at least partially right as the second quarter started, with regard to their Treasuries bets, the first quarter was extremely challenging.
Industry data provider HFR said on Friday its Relative Value Fixed Income-Sovereign Index lost 2.66% in the first quarter, the worst performance for two years and a stark contrast to the 7.71% surge in its broader Macro Index.
Comparing the shifts in CFTC Treasuries futures positioning in the January-March period with moves in U.S. yields shows that funds got the directional bets on higher yields right, but were crushed on their curve trades.
Funds increased their 10-year bond net short position by almost 265,000 contracts and their two-year net short position by 147,000 contracts, effectively a bet that the 10-year yield would rise by more than the two-year yield.
The 10-year yield rose around 83 bps in the quarter, but the two-year yield surged 160 bps, the biggest quarterly rise in over 40 years. The curve flattened by 77 bps, the most since 2011.
The overwhelming consensus now is that the Fed is about to undertake the most aggressive policy tightening in decades via steep interest rate hikes and a rapid reduction of its balance sheet.
So where does the curve go from here? 
Analysts at Citi note a fairly substantial amount of easing is already priced into U.S. money markets from the expected peak in rates in the second half of next year, suggesting there may be limited room for the curve to flatten further. 
But analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) argue that an inverted yield curve ""is here to stay,"" without necessarily flagging recession ahead. 
If a clear trend emerges over the course of the quarter, funds will be hoping they are on the right side of it this time.

West Texas Intermediate futures rose around 1% to trade above $95 a barrel. Shanghai has eased lockdowns for some housing complexes, though authorities indicated they would reimpose restrictions if cases climb. The southern city of Guangzhou is also taking measures to prevent a flare-up. Oil has now almost given up all its gains since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The oil market has seen a tumultuous period of trading since late February, whipsawed by Russia’s invasion of its neighbor, rising tensions in the Middle East, the virus flare-up in China and tightening monetary policy. The war in Ukraine has entered its second month despite efforts to agree a cease-fire.
The invasion has fanned inflation and prompted the U.S. and its allies to release strategic reserves to tame rising energy prices. OPEC’s top diplomat, meanwhile, told European Union officials that the current crisis in global oil markets caused by Russia’s war is beyond the group’s control. 
Brent remains in a bullish backwardation structure -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- but it’s eased over the past week. The prompt timespread for the global benchmark was 21 cents a barrel in backwardation on Monday, compared with $1.53 a week ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett needed just two weeks to put together Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's $11.6 billion takeover of Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, its largest acquisition in six years, even as he balked at paying the insurer's banking fee, a regulatory filing on Monday shows.
Alleghany said its Chief Executive Officer Joseph Brandon met with Buffett for dinner in New York City on March 7, where after some ""casual conversation"" Buffett offered $850 per share in cash for the company, less the fee for bankers at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Five days later, Brandon and Alleghany Chairman Jefferson Kirby (NYSE:KEX) met Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, where Kirby asked Buffett to make a higher offer, pay Goldman's $27 million fee, or use Berkshire stock to fund part of the purchase.
""Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points,"" the filing said.
Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, ultimately agreed to pay $848.02 per share, with the $1.98 difference from $850 accounting for Goldman's fee.
The merger was announced on March 21. Alleghany got 25 days to potentially find a better offer. Goldman has since asked 31 potential bidders about their interest, the filing said. The ""go-shop"" period ends on April 14.
Brandon led Berkshire's General Re unit from 2001 to 2008.
Buffett, 91, has long objected to the costs of doing business on Wall Street.
He rarely uses investment banks at Berkshire, relying on 98-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for help in major capital decisions.
Buffett has praised former Goldman banker Byron Trott, working with him on purchases of food distributor McLane Co from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and a large stake in truck stop operator Pilot Flying J from the family of billionaire Jimmy Haslam.

The Alleghany purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals.
Berkshire's last major acquisition was the $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016.

Florida previously reached $878 million in settlements with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, Abbvie Inc's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc. 
Steven Derringer, Walgreen's attorney, said in his opening statement that the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions from doctors and did not ignore red flags that allowed opioids to flood Florida.
""There are so many pills because doctors have written so many prescriptions for pain medicine,"" Derringer said.
Florida has spent more than $14 billion to address the opioid crisis in the state, and opioid overdoses have caused nearly 40,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, Webster told jurors. 
Walgreens deserves a ""huge chunk of the blame"" for overdose deaths and the state's increased spending, Webster said.
Derringer countered that others should be blamed for the state's opioid epidemic including drug manufacturers who lied to pharmacies about addiction risk, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials who approved the sale of opioids for chronic pain and doctors who wrote unnecessary prescriptions. 
Florida has collected more than $3 billion in opioid litigation against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies, according to Attorney General Ashley Moody. Most will be spent on efforts to mitigate the opioid crisis in the state.
In March, Walgreens rival CVS Health Corp agreed to pay Florida $484 million. Drugmakers Teva will pay $194.8 million, Allergan will pay $134.2 million and Endo will pay $65 million.
Walgreens previously argued it was immune from being sued based on a mere $3,000 settlement it reached with Florida in 2012, following an investigation into its record-keeping policies and efforts to prevent the diversion of opioid drugs.

Byrd ruled in March that the 2012 settlement addressed only a single record-keeping violation and did not protect Walgreens from other claims. The company has appealed her ruling.
While a large portion of the more than 500,000 U.S. deaths from overdoses in the past two decades were caused by the powerful opioid fentanyl and other illicit drugs, overuse of prescription pain medicines put countless Americans on the path to addiction.

Investing.com - Dow futures moved slightly higher in overnight trading on Monday, following declines among major benchmark averages during regular trade as U.S. Treasury yields surged ahead of fresh inflation data set to be released on Tuesday.
At 6:30pm E.T (10:30pm GMT), Dow Jones Futures, S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures were each trading 0.1% higher.
The overnight moves come as investors await the release of March’s highly anticipated consumer price index on Tuesday with market analysts expecting the highest annual increase in prices since December 1981 amid rising food costs, rents and energy prices.
Investors are also looking ahead to the start of earnings season on Wednesday with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) set to report earnings results, followed by several big banks on Thursday.
During regular trading on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 413.04 points or 1.19% to 34,308.09, the S&P 500 fell 75.73 points or 1.69% to 4,412.53 and the NASDAQ Composite retreated 299.04 points or 2.18% to 13,411.96.
Technology companies suffered as market participants rotated into safer assets amid surging bond yields. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.2%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 3.9%, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dipped 2.6%, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost 2.4% and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shed 5.2%.
Energy companies also retreated amid easing Oil prices as lockdowns in China threaten to curb demand. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) fell 6.3%,   Diamondback Energy Inc   (NASDAQ:FANG) lost 4.9%,   Exxon Mobil   Corp (NYSE:XOM) shed 3.4%,   Chevron   Corp (NYSE:CVX) dipped 2.6% and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) declined 4.9%.
Meantime, U.S. bond yields continued to rise as investors digested the Fed’s plans to tighten monetary policy settings. The United States 10-Year yield was near its highest levels since January 2019 at 2.774%.  "

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Sachem Head on Monday cut its slate of director nominees at US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Co to five from seven, backing away from plans to try and take control of the food distributor's board.
The hedge fund, US Foods' biggest shareholder with an 8.7% stake, announced the move in a regulatory filing less than two weeks after the company appointed two new independent directors to persuade investors it was pursuing the right strategy.
Sachem Head, which has been invested in US Foods since 2018, did not say which of its director nominees have been cut or which US Foods board members it hopes to replace with its own candidates at the annual meeting.
The hedge fund said it ""reevaluated"" the optimal number of directors it needs to nominate to push for the change it believes is needed for the company to ""begin to fulfill its potential."" Investors will vote for directors at the annual meeting on May 18 unless a settlement is reached beforehand.
The hedge fund's original nominees included Scott Ferguson, Sachem Head's portfolio manager, as well as former Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees and other executives with supply chain and food industry expertise.
Ferguson began pushing for changes last year and has said he believes the company is lagging peers and has not improved operations as promised.
The two sides have held discussions to try and resolve the boardroom battle, and Ferguson late last month made a settlement proposal that the company rejected, according to a regulatory filing made by the company on Monday.
Sachem Head offered to end the proxy contest in return for four board seats and a public announcement that US Foods was searching for a new chief executive officer or was exploring strategic alternatives, the company's filing said.
In early April, the company proposed handing two seats to Sachem Head, picking the directors from the hedge fund's slate. It also offered forming a committee to assess ways to boost the share price, and insisted on a standstill agreement. In an earlier effort to settle the matter, the company had already offered two seats, one to a Sachem Head nominee, and one to a director the two sides picked jointly while rejecting the possibility of adding Hees to the board. 
The company's share price closed up 2.30% at $36.05 on Monday.

(Reuters) -New York pension officials on Monday said they will support shareholder resolutions filed at major banks seeking quick cuts to financing of new fossil fuel development, pushing climate issues to the fore of another springtime shareholder meeting season.
Shareholders should support resolutions filed at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and four other banks ""in order to mitigate the systemic risks posed by unfettered climate change,"" according to a statement sent by a representative of New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees some $280 billion in retirement assets.
Backing from the third-largest U.S. public retirement system will boost prospects of the resolutions from green-minded investors including the Sierra Club Foundation and Trillium Asset Management. 
Effectively, the nonbinding proposals call for banks to end development of new fossil fuel projects in line with calls this year from global watchdog the International Energy Agency (IEA).
So far, banks have opposed the resolutions. In a securities filing Bank of America said its board ""believes the policy requested by the proposal is unnecessary in light of our commitment to financing a low-carbon environment, our robust risk management programs and policies, and our net zero commitment.""
Goldman Sachs said in another filing that given its investments in decarbonization and transition finance, its stakeholders ""are better served by our engagement, not our divestment.""

Influential proxy adviser Glass Lewis so far has recommended investors vote ""against"" the resolutions, saying the banks have been responsive to climate concerns. 
In another report Glass Lewis also wrote that expanded fossil fuel development is likely as result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Shareholders may be reluctant to limit Bank of America’s ability to participate in such projects in the current geopolitical context,"" Glass Lewis said.

(Reuters) - Daily Journal Corp, the publishing and software company where Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger helps oversee investments and until recently was chairman, on Monday said it halved its investment in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
In a regulatory filing, the Los Angeles-based company said it owned 300,000 of Alibaba's American depositary shares (""ADS"")worth $32.6 million as of March 31, down from 602,060 shares at the end of 2021.
The reduction essentially reversed Daily Journal's trading activity in last year's fourth quarter, when its Alibaba stake nearly doubled in size.
The price of Alibaba's ADS has fallen 15% this year, and 68% from its October 2020 peak.
Daily Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company publishes newspapers and provides software to courthouses.
Munger, 98, had been Daily Journal's chairman for 45 years before stepping down last month.
Daily Journal said he would remain a director and focus on matters he has worked on, including its securities portfolio. Munger is better known for his work at Berkshire, where he has been vice chairman since 1978 and helps the 91-year-old Buffett allocate capital.
Long bullish on China, Munger spearheaded Berkshire's approximately 7% stake in electric car maker BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF).
At Daily Journal's annual meeting in February, Munger lamented recent deterioration in relations between the United States and China.

""They should like us and we should like them,"" he said.
Most of the rest of Daily Journal's securities portfolio is in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which is also a major Berkshire investment, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.

(Reuters) -Private equity firm Thoma Bravo will acquire SailPoint Technologies for $6.12 billion, the cybersecurity firm said on Monday, in the latest deal that underscores the heightened interest in the security software market. 
In buying Austin, Texas-based SailPoint, Thoma Bravo will bolster its strength in the security-focused space, where it already has key investments in firms including Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) Inc, Barracuda Networks and Sophos. 
Shares of SailPoint, founded in 2005, closed at $64.05 on Monday, a 29% jump from Friday. 
Cybersecurity has been a hot sector for buyouts thanks to a COVID-19 pandemic-led shift to remote working as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has led to a spike in cyberattacks. Datto, a security solutions provider, has also been taken private in a $6.2 billion deal by investors led by Insight Partners on Monday. 
Thoma Bravo, which manages more than $103 billion in assets, was the majority stakeholder in SailPoint prior to its initial public offering in 2017. It exited from its position by the end of 2018. 
SailPoint shareholders will receive $65.25 per share in cash, the company said on Monday, representing a premium of 31.6% as of Friday close. Including debt, the deal is valued at about $6.9 billion. 
Sources said the deal could help SailPoint accelerate its transition to a software as a service (SaaS) model without the scrutiny of being a public company, and fund potential transformative acquisitions with the dry powder from Thoma Broavo. 
SailPoint's Chief Executive Officer Mark McClain said the go-private deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, would allow the company to pursue long-term growth with greater flexibility and expand their markets on the back of additional capital from the private equity firm.

""We're about 10% penetrated in our target market. We have a lot of room to grow in terms of what we add to our portfolio,"" McClain said. 
SailPoint specializes in software related to identity and access management that helps businesses mitigate unwanted user access and reduce the risk of sensitive data leakage. SailPoint shares had lost about 9.2% in 2021.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 05:27PM ET</span>","U.S. yields jump to 3-year highs, stocks slide on CPI outlook","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell on Monday, pulled lower by technology shares in Europe and on Wall Street, as U.S. Treasury yields jumped ahead of inflation data that could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten policy enough to slow a rebounding economy.
The euro rose against the dollar to snap a seven-day losing streak as the single currency rallied after French leader Emmanuel Macron beat far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in France's first round of presidential voting on Sunday.
The dollar held just below almost two-year highs against a basket of currencies and strengthened against the Japanese yen, up 0.88%, and versus the commodity currencies - the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose more than 7 basis points to 2.793%, the highest level since January 2019. 
Yields have surged in anticipation of Fed rate hikes, which Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation at SLC Management, expects to be by 50 basis points at each of the Fed's next three policy meetings.
""The Fed is going to move aggressively. The market has appropriately priced it in,"" Mullarkey said. 
""They don't want to be an issue in the midterms,"" Mullarkey added, referring to elections in November that will determine whether Republicans can wrest control from President Joe Biden's Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. ""They also do not want to be in the position where they don't have inflation under control."" 
Economists polled by Reuters forecast the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) on Tuesday would post an 8.4% year-over-year increase in March. Separately, they also saw the probability of a recession next year at 40%.
Technology shares, which have been underpinned by record low interest rates, fell 2% in Europe and 2.6% on Wall Street.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.33% and the pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.59% as regional bourses fell with the exception of France's CAC 40.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.19%, the S&P 500 lost 1.69% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.18%. All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell.
Volatility gripped French blue chips on the outlook for a tight Macron-Le Pen race in the final round of voting. French assets have underperformed as markets are uneasy about Le Pen's agenda of protectionism, tax cuts and nationalization. 
The CAC 40 index, which is off 1.5% so far in April as the STOXX 600 gains about 0.4%, closed up 0.12%. 
""I don't expect the French equity markets to rally until we have the second round - we expect a lot of volatility and range-bound trading,"" said Mathieu Racheter, head of equity strategy at Julius Baer. ""It is really a close call in the runoff.""
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.6% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slid 0.61%.
Oil prices dropped by $4 a barrel, with Brent tumbling below $100 on plans to release record volumes of crude from strategic reserves and on continuing COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
U.S. crude futures fell $3.97 to settle at $94.29 a barrel while Brent settled down $4.30 at $98.48.
Palladium steadied after jumping as much as 5% on supply concerns following a recent suspension on trading of the metal sourced from Russia in the London metals hub, while gold was buoyed by inflation fears.
U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,948.20 an ounce.
Bitcoin fell 5.66% to $39,748.60.
China's inflation figures surprised on the high side on Monday although they were still relatively modest at 1.5% year-on-year in March.

But that still saw yields on China's 10-year government bonds fall below U.S. Treasury yields for the first time in 12 years on Monday.

(Reuters) - California utility PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp has reached settlement agreements with district attorneys representing Northern California counties to avoid prosecution over two major wildfires, with the company agreeing to pay $55 million.
""As a result of these agreements, no criminal charges will be filed in the Dixie Fire (2021), and the criminal complaint regarding the Kincade Fire (2019) will be dismissed,"" the company said in a statement on Monday.
The financial commitments within the agreements total $55 million over five years, and PG&E will not seek recovery of these costs from customers, it added.
PG&E did not admit wrongdoing in the settlements reached with prosecutors for the 2021 Dixie Fire and the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County.
The Dixie fire, ranked as the second-largest California wildfire on record, scorched through Northern California communities and forests in August, forcing thousands to flee from their homes and prompted precautionary power shutdowns. PG&E had said the blaze may have started when a tree fell onto one of the utility's power cables.
The Kincade wildfire in California's wine country in 2019 that forced some 2,000 people to flee homes was caused by PG&E's electrical transmission lines, the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in 2020.
PG&E entered agreements with Butte, Lassen, Plumas, Shasta, Sonoma and Tehama counties to strengthen wildfire safety and response programs and to work with local organizations affected by the fires to help rebuild impacted communities, the company said on Monday.

The utility emerged from bankruptcy in 2020. It had sought protection from creditors after wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 drove the utility's potential liabilities into tens of billions of dollars. 
Late last year, PG&E said it had received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office seeking documents from the Californian utility related to the Dixie Fire.

Investing.com – Stocks sank on Monday as rising Treasury yields– which move inverse to price– sent tech shares tumbling.
Investors are bracing for tomorrow’s release of inflation data for March, which is widely expected to show price gains running their hottest in four decades.
Still, the job market is also at multi-decade highs, in terms of the economy being at full employment, as the economy recovers from the pandemic era shutdowns.
Tomorrow’s data release is the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting, when it is expected to raise rates by a half point, rather than its customary quarter-point move.
Oil is down around $94 a barrel, which could be a sign the inflationary pressures of the last few months could be nearing a peak. If energy prices fall far enough, that will eventually work its way through prices for fuel and consumer goods.
Also this week, a spate of big company earnings as first quarter reporting season kicks off. Big banks are due starting Wednesday and other S&P 500 companies are on the agenda.
The U.S. stock market is closed Friday for the holiday weekend, so investors are looking at an abbreviated trading week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Consumer prices
The US will report CPI data on Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET. For the year-over-year comparison, it is expected to show a gain of 8.4% after a 7.9% gain in February.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 03:45PM ET</span>","Benettons, Blackstone to launch bid for Atlantia this week - sources","By Francesca Landini and Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) -The Benettons and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are aiming to launch a takeover offer for Italy's Atlantia this week without involving directly other partners for now, two sources close to the matter said on Monday.
One of the sources said the bid could be announced before Saturday, as the two partners rush for taking the Italian infrastructure group private after an unsolicited approach by a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield.
Benettons' holding company Edizione, which controls Atlantia with a 33% stake, and Blackstone are expected to set up a new company that will launch the offer for the infrastructure group, the sources said.
Edizione will have the majority of the ""Newco,"" with Blackstone holding the rest, other partners could follow at a later stage, the sources said.
Speculation over an incoming bid for the group has pushed the stock briefly above 22 euros on Friday, valuing it more than 48 billion euros ($52 billion) including net debt worth 30 billion euros. 
Atlantia, which operates airports in Italy and France along with motorways in Europe and Latin America, will pocket 8 billion euros next month from the sale of its Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia.
This transaction, designed to end a political dispute over the collapse of a bridge operated by Autostrade, has made Atlantia cash-rich, attracting suitors.
In March, GIP, Brookfield and Spain's ACS approached the Benettons with a proposal to buy the infrastructure group, they said last week.
According to the sources, the two funds also courted Italian banking foundation CRT and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, two long-time investors in Atlantia which own 4.5% and 8.3% respectively in the group, but were rebuffed.
CRT and GIC could have a role in Edizione-Blackstone's project for Atlantia at a later stage, one of the sources said.
""Edizione and Blackstone are not currently discussing any plan to involve GIP and Brookfield in their bid,"" one of the sources said. 

CRT declined to comment; GIC, Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield was not immediately available to comment.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Monday, paced by a tech-led slump as surging U.S. Treasury yields kept the pressure on growth sectors of the market including tech.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.1%, or 375 points, the Nasdaq slipped 2.0%.
Technology stocks, which snapped a three-week winning streak last week, started the week on the back foot, as Treasury yields continued to rack up gains on expectations of a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening next month.
“U.S. bond yields are on the rise as investors continue to digest the Fed’s more hawkish position. As a result, the 10-year yield has pushed from 2.40% to 2.74% in the past week,” Stifel said in a note.
The Fed’s plan to curb inflation will come under added scrutiny on Tuesday as the U.S. is expected report that the pace of inflation in March rose at annual rate of 8.4%, a four-decade high.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), down more than 3%, led the decline in big tech after UBS estimated that Office 365, the tech giant's second-biggest business, will likely see declining growth ahead as the boost from the pandemic and work from home trend fades.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down more than 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, bucked the trend lower after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk made a u-turn on a decision to join the social media's board, paving the way for Musk to buy more shares of Twitter. Joining the board of Twitter, would have limited Musk to owning no more than 14.9% of the company.  
Semiconductor stocks also pressured the broader tech sector as sentiment on chipmakers was hurt after Baird downgraded Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to neutral from outperform and cut its price target on the stock to $225 from $360, sending its shares down more than 5%.
Baird flagged order cancellations for Nvidia’s consumer GPUs, and said the upcoming fork for cryptocurrency Ethereum could further dent demand.
Financials, mostly banks, relatively outperformed the broader market, down just 0.2%, boosted by rising yields ahead of the start of the quarterly earnings season.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reports results on Wednesday.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday.
Energy stocks were also a big drag on the broader market even as oil prices were pressured by worries about the impact on demand from lockdowns in China.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were among the biggest decliners in the sector.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors moved a step closer on Monday to a potential payout of billions of dollars in default insurance on debt issued by the Russian government and its entities as the country is on the brink of its first external default in over a century.
The EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (CDDC) ruled on Monday that state-owned Russia Railways is in default on a missed bond payment, a key step in triggering so called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) - an instrument to insure exposure to default risk.
The decision, which marked the first time a Russia-originated debt instrument has been officially classified as defaulted since the country's invasion of Ukraine, was closely watched by creditors waiting to see whether the country's sovereign external debt might follow the same path.
Only a few hours later, the same committee was asked whether a potential failure to pay occurred on hard-currency bonds issued by Russia's government.
The CDDC, whose members include some of the world's biggest investment banks, said on Monday it had decided a ""failure to pay"" credit event has occurred on Swiss franc loan participation notes linked to state-owned Russian Railways. 
The loan participation notes due 2026 were issued by RZD Capital to finance a loan of 250 million Swiss francs ($268 million) to Russian Railways. 
There are $21.1 million worth of net notional CDS across 17 contracts outstanding for Russian Railways, according to data by IHS Markit.
Western sanctions against Russia following the Ukraine invasion, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"", as well as counter measures by Moscow have imposed strains on the Russian economy and raised questions about the possible default of many bonds issued by Russian corporations. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank are some of the committee members who voted ""yes"" to the question on whether a failure to pay event occurred on Russian Railways. The committee met on Friday.
Some analysts see this as a test case on whether a solvent issuer that could not physically make the payment due to sanctions is considered in default.
""Apparently CDDC says yes... and probably means it will conclude something similar with the Russian sovereign trying to pay a USD coupon – but failing to,"" said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for UBS AG, the notes' paying agent, declined to comment. 
Russian Railways, which operates both cargo and passenger trains along thousands of miles of railway, said it had attempted to make interest payments due March 14 but was unable to do so due to ""legal and regulatory compliance obligations within the correspondent banking network,"" according to an official notice posted by the SIX Swiss Exchange and referenced in the request to the committee.
While outstanding CDS on Russian Railways are relatively limited, there are currently $3.43 billion of net notional Russia CDS to be settled, investment bank JPMorgan said in a note on Monday.
The question on the Russian sovereign debt is pending consent from the determinations committee and no date for a meeting has been set https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/cds/the-russian-federation-2, according to its website. 
Russia could face its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles last week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars.

Russia Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the country will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt.

Warner Bros Discovery shares were up 0.8% at $24.62, while AT&T stock climbed 2% to $18.62 before the bell.
AT&T and Discovery set out to create a standalone media business in May last year and the deal closed on Friday, with the new business housing channels including HBO, CNN and the Discovery Channel as well as franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"". 
The company, which also owns streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+, faces stiff competition from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.
Warner Bros Discovery is led by long-time Discovery veteran David Zaslav, and the new leadership team, announced last week, comprises many of his lieutenants.
""We expect that Zaslav will use his experience to help Warner Bros.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 02:16PM ET</span>",Ford inks Argentina lithium supply deal with Lake Resources,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it has signed a preliminary deal to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina, marking the first time the automaker has publicly announced where it will procure the electric vehicle battery metal.
The deal is a major bet by Ford on direct lithium extraction (DLE), a relatively new breed of technologies that filter the metal from brines and use far less acreage than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), BMW, Stellantis NV and other Ford rivals have inked supply deals of their own with companies planning to use DLE technology. 
Ford aims to buy 25,000 tonnes annually of the white metal from Lake's Kachi project in northern Argentina, which is being developed with privately held extraction startup Lilac Solutions Inc. 
Lilac's technology, like all DLE technologies, has yet to work commercially, though it has the support of Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and other high-profile investors.
The agreement between Lake and Ford is nonbinding and would need to be finalized to include a specific delivery timetable. 
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in February that his company was working on deals to secure supply of key raw materials for batteries such as lithium, nickel, rare earths and copper.
""This is one of several agreements we're exploring to help Ford secure raw materials to support our aggressive EV acceleration plan,"" said Ford spokesperson Jennifer Flake.
Sydney-based Lake Resources is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, which requires supply deals to be publicly disclosed.

The Kachi project, in northern Argentina near the Chilean border, is expected to cost about $540 million and open by 2024. 
Lilac's technology uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced. Lilac has said it could use a desalination plant to filter brackish water to avoid using potable water.

Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bond in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the instruments. 
Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are a way of insuring the buyer against exposure to specific risks, in this case Russia defaulting on its sovereign debt.
The process starts with a market participant, usually an investor who has bought such protection, asking the CDDC to decide whether a potential failure to pay event has happened.

If the committee decides that a credit event has happened, the payout will be triggered.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:55PM ET</span>",SocGen severs Russia ties with sale of Rosbank to oligarch Potanin,"By Tassilo Hummel
PARIS (Reuters) -French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said on Monday it would quit Russia and take a 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) income hit from selling its Rosbank unit to Interros Capital, a firm linked to Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.
Rosbank will rejoin the business empire of Potanin, the 61-year-old head of mining giant Norilsk Nickel, who has been sanctioned by Canada https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/russia_regulations-reglement_russie13.aspx?lang=eng under Western moves against Russia's business and political elite over its invasion of Ukraine.
He has not been sanctioned by the European Union or the United States. 
While financial terms of the deal were not announced, SocGen said it would write off 3.1 billion euros, comprising a 2 billion-euro hit on Rosbank's book value and the rest linked to the reversal of rouble conversion reserves.
SocGen, the first major Western bank to announce its exit from Russia, had previously flagged the risk of a write-off on its 99% stake in Rosbank. Investors said its exit from Russia removed a lot of uncertainty.
It pledged to stick to plans for a dividend and a 915 million-euro share buyback. 
Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz noted SocGen shares rallied 7% on the news, even though Russia only accounted for about 2% of SocGen's earnings.
""It shows what discount the market was pricing in for potential Russian risks. This draws a line in the sand,"" he said.
SocGen ""essentially gives the business away for free,"" Scholtz said, noting the book value writedown on Rosbank.
""The only way they can do that is that if they get no material consideration,"" he added. 
Interros agreed, however, to pay off Rosbank's subordinated debt, approximately 500 million euros. 
Overall, SocGen said the exit would shave 20 basis points (bps) from its Tier 1 capital ratio - the core measure of a bank's financial strength - which stood at 13.7% at the end of 2021 or 470 bps above the minimum required.
Citi analysts said the news was ""a welcome surprise for the market, given the small capital impact and the reduction of future risk, as well as confirmation of dividend policy.""
But the sale to Potanin was not universally applauded.
""It's a bit distressing that ultimately this is an enormous gift to one of the wealthiest oligarchs,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
France's finance ministry declined to comment when asked whether the government had a role in negotiations. It declined to comment on Potanin’s status as a sanctioned individual.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation,"" has prompted a wave of foreign companies to shutter their Russian businesses. Orchestrating a complete break is, however, more difficult due to sanctions and political sensitivities.
Axiom's Legras said SocGen's Russian exit put pressure on others to act. Italy's UniCredit and Austria's Raiffeisen are still considering their futures in Russia, while U.S. bank Citi is trying to offload a consumer banking franchise. 
""The challenge in this environment is whom can you sell to? It's easier to sell at a deep discount or walk away when it's 2% of your earnings than if it is a third,"" Morningstar's Scholtz said, referring to Raiffeisen which earns almost 30% of net profits from Russia. 
Asked whether SocGen's deal meant other companies could sell their assets to Russian buyers, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This depends on the decision of an owner of a specific company which is leaving Russia"".
ORDERLY EXIT
SocGen said the deal would allow it to quit Russia in an ""an effective and orderly manner"" and ensure continuity for Rosbank's employees and clients.
Potanin's holding company had owned Rosbank from 1998, before SocGen bought a stake in 2006 and merged it with its other Russian operations in 2010. SocGen paid https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/pressrelase/06132gb.pdf $317 million for its initial 10% stake in Rosbank.
Potanin, Russia's second richest man with $27 billion worth of assets according to Forbes magazine estimates, worked in the Soviet Union's foreign trade ministry and later as a banker before establishing Interros in 1990, an umbrella for his assets which range from metals production to a ski resort.
During the 1990s, Potanin served as Russia’s first deputy Prime Minister, masterminding the first wave of privatisations of former state-owned and himself buying several large businesses, including a stake in mining giant Nornickel.
Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, Potanin said that confiscating assets from companies that had left Russia would shatter investor confidence for decades.
""The most important goal of Interros is to maintain the stability of Rosbank and create new opportunities for its clients and partners,"" Potanin said in a statement. 
Interros said the Rosbank deal should be closed in the next few weeks after all necessary regulatory approvals.

French financial watchdog AMF declined to comment.

(Reuters) -European stocks fell on Monday as surging bond yields hit technology shares and volatility gripped French blue-chip stocks on forecasts of a tight race between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the final round of the election.

(Reuters) -Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc on Monday announced a 10-for-1 split of its class A and class B stock, joining a growing list of companies that have split their shares to make them more attractive for investors.
Shopify would also seek shareholder approval to authorize and issue a new class of shares, called the Founder share, to Tobi Lutke, its chief executive officer and founder.
The proposal seeks to preserve the voting power of Lutke, as the Founder share will provide him with a variable number of votes and that combined with his previously owned shares from other classes would represent 40% of the total voting power attached to all of Shopify's outstanding shares. 
The proposal, however, said that Lutke will hold the Founder shares only until he is an executive at Shopify or a board member.
While D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Tom Forte said the brokerage is generally opposed to founder shares and believes they are not in the interest of shareholders, he said he is willing to give Lutke the benefit of doubt due to his ""superb"" track record.
""We believe it may protect the company from unwanted suitors, such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), considering the recent weakness in the (Shopify) stock,"" Forte added.
U.S.-listed shares of Shopify were marginally down at $602.61 in morning trading, while they were slightly up at C$765 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They have lost more than half their value this year.

Currently, the company's class A shares carry one vote per share and class B shares carry 10 votes per share.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. banks set for better-than-expected trading revenues,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading may be a surprise bright spot for Wall Street banks in the first quarter, after clients rejigged portfolios in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and interest rate hikes, analysts and executives say.
But quarterly results from banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will show a sharp decline in investment banking revenues and in first-quarter earnings overall. That is due to companies pausing deals until choppy equity markets stabilize. 
Coming into the year, banks had expected trading volumes to decline to levels similar to 2019, following exceptional activity in 2020 and 2021. Traders had benefited from the Federal Reserve pumping liquidity into markets to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the conflict in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" and the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes as the Fed attempts to bring inflation under control, has led to traders enjoying another bumper period.
""There's definitely been more volatility than we expected coming into the year and that volatility benefited trading businesses, particularly on the fixed income side,"" said one senior New York-based banker.
Uncertainty over the pace of interest rate hikes by central banks has stimulated rates trading, the source said.
Another senior executive at a European bank with large U.S. operations said his firm's trading businesses had enjoyed a ""pretty phenomenal quarter.""
""It was a very similar trend to what we saw in the same quarter last year in terms of volumes,"" he said.
Banks face exceptionally tough comparatives. The first quarter last year saw major equity indexes hit record highs, driving volumes. Having initially forecast sharp year-on-year declines, analysts now expect a similar performance this year.
Analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) anticipate a boost in banks' trading revenues ""that could roughly mirror the exceptional results of first-quarter 2021,"" they said in a research note.
Still, some see more headwinds. Christopher McGratty of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates an 18% decline in trading revenues.
'GOOD VOLATILITY'
Traders are hoping they continue to see ""good volatility,"" where clients are encouraged to buy and sell securities to reshape portfolios, rather than ""bad volatility,"" where liquidity dries up due to bid/ask spreads being too high.
Equity trading surged in the first quarter as the VIX - a measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks that some call Wall Street's fear gauge - spiked. Fixed-income trading ramped up as clients hedged their positions, bankers say.
Rapid shifts in asset prices can mean banks benefit from increased trading volumes as clients adjust their exposures. But they present dangers too, from counterparty risk. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) was forced to halt nickel trading earlier this month after prices doubled to more than $100,000 per tonne, a rise which sources blamed on short covering by one of the world's top producers.
The New York-based bank executive said his firm had been ""carefully monitoring"" its commodities exposures and testing the liquidity of clients on a regular basis.
Another downside for banks has been a sharp drop in investment banking fees as companies hold off on deals. M&A advisory fees are expected to drop by 30-40%, analysts say.
Equity capital markets (ECM) issuance dropped 70-80%, according to analysts. The decline in major equity indexes led to initial public offerings virtually drying up. 

Despite that, pipelines remain healthy and activity could pick up quickly when markets stabilize, bankers say. Companies could be encouraged to make acquisitions because valuations have declined from last year's highs. That could, in turn, lead to a pick-up in equity capital markets.
""The first quarter marked a significant shift in the operating environment, but we continue to see opportunity in the year ahead,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy plans to beef up its scrutiny of corporate takeovers with a new dedicated division at the cabinet office to oversee merger deals involving strategic companies, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi's 14-month old government has used so-called ""golden powers"" to set conditions on scores of mergers and has blocked several attempts by China to extend its presence in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
Now Draghi's closes aides are working to create a new Directorate-General in his office to strengthen Rome's capacity to police any changes to the ownership structure of strategic firms, the sources said, asking not to be named.
Among the tasks of the new bureau will be ""strategic analysis of what is happening in relevant markets,"" one of the sources said, adding that the restructuring will increase the staff dedicated to takeover issues. 
As part of the drive to strengthen the golden powers, the government plans to finalise by the end of May new rules forcing companies that own sensitive assets to inform it of preliminary discussions with potential suitors, the second source said.
If already in place, such a rule would have allowed the government to have a direct say over KKR's failed takeover approach for  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
The moves come after Rome introduced new measures last month requiring firms operating 5G networks to supply, on an annual basis, considerably more detailed notification to the authorities over proposed mergers and supply deals.
The government also permanently extended the special powers to cover banks and insurance companies as well as proposed takeovers of Italian companies by other EU firms.
Until former European Central Bank chief Draghi took office in Italy in February 2021, the golden power veto had been used just twice in a decade to curb foreign forays in Italy. Draghi used it four more times in just over a year, heading off as many Chinese bids.
The latest episode, last month, saw Rome annul a 2018 sale of a military drones company to Chinese investors.
However, Draghi's approach has triggered legal challenges from both foreign predators and their Italian prey. 

The notification requirements have also increased red tape for firms, which in order to avoid the risk of infractions and fines are informing the government of any mergers and deals even when it would not be necessary.
Last year the number of notifications jumped to almost 500, compared with 342 in 2020 and just 83 in 2019.

441,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 10:25AM ET</span>","UBS Cuts Alibaba Price Target on Near-term Headwinds, Remains Positive Long term","UBS analyst Jerry Liu lowered the price target on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) to $140.00 per share from $150.00 on near-term headwinds.
The lowered price target reflects lower estimates for F4Q22 (Mar Q) and FY23 to mirror “incremental Covid-19 related headwinds, on top of regulatory and macro impacts last year.”
Liu expects to see March online retail sales growth decelerating “significantly” amid a spike in Covid-19 cases across China. Hence, the near-term challenges are likely to force Alibaba to cut costs.
“This will impact supply chains and fulfillment networks, and weaken consumer demand, especially in categories like apparel. We now assume the Jun Q is the trough for Customer Management revenue (CMR) YoY growth vs. Mar Q previously, as we conservatively assume the MoM deterioration in growth near term offsets the easing YoY comparisons. There are some additional growth impacts to domestic on-demand, international e-commerce, and cloud segments, but we also see improvements later this year,” Liu said in a client note.
Still, the analyst remains positive on BABA shares.
“As consumption in China recovers later this year, we expect Alibaba's top and bottom line growth rates to accelerate.

Investing.com --  Hoth Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:HOTH) stock more than doubled in early trade on Monday after the biotech startup said that its experimental cancer treatment HT-KIT had appeared successful in killing cancerous cells and stopping tumor growth in a preclinical study.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), Hoth stock was up 110% at $1.28. However, that's still barely 20% of its value when it listed in 2019.
HT-KIT is a new molecular entity under development for treatment of mast cell-derived cancers and anaphylaxis. It has already been awarded Orphan Drug status, which will guarantee the company tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees, and seven years of patent protection if it is formally approved for use.
HT-KIT is a treatment based on messenger RNA, the same technology that is behind the COVID-19 vaccines of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
The company said that research conducted jointly with North Carolina State University showed HT-KIT can kill cancer cells and inhibit their growth within 72 hours, reducing the likelihood of tumors spreading to other organs in the body.
""With our HT-KIT drug, we are flipping off a key cancer signal that's involved in multiple aggressive cancers, such as systemic mastocytosis, mast cell leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and acute myeloid leukemia,"" CEO Robb Knie said in a statement.
He noted that the next round of preclinical studies for the drug has already started and that the company plans to brief the Food and Drug Administration on their results in the course of this year.
Hoth has already completed a manufacturing feasibility study for the drug together with China-based WuXi STA."

Heading into earnings, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan lowered the price target to $420.00 per share from $450.00 on the Neutral-rated NFLX shares to reflect lower estimates - from 21 million to 17 million for 2022 net adds - and continued margin pressure.
“In order to get more constructive on NFLX, we continue to be focused on post-pandemic normalization, a lessening of media consumption competitive intensity, clearer line of sight into more moderate content spend growth and/or sustainable FCF generation that can fund share buybacks,” Sheridan said in a client note.
Similarly, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson has reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Netflix ahead of a potentially “noisy” report. Overall, the analyst lowered 2022E/2023E EPS by 1%/6%, respectively.
“We believe 1Q paid net adds benefited from a stronger content line-up in Asia, which should partially offset a ~1M drag from Russia, resulting in our new estimate of 2.1M (prev. 2.5M). While positive, we believe further FX headwinds, inflation, and competition elevate risk to 2022E/2023E revenue/EPS. Until these pressures subside, we remain skeptical operating margin can return to ~300 bps annual expansion,” Patterson wrote in a client note.

The Detroit-based automaker said it was on track to launch more than 20 new and refreshed models in the world's biggest auto market despite the pandemic's impact.
The COVID-19 curbs introduced in China to fight the worst outbreak in two years caused auto sales in the country to plunge in March, with automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc feeling the pain of limits on production.
GM's sales fell 21.4% to 613,000 vehicles in China in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Sales of its top-selling Chevrolet brand declined nearly 20% in the same period. 
The lockdown, one of the biggest tests for China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, has forced automakers and suppliers to either try to adapt with extreme measures to keep factories running or to shut down and risk delayed shipments at a time when demand for vehicles is strong.

China's financial center of Shanghai started easing its lockdown measures in some areas on Monday despite reporting more than 25,000 new COVID-19 infections. 
GM had said in March its manufacturing facilities were operating normally in Shanghai and were not affected by the city's lockdown measures.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary and Austria questioned an EU decision to blacklist two Russian oligarchs but eventually accepted the move after pressure from other governments, European Union diplomats and officials said.
The EU adopted a new package of sanctions against Russia last Friday over its invasion of Ukraine, including the blacklisting of oligarchs close to the Kremlin, among them Moshe Kantor and German Gref.
Hungary and Austria enjoyed relatively cordial relations with Russia before the invasion, and their concerns about blacklisting Kantor and Gref underlines the difficulty the EU faces in presenting a united front against Russia.
The envoys of Estonia and Lithuania successfully urged their partners not to remove the two men from the list, the diplomats said. 
Kantor, a large shareholder in Russian fertilizers company Akron, is also a philanthropist who had headed the European Jewish Congress (EJC).
He was sanctioned for having close ties to President Vladimir Putin, the EU sanctions document said. Kantor, a citizen of both Britain and Russia, has already been sanctioned by London and the EJC said on Friday he would stand down as its president.
Hungary and Austria had both questioned the move against Kantor at a meeting of EU diplomats last Wednesday, officials who attended the meeting said.
The Hungarian envoy had expressed surprise at the blacklisting of somebody he described as a highly decorated man, they said. Kantor has received awards from several EU states, including Austria, Italy and France.
Spokespersons for Hungary's government and its diplomatic mission in Brussels had no immediate comment.
The Austrian envoy at Wednesday's meeting had asked for more information about why Kantor had been listed, sources said.
""Austria has never objected to or blocked any listings and will of course not do so in the future,"" a spokeswoman for Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said.
Blacklisted oligarchs face asset freezes and travel bans in the EU, but not all EU countries have reported enforcement measures.
Out of about 30 billion euros frozen to oligarchs since the start of the Ukraine war, Austria has reported a few hundreds of millions of euros blocked in bank accounts linked to blacklisted individuals. Hungary has so far not publicly reported any measures. 

At the meeting, Hungary also questioned the listing of Gref, head of Sberbank, Russia's largest lender.
Sberbank plays a crucial role in energy transactions and has so far been exempted from EU sanctions because of the EU's reliance on Russian gas and oil.

Wilson believes that the stock market is sending a clear message to traders: Stay defensive as growth will disappoint. The strategist added that we are facing “a pivotal earnings season.”
“The internal message from stocks is diverging again from bonds and the S&P 500. When that happens we think it pays to follow stocks. Our main takeaway is to stay defensive and be wary of what bonds are really saying about growth. The move looks more technical at this point which tends to exhaust and reverse quickly. Cyclicals look most vulnerable to such a reversal if it happens,” Wilson said in a client note.
On why the S&P 500 is trading less than 10% off the all-time high despite an extremely challenging macro environment, Wilson says that mis-priced yields helped the index to “remain resilient” after ignoring “the growing risk of a more hawkish Fed in the fourth quarter of 2021.”
Wilson argues that the stock market is “the best strategist in the world.”
“On that score, the internals of the stock market are once again diverging from the message from the bond market. More specifically, back end rates have had one of it's largest 1 month moves in history as Fed funds futures catch up to reality. To be clear, we don't have a bone to pick with this move higher in rates given the state of inflation and the Fed's persistent attempt to convince the world they are going to do whatever it takes to quash it. However, we do question the bond market's apparent view that the Fed can do this much tightening without impacting the economy in such a way that this path for rate hikes will be challenging to complete,” the strategist added.

Discovery, a standalone global media and entertainment giant.
The combined company, a result of Discovery’s merger with AT&T’s Warner Media, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange today under the ticker symbol “WBD.”
“Today’s announcement marks an exciting milestone not just for Warner Bros. Discovery but for our shareholders, our distributors, our advertisers, our creative partners and, most importantly, consumers globally,” said David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros.
Under the terms of the deal, AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. AT&T investors received 0.241917 shares of the combined company for each AT&T common share they owned at the close.
Ultimately, shareholders of the telecommunications company received 1.7 billion WBD shares, which accounts for 71% of the combined company’s stock on a fully diluted basis. Shareholders of Discovery hold the remaining stake of WBD.
Following the completion of the deal, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft named WBD a new Top Pick in the bank’s media sector coverage. A new price target is $48.00 per share, up from $40.00.
“We view the new Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as one of the best positioned companies in the global streaming video entertainment industry1 given its content and IP portfolio, combined with its widely recognized HBO Max brand and existing base of 92M streaming subscribers. From a content perspective, we view WBD as #1 in scripted general entertainment content given the Warner Brothers + HBO libraries and current production slates; and #1 in unscripted given legacy Discovery's content across its lifestyle brand portfolio. We also view CNN as a valuable and differentiating asset for WBD's global streaming business,” Kraft said in a client note.
The analyst believes WBD could reach 194 million global DTC/streaming subscribers by the end of 2026.
“Given that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is already at 222M subscribers, we believe there could be upside to our WBD forecast,” the analyst added.
On the other hand, Bank of America analyst David Barden reiterated a Buy rating on T stock on premium yield and value. The analyst also lowered the price target to $25.00 per share from $35.00 to reflect the WM spin.
“We believe AT&T’s shares are undervalued. In recent years T’s valuation has reflected an overly complex structure of loosely-related businesses sub-optimally organized as a conglomerate. While the divestitures of the past year have addressed the complexity (admittedly in a complex way sometimes eg. DTV), headwinds were once again created on May 17, 2021 when AT&T announced the dividend reset to $1.11/share (from $2.08) once the WM spin closed. With the deal now closed, the dividend reset, and the investor base stabilizing, we believe the stage is set for investors to begin focusing on AT&T’s improving fundamentals,” Barden wrote in a memo.

The rest will be sourced through so-called Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), where power producers are paid to generate a certain amount of energy over a number of years at a set price.
The carmaker is in advanced discussions to purchase additional wind energy through PPAs worth a billion euros ($1.09 billion) by 2025, Burzer added.

Investing.com -- Amazon, on Monday, launched a massive billion bond sale in seven tranches, putting pressure on a bond market already depressed at the thought of March's inflation data, which are due for publication on Tuesday.
The e-commerce and Cloud-hosting giant, which recently announced a $10 billion stock buyback program, aims to borrow a total of $12 billion through seven separate tranches, with maturities stretching up to 40 years. The sales will be handled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), according to the company's filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission.
Unverified market talk indicated that the 10-year tranche would be priced to yield around 110 basis points over the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury. while the 30-year tranche was aiming for a spread of 140 basis points and the 40-year tranche a spread of 155 basis points.
Amazon had just under $37 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of last year, along with another $60 billion in short-term investments. At the same time, it had $64 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations. 
The sale comes as long-term interest rates in the U.S. hit their highest in over three years. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to as much as 2.78% overnight, its highest since March 2019, while the 30-Year yield rose to as high as 2.80%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) is suspending its business in Russia indefinitely and has put employees on paid leave, six weeks after the Swedish telecom equipment maker started a review of the impact of Western sanctions on its operations.
The company said on Monday it would record a 900 million crown ($95 million) provision in the first quarter for impairment of assets and other exceptional costs related to the move.
Ericsson has about 600 employees in Russia, a spokesperson said. 
Hundreds of Western companies have either withdrawn https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-600-companies-have-withdrawn-russia-some-remain or suspended operations in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February while Western governments have imposed sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Ericsson had paused deliveries to customers in Russia in February, and rival Nokia (NYSE:NOK) did so in early March. 
""Move was inevitable following a swathe of sanctions,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. ""It will be a huge blow to both Ericsson and Nokia as they will not be paid for their networks."" 
The suspension will also hurt Ericsson's future plans in the country as Russia said last year it would extend telecoms operators' licences beyond 2023 for networks on the condition that they started building networks using only Russian equipment.
Ericsson does not have any manufacturing in Russia and its manufacturing hubs in Europe are in Estonia and Poland.
Nokia in November announced plans to set up a joint venture with YADRO, a leading Russian developer and producer of high-performance servers and storage systems, to build 4G and 5G telecom base stations in Russia.
Nokia said in a statement the company complies with all sanctions and restrictions and has suspended deliveries to Russia for the time being. 
""Nokia will not continue R&D in Russia and we have already started the process of transferring R&D tasks outside of Russia,"" the company said.

CEO Parag Agrawal announced Elon Musk has rejected the company’s offer to join the board of directors, an unexpected turn of events just a week after Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO became Twitter’s largest shareholder.
Agrawal posted a tweet saying the social media company’s board held multiple talks with Musk, who did not state the reason why he will not be joining Twitter’s board.
Twitter planned to appoint Musk to the board on Saturday, a move that would have prevented him from becoming the beneficial owner of nearly 15% of Twitter’s common stock.
""I believe this is for the best,"" Agrawal said, referring to Musk’s decision. ""There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.""
Musk’s only response was a tweet with the face-with-hand-over-mouth emoticon. The billionaire disclosed his 9.1% stake in Twitter on April 4, after which he promised to bring “significant improvements” to the social network.
The announcement of Musk joining Twitter’s board prompted discontent among some Twitter employees, who were concerned that he could harm the company.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees more turbulence coming after CEO Agrawal announced the news on Sunday. Ives believes two sides couldn't agree on Musk's communications with the public “as he likely needed to take a more back seat/quiet stance as part of joining the Board.”
“This now goes from a Cinderella story with Musk joining the Twitter Board and keeping his stake under 14.9% helping move Twitter strategically forward to likely a ""Game of Thrones"" battle between Musk and Twitter with the high likelihood that Elon takes a more hostile stance towards Twitter and further builds his active stake in the company,” Ives commented in a note.
The analyst sees the three potential scenarios for Musk and Twitter.
“In our opinion its likely paths 1 or 2 with the Street now focused on Musk's next poker (next filing/stake in Twitter) move in this ongoing soap opera between Elon and Twitter,” Ives concluded.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces an additional EU antitrust charge in the coming weeks in an investigation triggered by a complaint from Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), a person familiar with the matter said, a sign that EU enforcers are strengthening their case against the U.S. company.
The European Commission last year accused the iPhone maker of distorting competition in the music streaming market via restrictive rules for its App Store that force developers to use its own in-app payment system and prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options.
Such requirements have also come under scrutiny in countries including the United States and Britain.
Extra charges set out in a so-called supplementary statement of objections are usually issued to companies when the EU competition enforcer has gathered new evidence or has modified some elements to boost its case. 
The Commission declined to comment. Apple had no immediate comment.
Under new EU tech rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) agreed last month, such practices are illegal. However Apple and other U.S. tech giants targeted by the rules will have a couple of years before the crackdown starts.
""The DMA is still two years away. The rules will probably apply to Apple at the beginning of 2024. This is why antitrust cases remain important,"" said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.
Companies found breaching EU antitrust rules face fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover and orders to ditch anti-competitive practices.

In addition to the music streaming investigation, Apple's practices in e-books and its Apple Pay are also in the EU antitrust crosshairs.
Sweden's Spotify, the largest music subscription service in the world, is one of Europe's big global success stories in consumer technology.

Investing.com -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rose 2.7% in premarket trading, bucking a generally weak market trend after the e-commerce company said its key personnel will give up majority voting control.
Under the terms of a proposal posted on the company’s website, the long-serving director and ‘angel investor’ John Phillips and his wife Catherine will convert their Class B shares, which have preferential voting rights, into Class A shares, ones held by Shopify’s outside shareholders.
That would raise the total voting rights of the Class A shares to 59% from 49% currently. The remaining voting rights will remain with the Class B shares, which are held by CEO and founder Tobias Lütke and affiliates. It would also ensure that Lütke is not able to pass on control of the company to future generations.
Shopify said it will seek approval for the measures at the same time as for a 10-for-1 stock split aimed at making its stock more accessible to smaller investors. It’s the latest company to take such a measure, after similar moves by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and others.
“The proposal will…strengthen the foundation for long-term stewardship by Mr. Lütke, a proven leader who has delivered significant shareholder value since the Company’s IPO,” the statement said. “This stability of leadership is expected to cement the Company’s focus on the long-term to the lasting benefit of merchants, employees and shareholders.”
Shopify’s stock had exploded in the early stages of the pandemic, as investors priced in a massive acceleration of the secular trend to e-commerce. Rock-bottom interest rates, which allowed analysts to model for low capital costs throughout a long growth phase, also supported its valuation.
However, that calculation has been undone by the Federal Reserve’s signaling that it will tighten monetary policy rapidly to rein in inflation. Since peaking at $1,762.92 in November last year, it has lost two-thirds of its value to trade at $603.18 as of Friday’s close.
Despite that selloff, it still trades at multiples that would have been considered expensive before the age of zero interest rates. At Friday’s close, it traded at well over 10 times the company’s expected sales in 2022. Shopify had said in February that it expected revenue growth to slow from a rate of 57% in 2021."

The analyst is concerned about order cancellations related to the consumer GPUs, as well as excess inventories, a slowdown in consumer and PC demand, and the Russian sanctions.
“While Nvidia sells at MSRP, pricing declines in GPUs post a pricing peak mid last year reflect on weakening demand, to the point where orders are now being impacted. Importantly Nvidia is not cutting wafer/substrate orders so far, as Nvidia has been supply restricted for the past 1.5 years and as data center demand remains very strong,” Gerra said in a client note.
Moreover, he argues that the demand weakness could increase in the light of the Ethereum fork that is expected this year.
The Ethereum fork expected late 2Q/early 3Q would compound the weakening demand trends, as it would result in a significant increase in graphic cards on the second-hand market, pressuring pricing further and likely reducing orders at least until the ramp of the GeForce RTX 40 series gains momentum (not until C2023). During the 2018 peak, mining represented as much as 40% of total consumer GPU demand based on supply chain estimates,” the analyst added.
The analyst also added that investors are underestimating the impact of Russia on Nvidia as this area “likely represents a larger percentage of consumer GPU than the consensus view.”
A new price target on Nvidia stock is $225.00 per share, down from $360.00.

Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. private equity firm is set to pay $65.25 a share for SailPoint. Thoma Bravo will pay a 31.5% premium to SailPoint’s Friday closing price.
The deal marks the second time Thoma Bravo has invested in SailPoint after the PE firm had bought a stake in the cybersecurity company in 2014 before it made an exit in 2018.
“Identity security is core to cyber security and businesses have realized that to fuel business growth and success, they must start with identity as the foundation for secure business transformation. We've experienced rapid growth and see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to continue to set the pace in the identity security market as the category leader,” said Mark McClain, CEO and Founder, SailPoint.
The deal is the latest addition to the takeover frenzy in the software industry, after a number of software makers have been sold to private equity buyers.
Last month, Thoma Bravo also bought cloud-based business software company  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) for 10.7 billion, the first major deal after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In January, affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners agreed to buy cloud computing company Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) for $16.5 billion. Elliot Management also acquired television rating company, Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN), for $16 billion.
Furthermore, cyber security software maker McAfee was taken private by a consortium managed by Advent International and Permira Advisers for $14 billion.
Private equity and investment firms have raised billions through traditional bank funding or private lenders, in spite of record inflation and the potential interest rate hike. To fund its buyout of Anaplan, Thoma Bravo secured the capital from a group of private lenders managed by Owl Rock, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Apollo Global, and Golub Capital.
Its acquisition of SailPoint will also be funded by private lenders, some of which have participated in the buyout of Anaplan, according to the Financial Times.
The SAIL transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.

470,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 07:27AM ET</span>",Big Banks Set to Post Weaker Deal Revenue Amid Ukraine Chaos,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s dealmaking boom came to an abrupt halt amid the war in Ukraine and a global shift toward rising interest rates, leaving big banks set to post a quarterly slump in investment-banking revenue.
The record merger-and-acquisition pipelines bank executives touted at the start of 2022 are still on the horizon, but have been put on the back burner amid gyrating markets and rampant inflation, according to Barclays Plc analyst Jason Goldberg.
“Many deals did not get launched given the market volatility throughout the quarter,” Goldberg said. “We do think pipelines remain strong and have just been more elongated than canceled.”
Another pressure point is the Biden administration’s more-skeptical view of mega mergers. U.S. antitrust enforcers earlier this year announced an effort to toughen merger reviews, saying a new framework is needed to combat a surge in deals that threatens to worsen already high concentration across industries.
M&A volume in the first quarter clocked in at $1.01 trillion, the lowest total since the early days of the pandemic, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Leadership at top banks cautioned when they reported fourth-quarter results that 2021’s deal wave wouldn’t last, even as investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported their best quarter ever.
JPMorgan is first among the top six banks scheduled to report, with results for the New York-based company set for Wednesday. That’s followed by an avalanche on Thursday: Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) & Co. all report that day. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) comes next Monday.
Other key topics to watch in first-quarter earnings:
Trading
The same volatility clogging deal pipelines is hanging question marks over trading revenue at the banks. While projections suggest it will weaken along with investment banking, big swings in markets could mean banks will post better-than-expected results. 
Volatility was particularly intense in prices for materials such as crude, gas, wheat and metals as a gulf emerged between buyers and sellers who are facing big financing strains. Markets were roiled as the invasion of Ukraine constrained commodities flows, though in many cases rallies were quickly followed by a drop in prices.
“This is the type of quarter that will make those banks that exited commodities do a double take,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with  Wells Fargo . “The big outstanding question is, How will the market’s volatility impact the results? There’s likely to be winners and losers.”
Underwriting
Capital markets will probably be another weak spot. Companies aggressively issued debt to boost liquidity during the pandemic and take advantage of low interest rates. Now they’re sitting on comfortable stockpiles of cash with little need to borrow anytime soon.
On the equities side, a slowdown in listings by special purpose acquisition companies is hampering results. Deals done by blank-check firms were a key source of equity-underwriting business last year, but have since fallen off. And the market is still digesting a plan from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would curb legal protections around forward-looking statements the entities currently enjoy.  
Loan Growth
Banks’ lending businesses suffered through historically low interest rates and weak demand amid government stimulus programs. But dwindling federal aid programs combined with higher interest rates could deliver the most substantive increase in loan growth since the start of the pandemic.
Projections from the top banks indicate lending could show a first-quarter gain of 9% from a year earlier, which would be the highest level since the first quarter of 2020.
Lenders are also boosting the rates they charge on loans, with the amount paid out on deposits rising at a slower pace. Banks are benefiting from the Federal Reserve’s shift to higher rates to combat spiraling inflation brought on by pandemic-era pressures and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“The tailwinds for Main Street banking should be mitigated by headwinds in Wall Street banking,” Wells Fargo’s Mayo said.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Russia's state-owned nuclear power supplier Rosatom and its Finnish unit RAOS Project will proceed with a planned nuclear plant in Finland, RAOS said on Monday, despite uncertainty over government permits since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Rosatom and RAOS Project continue fulfilling their obligations under signed agreements and contracts relating to the Hanhikivi 1 project,"" RAOS Project told Reuters in an email.
Since Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Finland's minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila has repeatedly said it would be ""absolutely impossible"" for the government to grant a construction permit for the Hanhikivi plant.
The plant was commissioned by a Finnish-Russian consortium dubbed Fennovoima, in which Finnish stakeholders such as Outokumpu, Fortum and SSAB own two thirds and Rosatom's subsidiary RAOS Voima holds the rest.
Many of the Finnish stakeholders have publicly expressed their will to pull out and write down the project, but are unwilling to pay RAOS Project for breach of existing contracts and possible indemnities.
Meanwhile, RAOS Project has continued preparatory construction work, such as cabling and excavation in the planned plant's site on the northwest coast of Finland, but cannot embark on building the facility without a government licence.
""RAOS Project Ltd as the ... supplier is acting based on and in accordance with the engineering, procurement and construction contract signed in December 2013 with Fennovoima,"" it wrote. 

Fennovoima had expected to obtain a construction licence from the government by summer 2022 to build the 1.2 gigawatt (GW) reactor, while construction was expected to begin in 2023.
Finland's government was not immediately available for comment.

Data show that car sales in the Chinese auto market plunged 11.4% in March from a year earlier to 2.23 million vehicles, even though sales have seen a sharp increase of 18.7% just a month earlier.
""The recent pandemic situation has been quite severe and so the figures in March were not too good, and we currently do not see much improvement in April,"" said Chen Shihua, the deputy secretary general of the CAAM.
Shihua said the car manufacturers were urging the authorities to provide support through new measures including the reduction of car purchase taxes.
The Omicron variant has spread rapidly across China, urging Beijing to introduce tighter measures and lockdowns, forcing some automakers, including Tesla, to temporarily shut down their factories.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) halted production at its Shanghai assembly plant on March 28, followed by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which suspended operations at its Shanghai joint venture in April.
Tesla produced just 55,462 cars last month when it was forced to suspend production for two days, just 154 more than in the 28-day long February. By comparison, the EV carmaker manufactured 68,117 units in January.
The new data also showed Tesla delivered 65,814 China-made cars in March; up 16.5% MoM. Strong local demand resulted in Tesla exporting just 60 EV units.
On Monday, Shanghai authorities said the lockdown will be eased in some areas of the city in a bid to revive the city after more than two weeks of strict measures.
The lockdown has significantly affected Shanghai residents, pressuring the city’s authorities to reduce the measures as some people struggle to access food and medicine.
Shanghai now plans to organize residents into three risk categories as a part of its plan to allow ""appropriate activity"" to those who live in neighborhoods with no Covid cases for two weeks.
""Each district will announce the specific names of the first batch (of communities) divided into the three types, and three subsequent lists will be announced in a timely manner,"" said Shanghai official Gu Honghui.
He added that the city was divided into 7,624 areas that are still under lockdown measures, while a group of 2,460 neighborhoods is to be reviewed after a week of no fresh infections. The last group of 7,565 ""prevention areas"" is set to have measures eased after two weeks of no infections.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, at the start of a holiday-shortened week that sees the new earnings season get underway and the release of key inflation data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 110 points, or 0.8%.
The main Wall Street indices suffered losses last week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, falling 3.9%, weighed by soaring U.S. Treasury yields.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at a yield of 2.75% on Monday, just off its highest level since March 2019, as investors positioned for the Federal Reserve to aggressively lift interest rates throughout the year to combat rampant inflation.
February's consumer price inflation reading of 7.9% was the largest annual increase in 40 years, and soaring commodity prices on the back of the Ukraine war mean March’s reading on Tuesday is expected to show that CPI climbed higher still, by an annualized 8.5%.
A strong inflation reading would likely add to investor concerns that tighter monetary policy could act as a drag on the economy.
A number of Fed policy makers are scheduled to speak during a week cut short by Friday’s Easter holiday, including Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, Raphael Bostic and Charles Evans later Monday. Their comments will be studied carefully for clues over the pace of future Fed tightening.
Also of interest this week is the start of the first quarterly earnings season, with the big U.S. banks first up. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) will report before the bell on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) follow on Thursday.
In corporate news, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will be in the spotlight Monday after billionaire investor Elon Musk decided against taking a seat on the social media giant’s board despite disclosing a 9.2% stake last week.
Oil prices fell Monday, continuing recent weakness as China’s lockdowns continue as its Covid outbreak worsens, weighing on demand from the world’s largest crude importer.
Shanghai reported over 26,000 new cases on Sunday, a new record, illustrating the difficulty the country has had stopping the spread of the highly infectious omicron variant despite lockdowns and repeated mass testing.
Additionally, European Union officials are set to hold talks with OPEC representatives in Vienna later Monday, hoping to persuade the cartel to increase output as the EU considers potential sanctions on Russian oil.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.4% lower at $94.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3% to $99.72 a barrel. Both benchmarks dropped over 1% last week, the second consecutive losing week.

LISBON (Reuters) -Ailing Portuguese airline TAP posted an annual loss of 1.6 billion euros ($1.74 billion) on Monday, while voicing ""cautious optimism"" that 2022 would bring better results despite uncertainties caused by the Ukraine war and the pandemic.
The airline, which is 72.5% controlled by the Portuguese state, is under a Brussels-approved rescue plan worth 3.2 billion euros and was forced to reduce its fleet size, cut more than 2,900 jobs and reduce wages. 
TAP said its 2021 results were hurt by the closure of its aircraft maintenance business in Brazil and the depreciation of the euro against the dollar. 
The company, along with the rest of the industry, was still facing ""unprecedented levels of uncertainty"" due to various factors, from COVID-19 to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chief Executive Officer Christine Ourmieres-Widener told a news conference. 
Rising inflation may create further challenges, mostly due to the cost of materials and fuel, she said. 
Chief Financial Officer Goncalo Pires said the airline would need to ""continue to perform in line"" with its restructuring plan in order to present better results in the future. 
""Delivering the plan is about maximising revenue but also controlling costs,"" Pires told reporters. ""There are many external factors, so we need to find strategies to mitigate those.""
Under the restructuring plan, TAP also had to wind down and close its aircraft maintenance business in Brazil, which represented a non-recurring loss of 1.03 billion euros. 
In 2020, the airline posted a 1.2 billion euros loss due to the pandemic. Ourmieres-Widener said TAP was not likely to reach pre-pandemic levels before next year.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Monday sued an alleged puppy scammer who used its services to sell fake pets, the first of what the company said would be a growing number of lawsuits targeting apparent misuse by its users.
Elder advocacy group AARP tipped Google to the scam last September following a complaint from a South Carolina resident who had sent $700 in digital gift cards to an online seller for a basset hound puppy that never came, according to Google's lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Jose.
Google is seeking monetary damages and a court order banning the accused user, Nche Noel of Cameroon. Noel did not respond to a request for comment through one of several puppy websites named in the lawsuit, and an attorney was not immediately listed for Noel in court records.
Noel used dozens of Gmail email and Google Voice accounts ""to communicate false promises to victims, register the fraudulent websites with U.S. internet hosting companies, and request and receive payments,"" the lawsuit states.
In addition to basset hounds, websites allegedly linked to Noel have offered maltipoo puppies and marijuana and prescription opiate cough syrup, according to the lawsuit.
Google policies bar use of its services in illegal activities. The lawsuit says the puppy scam harmed Google's reputation and cost it over $75,000 to investigate and remediate.
The company said that while it was unlikely that Noel would appear in court, an order against Noel could disrupt the alleged scam and deter copycats.
Previously, Google referred a similar case to the U.S. Justice Department. That Cameroonian puppy scammer pleaded guilty last year https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cameroonian-citizen-extradited-romania-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-defraud-online-purchasers.

Google has previously sued hackers based in Russia and marketing companies masquerading under its name. But the company said it was the first time it directly filed a consumer protection case before.
Google timed its filing to coincide with National Pet Day.

Investing.com -- Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell in premarket trading on Monday after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said at the weekend that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk won't join the board of the social media company after all. 
Twitter had offered Musk - the world's richest man and one of the most-followed people on the micro-blogging site - a board seat last week after Musk had disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company. 
Twitter stock had risen some 25% in response to the announcement, with many hoping that Musk would help reverse the stock's recent underperformance. Prior to the initial announcement, it had lost over half its value since peaking in February 2021.
Agrawal said that Musk had told the board on Saturday he wouldn't take up the offer of a board seat. In a statement on the platform, Agrawal said: ""I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.”
Musk, for his part, issued a series of tweets about Twitter - some serious, some joking - over the course of the weekend, including a suggestion that the company accept payments to its premium Blue service in the form of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that he has touted in the past. 
Agrawal's statement hinted that the board had been anxious to limit Musk's ability to disrupt its current strategy.
""We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward,” Agrawal said. 
Musk's activity on the site since disclosing his stake had indicated that he would seek to change various elements of the company's operations, despite styling his investment as ""passive"".  Investors considering a more 'activist' engagement are required to disclose more to the Securities and Exchanges Commission about their intentions - something which Musk has not yet done.

Loss of the two eastern markets would cost 25% of revenue, it said.
In response, it will enter Italy, Greece and Cyprus next year and continue expanding its ""Reserved"" brand in Germany and Britain.
""After the difficult period of the pandemic, we faced further challenges related to losing a significant part of the sales network,"" said Chief Financial Officer Przemyslaw Lutkiewicz, referring to the suspension of Ukrainian operations and decision to quit Russia.
""Despite this, the company's situation remains stable, and the expected revenues for the current financial year, more than 16 billion zlotys ($3.76 billion), allow us to think calmly about the future of LPP,"" Lutkiewicz added.
Since the company could not predict the future situation in Ukraine, it had decided to focus on EU markets where it was already present, he said. ""At the same time, we want to debut in new markets, especially in the southern European region, where we see growth potential for our brands.""
The company will also focus this year on developing its e-commerce business, which in the fourth quarter of its financial year to January 31, 2022, exceeded 30% of total sales. 

In the current year, the estimated value of revenues from online sales may reach 5 billion zlotys. That would be 31% if total revenue is 16 billion zlotys.

European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said in a statement on Monday its members pledge to file for reimbursement by national health systems no later than two years after EU regulatory approval, ""provided that local systems allow it"".
While EU drug approval is largely centralised, with the European Medicines Agency acting as watchdog, procedures to subsequently set the treatment price for national health systems remain in the hands of member states and differ greatly.
The pledge would reduce the time patients wait for new medicines by four to five months in several countries such as Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, EFPIA said, citing estimates by market researcher IQVIA.
The lobby group warned that any new rules forcing drugmakers to bring new products to all EU countries within a certain deadline could backfire and discourage companies from bringing some products to public health systems in the region altogether.
""We understand that some of the proposals being discussed could introduce obligations for (drugmaker) to market or supply all EU Member States,"" EFPIA said in a separate report.
""The industry has concerns regarding the use of regulatory tools designed for medicines authorisation being applied to address availability issues that are within the remit of member states,"" it added.
The average lag between EU market clearance and large patient groups receiving a newly developed drug varies greatly within the bloc, ranging from 133 days in Germany and 497 days in France to 899 days, or 2.5 years, in Romania, according to the report.

EFPIA said that the delays were influenced by several regulatory factors beyond companies' control. 
The lobby group also said it was proposing a harmonised system of tiered drug pricing, based on a country’s ability to pay, to replace the highly diverse EU price-setting landscape.

The phone is being produced at a local plant of Apple's Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, situated in the town of Sriperumbudur in Southern Tamil Nadu state, according to a source.
Apple has been shifting some areas of iPhone production from China to other markets including India, the world's second biggest smartphone market, and is also planning to assemble iPad tablets there. 

India and countries such as Mexico and Vietnam are becoming increasingly important to contract manufacturers supplying American brands as they try to diversify production away from China.
The iPhone 13 is the fourth model to be produced locally after Apple launched manufacturing operations in India in 2017 with the iPhone SE.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 05:16AM ET</span>",Chinese oil giant CNOOC to raise $4.4 billion in Shanghai listing,"(Reuters) -Chinese oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd said on Monday it will raise 28.08 billion yuan ($4.41 billion) in a share listing in Shanghai, after setting the price for what will be mainland China's 11th-biggest public stock offering.
Fundraising will be expanded to 32.29 billion yuan if an over-allotment ""greenshoe"" option to buy and sell more shares, issued to investment banks underwriting the deal, is fully exercised, the company said in a sales prospectus.
CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil producer, priced its Shanghai offering at 10.8 yuan ($1.69) per share, a 13% premium to its Hong Kong share price on Friday. It said it would use the share sale proceeds to fund one gas and seven oilfield projects in China and overseas, and to replenish capital. 
The firm's Hong Kong shares fell 3.3% in Hong Kong on Monday morning, more than the 2.5% drop in the benchmark Hang Seng index.
The Shanghai sale comes after CNOOC was delisted last October by the New York Stock Exchange after Washington added the firm to a trade blacklist citing suspected connections to the Chinese military. State-backed rivals PetroChina and Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) are already listed in Shanghai.
It also comes as a number of Chinese companies have paused Shanghai listing plans citing disruption to business life in the city, under lockdown to fight China's biggest coronavirus outbreak in two years.
CNOOC seeks to take advantage of soaring global oil prices as Russia's war on Ukraine pushes up already high energy prices. CNOOC expects first-quarter profit to jump 62%-89% from a year earlier, after registering record profit, and output in 2021.

CNOOC priced its Shanghai offering, which will make the top 10 of China's listing if the greenshoe option is fully exercised according to Refinitiv data, at 23.88 times earnings, or 1.05 times net assets.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>","China auto sales slump in March on COVID curbs, Tesla production sluggish","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China auto sales plunged in March as the country's curbs to rein in COVID-19 outbreaks took their toll, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was among automakers feeling the pain of limits on production.
Sales in the world's biggest car market tumbled 11.7% in March from a year earlier to 2.23 million vehicles - its first decline in three months and contrasting sharply with an 18.7% jump in February, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. 
""The recent pandemic situation has been quite severe and so the figures in March were not too good, and we currently do not see much improvement in April,"" said Chen Shihua, the association's deputy secretary general.
He added automakers were pressing the government for supportive measures such as cuts to the auto purchase tax. 
China has imposed strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, including in Jilin province and Shanghai.
Tesla has suspended production at its Shanghai factory since March 28, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Shanghai joint venture paused operations this month. Volkswagen and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp joint ventures with their Chinese partners in Changchun, Jilin's capital, have been suspended since mid-March.
Tesla only assembled 55,462 units in March when it also paused production for two days in the middle of the month, data from a separate association showed.
That was just 154 more than in February, a much shorter month for workers due to the Lunar New Year holiday. By comparison, the plant made 68,117 vehicles in January.
The data also showed Tesla's exports of cars made in China tumbled to just 60 in March, as domestic deliveries more than doubled from February. 
Chinese buyers have rushed to place orders, worried that Tesla may raise prices further after announcing price hikes in November and March due to the higher costs of raw materials. 
Tesla export data is patchy and can fluctuate wildly due to seasonal factors. It exported 33,315 China-made cars in February.
Other automakers hit hard by COVID curbs included electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) which said on Saturday it had suspended production after operations at its suppliers were disrupted. Its shares slumped 9% in Monday trade.

Battery giant CATL also said on Monday it has implemented a so-called ""closed-loop management"" system at its main factory to keep production going. A ""closed-loop management"" system is akin to a bubble-like arrangement, in which workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of society to prevent virus transmission.
While China's overall March sales plummeted, sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, more than doubled in March to 484,000 vehicles. That was, however, sharply slower than a tripling of sales in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has acquired Netherlands-based asset manager  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners for 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to expand its asset management footprint in Europe and increase its sustainable investment capabilities.
NN Investment Partners, formerly part of NN Group, will be integrated into Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). The acquisition of the firm, which has more than 900 employees, brings Goldman's assets under supervision to approximately 2.8 trillion dollars.
Buying NN Investment Partners, based in The Hague, is part of Goldman Sachs’ plan to scale up its European operations. The business will push growth in products such as European equity and investment-grade credit, sustainable investments and ""green"" bonds.
It will also help GSAM deepen its integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) values into its operations. 
""This acquisition advances our commitment to put sustainability at the heart of our investment platform. It adds scale to our European client franchise and extends our leadership in insurance asset management,"" David Solomon, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said on Monday.
Solomon is looking to diversify the bank's revenue to focus on more predictable business such as consumer banking, wealth and asset management.

As part of the transaction, GSAM has entered into a long-term strategic partnership with NN Group to manage an approximately 180 billion dollar asset portfolio.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's $8 billion Amul dairy group said on Monday it is bracing for disruptions and higher input costs for some products from July when the government's ban on plastic straws kicks in.
India last week refused to waive an impending ban on straws that are packaged with small juice and milk beverage packs, stoking fears in the $790 million industry that includes players like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), India's Dabur and Parle Agro, Reuters reported.
Amul has not worked out any practical solution to replace the tiny plastic straws and the paper variant is not feasible, said R. S. Sodhi, Amul's managing director.
""The intention of the government is good ... (but) the straws are not even 0.1% of total plastic consumption,"" Sodhi told Reuters. 
""The entire industry will be impacted.""
Sodhi's comments underscore the growing tensions in India's drinks industry at a time when demand surges in the sweltering summer season.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing to stamp out polluting, single-use plastic trash that chokes rivers. The government believes the tiny straws are a ""low-utility product"" and should be scrapped for paper straws or spout pouches.
Amul, a household name in India best-known for its milk and butter products, clocked sales of 610 billion rupees ($8.04 billion) in 2021-22, Sodhi said. It also sells various milk-based beverages in small packs with straws. 
With the ban, supplies of such packs will be disrupted and manufacturers may shift to more expensive packaging solutions, thereby raising costs, Sodhi said, adding that Amul sells billions of such carton packs each year.

Pepsi's Tropicana juice and Coca-Cola's Maaza and Parle Agro's Frooti mango drinks are among other popular beverages sold in such packs. An industry body representing them and other beverage makers has said it plans to again raise concerns with the government, and Sodhi said Amul will follow suit.
""We will write to the appropriate authorities,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Monday at the start of a holiday-shortened week, with the investors digesting the French presidential election, slowing U.K. growth, an upcoming ECB policy-setting meeting as well as the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%, while CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%.
Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron won the first round of voting in Sunday’s French presidential election, beating the populist right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. 
Macron will now face a run-off against Le Pen in two weeks' time, in a repeat of the 2017 elections, creating a degree of uncertainty with opinion polls predicting a very tight battle in the second round.
A Le Pen victory could send shockwaves through Europe given her anti-European Union stance, but the gains on the CAC 40 early Monday suggest a degree of relief that Macron is ahead at this point.
Adding to the positive tone on the French market Monday was the news Monday that  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) has agreed to sell its stake in  Rosbank  (MCX:ROSB), ending a more than 15-year investment in the Russian lender. The French bank's stock soared 6% as investors reacted positively to the news that it was exiting the Russian market. 
The European Central Bank is set to hold its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday, the day before Friday's Europe-wide holiday, and investors will be looking for guidance of future monetary policy with Eurozone inflation running at a record high 7.5% and showing no signs of peaking.
Policymakers will be reluctant to tighten policy amid uncertainty over the impact of the war in Ukraine on the bloc’s economy, but the more hawkish members of the ECB’s governing council will continue to push for interest rate hikes this year.
Evidence of the likely economic slowdown in the region came from the U.K., with the country’s GDP climbing just 0.1% on the month, a drop from the 0.8% increase seen the previous month. 
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later Monday in Moscow. This would be the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in late February.
Oil prices fell Monday, continuing recent weakness as China’s lockdowns continue as it COVID outbreak worsens, weighing on demand from the world’s largest crude importer.
Shanghai reported over 26,000 new cases on Sunday, a new record, illustrating the difficulty the country has had stopping the spread of the highly infectious omicron variant despite lockdowns and repeated mass testing.
With China maintaining its COVID Zero strategy, there is no clarity over when these lockdowns will be lifted, and thus when this economically important region can return to full output.

Investing.com --  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) stock rose sharply by mid-morning on Monday as the French bank said it will sell its Russian subsidiary Rosbank (MCX:ROSB) back to its former owners, the latest in a string of moves by western institutions turning their back on the Russian market in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The French bank said it will take a total of 3.1 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in charges from writedowns of both  Rosbank  and its insurance operations in Russia, which it is also selling back to Interros, the holding company controlled by metals magnate Vladimir Potanin. The bank made no mention of a purchase price, except in so far as Interros will repay some $500 million of subordinated debt issued by SocGen to its subsidiary.
The move had been expected and the market was reassured by SocGen's assurances that the accompanying writedowns would have only a modest impact on its overall financial health. The bank's core tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of financial strength, will fall by only 20 basis points as a result of the disposal. At the end of last year, that capital ratio had stood at 13.7% - some 470 basis points above the regulatory minimum.
The move ends what had been an increasingly profitable venture for SocGen. Rosbank had contributed 152 million euros in net income to the group's bottom line in 2021, more than double what it earned in the first year of the pandemic.
The stock's reaction made SocGen the best performing stock in Paris on a morning when the overall market breathed a sigh of relief at incumbent Emmanuel Macron's narrow win in the first of two rounds of voting in the country's presidential elections.

The sanctions will also prohibit the export of certain raw materials from the EU to Russia and limit transportation from and to Russia, the company added.

Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later Monday in Moscow. This would be the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in late February.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 01:40AM ET</span>",How Meta fumbled propaganda moderation during Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"By Katie Paul and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - Days after the March 9 bombing of a maternity and children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, comments claiming the attack never happened began flooding the queues of workers moderating Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram content on behalf of the apps' owner, Meta Platforms.
The bombardment killed at least three people, including a child, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said publicly. Images of bloodied, heavily pregnant women fleeing through the rubble, their hands cradling their bellies, sparked immediate outrage worldwide.
Among the most-recognized women was Mariana Vishegirskaya, a Ukrainian fashion and beauty influencer. Photos of her navigating down a hospital stairwell in polka-dot pajamas circulated widely after the attack, captured by an Associated Press https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-edf7240a9d990e7e3e32f82ca351dede photographer.
Online expressions of support for the mother-to-be quickly turned to attacks on her Instagram account, according to two contractors directly moderating content from the conflict on Facebook and Instagram. They spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, citing non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work publicly.
The case involving the beauty influencer is just one example of how Meta's content policies and enforcement mechanisms have enabled pro-Russian propaganda during the Ukraine invasion, the moderators told Reuters.
Russian officialdom seized on the images, setting them side-by-side against her glossy Instagram photos in an effort to persuade viewers that the attack had been faked. On state television and social media, and in the chamber of the U.N. Security Council, Moscow alleged - falsely - that Vishegirskaya had donned make-up and multiple outfits in an elaborately staged hoax orchestrated by Ukrainian forces.
Swarms of comments accusing the influencer of duplicity and being an actress appeared underneath old Instagram posts of her posed with tubes of makeup, the moderators said.
At the height of the onslaught, comments containing false allegations about the woman accounted for most of the material in one moderator's content queue, which normally would have contained a mix of posts suspected of violating Meta's myriad policies, the person recalled.
""The posts were vile,"" and appeared to be orchestrated, the moderator told Reuters. But many were within the company's rules, the person said, because they did not directly mention the attack. ""I couldn't do anything about them,"" the moderator said.
Reuters was unable to contact Vishegirskaya.
Meta declined to comment on its handling of the activity involving Vishegirskaya, but said in a statement to Reuters that multiple teams are addressing the issue.
""We have separate, expert teams and outside partners that review misinformation and inauthentic behavior and we have been applying our policies to counter that activity forcefully throughout the war,"" the statement said.
Meta policy chief Nick Clegg separately told reporters on Wednesday that the company was considering new steps to address misinformation and hoaxes from Russian government pages, without elaborating.
Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media and the Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment.
Representatives of Ukraine did not respond to a request for comment.
'SPIRIT OF THE POLICY'
Based at a moderation hub of several hundred people reviewing content from Eastern Europe, the two contractors are foot soldiers in Meta's battle to police content from the conflict. They are among tens of thousands of low-paid workers at outsourcing firms around the world that Meta contracts to enforce its rules.
The tech giant has sought to position itself as a responsible steward of online speech during the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.
Just a few days into the war, Meta imposed restrictions on Russian state media and took down a small network of coordinated fake accounts that it said were trying to undermine trust in the Ukrainian government.
It later said it had pulled down another Russia-based network that was falsely reporting people for violations like hate speech or bullying, while beating back attempts by previously disabled networks to return to the platform.
Meanwhile, the company attempted to carve out space for users in the region to express their anger over Russia’s invasion and to issue calls to arms in ways Meta normally would not permit.
In Ukraine and 11 other countries across Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, it created a series of temporary ""spirit of the policy"" exemptions to its rules barring hate speech, violent threats and more; the changes were intended to honor the general principles of those policies rather than their literal wording, according to Meta instructions to moderators seen by Reuters.
For example, it permitted ""dehumanizing speech against Russian soldiers"" and calls for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, unless those calls were considered credible or contained additional targets, according to the instructions viewed by Reuters.
The changes became a flashpoint for Meta as it navigated pressures both inside the company and from Moscow, which opened a criminal case into the firm after a March 10 Reuters report made the carve-outs public. Russia also banned Facebook and Instagram inside its borders, with a court accusing Meta of ""extremist activity.""
Meta walked back elements of the exceptions after the Reuters report. It first limited them to Ukraine alone and then canceled one altogether, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, Meta's public statements, and interviews with two Meta staffers, the two moderators in Europe and a third moderator who handles English-language content in another region who had seen the advisories.
The documents offer a rare lens into how Meta interprets its policies, called community standards. The company says its system is neutral and rule-based.
Critics say it is often reactive, driven as much by business considerations and news cycles as by principle. It’s a complaint that has dogged Meta in other global conflicts including Myanmar, Syria and Ethiopia. Social media researchers say the approach allows the company to escape accountability for how its policies affect the 3.6 billion users of its services.
The shifting guidance over Ukraine has generated confusion and frustration for moderators, who say they have 90 seconds on average to decide whether a given post violates policy, as first reported by the New York Times. Reuters independently confirmed such frustrations with three moderators.
After Reuters reported the exemptions on March 10, Meta policy chief Nick Clegg said in a statement the next day that Meta would allow such speech only in Ukraine.
Two days later, Clegg told employees the company was reversing altogether the exemption that had allowed users to call for the deaths of Putin and Lukashenko, according to a March 13 internal company post seen by Reuters.
At the end of March, the company extended the remaining Ukraine-only exemptions through April 30, the documents show. Reuters is the first to report this extension, which allows Ukrainians to continue engaging in certain types of violent and dehumanizing speech that normally would be off-limits.
Inside the company, writing on an internal social platform, some Meta employees expressed frustration that Facebook was allowing Ukrainians to make statements that would have been deemed out of bounds for users posting about previous conflicts in the Middle East and other parts of the world, according to copies of the messages viewed by Reuters.
""Seems this policy is saying hate speech and violence is ok if it is targeting the 'right' people,"" one employee wrote, one of 900 comments on a post about the changes.
Meanwhile, Meta gave moderators no guidance to enhance their ability to disable posts promoting false narratives about Russia's invasion, like denials that civilian deaths have occurred, the people told Reuters.
The company declined to comment on its guidance to moderators.
DENYING VIOLENT TRAGEDIES
In theory, Meta did have a rule that should have enabled moderators to address the mobs of commenters directing baseless vitriol at Vishegirskaya, the pregnant beauty influencer. She survived the Mariupol hospital bombing and delivered her baby, the Associated Press https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-health-europe-bombings-259ec00f1a6c426603827985dac3a3e9 reported.
Meta's harassment policy prohibits users from ""posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur,"" according to the Community Standards published on its website. It cited that rule when it removed posts by the Russian Embassy in London that had pushed false claims about the Mariupol bombing following the March 9 attack.
But because the rule is narrowly defined, two of the moderators said, it could be used only sparingly to battle the online hate campaign against the beauty influencer that followed.
Posts that explicitly alleged that the bombing was staged were eligible for removal, but comments such as ""you're such a good actress"" were considered too vague and had to stay up, even when the subtext was clear, they said.
Guidance from Meta enabling commenters to consider context and enforce the spirit of that policy could have helped, they added.
Meta declined to comment on whether the rule applied to the comments on Vishegirskaya's account.
At the same time, even explicit posts proved elusive to Meta's enforcement systems.
A week after the bombing, versions of the Russian Embassy posts were still circulating on at least eight official Russian accounts on Facebook, including its embassies in Denmark, Mexico and Japan, according to an Israeli watchdog organization, FakeReporter.
One showed a red ""fake"" label laid over the Associated Press photos of Mariupol, with text claiming the attack on Vishegirskaya was a hoax, and pointing readers to ""more than 500 comments from real users"" on her Instagram account condemning her for participating in the alleged ruse.
Meta removed those posts on March 16, hours after Reuters asked the company about them, a spokesperson confirmed. Meta declined to comment on why the posts had evaded its own detection systems.

The following day, on March 17, Meta designated Vishegirskaya an ""involuntary public person,"" which meant moderators could finally start deleting the comments under the company's bullying and harassment policy, they told Reuters.
But the change, they said, came too late. The flow of posts related to the woman had already slowed to a trickle.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 01:21AM ET</span>","Inflation, rising rates, war create uncertain outlook for U.S. earnings","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An aggressive Federal Reserve, soaring inflation and geopolitical uncertainty from the war in Ukraine are muddying the outlook for the upcoming U.S. earnings season, leaving some strategists wary of surprises as corporate results kick off this week.
Expectations for earnings growth have largely held up in recent weeks, despite a first quarter that saw commodities prices surge after Russia invaded Ukraine, threatening to exacerbate already-high consumer prices. 
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have increased by about 6% in the first three months of 2022 from a year ago and forecast profit growth of about 9% for the year, forecasts in line with those at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The reporting period for S&P 500 companies begins this week with results from major banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday.
Some worry, however, that a cocktail of rising prices, higher wages and tightening financial conditions may have weighed on some companies' balance sheets or clouded expectations for the rest of the year. 
""The environment is very different this quarter. There are so many things going on,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. ""It will be fascinating to see how companies respond."" 
Earnings season comes on the heels of a tumultuous quarter for asset prices that saw the S&P 500 swoon nearly 13% before paring losses in a furious rebound late last month. The index is down about 6% for the year-to-date.
Energy and other commodity prices have surged, with Brent crude futures up 32% for the year so far. The war in Ukraine has also created worries about supply and transportation problems, adding to concerns that have been building since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
That's led a number of companies to warn about the impact of rising raw material and other costs on margins in recent weeks, including packaged food company Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc, which this month lowered its full-year profit forecast. 
""I see capital more expensive, labor more expensive, commodities more expensive,"" Ablin said. ""Unless these firms can pass these costs along - and arguably they'll be able to pass along some but not all... That says to me, margins have to decline."" 
Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wages, another negative for companies. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rebounded in March amid growing labor market optimism. 
In March, the Fed raised rates for the first time since 2018 and policymakers have signaled they are ready to aggressively fight the fastest consumer price growth in nearly four decades with meaty rate hikes and balance sheet runoff, leading some investors to worry that the central bank's monetary policies may bring on a recession. 
With earnings, ""it's easy to identify the multiple negatives,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""The question is how much of those negatives have already been priced into individual company shares."" 
Given recent market volatility and nervousness heading into earnings season, he said, ""The only guarantee is there are going to be outsized moves in both directions from individual companies"" following their reports. 
Among sectors, analysts expect a massive year-over-year jump in energy earnings in the first quarter because of the higher oil prices, while materials' growth also is expected to have benefited from surging prices. 
Meanwhile, big banks are expected to report a large decline in earnings from a year earlier, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading.
At the same time, major U.S. companies including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) have halted sales in Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine in late February. While overall S&P 500 companies' revenue exposure to Russia is relatively small, the war, which Russia calls a ""special operation,"" adds to the uncertain outlook for companies. 
Overall, corporate margins have held up, ""so the market can take some margin contraction, only because we're coming from such high rates,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. 

Still, the rate of earnings growth has slowed from last year, when companies were rebounding sharply from the lows of the pandemic, he said. S&P 500 profit growth for all of 2021 was about 52%, based on Refinitiv data. 
""This is going to be a normalization year, so to speak, where growth rates are slower,"" Wren said. ""You don't have all of this fiscal and monetary stimulus. That's what the market has to adjust to.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese question-and-answer website Zhihu Inc opened its bookbuilding process on Monday to raise $133 million in a dual primary listing in Hong Kong, according to its regulatory filings and a term sheet seen by Reuters.
The deal comes amid a regulatory standoff between Washington and Beijing over access to Chinese company audits, a dispute that is casting doubt on the fuure of those companies listed in the United States.
Zhihu, which listed in New York in March last year, is selling 26 million existing shares in the Hong Kong deal, which will be finalised on Thursday, the filings showed.
Four major shareholders, led by investors Capital Today and Innovation Works, are selling some of their stakes in Zhihu, according to the term sheet.
Zhihu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
With Zhihu's service, users publicly post questions to which others offer replies.
An increasing number of Chinese firms listed in the U.S are considering secondary or dual primary listings in Hong Kong in case U.S. delistings are ordered, sources have previously told Reuters.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing has previously barred foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said earlier this month it would revise the confidentiality rules involving offshore listings, which could remove a legal hurdle to the company-audit standoff.
The proposal centres on scrapping requirements that on-site inspection of overseas-listed Chinese companies be conducted mainly by Chinese regulators.
The move could allow inspections by U.S. regulators who demand complete access to such firms' audit working papers, which are stored in China.
Zhihu's New York listed shares have fallen 53.8% so far in 2022.

Shares in the country's 30th-largest developer slid 10% in Monday morning trade while its bond prices also tumbled.
""During the past few weeks due to the COVID lockdown situation in Shanghai, some of the company's operations have been halted and the progress of sales and asset disposals have been delayed,"" it said in a filing on Sunday.
It was not able to pay $20.4 million in combined interest for its May 2020 and June 2021 notes within the 30-day grace period after they were due on March 10.
The two notes together are worth $540 million.
Zhenro also flagged that it might miss interest payments on its September 2020, June 2020 and January 2020 notes that have grace periods ending respectively on April 10, April 14 and May 14. It might also default on the $23.4 million principal of April 2021 notes due April 13, it said.
Those four bonds combined are worth more than $860 million.
The January 2020 bond due April 2024 was trading at 13.006 cents on the dollar compared to 15.443 cents on Friday.
Zhenro plans to extend maturity of its onshore and offshore debt and dispose of assets worth up to 4 billion yuan ($630 million) in the first half, sources told Reuters in February.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:11AM ET</span>",Capacity crunch may abort U.S. satellite boom as sanctions threaten Russia launches,"By Akash Sriram
(Reuters) - Houston, we have a problem! 
U.S. rocket companies are facing the daunting task of ferrying hundreds of satellites to space in the coming years as sanctions sideline the Russian space launch industry.
SpaceX, Astra Space and Rocket Lab USA are among a handful of U.S. companies expected to fill the vacuum, but industry officials have doubts about their capacity to quickly ramp-up. 
As the race between companies, including Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Project Kuiper, for building giant satellite constellations to beam broadband internet from space heats up, demand for launches is expected to skyrocket.
More than 800 satellites under 100 kilograms are expected to be put in orbit this year alone, nearly double the number of launches in 2021, according to data from launch service aggregator Precious Payload. 
Small satellite launches set to double in 2022: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SATELLITELAUNCHES/zjvqkdllwvx/chart.png 
And with Project Kuiper taking up significant capacity over the next few years, analysts expect the industry to face some launch-related delays.
""Come 2024, 2025, when all these mega constellations need a launch, there is going to be a real problem,"" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told Reuters, referring to the networks of communications satellites being built by SpaceX, AST Spacemobile and OneWeb.
Rocket Lab is among a new breed of firms building miniaturized propulsion systems to cash in on an exponential rise in demand for putting compact satellites in the so-called low earth orbit.
In 2021, satellites launched by OneWeb and SpaceX accounted for the launch of about three-quarters of small satellites, according to industry analytics firm BryceTech.
Still, Russia maintained a 16% share of the global launch market over the past five years, according to historical databases. 
Russia's market share over the past five years: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SATELLITELAUNCHES/movanbrrdpa/chart.png 
Its share was actually larger, given that Soyuz rockets were also launched under a since-suspended French-Russian joint venture named Starsem.
About two-thirds of Soyuz launches were commercial or in support of the International Space Station (ISS), while the rest were for Russia's domestic customers, Quilty Analytics analyst Caleb Henry said. 
If access to Russia's capabilities are lost due to Western sanctions on the country for its invasion of Ukraine, companies in Europe and the United States will have to quickly step in to meet demand.
That, however, may not be all that easy, given the complexities and challenges involved in building and launching new rockets.
""It is always possible that new vehicles will come online faster, thanks to improved manufacturing techniques, but precedent suggests it will be difficult to achieve high launch cadences for the next few years,"" analyst Henry said.
Rocket Lab's Beck said the launch crisis would also apply to smaller satellites used to image the Earth and conduct scientific observation that usually share a ride to orbit on a rocket with other satellites.
LAUNCH CRUNCH
Delayed launches can affect satellite internet companies in multiple ways. There is a risk of losing launch rights if they do not adhere to an FCC mandated deadline, while some firms may not see return on investment unless their satellite is in orbit.
United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), is set to replace its Russian engines with those made by Jeff Bezos-backed Blue Origin. Still, Western launch companies have a long way to go.
However, Amazon's blockbuster launch contracts for Project Kuiper can incentivize rocket makers to speed up production, industry experts say.
SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle is set to be in mass production sooner and analysts expect it to meet some demand. The company also launches satellites for and operates Starlink.
""Longer term, launch constraints can be alleviated by Starship. Starship could crush pricing in the commercial market if Elon wants to, but my prediction is he is much more focused on getting humans to Mars,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Edison Yu.

Yu added that ""new space companies"" such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Astra Space are the winners when demand rises and there is no dependence from satellite manufacturers around the world on Russia's Soyuz rocket.
Earlier this year, OneWeb decided to abandon Russian launch services and signed a deal with rival SpaceX to put its satellites in orbit.

Gortune Alternative is 40%-held by its single largest shareholder Gortune Investment, which was set up in 2016 under the Guangdong government’s guidance. Gortune Alternative will also promote implementation of the overall debt restructuring plan and facilitate communication with Fantasia Group’s creditors.

The Chinese builder, which in February asked holders of about $1 billion of bonds set to mature this year for more time to repay, said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing Sunday it didn’t pay a combined $20.4 million of interest on two dollar bonds. That has resulted in events of default, according to the company. 
Zhenro also said it might not be able to pay a combined $32.6 million of interest due on three other dollar bonds before grace periods end between April 10 and May 14. Failure to meet the obligations would also constitute events of default, the company said. However, the firm said it intends to pay the interest due on all five notes by May 31.

The tech sector was once again at the forefront of losses, with the Hang Seng Tech Index losing more than 4% in early Hong Kong trading. The broader Hang Seng Index was down 2.5%, while China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index also slumped as much as 3%.
Investors in Chinese equities are confronting multiple challenges at home and broad, causing the market to plunge again despite the mid-March vows from authorities to support the economy and the battered property and tech sectors. Record virus infections in Shanghai, a more-than-expected jump in China factory gate prices, concerns about tech regulations and surging U.S. yields all combined to trigger Monday’s losses.
“There’s very little to be optimistic about,” said Zhang Fushen, senior analyst at Shanghai PD Fortune Asset Management (LLP). “The shine from policy pledges of a few weeks ago is starting to wear off, especially with the situation in Shanghai. There is a gloomy atmosphere.”
The Hang Seng Tech gauge was on course for a fourth day of losses. That’s after China’s State Council issued new guidelines over the weekend on removing data monopoly at platform companies and preventing them from restricting competition.
Investors are also keenly watching for developments related to a potential delisting of Chinese companies at American exchanges as Beijing vowed to defuse risks with a radical proposal.
“China tech stocks are facing two big hurdles that haven’t been priced in the shares,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific Yamaichi International Hong Kong Ltd., citing the uncertain pace of rate hikes in the U.S. and the delisting risks. Beijing is being cooperative, but “it’s unclear whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange and Commission will remain tough and force these companies to delist from the U.S. To me, that possibility can’t be ruled out yet.”

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with bonds continuing a selloff as investor concerns about inflation and monetary tightening continue. However, incumbent Emmanuel Macron is in the lead after the first round of the French presidential vote.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.93% by 10:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 2.53%. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.68%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.66% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.53%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Investors breathed a sigh of relief over the results in France, but questions remain as to whether Macron can maintain the lead against rival Marine Le Pen in Apr.24’s runoff.
U.S. futures fell, indicating further challenges ahead for global shares as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues tightening its monetary policy.
“Today, the mantra for many investors is ‘Don’t fight the Fed when it is fighting inflation,’” Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni said in a note.
“We agree with that, but it’s not as bearish as it sounds,” in part because accumulated excess liquidity and an inflation boost to earnings are beneficial for stocks, the note added.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she is confident that the U.S. will avoid a recession even amid tighter policy, although the inflation rate will likely remain at more than 2% into 2023. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak later in the day, followed by Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin a day later. Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak on Thursday.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.72%, around the highest since 2019, while Australia’s 10-year bond yield hit 3% for the first time since 2015.
The war in Ukraine precipitated by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, a hawkish Fed, and the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in China also continue to drive investor concerns.
Russia appointed General Alexander Dvornikov as the new commander for its military operations in Ukraine, in a bid to refocus its war effort after failing to secure territory around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Russia will  halt bond auctions for the remainder of 2022 due to prohibitive borrowing costs and Western sanctions. European Union foreign ministers will meet, with further sanctions against Russia on the agenda, later in the day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) confirmed on Sunday it plans to cut its summer schedule in a bid to avert flight disruptions as it works to ramp up hiring.
An airline spokesman confirmed an email to staff on Saturday, reported earlier by CNBC, that said JetBlue had ""already reduced May capacity 8-10% and you can expect to see a similar size capacity pull for the remainder of the summer.""
U.S. airlines are working to aggressively ramp up hiring as they prepare for an expected spike in summer travel demand as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. Since September, several major U.S. airlines have been forced at times to cancel hundreds or thousands of flights after severe weather disruptions.
The New York-based airline said on Sunday that ""given we anticipate continued industry challenges and heavy demand into the summer, we are planning more conservatively and trying to be proactive where we can with cancellations due to disruptive weather and air traffic control events.""
JetBlue canceled 148 flights, or 13% of its schedule on Sunday and delayed 39% of its flights, according to FlightAware, after canceling 18% of flights Saturday and delaying 48%.
The airline added that ""to get our operation back on track this week and provide additional recovery options for the potential of additional April weather events, we are cancelling some flights this weekend and will be making a small schedule adjustment through the rest of the month.""

JetBlue said despite hiring more than 3,000 new crew members in 2022, ""we remain staffing constrained, and these disruptions exacerbate an already challenging staffing situation."" It said it was adding ""hundreds of new crewmembers each week as we prepare for summer travel.""
JetBlue last week made an unsolicited offer of $33 per share in cash to buy  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), surpassing a near $25 per share cash-and-stock bid from Frontier Group Holdings made in February. Spirit said on Thursday it would start talks with JetBlue on its $3.6 billion offer.

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) -GoTo is banking for a steady market debut after raising $1.1 billion in a relatively cautious IPO, while a booming local share market is cementing expectations that Indonesia's largest tech firm can buck a global downtrend in tech stocks.
Formed by the May merger of ride-hailing-to-payments company Gojek and e-commerce giant Tokopedia, PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk will debut in Jakarta on Monday in the culmination of one of the world's biggest initial public offerings (IPO) so far this year.
Taking advantage of new listing rules, the debut will mark a watershed for the $70 billion digital market of Southeast Asia's largest economy, where record venture funding is creating a wave of startups.
""GoTo is the most differentiated technology company in Southeast Asia. Relative to its peers, diversification is going to be a very important thing that investors will need to get on top of and understand how to properly value the business,"" said Shane Chesson, a partner at Openspace Ventures, one of Gojek's earliest investors.
Indonesia's digital economy is likely to grow nearly five times to up to $330 billion by 2030 from 2021, showed a study by consultancy Bain & Co and GoTo backers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.
While U.S.-listed peers Grab Holdings Ltd and Sea Ltd operate across Southeast Asia, GoTo focuses on Indonesia. With 2.5 million drivers, 14 million merchants and 55 million annual transacting users, GoTo's businesses straddle millions of small and mid-sized firms across the archipelago.
Angus Mackintosh, founder at CrossASEAN Research, said in a report on Smartkarma that key to GoTo's IPO was that it was small and offered only to local investors. ""This should mean that there is stronger support.""
GoTo is selling 4% in shares with most taken up by funds. Backed by names such as SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GoTo is also broadening its investor base by allocating shares to 600,000 drivers.
It will also be first to issue multiple class voting shares and tap new rules allowing unprofitable firms to list directly on the bourse's main board.
Analysts said the size and valuation are lower than expected, and that GoTo likely aimed to avoid a repeat of the experience of e-commerce peer PT Bukalapak.com Tbk.
Bukalapak raised $1.5 billion in July selling 25% of equity after initially targeting $300 million. Its stock debuted strongly but tumbled 25% within days and has halved from its IPO price.
GoTo priced its shares at 338 rupiah ($0.0235), the high end of its indicative range.
Its investors are subject to an eight-month lock-in, or two years for those with multiple class voting shares. With Bukalapak, though there was an eight-month lock-in, some funds could sell up to 10% of holdings immediately.
GoTo will become Indonesia's fourth most-valuable firm at $28 billion, with analysts estimating an index weighting of up to 9%.
""Once you're in the index, all the local funds buy quasi automatically,"" said one GoTo investor. The IDX is at a record high and is Asia's best-performer this year at 9%.
GoTo President Patrick Cao said weak markets prompted caution with pricing. Still, the firm expects listing to support fundraising and plans to list overseas within two years.

""It is a very challenging environment in the public market now, with market caps of DiDi Global Inc, Grab, DeliveryHero and many others falling below the target valuation of GoTo,"" said Jianggan Li at advisory Momentum Works.

(Reuters) - Two of the world's richest people are pitching in ideas to tackle the issue of homelessness, suggesting that  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) convert its headquarters to a shelter home. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos on Sunday backed an idea put forth by Elon Musk, who recently became Twitter's largest shareholder, to convert the social networking firm's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter as few people are working there during the pandemic.
Bezos tweeted https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1513251374774972417 an article by technology-focused blog GeekWire from May 2020 about Amazon's eight-floor family homeless shelter attached to its Seattle headquarters, saying the initiative worked out great and makes it easy for employees who wish to volunteer. 
Bezos also suggested converting at least a portion of Twitter's headquarters, if not all of it, into a homeless shelter. Musk agreed in another tweet, calling it a ""Great idea.""
Musk, who has more than 81 million followers on Twitter, started a poll on Saturday, asking users to vote if the building should be converted. The poll gained over a million votes in less than a day, with more that 90% saying yes. 
The chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, who frequently tweets about his company and other topics, has been known to leave people confused as to whether he is joking. However, Musk clarified this time he was not joking. ""I'm serious about this one btw,"" he tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1513199588454264832, following up on the topic on Sunday. 
A separate poll https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1513045405029711878 by Musk on Sunday asked if ""w"" should be deleted from Twitter's name, leaving two voting options, ""yes"" and ""of course."" 

Musk had suggested a raft of changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service on Saturday, including reducing its price, banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin.

""In recent months, voestalpine has been conducting an open-ended market sounding to stabilize the business model of its direct reduction plant in Corpus Christi, Texas,"" the Austrian firm said in a statement. ""As a result of this examination, voestalpine is currently in negotiations to sell 80% of its shares in voestalpine Texas.""
Talks were at an advanced stage, it said, without disclosing a potential sales price.
Voestalpine announced plans to invest 550 million euros in a state-of-the-art plant in Corpus Christi in 2013.
The $1 billion plant in Corpus Christi opened in October 2016, with an annual capacity of 2 million tonnes of high-quality hot briquetted iron, or sponge iron, a pre-material used in steel production.
However, the plant has since faced setbacks ranging from construction delays to cost overruns totaling more than a billion dollars, as well as a challenging market situation amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Following write-offs, the Texas operation was valued at 448 million euros, Chief Financial Officer Robert Ottel said in November 2020.

Voestalpine recognised an impairment loss of 163 million euros on the Texas operations for its 2020-21 reporting year, as the plant was confronted with ""sharply lower"" demand. 
However, during the first three quarters of its current 2021-22 reporting year, the Texas plant had benefited from ""good demand for steel in North America,"" the Austrian firm said in February, when it said it expected full-year earnings across the group at the upper end of its forecast.

The European Union on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, which will ban a range of imports and also ban all transactions with four Russian banks, including VTB.
BaFin said following the sanctions, management at VTB's Frankfurt-based subsidiary is no longer allowed to take instructions from the parent bank, and that the parent company cannot access the financial assets or economic resources of its European unit. 
The measures ""result in a complete ring-fencing of VTB Bank (Europe) SE from the parent company,"" BaFin said.
VTB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
VTB was one of the Russian banks excluded from the SWIFT messaging system, in what was a big blow to its ability to transfer money.

But the new EU sanctions will block all transactions with the bank.
BaFin also said savers who have deposits with VTB's European subsidiary would still have access to their funds.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 11:00PM ET</span>",Musk proposes Twitter Blue subscription shake-up days after disclosing 9.2% Twitter stake,"(Reuters) - Elon Musk,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s biggest shareholder, on Saturday suggested a raft of changes to the social media giant's Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin.
Musk, who disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter just days ago, was offered a seat on its board of directors, a move which made some Twitter employees panic over the future of its ability to moderate content.
Twitter Blue, launched in June 2021, is Twitter's first subscription service and offers ""exclusive access to premium features"" on a monthly subscription basis, Twitter says. It is available in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In a Twitter post, the head of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc suggested that users who sign up for Twitter Blue should pay significantly less than the current $2.99 a month, and should get an authentication checkmark as well as an option to pay in local currency.
""Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn't get checkmark for 60 days (watch for credit card chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam,"" Musk said in a tweet. 
""And no ads,"" Musk suggested. ""The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.""
Musk also proposed an option to pay with dogecoin and asked Twitter users for their views.
Twitter declined to comment on Musk's suggestions.

The company already lets people tip their favorite content creators using bitcoin. Twitter had said last year that it planned to support authentication for NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital assets such as images or videos that exist on a blockchain.
Musk also started a poll on his Twitter account - which has more than 81 million followers - asking whether the firm's San Francisco headquarters should be converted to a homeless shelter as ""no-one shows up (to work there)"". The poll got more 300,000 votes in an hour, with 90% answering yes.

A filing by a group of seven shareholders said that while Volkswagen does disclose its trade association memberships, it should go further and say whether the associations' aims are compatible with its emissions-cutting targets.
Fellow carmakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW have already committed to doing that.
""The Board is failing to deliver transparent oversight of the company's climate lobbying,"" said Charlotta Sydstrand, sustainability strategist at Swedish pension scheme AP7, one of the shareholders involved in the proposal.
Her comments were included in a statement issued by the Church of England Pensions group, which also backed the filing.
The statement said Volkswagen had rejected the proposal on the grounds that the issue was deemed to be beyond the competence of the general meeting.
Volkswagen was not immediately available for comment.
Other supporters of the proposal included Britain's biggest listed asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and a range of Swedish pension funds.

Pressure by investors on climate-related issues is growing rapidly.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>",Explainer-Clock ticks down towards a Russian default,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia faces its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles earlier this week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars.
S&P on Saturday lowered the country's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honour its commitments to foreign debtholders.
Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". 
Here are answers to key questions: 
CAN RUSSIA PAY?
Russia was due to make a payment of $649 million to holders of two of its sovereign bonds on Monday. But the U.S. Treasury blocked the transfer, preventing Russia from using any of its frozen foreign currency reserves for servicing its debt. 
Coming up with an alternative, Russia placed the rouble equivalent of those payments for bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations in special accounts at its National Settlement Depository.
Moscow has a 30-day grace period from the payment date, which was Apr. 4. 
Analysts say Russia has the means and ability to pay. The country receives billions in U.S. dollars in revenue from energy exports, and while around half its foreign exchange reserves are frozen, it has hundreds of millions that are not. 
Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, said this was likely a ""willingness-to-pay situation."" 
The U.S. Treasury did not ban correspondence banking with Russia, subject to checks, and has granted a license to allow for payments relating to Moscow servicing sovereign debt until May 25. 
All this means it looks like Russia could still make the payment, if it wanted to, according to analysts. 
WHAT TYPE OF DEFAULT? 
At its most basic level, a default is a breach of contract, though the term can cover a variety of scenarios. 
Payment default is a failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts due after the grace period has passed, according to a paper by restructuring experts file:///C:/Users/8017535/Downloads/chapter-7-sovereign-default.pdf at the International Monetary Fund. 
However, there are also technical defaults due to events such as administrative errors, generally viewed by market participants as minor and swiftly remedied. 
Legal experts say payment in the wrong currency, in this case roubles, constitutes a non-payment. 
Russia has dismissed the notion of a default. 
""In theory, a default situation could be created but this would be a purely artificial situation,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. ""There are no grounds for a real default."" 
WHO WOULD CALL A DEFAULT? 
A default is a state of affairs, not a credit rating though markets often look to credit-rating agencies to declare a default has occurred. 
S&P, assigning Russia a ""selective default"" rating, said it did not expect investors would be able to convert the rouble payments into dollars equivalent or that the government will convert those payments within a 30-day grace period. 
With major ratings agencies having withdrawn ratings on Russia it is not entirely clear what manner of announcements might be made. 
A default will have wider ramifications. 
It could, for example, trigger credit default swaps (CDS) - an insurance policy bought by investors for such a case. A determinations committee will take a view on whether a ""non-payment"" event has occurred. However, such a decision is generally taken after the grace period has passed. 
There are around $6 billion worth of CDS contracts outstanding on Russia. 
WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN? 
Russia could unilaterally declare a moratorium - a temporary or permanent payment stop.
Made as an announcement or legislation separate from the missed payment, a moratorium can come before or after the payment default, according to the IMF. 
A government might announce a moratorium as an interim measure to halt payments before launching a debt restructuring, as Mexico did in 1982. 
The declaration of a moratorium is also one of the potential triggers for CDS contracts. 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A DEFAULT? 

Debt obligations at risk of, or already in, default are often snapped up by funds specialising in distressed situations, either hoping to make money when a restructuring is eventually worked out or to litigate in courts with the aim of getting compensation or seizing a debtor's assets instead. 
However, litigation and asset seizures are lengthy and costly processes. Many previous attempts have been unsuccessful, such as when creditors tried to seize Argentina's famous navy vessel https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2135.en.pdf, the ARA Libertad, in 2012 over a debt default a decade earlier or Argentine dinosaur fossils exhibited in Europe.

On Saturday, a message on YouTube said the Duma channel had been ""terminated for a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service"".
YouTube, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's, has been under pressure from Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and officials were quick to respond.
""From the look of it, YouTube has signed its own warrant. Save content, transfer (it) to Russian platforms. And hurry up,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging service.
The communications watchdog said it had requested Google restore access to the Duma channel immediately.
""The American IT company adheres to a pronounced anti-Russian position in the information war unleashed by the West against our country,"" Roskomnadzor said.
Google told Reuters in an emailed comment that is was committed to compliance with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws.
""If we find that an account violates our Terms of Service, we take appropriate action. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation for any updates and changes."" 
Vyacheslav Volodin, the Duma's speaker, said YouTube's move was further proof of rights and freedom violations by Washington.
""The USA wants to obtain a monopoly on promoting information. We cannot let it happen,"" Volodin said on Telegram.
Russia has already restricted access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms' flagships Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram since sending thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia had earlier tried to ban the Telegram messaging app, now widely used by officials, but lifted its ban in mid-2020.
Some Russian media cast the move as a capitulation, but Roskomnadzor said it had acted as it did because the app's Russian founder, Pavel Durov, was prepared to cooperate in combating terrorism and extremism on the platform.

In reports issued by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis ahead of an April 29 general meeting to name a new board at Generali, the two proxy advisers urged shareholders to support the slate of board nominees put forward by the outgoing board.
The board's proposed reappointment of Donnet has been challenged by Italian tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali and is its second biggest shareholder behind investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Mediobanca backs Donnet, while Generali's third-biggest investor, Italian eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, has sided with construction magnate Caltagirone.
The tussle for control of Europe's No.3 insurer threatens the stability of a group that is a cornerstone of Italy's financial system and a major holder of its public debt.
Glass Lewis said it did not believe Caltagirone's alternative plan for Generali made a compelling case to suggest the group had suffered from poor operational performance, missed targets or subpar investor returns.
""We believe the Dissident's central strategic thesis ultimately tilts from the attractively ambitious to the disconcertingly optimistic,"" it said in the report, of which Reuters saw a copy.
In pledging to grow Generali's earnings per share in coming years roughly twice as fast than envisaged by Donnet's plan, Caltagirone has put forward a veteran Generali executive, Luciano Cirina, as his own CEO candidate.

""The dissident plan is indeed more ambitious than the company's, but it appears unclear if Caltagirone's offers a superior path after considering factors like execution skills, feasibility, and risk,"" ISS said.
""In terms of governance, Caltagirone has been 14 years on the board and his accusations appear strangely timed after such a long tenure,"" it added.

“It is also one of our financing options, but we need to prove to them that we are qualified,” Vingroup Chairman Pham Nhat Vuong told a group including reporters.
VinFast said this week that its Singapore-based holding company had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with U.S. securities regulators, as the company readies a $4-billion investment to build a factory in the United States.
VinFast, which began operations in 2019, is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with two all-electric SUVs and a battery leasing model that will reduce the purchase price.
Vuong said VinFast was committed to an IPO that would help establish the electric vehicle maker as a global brand, but added: “if the conditions are not right we can wait.”
""We ourselves are determined to push and committed to this IPO, but the highest target for the IPO is not financing but to set up VinFast in the global market,"" he told the group.
Lending from the U.S. government's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (AVTM) loan programme was another option VinFast was exploring, Vuong said, in response to a question.
The $25-billion fund was established by Congress in 2007 when Detroit-based automakers were tipping into crisis. It is administered by the Department of Energy still has a lending capacity of almost $18 billion, according to its website.

VinFast has promised to create 7,500 jobs at its planned plant in North Carolina, where it will build the battery-powered VF8 and VF9 SUVs. The company has said it plans to begin construction of the plant as soon as permits are granted with a goal of starting production by 2024.
It plans to begin exporting the two electric vehicles to the United States later this year from its existing plant in Vietnam.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 10:26PM ET</span>",Alzheimer's drugmakers seek accelerated FDA review despite U.S. coverage decision,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co on Friday said they still plan to seek accelerated U.S. approval for experimental Alzheimer's drugs even after the Medicare health plan decided to severely limit coverage of medicines approved in that manner.
On Thursday, after a months-long review and a pressure campaign from patient advocacy groups, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would only pay for Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm, and other drugs that work in a similar fashion, for patients enrolled in valid clinical studies, unless the treatments demonstrate clear evidence of patient benefit.
Medicare covers nearly 64 million Americans age 65 and older, so the coverage decision could affect 85% of people who might otherwise use the medications for the age-related condition. 
Eisai's lecanemab and Lilly's donanemab, like Aduhelm, are monoclonal antibodies designed to remove beta-amyloid, a type of protein fragment that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The two drugmakers said they expect upcoming Phase III trial results to eventually validate earlier-stage data under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
A fourth plaque-targeting antibody, gantenerumab, is in late-stage development at Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF), which is not seeking an accelerated FDA review.
The FDA in June authorized Biogen's Aduhelm - the first drug in this class and first U.S. approved Alzheimer's treatment in 20 years - under the agency's accelerated pathway based on the drug's plaque-clearing ability, rather than proof it slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients.
Medicare, however, has decided to allow standard reimbursement only for Alzheimer's drugs approved under the traditional FDA process based on ""a direct measure of clinical benefit."" 
Eisai, which is partnered with Biogen, said it aims to complete a rolling FDA application for lecanemab, under the accelerated pathway, by mid-year. The Japanese drugmaker said it also expects results from its 1,800-patient, Phase III trial this fall.
If those results are positive, Eisai said it believes the large study could meet the ""high level of evidence"" criteria set by Medicare in its coverage decision.
The study is designed to show that lecanemab can slow by at least 25% the rate of cognitive and functional decline. 
""It is a disease-modifying drug,"" Ivan Cheung, Eisai's U.S. chairman, said in a recent interview with Reuters. ""You expect to see separation between the treated and untreated groups that improves over time.""
Roche also expects to report Phase III trial results for gantenerumab later this year.
Lilly, in a statement, said it intends to complete its current, rolling application for accelerated FDA approval of donanemab this year. It does not expect to have results from a Phase III trial of the drug until mid-2023. 
The Indianapolis-based company said it believes Medicare coverage restrictions are ""unnecessary, restrictive and inappropriate"" for FDA-approved drugs.
The idea that removing amyloid plaques is reasonably likely to slow cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer’s is known as the ""amyloid hypothesis,"" a theory that has led to long history of drugs that tried and failed to clear the plaques or help patients.
Greg Rippon, neuroscience and Alzheimer's Disease medical lead at Roche's Genentech unit, explained in a recent interview that the theory is supported by analysis of inherited forms of Alzheimer's, which are all caused by mutations in amyloid processing.
He said more recent studies have shown that the build-up of amyloid is a precursor to other brain dysfunction that speeds neurodegeneration for patients with Alzheimer's.

    ""Obviously, it comes down to clinical data and demonstrating that clinical benefit and that's where a lot of skepticism is centered,"" Rippon said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield hit a three-year high above 2.7% on Friday while the U.S. dollar index posted its largest weekly percentage gain in a month, helped by the prospect of more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower in choppy trade as investors assessed the economic outlook with the Fed moving to fight inflation. 
This week's release of minutes from the Fed's March meeting showed ""many"" officials were prepared to raise rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months.
The dollar index advanced to 100 for the first time in nearly two years. It rose as high as 100.19, its highest since May 2020. It was last little changed on the day at 99.822, and up 1.3% on the week.
As the dollar has gained in recent weeks, the euro has been pressured by a tightening election race in France, the euro zone's second-biggest economy, between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Macron is still ahead in polls.
The euro dropped for the seventh straight session to a one-month low of $1.0837. It last changed hands at $1.0853, down 0.3% on the day. 
""The dollar's latest pop is the culmination of bullish factors ranging from geopolitical risk, election uncertainty in France, and the Fed's increasingly hawkish outlook for interest rates,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
In Treasuries, the 10-year yield hit 2.73%, its highest since March 2019, and the yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities went within 15 basis points of turning positive for the first time in over two years.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 5.2 basis points to 2.706% while the 2-year note yield was up 5.8 basis points at 2.520%, leaving the 2/10 spread at 18.41 basis points.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4%, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27%, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34%, to 13,711.00.

French presidential election risk was also evident in bond markets as French borrowing costs rose while yields of other core European government bonds fell. 
In the energy market, oil prices rose 2% on the day, but registered their second straight weekly decline.

Member nations of the International Energy Agency (IEA) will release 60 million barrels over the next six months, with the United States matching that amount as part of its 180 million barrel release announced in March.
Brent crude futures settled up $2.20, or 2.19%, at $102.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $2.23 to $98.26.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Dow rose and the S&P 500 ended lower in choppy trade on Friday, as beaten-down bank shares gained and investors grappled with how best to deal with an economy that could skid as the Federal Reserve moves to aggressively tackle inflation.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a three-year high of 2.73%, helping boost the S&P banking index, which rose 1.18%, after slumping to 13-month lows on Thursday. The index is down 10.8% year to date.
The big rate-sensitive lenders all rose, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) gaining 1.8%, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) 0.7%,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) 1.7% and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) 2.3%.
Since peaking at two-month highs in late March, the market has trended lower as the Fed signals it will aggressively hike rates, leading investors to reposition their portfolios. Economically sensitive value shares this year have outperformed tech-heavy growth stocks, which often depend on low rates.
""We're going into a very long-term and meaningful period of value outperforming growth. It's not merely a cyclical adjustment, but a secular story,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at wealth manager the Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
""The value-growth story is a big one and it is a byproduct of two things, which is what you want. Growth is overvalued and value is undervalued,"" he said.
The Russell 1000 Value index rose 0.51% while the Russell 1000 Growth index fell 1.09% on the day. 
Investors are weighing the probability of a recession with two outcomes. On the one hand, the Fed could engineer a ""soft landing"" with slowing but positive growth, making banks ""woefully oversold,"" said UBS bank analyst Erika Najarian. 
Or a sharp slowdown is imminent, which would cause a knee-jerk bank share sale as ""owning banks in a recession is no fun,"" she said.
Big U.S. banks, which kick off the first-quarter results season next week, are expected to report a large decline in earnings from a year earlier, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading.
""There's always going to be a price at some point where people are going to step in and think things are cheap and they might buy,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives, at Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
""Perhaps a 52-week low was enough to entice some people into the financial sector,"" Frederick said, noting the 10-year Treasury yield was at its highest level since March 2019.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4%, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27%, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34%, to 13,711.00.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.37 billion shares.
For the week, the S&P fell 1.16%, the Dow lost 0.28% and the Nasdaq shed 3.86%, as the index was hit after Fed officials raised concerns about rapid rate hikes causing a slowdown.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc fell between 1.9% and 4.5% as megacap stocks extended this week's decline as the surge in Treasury yields weighed.
The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), fell 1.76% and semiconductor stocks slid 2.42%, extending the week's decline.
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 6.88% after a report said Goldman Sachs downgraded the online brokerage, while Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co jumped 2.99% on a ratings upgrade.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 184 new lows.

NEW YORK(Reuters) -Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Roger Ng was convicted by a U.S. jury on Friday of corruption charges related to his role in helping loot hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB development fund. 
The charges stemmed from one of the biggest financial scandals in history. Prosecutors charged Ng, Goldman's former top investment banker for Malaysia, for conspiring to violate an anti-corruption law and launder money. 
They said he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, had pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers say Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors' investigation, falsely implicated Ng in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence.
The fund was founded to pursue development projects in the Southeast Asian country.
The jury convicted Ng of two counts of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) through bribery and circumvention of Goldman's internal accounting controls, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
""Today's verdict is a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia,"" Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. ""The defendant and his cronies saw 1MDB not as an entity to do good for the people of Malaysia, but as a piggy bank to enrich themselves."" 
Ng, wearing a black suit jacket and black tie, showed little emotion as the jury's foreperson read out the verdict. Ng glanced back and forth between the jury and the desk he was seated at. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, hung his head after the guilty verdict to the first count was read.
U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who is overseeing the case, ordered that Ng be subject to a curfew pending sentencing, but said she did not consider him a flight risk.
Deliberations began on Tuesday after a nearly two-month trial in federal court in Brooklyn.
'HARD TO WIN'
Agnifilo said Ng may appeal, depending on the outcome of his post-trial motions and his sentence. He stood by his decision to convince Ng to waive extradition to face trial, saying he had a better chance of a fair trial in the United States than in Malaysia.
""These big cases are tough and they're hard to win,"" Agnifilo told reporters.
Prosecutors have said Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through three bond sales, but that $4.5 billion was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks between 2009 and 2015.
Ng is the first, and likely only, person to face trial in the United States over the scheme. Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and its Malaysian unit agreed to plead guilty.
Jurors heard nine days of testimony from Leissner, who said he sent Ng $35 million in kickbacks. Leissner said the men agreed to tell banks a ""cover story"" that the money was from a legitimate business venture between their wives. 
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, later testified for the defense that the business venture was, in fact, legitimate. She said she invested $6 million in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's then-wife, Judy Chan, and that the $35 million was her return on that investment. 

Agnifilo said in his closing argument on Monday that Leissner could not be trusted. Alixandra Smith, a prosecutor, said in her summation that Leissner's testimony was backed up by other evidence.
Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the scheme, was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large.

The combined company, Warner Bros Discovery Inc, will start trading on the Nasdaq on Monday under the ticker symbol ""WBD"".
In May last year, the companies set out to merge and become a standalone media business, with AT&T (NYSE:T) aiming to focus more on its wireless ambitions and Discovery looking to beef up its content library.
""With the close of this transaction, we expect to invest at record levels in our growth areas of 5G and fiber, where we have strong momentum,"" AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said in a statement.
Warner Bros Discovery's portfolio includes Discovery Channel, Warner Bros. Entertainment, CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network; streaming services Discovery+ and HBO Max; and franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"".

523,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 06:55PM ET</span>",Amazon calls for election re-run after workers voted for first U.S. union,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Friday called for an election re-run after workers at a New York City warehouse voted to create the company's first U.S. union, saying that the U.S. labor board and worker-organizers suppressed turnout.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Labor Union (ALU) rejected the allegations made by the online retailer that is the second-largest U.S. private employer.
Amazon made its demand a week after the landmark victory for organized labor, which for years has sought to offer protections to workers at the company. Some 55% of employees who voted from Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island opted to join the ALU, which has argued for higher pay and job security. Turnout was about 58%.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement: ""We want our employees to have their voices heard, and in this case, that didn't happen - fewer than a third of the employees at the site voted for the union.""
Amazon also accused the ALU of intimidating workers and distributing marijuana to gain votes in its favor, according to a company filing on Friday.
Derrick Palmer, vice president of the ALU, said Amazon is trying to ""demean our character and undermine our efforts."" 
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) now must process Amazon's objections before certifying the election result. The timing for this was not immediately clear.
In its filing, Amazon said the NLRB improperly helped the ALU gain standing to hold an election and created the impression that it supported the union. Amazon also accused the NLRB of hampering turnout through mismanagement in the polling area and by allowing camera crews on site that scared away voters.

An NLRB spokesperson declined to comment on these objections but the board has said previously that it is independent and that its enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with its congressional mandate.
The ALU pushed back against Amazon's claims, saying the company did not contest low turnout in a prior union election in Alabama in which workers voted against organizing. The ALU said it was Amazon that had intimidated workers, and the union has filed dozens of unfair labor practice charges against the company.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus lost a fifth of outstanding orders for its A330neo long-haul jet in March as the plane's largest customer went through restructuring, but won sales elsewhere for more than 100 of its smaller jets, monthly data showed on Friday.
AirAsia X cancelled 63 of the A330-900 version of the A330neo, an upgrade of the long-established A330 wide-body model, as well as 10 smaller A321neo aircraft, Airbus said.
The European planemaker also said it had delivered 142 planes in the first quarter, up more than 13% on the year. 
But the net number of deliveries stood at 140 after two for Aeroflot were cancelled due to sanctions on Russia.
Airbus had counted the two A350 deliveries for Aeroflot in its end-year tally in December as part of its forecast-beating annual deliveries, but the planes did not fly to Russia. Airbus has also cancelled the associated Aeroflot order, data showed.
""Airbus may seek new owners for these assets,"" Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said in a note. 
Industry sources have said Airbus is trying to sell surplus A350s to Air India including three which it claims to have available as a result of a spat with Qatar Airways. The two sides are involved in a bitter court battle over the fate of A350s following the discovery of surface damage in the fleet.
The widely watched delivery totals confirm a range of 140-142 reported this week by Reuters, quoting sources - a higher number than some analysts had anticipated. 
CLEANING BACKLOG
The announcement came as Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury told a German newspaper that Airbus is sticking to its goal of raising benchmark narrow-body production to 65 a month by summer 2023, and reaffirmed financial goals despite the war in Ukraine.
The A330neo is an upgrade of Airbus' most-sold wide-body jet designed to compete with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 at a lower price.
It clocked up hundreds of orders only to face patchy demand as it was left heavily dependent on troubled AirAsia X.
Airbus has been gradually reducing the presence in its books of orders deemed unlikely to come to fruition while shifting attention to booming sales for the narrow-body A321neo.
""It is always a shock to see a large wide-body cancellation but these aircraft have probably not been counted in investors’ delivery forecasts for at least the past three years,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said.
""With the focus on strong demand for the A321neo, it is a good opportunity to take a look at the A330neo orders and clean up the backlog.""
In legal testimony on Thursday, Airbus minimised the benefits of its hot-selling A321neo compared to Boeing's 737 MAX 10, in contrast with its own marketing pitch, but analysts described the move as a courtroom tactic in its widening legal dispute with Qatar Airways.

After Friday's rejig of orders, Airbus has 200 undelivered A330neos in its order book versus 265 a month ago. These include 28 for Iran under a nuclear deal that collapsed in 2018, though Tehran is in talks with major powers aimed at reviving the deal.
Airbus said on Friday it had sold a total of 253 jets in the first quarter or a net total of 83 after cancellations. Rival Boeing will issue quarterly data next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines confirmed on Friday it has delayed the return of some grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines until at least May 12.
An engine on a United Airlines 777 jet failed shortly after takeoff from Denver in February 2021, showering debris over nearby cities but no one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
""We continue to work conscientiously with Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and the (Federal Aviation Administration) to safely return these aircraft to service soon, and our current plan will allow them to return in the second half of May,"" United spokesman Joshua Freed said.
United is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 of those planes. United shares closed down 1% Friday.
CNBC reported the delay earlier, citing a memo to pilots.
Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was finalizing three safety directives for those grounded 777s that will allow them to return to service.
The FAA said the new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, require enhanced inspections and modifications.
The FAA said the directives would be effective April 15.
In February 2021, FAA ordered immediate inspections before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine built by Pratt, a unit of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). 

Boeing must develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements. FAA must approve that bulletin before the planes can return to service.
In April 2021, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13  Boeing Co  777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned. The engines are on only a small number of older 777s outside the United States.

Investing.com -- Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) shares rebounded on Friday after tumbling 17% Thursday. The drugstore chain caught a downgrade from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and a price target cut by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
However, that did not impact the stock on Friday, with Rite Aid shares closing the session 7.44% higher.
JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill slashed the price target on Rite-Aid shares to $7 from $14, maintaining an underweight rating.
Gill said to investors that while they continue to believe the retail pharmacy group is well-positioned over the long term, ""the near-term backdrop remains challenged due to ongoing reimbursement pressure and less of an ability to offset those pressures.""
Due to various industry headwinds, JPMorgan sees a long road ahead for Rite Aid as a stand-alone entity. 
The analyst also pointed to significant near-term headwinds related to Covid-19, including lower acute scripts and weak OTC [over-the-counter] cough/cold/flu sales, driving a reduction in retail pharmacy profit in the near term.
""We believe a discount is warranted given the ongoing turnaround and high leverage at Rite Aid,"" wrote Gill."

Investing.com -- The Dow ended higher Friday, but that wasn't enough to prevent a weekly loss as tech snapped its winning streak under pressure from surging Treasury yields following further details on the Federal Reserve's plan to rein in inflation. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.40%, or 137 points, The S&P 500 fell 0.20%, the Nasdaq slipped 1.3%. All three major averages ended the week in the red.
Technology stocks snapped a three-week winning streak, keeping the broader market in the red as investors remain wary of growth sectors of the market in the wake of surging Treasury yields.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.7% for the first time in more than three years on expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to stem inflation.
The Fed’s March meeting minutes, released earlier this week showed that Fed members appear “poised to hike rates 50bps in May, and initiate a sizable drawdown of the balance sheet beginning next month,” Stifel said in a note.
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell more than 1%, while an ongoing decline in the chip stocks added pressure on the broader tech sector.  
Banking stocks, which have been under pressure in recent sessions on worries that a potential recession could increase bad debt for banks, finally found some reprieve as investors looked ahead to quarterly results from major Wall Street banks next week.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reports results on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday.
""Banks are good place to be in the upcoming economic environment not just because rates are going up, but I think the consumer still is in a position of strength,"" Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
While rising rates boost lending margins and profitability for banks, the pace of the increase in rates has driven up borrowing costs and impacted demand. The red-hot pace of increasing rates will be determined by whether the Fed follows through on its hawkish plan to tighten monetary policy.
""Most people believe that the Fed is going be very hawkish and and cause a recession, but I just don't think that they will,"" Lee added. ""If the economic data starts to look ugly, I think they will stop tightening immediately."" 
Energy stocks were up more than 2%, buoyed by rising oil prices as investors weigh up the prospect of energy supply disruptions after the European Union confirmed new sanctions including a coal embargo against Russia over the latter’s invasion of Ukraine.
Despite the rise on Friday, oil prices succumbed to second-weekly loss as countries agreed to release million of barrels of emergency supplies.
Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were among the biggest gainers with the latter up more than 7%.
In earnings news, WD-40 (NASDAQ:WDFC)’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue offset softer full-year guidance, sending its share price more than 7% higher.

GTCR has informed Merit Medical it would be willing to pay $72 to $75 per share, one of the sources said. Merit Medical shares were trading at around $61 before Reuters reported on March 9 that the company was exploring a sale.
Other private equity firms could also express interest in Merit Medical and there is no certainty that any deal will be reached, the sources said. Should there be a deal, it could come as early as May, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Spokespeople for GTCR and CD&R declined to comment. A Merit Medical spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Merit Medical manufactures and sells devices and instruments used in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy.
The South Jordan, Utah-based company previously attracted the interest of activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which clinched an agreement in 2020 to shake up Merit's board of directors. 
Both GTCR and CD&R are prolific investors in health and medical device businesses and have been seeking to capitalize on a wave of consolidation sweeping the industry.
One of GTCR's portfolio companies, vaccine reagent provider Maravai LifeSciences Holdings Inc, turned down an $11 billion acquisition offer from laboratory supplies vendor Sartorius AG in February, sources told Reuters at the time. It remains possible that the companies will negotiate a deal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it is naming a new head of its aircraft certification service as the agency works to implement significant reforms Congress ordered in December 2020.
The FAA said effective on May 8 Lirio Liu, who directs the FAA's International Affairs office, will become the new executive director of its Aircraft Certification Service replacing Earl Lawrence, who is moving to a new role at the FAA.
The move comes days after FAA Administrator Steve Dickson stepped down and Billy Nolen, the FAA’s aviation safety chief, was named acting administrator effective April 1.
There have been a number of other personnel changes recently at the FAA. On Wednesday, the National Business Aviation Administration said it was naming the FAA's acting aviation safety chief Chris Rocheleau as its new chief operating officer.
Rocheleau had been named acting aviation safety chief on April 1. 
Congress approved dramatic reforms to how the FAA certifies new airplanes after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes in five months killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month-grounding.
Dickson told Congress last year the FAA is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and the FAA is reviewing a number of issues involving Boeing.
The legislation requires disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said the FAA reform law ""was a clear course correction. It said that we needed to have stronger FAA oversight, the people in place to do that job, and to hold manufacturers accountable.""
The FAA has warned Boeing that it may not be able to win certification for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 variant by December. 
House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio on Wednesday noted the MAX 10 does ""not have an advanced flight crew alerting system"" that became an industry standard in 1982 and is on every current Airbus and Boeing model in production except for the 737s.

DeFazio noted the ""aircraft certification bill gave the FAA a two-year grace period to certify aircraft without the advanced flight crew alerting system, but that grace period should not be extended.""
Boeing said it continues to work with the FAA ""to provide the information they need and remain committed to meeting their expectations regarding 737-10 certification.""

The department had asked Judge Amit Mehta in a court filing to sanction Google, saying the company's ""Communicate with Care"" program, which asked employees to add a lawyer to many emails, was sometimes a ""game"" to shield communications that did not genuinely fall under attorney-client privilege. Google responded that it did nothing wrong.
Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said that there were an ""eye-popping"" 140,000 documents originally slated as falling under attorney-client privilege but that 98,000 or those were quickly given to the government. But he also said that he was ""not sure a federal court has the authority"" to sanction that practice since it occurred before the government filed its lawsuit.
John Schmidtlein, Google's attorney in the case, said that 21,000 of the emails were still at issue.

Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lawyer, asked that Google be sanctioned for the practice and be required to turn over the 21,000 emails. He argued that the practice cost the government valuable time in putting together its case. 
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit against Google in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law in its handling of its search business. Trial was set for September 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - Munich Re is planning new wordings in cyber insurance policies to exclude war, to avoid disputes over what is covered, the reinsurer's top cyber underwriter told Reuters.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fears of cyber attacks, with the risk that Western businesses or government institutions could be targeted.
Most cyber policies cover companies against business interruption losses and the repair of hacked networks following a cyber attack, but exclude war. However, grey areas in the wordings leave insurers open to claims as a result of cyber war.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said last week that insurance losses from the Ukraine conflict could total $35 billion, with cyber one of the classes of insurance most exposed.
Munich Re is seeking clearer war exclusion clauses in cyber policies, based on wording developed last year in the Lloyd's of London market.
The invasion of Ukraine was not a ""classic cyber war,"" said Juergen Reinhart, chief underwriter, cyber, at Munich Re, but he said it was best to be prepared.
""Let's not wait...but act now.""
Munich Re said last month it was winding down business in Russia. 
AIG (NYSE:AIG), one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is considering cutting cover for Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reported on Friday.
Munich Re was looking to bring in new wordings on its direct cyber insurance products, Reinhart said. The reinsurer was also suggesting to its cyber insurer clients that they introduce similar clauses. 
Ambiguous business interruption policy wordings led to a slew of court cases across the world in the past two years over whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic was covered by insurance.
“We have learnt this lesson as an industry in respect of the pandemic - how painful it is if you have unclear wordings,"" said Reinhart. 
""Our intention is to have very, very clear wordings...and avoid surprises.""

Julia Graham (NYSE:GHM), chief executive of UK insurance buyers' association Airmic, said clarity was needed.
""There has been a lot of uncertainty among Airmic members around war exclusions, especially for their cyber policies,"" she said.
""The lack of standardised policy wordings on cyber in the market has certainly not helped things."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America on Friday voiced support for the securities regulator's proposal requiring U.S.-listed companies to disclose their climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled the draft rule last month, aiming to help investors better understand the ""actual or likely material impacts"" climate-related risks will have on a company's business, strategy and outlook.
""We think the proposal is constructive and headed in the right direction,"" said Paul Donofrio, head of sustainability at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the country's second-biggest bank by assets.
The bank is still reviewing the SEC's 500-plus-page draft rule and plans to submit a comment letter by the regulator's deadline. 
Among the proposed rule's key requirements, companies must disclose their own direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as those generated by suppliers and partners, known as Scope 3 emissions.
""We are all in on this notion of companies providing the marketplace with disclosures that will help everybody understand what the emission status is at a company and what their plans are to get to net zero ... so that market participants can allocate capital to the best and highest use,"" Donofrio told reporters.
Donofrio, who spent six years as the bank's chief financial officer, cautioned that Scope 3 emissions are currently hard for the majority of companies to calculate accurately but said the bank supports phasing in those disclosures later. 

""Scope three disclosures, today, might be subject to a lot of uncertainty, would not get the assurance, therefore not be trusted and it might call into a question other disclosures,"" Donofrio said.
He added that the bank supports a price on carbon, which could reflect ""its true cost to society so that people will see the value of those investments"".

The executive pay proposal will be put to an advisory vote at Goldman's annual general meeting scheduled on April 28.
""We are concerned about special, one-off grants to the CEO and COO considering their quantum and structural issues,"" Glass Lewis said in a note to Goldman's investors, seen by Reuters on Friday.
Goldman declined to respond to Reuters request for comment.
The opposition from Glass Lewis comes against the backdrop of a talent war on Wall Street, with rising inflation and a tight labor market forcing big U.S. banks to pay more to woo and retain employees.
In a regulatory filing October last year, Goldman said it would grant performance-based stock worth $30 million to Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, and $20 million in stock to John Waldron, the bank's president and chief operating officer. The awards would be paid out in October 2026.

The bank later expanded the awards in January to include other members of the top management. 
Goldman's stock has dived nearly 16% so far this year, as financial firms continue to grapple with the economic fallout of the Ukraine crisis and the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy.

Since the start of war in Ukraine, the EU has blacklisted around 700 people linked to the Kremlin or accused of supporting the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". That has not always, however, led to a quick freezing of assets, amid legal hurdles and sometimes lack of political will.
The new measures will hit over 200 additional individuals, mostly from the separatist regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, and also top businessmen, politicians and military staff close to the Kremlin. 
Another 18 entities have also been hit by asset freezes, including four banks, such as VTB, and military firms, nearly doubling the number of companies hit by sanctions since the start of the war.
Herman Gref, the head of Sberbank, has been added to the EU blacklist, according to the document, in a move that is important symbolically. The EU has so far refrained from sanctioning the bank, which plays a key role in energy payments.
Putin's daughters Ekaterina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova have also now been sanctioned for benefiting from the Russian government, the document said.
Putin had already been sanctioned in an early round of restrictive measures, although it is unclear how many assets, if any, he and his family hold in the EU.
Wealthy oligarchs usually use front men or anonymous shell companies and trusts to shield their assets, making it very hard if not impossible for investigators to identify them, especially in jurisdictions with lax rules on companies' beneficial owners.

Oil company Surgutneftegas' executive Vladimir Bogdanov, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal, Oleg Deripaska, billionaire Boris Rotenberg, major shareholder in Russia's top gold miner Polyus Said Kerimov, and the chief of Russian e-commerce platform Ozon Alexander Shulgin have also been sanctioned.
The new listings are part of the EU's fifth package of sanctions against Russia, which include a ban on coal imports and restrictions for entry into the EU for Russian vessels and lorries.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Mauricio Claver-Carone, on Friday said he was the target of an ""anonymous political media campaign"" after Reuters reported the bank's directors were looking into an accusation that he had an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.
IDB directors met this week to discuss hiring an outside firm to investigate allegations that Claver-Carone had carried out an intimate relationship with a staffer, Reuters reported exclusively. 
The news agency was unable to confirm the claims about the alleged relationship, which, if verified, would appear to be against the bank's rules. Claver-Carone has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
At an event on Friday, which was streamed online, Claver-Carone criticized an ""anonymous political media campaign"" against him and said he had evidence of the truth and hoped to have the opportunity to defend himself. He did not directly address the specific allegations, which were made in an anonymous letter.
""Trust me, I would love to present to all of you today the direct evidence which I have - not circumstantial, not hearsay, not anonymous - but direct evidence of truth,"" Claver-Carone said in opening remarks at an IDB event.
""I do hope I am given the opportunity to officially present my case and information,"" he added, saying he would respect the confidentiality of the ongoing process.
He alleged that some people at the bank were ""weaponizing an anonymous letter to orchestrate a media campaign,"" without giving evidence.
The IDB declined to comment on Claver-Carone's remarks.

The bank's directors met again on Thursday and drafted a resolution to hire an external firm to investigate the allegations which must be approved by the board of governors, a bank source said. The directors decided not to propose removing Claver-Carone from his duties, the bank source added.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 02:47PM ET</span>",Beaten-down growth stocks alluring as Fed slows U.S. economy,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are looking for bargains in beaten-down growth and tech stocks, betting they will shine as the Federal Reserve fights to slow the US economy and tame red-hot inflation.
Growth stocks – which have trounced their valued-focused peers over the last decade – have borne the brunt of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish turn this year, with the Russell 1000 Growth index down more than 11% year-to-date, compared to a more-than 5% loss for the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
By contrast, value stocks – often defined as shares of economically sensitive companies trading at a discount to their total worth – are broadly flat on the year. 
Underpinning those moves is the perception that the Fed’s fight against inflation will keep interest rates climbing, eroding the future cash flows that growth stocks are heavily valued on. Value stocks, meanwhile, have found support from a strong economy and surging commodity prices. 
That dynamic could change if the Fed’s tightening monetary policy slows the economy. That would boost the appeal of growth names for some investors who believe their profits rely less on broader economic strength. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month and has hinted at meatier increases ahead.[L2N2W41S3]
Expectations of an aggressive Fed briefly turned the spread between yields on two and 10-year Treasuries negative last week, a phenomenon that is often seen as an indication of worries about economic growth. Recessions have followed six of the last seven yield curve inversions since 1978, according to data from Truist Advisory Services. 
“If these recession fears grow, then you are going to have a big shift away from value stocks,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank, who has been increasing her stake in technology stocks. “Sustainable earnings growth … will become more important again.” 
Growth stocks have tended to outperform in the six months following yield curve inversions, with the Russell 1000 Growth Index rising by an average of 6.4% during such periods since 1978, compared to a 4.4 % gain for value stocks, data from CFRA showed. Growth stocks have fallen by an average of 0.6% during recessions, while value stocks have fallen by an average 6.8%, according to CFRA data. 
The Russell 1000 Growth Index is up 320% over the last 10 years, compared to an 145% rise for its value-focused counterpart.
Earnings season kicks off next week, giving investors a closer look at how companies have fared at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and rising commodity prices. Also on tap is the latest US consumer prices report, due out on Tuesday. The S&P 500 is on track to close down 1% this week, as worries over a more aggressive Fed slow a rally that saw the index pare its year-to-date losses last month. [L2N2W411P]
Overall, investors have sent a net $4.2 billion to the Invesco QQQ Trust - which tracks the growth-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index - over the last three weeks, the fund's longest streak of positive inflows since January, Lipper data showed. 
Mayukh Poddar, a portfolio manager of Altfest Personal Wealth Management, has increased exposure to growth stocks in healthcare such as Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and mega-cap tech names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in anticipation that the Fed's hawkish tilt will slow the economy, hurting value stocks. 
""The Fed is telling us ... that fighting inflation has become their priority and the only way they can fight that is to slow down demand,"" he said. 
Some on Wall Street are skeptical of a bounce in growth stocks, especially as bond yields continue soaring. Yields on the US benchmark 10-year Treasury recently hit 2.71%, their highest level since 2019. 
“The period of extremely low interest rates was very good for growth stocks ― and very challenging for value investors,” wrote Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer, U.S. Fundamental Equities at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), in a recent note. “The road ahead is likely to be different, restoring some of the appeal of a value strategy.” 
Others believe it is just a matter of picking the right stocks. 

Moustapha Mounah, an assistant portfolio manager with James Investment, has cut his energy stock exposure to 8% of his portfolio from 12%, while moving into software companies such as Abobe and SalesForce that he expects will be able to raise prices amid continued high inflation. 
""The growth stocks that are really getting hurt are the speculative names, but there are many companies out there that will do well regardless of the cycle in the economy,"" he said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Negotiators from  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss a possible end to a strike at the company’s oil refinery in Richmond, California, spokespeople for both sides said.
The talks will be the first face-to-face meeting in nearly two weeks between Chevron and USW Local 12-5. Some 500 workers at the 245,271 barrel-per-day refinery formally began the strike on March 21 after the two sides failed to reach agreement on a new labor contract.
Chevron has continued to operate the refinery, its second largest in California, with managers and supervisors. The plant provides about 20% of Northern California's gasoline and 60% of the jet fuel used at area airports, according to Chevron. 
""We look forward to continuing formal discussions,” said Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich. 
The two sides have held informal talks in recent days, said Kruzich and B.K. White, first vice president of Local 12-5. 
The union began the strike after members of Local 12-5 had twice rejected the company’s contract proposal. They are seeking a 5% pay increase on top of the 12%-over-four-years national wage increase agreed to by the USW International union and U.S. refinery owners. 
The union has said it sought the additional pay because most of the wage increases in recent years were eaten up by high health insurance and housing costs in California. 

The refinery has reported at least two malfunctions since the stoppage began, according to state filings. It is preparing to shut the crude distillation unit for a planned overhaul in mid-April. Those units do the primary refining of crude oil and provide feedstocks for all other units.
One of the malfunctions forced the temporary shutdown of a jet fuel hydrotreater, which pushed prices upward in California markets temporarily. Jet fuel and diesel prices have fallen this week.

A second labor group, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which was losing a bid to organize an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Alabama, also filed objections on Thursday to that union election.
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is giving Amazon until April 22 to back up its objections to last week's election in New York, in which Staten Island workers voted to form the company's first U.S. union. Amazon had requested extra time to provide evidence because its objections are ""substantial,"" it said in a filing Wednesday.
A certified election result would give organized labor a foothold in the United States' second-largest private employer, with the potential to alter how Amazon manages its finely tuned operation.
Some 55% of workers who voted in the election at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island opted to join the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has demanded higher pay and job security. Since the result, U.S. workers from another 50 Amazon sites have contacted the union, the group's leader has said.
Among Amazon's planned objections to the outcome are that the ALU interfered with employees in line to vote and that long waits depressed turnout, Amazon's filing said. Some 58% of eligible voters cast ballots in person over several days.
Eric Milner, an attorney representing the ALU from law firm Simon & Milner, dismissed Amazon's claims as false and said they would be overruled.
""To say that the Amazon Labor Union was threatening employees is really absurd,"" he said. ""The Amazon Labor Union is Amazon employees.""
Separately on Thursday, the RWDSU objected to the election in Bessemer, Alabama, in which Amazon workers voted against unionizing. It was the second election in Bessemer, after the NLRB determined that Amazon had improperly interfered in the first contest there last year. The most recent outcome is pending in light of hundreds of challenged ballots and now the RWDSU's objections, which could delay a result for months.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, “We want our employees’ voices to be heard, and we hope the NLRB counts every valid vote.”
In a filing, the RWDSU said Amazon unlawfully removed pro-union literature from non-work areas and terminated an employee who spoke in favor of the union during mandatory work meetings, among other objections. The RWDSU said these were grounds for the NLRB to set aside the result.
Amazon itself took issue with the RWDSU's conduct, such as the union's communications with workers around the use of a mailbox on warehouse property, adding that its filing objections is standard process.
The retailer faces a high bar in demonstrating that the New York union violated rules for engagement with employees that influenced the outcome, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.

In addition, the NLRB typically treats employers' alleged violations more seriously than alleged wrongdoing by unions because companies have greater power over workers, he said.
""It's going to be really tough"" for Amazon, he said.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",Analysis: Warner Bros Discovery's Zaslav takes over as streaming bubble bursts,"By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - As David Zaslav prepares to take over as head of Hollywood's new powerhouse, the soon-to-be formed Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), he’ll confront a challenge few anticipated last May, when the $43 billion merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc was announced -- how to make streaming video as profitable as the old TV business it's replacing.
Nearly two years after AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia division launched its HBO Max streaming service in May 2020 to challenge market-leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Wall Street has grown skeptical of streaming’s long-term prospects, citing the significant and ongoing investments in new content and an uncertain future for even market leaders like Netflix. The reassessment came in January, as the world's largest streaming service forecast modest growth for its first quarter. 
HBO Max, which houses the Warner Bros film library that includes the ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"" franchises, classic television series such as long-running NBC sitcom “Friends” and contemporary dramas such as HBO’s “Euphoria,” ended 2021 with nearly 74 million subscribers globally, though its former parent company, AT&T, did not report its operating income. 
Zaslav will need to balance the financing of its streaming businesses, which will include the Discovery+ service and the newly launched CNN+, with supporting its cash-generating but declining cable television businesses, say Hollywood veterans who know the executive and spoke with Reuters about the challenges. 
“Streaming is an incredibly capital-intensive business. HBO Max has a huge head start in terms of brand, library, and creative abilities. But it’s competitive, so how do you stand out from the competitive crowd?” media analyst Michael Nathanson told Reuters. “How do you make sure you don’t under-invest in linear, in favor of digital?”
Warner Bros Discovery will be saddled with $55 billion in debt mostly tied to the merger, limiting Zaslav’s options. He already signaled in February that he had no plans to ""win the spending war"" against Disney's $33 billion content budget or the $17 billion that Netflix spent in 2021.
""He can’t make the purely strategic choices that a Disney can make, because they have the balance sheet to do that,” said one executive. “He has to be practical in how he navigates from the old media to the new.”
Warner Bros Discovery’s chief executive also is stepping into a minefield left by his predecessor, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who angered Hollywood’s creative community when the film studio announced it would release its 2021 movies on HBO Max and in theaters on the same day. 
Since the deal's announcement Zaslav has been busy taking meetings and meals with Hollywood producers, agents and others, to hear their concerns and solicit advice. 
“I think a lot of Hollywood is rooting for him to succeed,” said producer Jason Blum. “Unlike some of his colleagues and his competitors, he’s over the past year made a huge effort in terms of outreach ... He’s curious. He loves storytelling ... That can’t be said for a lot of people in that same job.”
Closer to home Zaslav also will need to boost morale on the Warner Bros studio lot, where the rounds of reorganizations, firings and strategy changes have taken a “psychological toll,” one former executive said.

The biggest unknown, Hollywood executives said, is how Zaslav, who has a reputation as a hands-on executive, and favors flat organizations, will manage a vastly larger media empire, with an estimated 30,000 employees, or about three-times the size of Discovery. This week, nine senior executives departed WarnerMedia. 
“The biggest kind of challenge is how does he prioritize his time?” said one veteran studio executive. “This is a very different animal than the non-scripted cable business.”

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 was flat Friday, as gains in financials and energy offset weakness in tech stocks amid pressure from higher Treasury yields ahead of the start of quarterly earnings season next week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.64%, or 225 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.89%.
Technology stocks, which are on course to snap a three-week winning streak, kept the broader market in the red as investors remain wary of growth sectors of the market in the wake of surging Treasury yields.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.7% for the first time in more than three years on expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to stem inflation.
The Fed’s March meeting minutes showed that Fed members appear “poised to hike rates 50bps in May, and initiate a sizable drawdown of the balance sheet beginning next month,” Stifel said in a note.
Big tech, excluding Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), fell more than 1%, while an ongoing decline in the chip stocks added pressure on the broader tech sector.  
Banking stocks, which have been under pressure in recent sessions on worries that a potential recession could increase bad debt for banks, finally found some reprieve as investors looked ahead to quarterly results from major Wall Street banks next week.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reports results on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday.
""Banks are good place to be in the upcoming economic environment not just because rates are going up, but I think the consumer still is in a position of strength,"" Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
While rising rates boost lending margins and profitability for banks, the pace of the increase in rates has driven up borrowing costs and impacted demand. The red-hot pace of increasing rates will be determined by whether the Fed's follows through on its hawkish plan to tighten monetary policy.
""Most people believe that the Fed is going be very hawkish and and cause a recession, but I just don't think that they will,"" Lee added. ""If the economic data starts to look ugly, I think they will stop tightening immediately."" 
Energy stocks were up more than 2%, buoyed by rising oil prices as investors weigh up the prospect of energy supply disruptions after the European Union confirmed new sanctions including a coal embargo against Russia over the latter’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Russia is being forced to scale back its oil production due to the strike by buyers in the West,” Commerzbank said in a note.
Russia is reportedly producing 500,000 barrels per day less than the March average, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) added, citing a report from Bloomberg.
Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were among the biggest gainers with the latter up more than 6%.
In earnings news, WD-40 (NASDAQ:WDFC)’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue offset softer full-year guidance, sending its share price more than 7% higher."
546,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 01:55PM ET</span>","Rouble falls after rallying, stocks down on new U.S. sanctions","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble on Friday hit its strongest level against the euro since June 2020 after an unexpected central bank rate cut, but soon reversed gains and ended the day in the red, while stocks fell after the U.S. Congress voted to ban Russian oil. 
The central bank cut its key interest rate to 17% from 20% ahead of a regular board meeting scheduled for April 29, and said it was open to possible further cuts at upcoming meetings.
The volatile rouble rallied shortly after the rate cut, which partially reversed the emergency rate hike that the central bank delivered in late February after Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. But the once-free-floating Russian currency finished trading on the Moscow Exchange at levels seen on Thursday.
The rouble eased 0.4% to 76.08 against the dollar, having briefly hit its strongest level since November of 71.
Against the euro, the rouble shed 1.5% to 82.70 after briefly touching 77.0750 for the first time since late June 2020.
The rouble's rapid recovery from the record lows hit in March raises doubts about the durability of its gains. Anyone who tries to buy foreign currency online at a bank in Russia or, illegally, at a foreign exchange booth, or who buys goods and services online denominated in foreign currencies will find the actual rate considerably worse.
Yields on 10-year OFZ treasury bonds, which move inversely to their prices, fell to 10.77% from 11.62% seen before the rate cut.
The surprise rate cut came after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said this week that his ministry was working with the central bank on measures to make the rouble exchange rate more predictable and less volatile.
""If the experience of the 2014/15 rouble crisis is any guide, a large interest rate cut (like that seen today) is likely to be followed by much more gradual easing as the CBR targets a large positive real interest rate to bring inflation back down to its target,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
LockoInvest firm said it has revised its year-end rate forecast to 11-12% from not more than 15%.
VOLATILE MARKETS
Moves in the rouble remain jittery and trading volumes on the Moscow Exchange are below average, but the rouble has fully recovered to levels seen before Russian troops entered Ukraine.
The rouble is supported by Russia's strong current account surplus amid high commodity prices as well as Russia's capital controls, said Olga Belenkaya, head of macro research at Finam brokerage.
The rouble has recently been steered by the mandatory conversion of dollar and euro revenues by export-focused companies, while demand for forex is limited by a ban on buying cash dollars and euros as well as by a 12% commission on buying forex online or through a bank.
Given the latest rouble firming, some recovery in demand for FX is possible despite the commission, Otkritie bank said in a note.
On the stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index fell 1.14% to 1,079.99 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index fell 1.6% to 2,592.7 points.

Shares in oil firm Bashneft underperformed the market, losing 4.5% on the day, while shares in rival Lukoil were down 1%. 
Oil stocks took a hit after the U.S. Congress on Thursday voted to impose further economic pain on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, passing a measure to remove its ""most favoured nation"" trade status and another to ban oil imports, which puts into law a previous executive order by President Joe Biden.

""Due to the logistical difficulties, vehicle exports and parts supply to Russia have been suspended since March,"" Mitsubishi said in a statement.
Japan has joined the United States and other allies in slapping additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing assets of the country's leaders and three financial institutions, to punish Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24.
Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, said in late March it would have to close the Kaluga plant shortly as it was running out of parts.
It was not immediately clear whether Stellantis had halted its operations too in Kaluga.
The company, which had earlier suspended all exports of cars to Russia as well as all imports from Russia, was not immediately available for comment on Friday.

Stellantis has also said it was moving its current production to western Europe and freezing plans for more investments in Russia, while keeping van production in Kaluga just for the local market.
New car sales in Russia fell 62.9% year-on-year in March, contracting for a ninth straight month, as the industry encountered an acute shortage and soaring prices caused by a sharp rouble drop and disrupted logistics.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 01:05PM ET</span>","GIP, Brookfield waiting on Atlantia as Benettons study rival bid","By Stephen Jewkes and Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) -Investment funds Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield are not contemplating any ""hostile"" move on Italy's road and airport operator Atlantia as a rival bid takes shape, two sources said on Friday.
The two funds said this week they had pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia to its main shareholder Edizione, a holding company controlled by the Benetton family.
But Edizione, which owns 33% of Atlantia, said it had no interest in the funds' project. It added that talks were under way with Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) on a deal of their own to strengthen its grip on the infrastructure group.
""GIP and Brookfield are in wait-and-see mode ... but there are no plans at present to launch any hostile bid,"" a source familiar with the matter said.
The two funds have an agreement with Florentino Perez's ACS for the Spanish construction company to acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer is completed.
The funds declined to comment.
The proposal, presented to the Benettons on March 30, leaves it up to Edizione to decide if it wants to remain shareholder of a group that would then be delisted, one of the sources said.
""The Benettons reject the idea of a break-up of Atlantia and also do not want to be cut out from the governance of the group,"" a third source said.
The funds' unsolicited approach comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a transaction aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
Edizione and Blackstone, which were already exploring options for the future of Atlantia before the two funds' approach, are now working on a counter-move that may lead to the group being taken private, sources have told Reuters.
Any deal involving Atlantia would require the blessing of the Italian government that has special veto powers on strategic assets such as airports and electronic payment networks like Atlantia's Telepass unit.
Shares in Atlantia rose sharply on Friday after a report Edizione and Blackstone could launch a bid at about 24 euros per share around Easter. They ended up 8.7% at 22.07 euros.
Edizione and Blackstone declined to comment on the report in daily Il Messaggero which cited banking sources directly involved in the matter. 

A price of 24 euros would value the group as a whole at around 50 billion euros ($21.7 billion), if 30 billion euros of net debt is taken into account. 
GIP and Brookfield are working with Rothschild and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) while Edizione and Blackstone have enlisted the help of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), separate sources told Reuters. ($1 = 0.9211 euros)

(Reuters) -European shares rallied on Friday to erase weekly losses, while investors focused on a tight race between far-right rival Marine Le Pen and incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the runup to the first round of French presidential elections over the weekend.
Financials and commodity stocks led the gains with all major sectors in positive territory. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 1.3% and ended the week about 0.5% higher, with healthcare stocks firming the most on the week.
Topping the index was Banco BPM's 10.2% surge, after French bank Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) said it has bought a 9.2% stake in Italy's third-largest bank.
""European markets are mostly playing catch up with the U.S. from yesterday's close,"" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Private Bank, adding that investors are waiting to get a sense of what earnings could look like with big U.S. banks set to kick off next week. [.N]
""Traders have shrugged off the negative headlines about additional sanctions on Russia, as well as the chatter about higher interest rates from the Fed,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. 
""But by and large, it was a negative week for equities as countries revealed plans to target Russia’s energy exports.""
The European Union formally adopted its fifth package of sanctions against Russia on Friday, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products.
Despite a 12% recovery from one-year lows hit in March, the STOXX 600 index is still down more than 6% this year on worries that surging inflation due to the Ukraine war will trigger central bank moves that could squeeze growth. 
In Sunday's first round of election in France, centre-left Macron is seen winning, but rival Marine Le Pen has surged in polls in recent weeks, leaving her victory within the margins of error. The two leading candidates from the vote will head to a run-off on April 24.
Barclay's Lafargue said despite the polls, the turnout or lack thereof could swing the election. 
France's CAC 40 index rose 1.3%, but is down about 2% this week - the most among European peers - on election uncertainty.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 11:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive-AIG looks at cutting insurance for Russia, Ukraine -sources","By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - AIG (NYSE:AIG), one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is considering cutting cover for Russia and Ukraine, to shield itself from the risk of hefty claims as sanctions ratchet up and the war drags on, an insurance broker and a source familiar with the matter said.
AIG is looking at adding exclusion clauses to policies for businesses operating in the region across a range of policies, according to the two sources who declined to be identified. 
Other major insurers are also looking to exclude Russia, Ukraine and even Belarus from a range of policies, the sources said, citing some insurers and policyholders.
Reuters could not determine if the potential reduction in cover would apply across all AIG policies in the countries. The insurer declined to comment. 
""What we are now seeing are the underwriters starting to introduce Russia, Ukraine wording into their policies,"" said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Schnur, managing director, U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader at insurance broker Marsh, declining to name the insurers.
Brokers such as Marsh act as intermediaries between corporate customers and insurers, and sometimes get involved in drawing up policies.
If AIG were to cut back cover for businesses and companies operating in Russia and Ukraine it would be the first major insurer to do so, potentially paving the way for others to follow suit.
While Russia has become a no-go zone for many companies due to sanctions imposed in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, some multinationals continue to do business there as well as in Ukraine in sectors ranging from agriculture to energy. They require insurance to keep their businesses open.
Local companies also rely on insurance for damage to goods, buildings and vehicles and for injury or loss of life of employees. Reuters could not determine how much of AIG's business in Russia and Ukraine was focused on domestic firms.
AIG, which recorded net written premiums in general insurance totalling more than $26 billion last year, has operations in Russia, according to its website, and is a major global player in sectors such as energy, construction and cyber.
'NON-NEGOTIABLE'
Sanctions on Russia are already forcing insurers to pull back from coverage of restricted Russian entities and individuals, while UK and European sanctions on aviation insurance extend beyond individual companies to all Russian firms.
Insurance brokers such as Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) have frozen operations in Russia, while reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) are among companies which have said they will not write new business in the country, whether potential policyholders are sanctioned or not.
But AIG and other underwriters are looking at going further, adding wordings into insurance policies to exclude cover for Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian and Ukrainian operations of Western businesses, industry sources say.
Insurers are concerned about reputational damage of doing business in Russia and they are also worried about property damage and delayed payments in Ukraine, where the economy has been pulverized by the war.
Some policyholders are already struggling to find insurance.
François Malan, chief risk and compliance officer at French engineering firm Eiffage, said last week that he was forced to accept an insurance exclusion for transporting cargo in waters near Ukraine.
""It was non-negotiable, it was not a question of price - it was non-covered,"" he said.
Ships sailing into waters around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, which include Ukraine's coast, need to have additional war risk insurance which means paying a separate premium. 
Some insurers are also cutting provision of this type of insurance due to the growing perils, which include being hit by projectiles or floating mines, marine insurance sources say.
PANDEMIC PLAYBOOK
Insurers generally add certain types of exclusion in policies exposed to potential conflict, such as during the South Korea winter Olympics, but do not usually exclude entire regions, as in the case of the Ukraine crisis.
The move to exclude risky areas of their business mirrors insurers' behaviour following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Faced with losses estimated at $100 billion, insurers rushed to exclude first COVID-19 and then all pandemics from policies. 
After also putting up premium rates, many of them reported strong profits in 2021, the second full year of the pandemic. Some industry sources say losses were smaller than originally anticipated as a result of those actions.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) last week estimated commercial insurers' losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict could total as much as $35 billion.

S&P said the insurance sectors likely to be most impacted were aviation, trade credit, political risk such as nationalisation, cyber, political violence and marine war.
Swiss Re said on Thursday that insurance and reinsurance losses from the invasion were likely to come in around the same as a medium-sized natural catastrophe loss such as from a hurricane.

Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds and which competes with  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) unit De Beers, produced about 30% of the global output in 2021. It exports mostly to Belgium, India, and the United Arab Emirates.
Washington on Thursday placed Alrosa on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which effectively kicks a sanctioned company out of the U.S. banking system and bans its trade with Americans, complicating operations in the global diamond market.
Alrosa said that the U.S. sanctions along with previous British sanctions on the miner make it technically impossible to make a coupon payment on its Eurobond of $11.6 million due on April 9.
Alrosa is ""studying the options of the proper fulfilment of its obligations under the Notes,"" it added in a statement. It did not provide any further comment on the U.S. sanctions.
It employs more than 32,000 people and mines diamonds in Russia's far east, where the climate is harsh and chances for miners to find other job are limited.
""Diamonds are one of Russia's top 10 non-energy exports by value, with exports in 2021 totalling over $4.5 billion,"" the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in a statement announcing expanded sanctions.

After Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation, the OFAC restricted Alrosa's ability to raise new debt and equity in the United States.
Alrosa also has a 41% stake in Angolan diamond production firm Catoca, but Catoca should not be affected by the U.S. sanctions given the OFAC said only entities owned 50% or more by Alrosa were being blocked.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd received an alumina shipment from Russia's Rusal in late March, weeks after saying it was severing ties with Russian businesses over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, an analysis of shipping data showed on Friday. 
The shipment illustrates how complicated and slow it can be for companies operating in an interconnected global economy to deliver on promises to cut links with Russia. 
Unlike a number of other Russian companies, Rusal is not the target of sanctions, although its billionaire founder Oleg Deripaska is. 
Rio Tinto declined to comment on the shipment and reiterated a March 10 statement to Reuters that said: ""Rio Tinto is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business.""
Rusal declined Reuters' requests for comment. 
On March 24 a bulk cargo vessel exited Rusal's Aughinish refinery in Ireland, which produces the aluminium feedstock alumina, Refinitiv shipping data shows. 
It travelled north to Iceland, where it moored in Straumsvik, home of Rio Tinto's ISAL aluminium smelter, on March 29. On April 1 the ship left Straumsvik and headed back to Aughinish, where it arrived on the evening of April 4. 
A source close to Rio Tinto said disentangling business ties with Russia takes time as the company needed to find alternative supplies. 
Rio Tinto also supplies bauxite from its mine in Brazil to Aughinish, but the shipping data indicated it had not delivered ore to the Rusal refinery in the past 30 days. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine - that Russia terms a ""special military operation"" - and the backlash against it have wreaked havoc on Rusal's supply chains.
Australia, the world's top bauxite producer, has banned exports of the aluminium ore to Russia.

Rio Tinto said on Friday it had taken sole charge of operations and production at Australian refiner Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd, in which Rusal owns a 20% stake. 
Miner and trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) said last week it would continue to honour its legal obligations under pre-existing contracts with Russian entities, but would not enter into any new trading business in respect of ""Russian origin commodities"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Shehbaz Sharif, the person most likely to be Pakistan's next prime minister, is little known outside his home country but has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician.
The younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz, 70, is leading a bid by the opposition in parliament to topple Imran Khan, and if a vote of no-confidence goes ahead on Saturday he is widely expected to replace Khan.
Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan's military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy in the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people.
Pakistan's generals have directly intervened to topple civilian governments three times, and no prime minister has finished a full five-year term since the South Asian state's independence from Britain in 1947.
Shehbaz Sharif, part of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, is best known for his direct, ""can-do"" administrative style, which was on display when, as chief minister of Punjab province, he worked closely with China on Beijing-funded projects.
He also said in an interview last week that good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan's recently antagonistic relationship with Washington.
There are still several procedural steps before Sharif can become Pakistan's 23rd prime minister, not including caretaker administrations, although the opposition has consistently identified him as its sole candidate.
If he does take on the role, he faces immediate challenges, not least Pakistan's crumbling economy, which has been hit by high inflation, a tumbling local currency and rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves.
Analysts also say Sharif will not act with complete independence as he will have to work on a collective agenda with the others opposition parties and his brother.
Nawaz has lived for the last two years in London since being let out of jail, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, for medical treatment.
'PUNJAB SPEED'
As chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, Shehbaz Sharif planned and executed a number of ambitious infrastructure mega-projects, including Pakistan's first modern mass transport system in his hometown, the eastern city of Lahore.
According to local media, the outgoing Chinese consul general wrote to Sharif last year praising his ""Punjab Speed"" execution of projects under the huge China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.
The diplomat also said Sharif and his party would be friends of China in government or in opposition.
On Afghanistan, Islamabad is under international pressure to prod the Taliban to meet its human rights commitments while trying to limit instability there.
Unlike Khan, who has regularly denounced India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sharif political dynasty has been more dovish towards the fellow nuclear-armed neighbour, with which Pakistan has fought three wars.
In terms of his relationship with the powerful military, Sharif has long played the public ""good cop"" to Nawaz's ""bad cop"" - the latter has had several public spats with the army.
Shehbaz was born in Lahore into a wealthy industrial family and was educated locally. After that he entered the family business and jointly owns a Pakistani steel company.
He entered politics in Punjab, becoming its chief minister for the first time in 1997 before he was caught up in national political upheaval and imprisoned following a military coup. He was then sent into exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000.
Shehbaz returned from exile in 2007 to resume his political career, again in Punjab.
He entered the national political scene when he became the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party after Nawaz was found guilty in 2017 on charges of concealing assets related to the Panama Papers revelations.

The Sharif family and supporters say the cases were politically motivated.
Both brothers have faced numerous corruption cases in the National Accountability Bureau, including under Khan's premiership, but Shehbaz has not been found guilty on any charges.

The bank generated about $300 million in the first quarter from dealing in bonds and derivatives tied to inflation, about double the tally of the same period a year ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lender’s traders made much of their money from euro-based transactions, an already-surging market that has jumped to unprecedented levels since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the person said.
The post-lockdown surge in consumer prices since last year may have spawned a global cost-of-living crisis but it has turned into a goldmine for traders who focus on inflation. Goldman Sachs made about $450 million from the business for all of 2021, double what the firm made in previous years, Bloomberg reported in February.  
Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in London, declined to comment. 
Euro-area inflation in March jumped past analysts’ forecasts to 7.5%, the highest year-on-year rate in the history of the single currency. Households and businesses across the European Union have been slammed with hikes in energy costs as the Russian invasion roils the continent’s access to oil and gas, worsening a crisis in the cost of commodities that set in last year. 
The rise in prices has forced governments across the bloc to spend billions of dollars on aid programs. The European Central Bank may raise interest rates to deal with inflation that’s now more than three times its 2% target. In France, Marine Le Pen has targeted the issue in her campaign to oust President Emmanuel Macron in elections that begin this Sunday. 
Investors have rushed to protect their holdings and speculate for short-term gains. The cost of options that pay out if inflation climbs above 2% -- viewed in the market as a form of insurance -- have climbed to previously-unseen levels. 
For Goldman Sachs, the geopolitical volatility has meant more profit. Nikhil Choraria, who helps oversee the inflation-trading business in London, has thrived by predicting the surge in the continent’s prices. 
a
Choraria has focused on derivatives tied to short-term or “front-end” inflation, the person said. This market became increasingly volatile during the first quarter as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, according to Michael Riddell, who manages about $8 billion at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. This kind of uncertainty can make traders a lot of money, he said.
“It’s not uncommon for bank trading desks to make money when you have big volatility events, although a few can also lose money too if they get caught on the wrong side,” Riddell said. “Front-end inflation markets were as volatile as it gets.”

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California law requiring grocery stores and restaurants to donate leftover food has been hard for local food banks and small towns to implement due to climbing fuel costs and uncertainty over who pays for food recovery. 
The effort to reduce methane emissions from discarded food sent to landfills while feeding hungry people has been slow to take off, illustrating the difficulty of curbing food waste on a large scale.
The California law, which took effect in January, mandates that national retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) as well as small grocery and convenience stores, donate unsold food, redirecting anything edible from landfills and composting anything inedible. It tasks cities and counties with formulating local plans, with a statewide goal of recovering 20% of edible food by 2025.
While other states restrict food going into landfills, California is the first to require food be donated for human consumption. The effort aligns with federal goals to slash food waste in half by 2030.
Food waste makes up a fifth of climate warming gas emissions in California dumps, according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecyle).
More than 500 waivers have been submitted by rural towns and counties to delay implementing food waste measures, saying they are too small, or do not have composting infrastructure in place for food that cannot be donated.
Food banks rely on private donations and some government assistance, and were stretched thin during the COVID-19 pandemic as hunger rates rose and food costs soared. They typically purchase food in bulk and deliver it to smaller food pantries to give to the hungry. [L1N2QA1UM]
Implementing the new rules has been especially challenging in rural California. As the North State Food Bank prepared for an influx of newly-mandated donations, the daunting costs of picking up food across 8,000 square miles (5 million acres/20,720 square kilometers) in six northern California counties became clear. 
""I can't send the truck all over town, picking up leftover sandwiches,"" said Tom Dearmore, director of community services at the Butte County Community Action Agency, which houses the food bank.
""The more we have to spend on fuel, the less food we can buy. It's pretty cut and dry.""
U.S. gasoline prices and global food inflation hit records following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, adding to the challenges.
In March, Butte County Community Action's fuel costs jumped 40% versus 2019. It spent 58% more on food. Only 10% of the food bank's food is donated; it purchases the majority to distribute to smaller food pantries and homeless shelters in a county where one in five families identify as food insecure. 
INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES
In bigger metropolitan areas, food banks partner with Feeding America, which has developed a sophisticated network of food banks across the country, to capture unsold food from national and regional supermarket chains.
But smaller grocery stores and rural food banks lack the systems to track and divert food waste. Michael Flood, chief executive of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, thinks that will change. 
""It's going to force action,"" said Flood. ""(Smaller grocery stores) may have been donating before, but may not have had as comprehensive a food donation policy and plan in place."" 
In some cases, plans developed by towns and counties trying to comply with the state law increase costs for retailers who have to navigate varying food waste regulations across the state. 
Raley's Supermarkets, a chain of 250 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has noticed some towns begin to assess fees for compost pickup, said Chelsea Minor, corporate director of public affairs. She said the company pays the fees, even though stores ship all food waste to a private company that converts it into reusable methane gas.
CalRecycle, the state recycling agency, is trying to absorb some of the added costs, distributing around $25 million since 2018 to help food banks buy refrigerators and trucks to handle added food donations. But demand has far outpaced the state's efforts. California funded $5 million in grants last autumn, despite receiving applications worth $13 million.
""It’s really incumbent upon the local government to figure out how they're going to implement their system,"" said Rachel Machi Wagoner, director of CalRecycle. 
Facing rising fuel costs, Butte County Community Action launched an app, known as 530 Food Rescue, that connects restaurants and grocery stores to volunteers who can collect donations and drop them off at food aid organizations. 

On a recent Tuesday, volunteers picked up day-old baked goods from a Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) to deliver to the Torres Community Shelter for up to 140 homeless guests.
""Having enough food has always been an issue,"" said Taylor Storey, executive director of True North Housing Alliance, which oversees the shelter. ""With the state our climate is in now, every little bit counts and food recovery is a huge part of that.""

The analyst believes that Sea has a key sustainability role in the new economy of developing markets such as ASEAN and LatAm. This is because the company is looking to improve the quality of life of consumers through technology.
We see two key positive sustainability aspects of SEA Ltd. (1) Shopee, its e-commerce service, helps empower SMEs through digitization and bridge the urban-rural gap in terms of distribution and reach. E-commerce adoption helps traditional SMEs boost their revenue and profit growth. This in turn helps to drive economic growth and reduce inequalities. (2) SEA Money, its digital financial service, provides cashless payment and other digital financial services to the un-banked and under-banked, Goodridge said in a client note released today.
The analyst also acknowledged that the company's gaming business bears a potential negative ESG risk given minor's gaming addiction.
We think that risks in ASEAN markets are low currently as the governments have been showing support for the e-sport industry. However, we are monitoring for potential regulation in Brazil. A positive sustainability aspect of Gaming is that Garena enables social interaction to >600mn Quarterly Active Users, which proved to be valuable given the social restrictions during COVID-19.
Goodridge also reflected on the pullback in Sea stock that is down almost 50% YTD. Still, the analyst sees significant long-term structural opportunities in e-commerce and fintech.
The market is applying an EV/GMV of 0.3x to the e-commerce business, a 50% discount to the average of global peers on 2023 consensus estimates; and we believe the market is not valuing its Digital Financial Services opportunity, the analyst concluded.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday, still weighed down by the selloff in bonds, which continued globally overnight and again in early dealings in New York.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 85 points, or 0.2%, at 34,503 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%. All three indices are on course for a losing week, having experienced a sharp upward repricing of interest rate expectations in response to coordinated guidance from Federal Reserve officials.
Wall Street analysts are now scrambling to revise their forecasts: Goldman Sachs strategist Jan Hatzius told clients in a note that the Fed may have to raise interest rates to 4% in order to bring down inflation, a full percentage point above the level that was, until recently, consensus. Higher inflation across the spectrum - and the consequent prospect of higher interest rates - is prompting analysts to shift their recommendations away from loss-making technology-driven companies and into stocks that are more firmly grounded in the material world.
Goldman analysts, for example, cut their recommendation on online brokerage  Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD) to sell from neutral, despite it having already lost nearly two-thirds of its value since Goldman helped it to list its stock less than a year ago. The analysts also downgraded their price target for  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock, more than tripling their estimate of its losses in 2023 and 2024. Robinhood stock fell 7.6% to a three-week low, while Coinbase stock fell 2.7%, also testing a three-week low if not breaking below it.
Beneficiaries included two of the U.S.'s two biggest grains traders, who were also helped by a UN report showing world food prices rising at their fastest since the organization started compiling records. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock rose 0.5% to a new all-time. It's now up 50% in the last six months. Rival  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) saw its stock rise as much as 0.6% to a new 14-year high before it retraced somewhat.
The mood was not helped by news out of Europe overnight, where Russian rocket artillery killed some 40 people and injured over 100 at a train station in Kramatorsk in the Ukrainian-held part of Donetsk region. There is ""no prospect of an easing of tensions or any diplomatic progress, let alone peace, with an intensification of the conflict in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions sadly seemingly inevitable,"" said Marc Ostwald, head of macro research at ADM ISI in London.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 09:36AM ET</span>","Shell in race for $1.1 billion Spanish green energy projects, sources say","By Isla Binnie and Andres Gonzalez
MADRID (Reuters) - Oil major Shell (LON:RDSa) and utilities Naturgy and Verbund are preparing binding bids to buy renewable energy assets in Spain valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), three sources close to the matter told Reuters. 
Spanish fund manager Q-Energy is selling the portfolio, taking advantage of strong appetite among European energy companies feeling increasing pressure from investors and governments to tackle climate change.
Competition for market share is intensifying as oil and gas companies set ambitious green targets, jostling with utilities and existing renewables businesses to lead the energy transition. 
Binding bids are due by the end of April, the sources said.
Shell, Naturgy and Q-Energy declined to comment. Verbund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Mainly consisting of solar projects, the assets up for sale are scattered from near Guadalajara in central Spain down to the sunny southern coastal region of Andalucia, one of the sources said.
The winning bidder is also likely to take on a team of about 25 people to develop the assets, the sources said.
Shell has made a number of solar acquisitions and this year won licences with Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY)'s Scottish Power to develop wind farms in the British North Sea. 
Naturgy changed its name from Gas Natural in 2018 and has since set out a plan to focus on renewable energy and distribution grids. Verbund generated 90% of its electricity from renewable sources last year and has said it is looking for opportunities to increase its investment in the sector. 
The portfolio being sold includes about 75 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity covered by an old subsidy regime that guarantees core earnings of roughly 60 million euros a year, one of the sources said.
It also includes development projects that will have capacity to generate about 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of electricity once construction is completed, the sources said. More than half of this has grid connection permits already. 

One gigawatt of power is roughly equivalent to the average production of a nuclear power plant.

Woodworth sees LME aluminum prices near peak with the geopolitical tensions starting to moderate and have a lower degree of impact on markets.
While we see current geopolitical events as driving lasting structural support for aluminum prices relative to the 2018 Rusal sanctions, we do believe supply/demand balances will start to normalize in 2H-22 as trade flows are gradually realigned, off-warrant material is monetized, and smelter operating rates sharply recover in China, Woodworth said in a client note.
On the other hand, Alcoa continues to experience inflationary pressures.
Accelerated cost pressures for caustic soda, pitch & coke, as well as energy/power remain headwinds. Higher caustic/carbon costs flow into COGS on lag with more impact to be felt in 2Q with prices up ~$250-350/mt y/y. AA buys ~1mt caustic annually. AA is likely to accelerate capex ahead as new low carbon technologies inch closer to commercialization. Given the current valuation, we argue the impacts from cost inflation and potentially higher capex matter to FCF yield value, the analyst added.
When it comes to Western sanctions on Russia, the analyst notes there have been limited direct sanctions on Rusal's aluminum exports.
Alcoa share price is down 1.2% in pre-open today.

The analyst expects to see a difficult earnings season on expectations most companies will guide below the Street consensus amid supply chain and geopolitical headwinds.
The war in Ukraine has pushed costs of raw materials higher while the lack of key components resulted in some facility downtime.
""We believe that auto tier 1 suppliers in our coverage will be most impacted given their exposure to higher input costs, and to a lesser extent by lower revenue (recall that many suppliers in our coverage were generally conservative with global auto production volume assumptions for 2022, so we see less of a revenue impact on average),"" Delaney said in a client note.
Given these challenges and headwinds, the analyst expects investors to become even more selective coming out of earnings.
When it comes to OEMs, Delaney prefers General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Ford (NYSE:F) given that the former has no material exposure to Europe, and GM had less units impacted in 1Q by semis than Ford (per IHS).
Goldman Sachs sees a risk to Ford's Q1 AND CY22 EBIT estimates. On the other hand, Delaney is positive on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after in-line Q1 deliveries were reported last weekend.
""We remain positive on Tesla for the full-year driven by strong EV demand, the company's leading ability to navigate the supply chain (e.g., Tesla has been able to find alternative suppliers more quickly in part due to its vertically integrated model), and increasing prices for its vehicles. However, the ongoing shutdown of its Shanghai factory due to COVID protocols in the city is a risk,"" the analyst added.

Around 750 of the 3,000 new hires the luxury carmaker plans to bring in globally to develop the operating system were hired in Sindelfingen, working on features from in-vehicle entertainment to autonomous driving.
The centre is part of a wider effort by Mercedes-Benz to streamline its software strategy from a patchwork approach bringing in technology from a wide range of suppliers, to controlling the core of its software offering itself.
""We take responsibility for software architecture and integration – that is our main goal,"" Chief Software Officer Magnus Oestberg said in a roundtable.
""We don’t do everything ourselves – we place value on partnerships, but of course the parts that are most important for us, we do in-house.""
One such partnership is with U.S. computer graphics specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with whom Mercedes-Benz struck a deal in 2020 to develop assisted and self-driving functions which will form part of the MB.OS system launching in two years time.
The carmaker is 600 unfilled vacancies away from achieving its goal of a global team of 10,000 software engineers in Berlin, China, India, Israel, Japan, and the United States.
""The profile of a software engineer is highly sought-after - demand is considerably higher than supply,"" Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer said.

A planned phase-out of coal imports is the cornerstone measure in a fifth package of sanctions against Russia proposed by the European Commission this week in reaction to civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
""The VdKi believes that prices will increase in the short term due to the change in the flow of goods and shortages of certain coal qualities,"" it said in a press release that described measures already being taken to switch away from Russian coal.
Citing a survey of its 44 member companies - which import the bulk of coal going to German power stations and steelmakers, foundries and heat providers - the group added that 60% expected prices to remain steady over the medium to long term.
On Wednesday, VDKi said alternative supplies would be in place by the peak demand winter season.
Germany imported around 18.2 million tonnes of Russian coal for power generation and 2.3 million tonnes for other uses last year, accounting for about half of its total requirement. 
VDKi said traders and consumers had already begun turning away from Russia due to logistics problems since September.
Benchmark European API2 coal futures for 2023 are just under $214 a tonne, three times the level of a year ago.
Sources told Reuters this week that a EU ban on Russian coal, its first on the country's energy sector, would take full effect from mid-August, a month later than initially planned following pressure from Germany to delay the measure.

Ifo institute researcher Karen Pittel said an embargo would be ""uncomfortable in the short-term, but manageable"".
Russia has said it can sell coal elsewhere. It denies targeting civilians during what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank has adequate provisions to face potential future losses given the current market uncertainty, the bank's Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Gortazar said on Friday. 
A day earlier, the Bank of Spain told lenders to monitor credit risks of customers most exposed to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and urged banks not to release provisions, which were boosted during the pandemic, given the current uncertainty.
""At the end of 2021, the unallocated amount of the pandemic-related provision is more than 1.4 billion euros, so we are comfortable with the existing cushion to absorb any losses that might happen,"" Gortazar told shareholders during the bank's annual meeting. 
Caixabank's pandemic-related provisions fell by around a fifth in 2021 compared to the previous year, boosting the lender's recurrent net profit by more than 70%.
The Bank of Spain is monitoring the evolution of state-backed loans granted in the pandemic as repayment freezes are lifted and indirect impacts from the Ukraine war show up in credit portfolios.
The central bank's Director General for Supervision Mercedes Olano said on Thursday that she expected an increase in bad loans but that should be manageable as Spanish banks' exposure to Russia was limited.
Gortazar told investors that Caixabank was confident that credit quality this year would remain at ""very adequate"" levels.
At the end of December, the bank's non-performing loans accounted for 3.6% of total lending, in line with the previous quarter. 
Shareholders are expected to approve a gross cash dividend of 0.1463 euros per share against 2021 earnings, representing a 50% pay-out.
Caixabank aims for a dividend cash pay-out policy of between 50-60% of 2022 consolidated earnings.

As a result, HP shares surged yesterday to a fresh all-time high above $40.00. Given that HP stock price hit UBS price target, the analyst sees a full validation.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, continuing the previous session’s rebound as investors sought bargains after expectations of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate increases had weighed.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 115 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Thursday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing nearly 100 points, or 0.3%, helped by dip buying investors seeking value after digesting the likelihood of tighter monetary policy from the U.S. central bank.
However, these averages are still set for a lower week, with the Dow currently heading for a drop of 0.7%, the S&P 500 a loss of 1% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.6%. 
The minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in March, the gathering which saw the U.S. central bank hike interest rates for the first time since 2018, added to recent comments from a number of policymakers that indicated hefty interest rate increases were on the way.
St. Louis Fed President “James Bullard doubled down on his recent hawkish statements by calling for up to 300bp of tightening this year,” said ING analysts, in a note.
The new quarterly earnings season starts next week, kicking off with reports from the banking sector. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) will report before the bell on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) will report before the open on Thursday.
The major lenders are set to show a sharp decline in first quarter earnings from a year ago, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading, but investors are likely to focus more on the chances of increased net interest income, as the banks benefit from higher interest rates. 
There is little in the way of major economic data scheduled for Friday, and investors may instead focus on events in Ukraine following reports of many deaths as a result of a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in the east of the country.
The U.S. Congress removed its ""most favored nation"" trade status on Russia on Thursday following previous allegations of atrocities by Russian troops on Ukrainian civilians.
Oil prices stabilized Friday but are still heading for hefty weekly losses, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its Covid outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, while China announced over 21,000 new Covid cases on Thursday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $96.09 a barrel, on course for a loss of 3.2% this week, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $100.35, down 3.9% so far this week.

The permit will allow the U.S. company to deploy its CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform to a large base of Department of Defense (DoD) and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) clients, marking a significant milestone in the company's plan to launch its sophisticated cybertechnology in the public sector.
Adoption of superior cloud-native technologies is mission-critical for the DoD and the DIB, as all federal agencies must remain vigilant in today's heightened threat environment. It's crucial the government takes steps to adequately prepare for disruptive activity from our nation's adversaries, said Shawn Henry, CSO of CrowdStrike and president of CrowdStrike Services.
CrowdStrike provides its cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, identity and data, as well as cybersecurity response services to 65 of the Fortune 100 companies and 15 of the top 20 banks in the world.
The company has recently teamed up with other companies to improve the cyber defense system of the U.S. through the joint Critical Infrastructure Defense Project.
Furthermore, CrowdStrike also held an Investor Briefing event where it presented new financial targets. Most importantly, CRWD said it is looking to achieve over $billion in ARR by FY26, which is much higher than the prior outlook of $3 billion and more by FY25.
Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz called the new guidance impressive.
We view the revised outlook as highly encouraging, although we believe it will still ultimately prove too low. More broadly, we believe CRWD's cloud platform remains highly differentiated, and we continue to believe strong ongoing execution can propel the shares much higher over time, Moskowitz said in a client note.
Similarly, Stifel analyst Brad Reback sees the new target as very achievable as he believes the company's growth opportunity remains in the early days as the company should continue to gain unit share from its market-leading endpoint platform, drive ARPU gains given continuous product innovation as well as benefit from a very robust cybersecurity spending environment.
Moreover, given CrowdStrike's operational efficiency (~30% FCF margin in FY22), we believe it will be extremely difficult for smaller, less advanced, competitors to sustain the pace of investment in both R&D and S&M that would be needed to close the technical/sales gap needed to catch CrowdStrike, Reback added.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 06:32AM ET</span>",U.S. bank earnings to decline in first quarter,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are expected to show a sharp decline in first quarter earnings from a year ago, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading, and funds set aside for loan losses being released.
Net income for the six biggest U.S. banks will be down about 35% from a year earlier, according to analyst estimates from Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Investment banking revenues stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. 
The quarter will be challenging for the biggest banks, according to analyst Christopher McGratty of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Estimated revenue declines of 36% in investment banking and 18% in trading are the biggest headwind, he said.
""Last year was massive for capital markets at the banks so comparisons are hard,"" McGratty said.
The quarter could be seen as short-term pain with the promise of long-term gain, analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a report. An example came on March 31 when PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) lowered its first-quarter revenue forecast but increased its full-year expectations, he noted. 
Investors are expected to focus more on the prospects for banks to increase their net interest income, or the difference between income from loans and interest paid on deposits and other funds, as they benefit from higher interest rates.
Bank executives will be asked for views on whether the U.S. economy will continue to grow if the war in Ukraine continues and the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to try to cool inflation. They may be pressed on whether lower-income borrowers can make repayments after the rise in gas and food prices.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in the United States, reports results on Wednesday.
On Thursday,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is due the following Monday. 
Analysts expect pre-provision net revenue - which is not clouded by swings in loss reserves set during the pandemic - to decline more modestly than overall profits plunge.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke expects a 7% decline in pre-provision net revenue compared with a 24% decline in earnings per share at the banks she covers.
An area of increasing concern to investors is whether banks, particularly JPMorgan, are allowing expenses to increase too much. JPMorgan's non-interest expenses jumped 11% in the last quarter, partly due to higher wages. It has also warned of rising technology and acquisition costs. 
Banks are more exposed to possible trading losses this quarter, particularly in commodities markets which turned volatile after Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Some banks, such as Citigroup, may make provisions for losses on Russian businesses after Western nations began imposing sanctions. Citigroup has said it could lose nearly half of its $9.8 billion exposure in a severe scenario. 
Another unknown is how much banks slowed their share buybacks during the quarter. Buybacks lift earnings per share, but they may have been tempered as banks saw their excess capital dented by unrealized losses on bond holdings which fell in value as yields rose during the quarter. [L2N2W31XD]

During the event, Musk spoke about the factory's capacity and production plans, but also teased new Tesla products that are still being developed, such as the Cybertruck and an innovative robotaxi.
He said Tesla plans to produce 500,000 Model Y vehicles per year in the newly opened factory and expects to begin selling its much anticipated Cybertruck next year.
In trailing twelve months, we've delivered over a million cars worldwide, Musk said. There's still a long way to go.
He said that Tesla's scale is becoming so big that these volumes, ""no company has ever achieved in the history of humanity.""
But it wouldn't be surprising to see Tesla make changes to its timelines, particularly during this period when global automakers are facing significant chip shortage issues and higher raw material prices as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
The automaker also said it plans to expand access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which costs $12,000, to a wider user base.
We're aiming to go to wide beta for almost all Full Self-Driving customers in North America this year, Musk said.
While Tesla does not produce self-driving vehicles, it developed a driver assistance software named Full Self-Driving. The program is still in its beta phase and is available to a select group of customers and employees.
A few days ago, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk will be joining Twitter's board of directors after he purchased a 9.1% activist stake in the social media giant.

The analyst sees the current Street estimates as too high, including a high bar for HOOD to reach profitability in 2023 (requires 10+% organic revenue growth + macro tailwinds) as the company has noted.
Another key factor behind a downgrade call is the fading retail engagement, especially among the broker's lower end customers. Additionally, the continued weakness in account growth is also listed as a headwind.
We believe this lack of clarity around the path to profitability will prevent the stock from re-rating higher, Nance said in a client note.
For Nance to become more constructive on Robinhood, he lists three things he is looking for:
1) An inflection in user growth, which we view as necessary for the company to continue to scale its platform;
2) A clearer path to near-term profitability, and
3) A more conservative Street outlook for revenue growth.

The lower price target reflects higher execution risk and the fact that some positive catalysts that were expected for April are now likely to materialize at a later stage. The delay is fueled mainly by the Boeing 737 NG accident in China.
Still, Liwag remains Overweight as he is bullish on the aerospace recovery post-COVID-19 and we do not expect the industry to revert back to global shutdowns. The analyst also expects BA to return to positive FCF in 2022, for the first time in 5 years.

HAIPHONG (Reuters) -Vietnamese automaker VinFast said on Thursday its Singapore-based holding company had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with U.S. securities regulators, as it plans spending of $4 billion on its first U.S. factory complex.
VinFast, which became the first fully fledged domestic car maker in 2019, is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with electric SUVs and a battery leasing model.
A source familiar with the matter said VinFast would probably look to raise about $2 billion from the offering.
""VinFast is moving ahead with its plans but the timing of the IPO is very much open,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There needs to be a window to get the IPO done and it could easily take a couple of months.""
A unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup JSC, Vinfast said it had not determined the IPO https:// size and price range.
""There are options to look at. We are still considering a lot of options,"" Chief Executive Le Thi Thu Thuy told reporters on the sidelines of an event to showcase the company's new VF8 battery-powered SUV.
She said the IPO was planned for the second half of this year as one option to fund a plant planned in North Carolina and U.S. expansion.
Last week the company said it signed a preliminary deal to initially invest $2 billion to build the North Carolina factory to make electric buses, sport utility vehicles and batteries for electric vehicles.
The company, established in 2017, plans to transition to all-electric vehicle production from late 2022.
A year ago sources said Vinfast was considering an IPO that could value the company at about $60 billion.
That valuation looks stretched in current markets, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
""Even the companies that have gone ahead with U.S. IPOs have had a sharp correction in valuations, so that's a given,"" he added.

Outside North America, VinFast is looking for a plant in Germany, it said in January.
VinFast said prices for its VF8 SUV started from $41,000 in the United States, versus about $63,000 for a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) SUV. It targets global electric vehicle sales of 42,000 this year.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 04:32AM ET</span>",Analysis-Samsung's reputation hit as prices slashed at home for new premium phone,"By Byungwook Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF)' flagship Galaxy S22 smartphone has taken a battering from reports of hobbled performance and has seen carriers half its price at home in South Korea just weeks since its launch, hurting its image as an iPhone rival.
Consumers have complained - and even filed a class-action lawsuit - about the handset maker advertising what it called its most powerful smartphone yet with scant detail about performance management software that they say drastically slows the premium device when using processor-intensive applications.
Such are the complaints that the Korea Fair Trade Commission last month began investigating the world's biggest phone vendor.
The controversy represents a blow to Samsung (KS:005930)'s reputation for high-end handsets - and potentially its finances - as it tries to make up for two years of premium sales that missed analyst estimates and reverse a decline in market share.
""The dispute will inevitably be a big hit to Samsung's credibility,"" said analyst Lee Seung-woo at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
At the heart of complaints is Samsung's Game Optimising Service (GOS) which manages device performance during gaming to prevent overheating and preserve battery life. The manufacturer introduced the software in 2016, just months before it pulled its premium Galaxy Note 7 following a series of battery fires.
GOS automatically limits handset performance during gaming but also during use of other processor-intensive applications, said Geekbench, a widely used performance scorer, which found the software slowed the S22's processor by as much as 46%.
The extent to which GOS slows the S22, lack of details about the software in marketing materials, and the inability to disable it set social media alight.
""This is an unprecedented, crazy issue that can't be excused in any way,"" ITSub, a YouTuber with 2.1 million subscribers who specialises in gadgets, said in a YouTube post.
Samsung said it issued an update to allow users to disable the software with no risk to safety. It also said it would continue to invest to innovate in both hardware and software.
PRICE DROP
The S22 series hit sales of 1 million handsets in South Korea within six weeks of release, reaching the mark two weeks faster than its predecessor, Samsung said.
""The intentional performance downgrade surely had a negative effect, but its actual impact on Samsung's sales seems limited. Data shows that sales are not much affected,"" said analyst Kim Ji-san at Kiwoom Securities.
Still, South Korea's three major telecom providers have nearly doubled subsidies for the S22, pushing its price as low as 549,000 won ($451) from a launch of 999,000 won. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 13, released in October, starts at 1,090,000 won with carriers offering smaller subsidies of around 150,000 won.
""When subsidies go up simultaneously at all three telcos, it's typically the manufacturer making up the contributions,"" said an official at carrier LG Uplus Corp, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Samsung's 2021 market share in devices over $400 shrank 3 percentage points to 17% from a year prior, while Apple's rose 5 percentage points to 60%, showed data from market researcher Counterpoint. The data also showed sales of both the S20 and S21 fell short of the S series' first-year norm of 30 million units.
Early shipments of the S22, launched late February, indicate Samsung will move over 6 million handsets by March-end, broadly in line with expectations, said Counterpoint Associate Director Sujeong Lim.
Still, Lee at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects the GOS furore to combine with increased component costs to leave April-June operating profit at Samsung's mobile arm at 3 trillion won, down from a previous forecast of 3.4 trillion won.
IBK Investment & Securities analyst Kim Un-ho also downgraded his forecast to 3 trillion won from 3.5 trillion won.
Samsung on Thursday said it expects to report an estimated 50% jump in overall January-March operating profit on April 28, as demand for its memory chips remained solid.
SPEED LIMIT
Teardowns of the lowest-priced S22 showed the handset lacked a cooling component called a vapour chamber, implying increased reliance on software to manage overheating, reviewers said.
Analysts said the lean toward software solutions stems from a renewed policy to cut costs - a strategy they said erodes a reputation as an innovator based on hardware strength.
Lee said Samsung ""is putting too much emphasis on cutting costs, which led to this unfortunate case.""
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Han Jong-hee at an annual shareholders meeting last month said he ""will not compromise quality to cut expenses, and will continue to introduce products that put utmost priority on first-rate product experience and quality.""
At least 1,885 consumers are not convinced, having filed a class-action lawsuit arguing Samsung's marketing inflates the S22's performance.

""If Porsche has a speed limit of 100 kilometres (62 miles)per hour, would you still buy it?"" said Kim Hoon-chan, the lawyer representing the consumers, adding that some 1,500 people have joined to file a second class-action suit.

The court said BT Funds Management had incorrectly charged its superannuation fund members insurance premiums that included commission payments, despite a ban on such commissions under the 2013 Future of Financial Advice reforms. 
BT Funds, the court said, had continued to charge these commissions until 2020.
The court also found BT Funds misrepresented members in their periodic statements, indicating that proper deductions were made even though such actions were not permitted.
Australian banks and financial institutions have been under scrutiny since an inquiry by the Royal Commission in 2018 found widespread shortcomings, forcing overhaul in the sector.
Friday's penalty order comes after six civil penalty proceedings filed by financial watchdog Australian Securities and Investment commission (ASIC) against the bank last November, alleging widespread compliance failures across many businesses.
Westpac and ASIC had then together proposed a A$113 million penalty to the Federal Court, with the lender saying it will remediate A$80 million to affected customers.
""Westpac and ASIC (had) jointly submitted agreed proposed penalties for each of the proceedings. These penalties remain subject to court approval and have been substantially provisioned in our full-year 2021 results,"" Westpac said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc plans to take Japanese chip equipment maker Kokusai Electric Corp public in an IPO as early as June, three sources said, in what is likely to be Tokyo's biggest listing in more than three years.
While the size of the initial public offering was not immediately clear, one of the sources said Kokusai Electric would likely list with a market value of around 700 billion yen ($5.67 billion).
That would make it the biggest company to list in Tokyo since SoftBank Group Corp listed its telecom unit with a market value of 7.2 trillion yen in late 2018, according to Refinitiv data. 
The Tokyo bourse is set to approve the listing as early as May, according to the three sources, all of whom declined to be identified because the matter was still private.
Lead underwriters include SMBC Nikko Securities, a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), two of the sources said.
KKR plans to sell part of its stake to domestic and overseas investors, according to the three sources.
KKR, Kokusai Electric, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, SMBC Nikko and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment. 
Kokusai Electric was spun off from Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Kokusai Electric Inc in June 2018.
The planned listing comes after U.S. firm Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) terminated its $3.5-billion deal to buy Kokusai Electric in March last year after failing to obtain regulatory approval from China.
Kokusai Electric said at the time it would continue to seek strategic partners and that an IPO would be an option.
KKR initially aimed for an IPO in March, but decided to delay as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and higher U.S. interest rates hit the global stock market.
Kokusai Electric, a maker of equipment for thin film formation, reported operating profit of 60 billion yen on sales of 178 billion yen in the year ended March last year.
Global demand for chip equipment has surged as semiconductors are being used in everything from artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other new technology.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, ending a volatile week on a positive note as investors continued to digest the prospect of tighter monetary policy, more sanctions on Russia, and potential French political turmoil.
By 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.5% and U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%.
Despite these gains, European equity markets are set to end the week largely lower, with the DAX down around 1.2% so far, the CAC 40 down 1.9%, and the blue Euro Stoxx 50 index 1.6% weaker.
The prospect of aggressive global rate hikes has rattled investors this week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling that it was prepared to act more quickly than previously guided to contain rampant inflation. 
The policymakers at the European Central Bank were not as hawkish, but still appeared keen to unwind stimulus, according to the accounts of their March meeting, released Thursday.
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with the United Nations General Assembly suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council over allegations of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, something denied by Moscow. 
The U.S. Congress also removed its ""most favored nation"" trade status, and the European Union agreed to ban coal imports, the first time that sanctions have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues.
Also on the radar is the risk of a political upset in France, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen very close to incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of the French presidential election.
In corporate news, Volvo (ST:VOLVb) stock fell 1% after the Swedish truck maker set aside provisions of 4 billion crowns ($423.2 million), expecting its first quarter operating income to take a hit from uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.

Oil prices edged higher Friday but are still heading for weekly losses of around 3%, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its COVID outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, while China’s COVID-19 outbreak appears to be worsening, with new case numbers topping 21,000 on Thursday.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd's agreed merger with BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s petroleum arm is in the best interest of its shareholders, an independent expert said, valuing the combined group at around $40 billion.
Global miner BHP agreed to hive off its petroleum business to Woodside last year in a nil-premium deal that will give BHP shareholders a 48% stake in the combined group and turn Woodside into a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer.
Accounting firm KPMG assessed the value of the combined group at between $37.2 billion and $42.3 billion, equating to a per share valuation of A$26.25 to A$29.81, which was equal to or more than its estimate of Woodside's current per share value. 
""Based on these measures, the proposed transaction is, in our opinion, fair to Woodside shareholders,"" KPMG said in a report commissioned by Woodside and released to its shareholders on Friday ahead of a vote on the deal on May 19. 
Woodside's board unanimously recommended that the company's shareholders vote in favour of the merger. 
Its shares fell 1.5% to A$32.40 after the report was released, compared with a 0.5% gain in the broader market. 
KPMG's valuation of the combined group was below an estimates by UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), at about A$34.60 a share and A$33 a share respectively, based on the banks' current oil price outlooks.
The independent expert assumed a Brent oil price of $100 a barrel for 2022, falling gradually to $70 a barrel in 2026. 
Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said KPMG's report did not shine as much light on BHP's growth prospects as hoped, including significantly underestimating the potential value of its Calypso gas find in Trinidad.
He also said the cashflow profile showed little increase in free cash flow despite Woodside's Scarborough gas project coming online in 2026, which he said ""may flag risk of decline elsewhere, including at Pluto/Sangomar/North West Shelf"".
KPMG highlighted the strength of the combined balance sheet, with BHP assets being handed over debt-free, which would lower the combined group's gearing to around 8%, compared with Woodside's target gearing of 15% to 35%.
""BHP Petroleum's asset base provides Woodside with immediate access to significant development and growth opportunities, within a time frame that is unlikely to otherwise have been available to Woodside as a standalone entity,"" KPMG said.
In a separate announcement, BHP said based on Woodside's share price of $25.55 on April 6, the implied value of BHP Petroleum is $23.4 billion.

Woodside said on Friday it expects to achieve its target of more than $400 million in cost savings from combining the two groups by early 2024, including cutting executive jobs and other staff, but said carrying out the changes would require one-off costs of up to $600 million in the first two years.
The independent expert's report confirmed that Woodside will be inheriting about $3.9 billion in oil and gas closure and rehabilitation liabilities from BHP.

Russia's six-week long incursion in Ukraine has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, turned cities into rubble and led to sweeping sanctions on its leaders and companies.
""The Volvo Group has total assets of about 9 billion crowns related to Russia, of which about 6 billion crowns is cash items that could be materialized over the coming years,"" it said in a statement.
""In the first quarter 2022, assets amounting to approximately 4 billion crowns will be provided for and have a negative impact on operating income, primarily in the Financial Services segment,"" it added.
Volvo in February suspended all sales, service and production in Russia, which last year accounted for about 3% of its net group sales of about 372.2 billion crowns.
The company's production site in Kaluga, near Moscow, has a capacity to produce 15,000 vehicles per year and employed over 600 people. 

Shares in the company have lost a quarter of their value since the start of the year as shortages of components and freight capacity led to production disruptions and increased costs, denting profits.

CMA CGM had been authorised by the European Commission to acquire Gefco's capital immediately, pending final approval of the deal expected in the coming months, it said in a statement without disclosing financial details.
Gefco had announced last week it would buy back the 75% of its shares held by RZD after the state-owned company became the target of Western sanctions.
Stellantis confirmed in a separate statement it had sold its remaining 25% stake in Gefco to CMA CGM.
France's PSA group, which last year merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis, fully owned Gefco until 2012, when it sold a 75% stake to RZD for 800 million euros ($869 million).
“The sale of this non-strategic asset marks the last step of our exit plan, initiated a decade ago, from the transportation and logistics industry,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said in the statement.
French media last week reported that, following the exit of RZD, the business would likely be acquired by CMA CGM, which has invested heavily in non-maritime logistics in recent years alongside container shipping, its core activity.
Gefco would allow CMA CGM's logistics division CEVA to become a market leader in auto transport and reinforce its presence in France and Europe, CMA CGM said.

Gefco employs 11,500 staff in 47 countries.

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - GoTo is banking for a steady market debut after raising $1.1 billion in a relatively cautious IPO, while a booming local share market is cementing expectations that Indonesia's largest tech firm can buck a global downtrend in tech stocks.
Formed by the May merger of ride-hailing-to-payments company Gojek and e-commerce giant Tokopedia, PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk will debut in Jakarta on Monday in the culmination of one of the world's biggest initial public offerings (IPO) so far this year.
Taking advantage of new listing rules, the debut will mark a watershed for the $70 billion digital market of Southeast Asia's largest economy, where record venture funding is creating a wave of startups.
""GoTo is the most differentiated technology company in Southeast Asia. Relative to its peers, diversification is going to be a very important thing that investors will need to get on top of and understand how to properly value the business,"" said Shane Chesson, a partner at Openspace Ventures, one of Gojek's earliest investors.
Indonesia's digital economy is likely to grow nearly five times to up to $330 billion by 2030 from 2021, showed a study by consultancy Bain & Co and GoTo backers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.
While U.S.-listed peers Grab Holdings Ltd and Sea Ltd operate across Southeast Asia, GoTo focuses on Indonesia. With 2.5 million drivers, 14 million merchants and 55 million annual transacting users, GoTo's businesses straddle millions of small and mid-sized firms across the archipelago.
Angus Mackintosh, founder at CrossASEAN Research, said in a report on Smartkarma that key to GoTo's IPO was that it was small and offered only to local investors. ""This should mean that there is stronger support.""
GoTo is selling 4% in shares with most taken up by funds. Backed by names such as SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GoTo is also broadening its investor base by allocating shares to 600,000 drivers.
It will also be first to issue multiple class voting shares and tap new rules allowing unprofitable firms to list directly on the bourse's main board.
Analysts said the size and valuation are lower than expected, and that GoTo likely aimed to avoid a repeat of the experience of e-commerce peer PT Bukalapak.com Tbk.
Bukalapak raised $1.5 billion in July selling 25% of equity after initially targeting $300 million. Its stock debuted strongly but tumbled 25% within days and has halved from its IPO price.
GoTo priced its shares at 338 rupiah ($0.0235), the high end of its indicative range.
Its investors are subject to an eight-month lock-in, or two years for those with multiple class voting shares. With Bukalapak, though there was an eight-month lock-in, some funds could sell up to 10% of holdings immediately.
GoTo will become Indonesia's fourth most-valuable firm at $28 billion, with analysts estimating an index weighting of up to 9%.
""Once you're in the index, all the local funds buy quasi automatically,"" said one GoTo investor. The IDX is at a record high and is Asia's best-performer this year at 9%.
GoTo President Patrick Cao said weak markets prompted caution with pricing. Still, the firm expects listing to support fundraising and plans to list overseas within two years.

""It is a very challenging environment in the public market now, with market caps of DiDi Global Inc, Grab, DeliveryHero and many others falling below the target valuation of GoTo,"" said Jianggan Li at advisory Momentum Works.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said it is boosting starting pay for its 12,000 long-haul truck drivers who deliver merchandise to its stores and Sam's Clubs locations amid a U.S. shortage of drivers that threatens to prolong supply chain snarls and merchandise shortages. 
Qualified drivers -- who tend to be in their late 40s and 50s, according to government and industry officials -- remain in short supply. Federal limits on daily working hours, the COVID-19 pandemic and other hurdles have prompted many truck drivers to quit.
Walmart Inc is also following rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in incentivizing employees in other roles to retrain for in-demand transportation jobs required to ease supply chain bottlenecks and support their online operations. 
Walmart's drivers were already among the best compensated in the nation. Now the world's biggest retailer is upping the ante by resetting truck drivers' starting salaries to $95,000 to$110,000 a year, from $87,500 previously. 
That far exceeds 2020's median pay of $47,130 for American big-rig drivers, whose ""real"" earnings have lagged inflation and effectively remain at about 70% of what they were in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 1.9 million big-rig drivers ply the nation's roads, according to the bureau. 
Walmart's move could strengthen its competitive advantage at a time when safe, experienced 18-wheeler drivers are in short supply and as Amazon builds its own network of trucking contractors.
""We're proud to announce pay raises to ensure Walmart remains one of the best companies in the world to drive for,"" said Karisa Sprague, Walmart's senior vice president for supply chain human resources said in a statement.
Consumer demand for everything from food to furniture soared during the pandemic. That overwhelmed resources -- from truck availability and seaport capacity to warehouse and distribution space -- snarling the flow of goods and fueling higher costs.
At Walmart alone, supply chain costs were $400 million higher than expected in the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28 that included the all-important holiday shopping season, the company said.
Recent data suggests pandemic demand may be cooling.
Commerce Department data released last week suggested that pandemic-fueled purchases of physical goods may have peaked as consumers resume spending on travel and entertainment. [Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3IPvXEI] 
Walmart continues to invest aggressively in Walmart.com, and is following Amazon in creating a pathway for employees to shift to transportation jobs to support e-commerce logistics. 

Walmart's 12-week, in-house trucking training program enables employees to earn their commercial driver's license and become full-fledged Private Fleet Walmart drivers. Walmart picks up the roughly $4,000 to $5,000 cost of that training. 
The company, which pays signing bonuses that can exceed $10,000, hired a record 4,500 truck drivers last year, bringing its trucker workforce to around 12,000. It already has graduated 17 new drivers from classes in Texas and Delaware, and plans to expand the program this year with the goal of training between 400 and 800 drivers to move goods to its more than 5,300 U.S. Walmart and Sam's Club stores.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Friday, with investors continuing to digest the prospect of tighter monetary policy, the ramifications of more sanctions on Russia, and potential French political turmoil.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.9%.
Despite these gains, European equity markets are set to end the week largely lower, with the DAX down around 2.5% so far, the CAC 40 down 3.3%, and the pan-Europe STOXX 600 index 0.7% weaker.
The prospect of aggressive global rate hikes has rattled investors this week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling that it was prepared to act more quickly than previously guided to contain rampant inflation. 
The policymakers at the European Central Bank were not as hawkish, but still appeared keen to unwind stimulus, according to the accounts of their March meeting, released Thursday.
""A large number of members held the view that the current high level of inflation and its persistence called for immediate further steps towards monetary policy normalisation,"" the accounts showed.
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with many Ukrainians being evacuated from eastern cities before an anticipated major Russian offensive.
Russian troops have been accused of committing atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, something denied by Moscow. This has resulted in the United Nations General Assembly suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.S. Congress removing its ""most favored nation"" trade status, and the European Union agreeing to ban coal imports, the first time that sanctions have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues.
Also on the radar is the risk of a political upset in France, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen very close to incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of the French presidential election.
Oil prices edged higher Friday but are still heading for weekly losses of over 3%, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its COVID outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, in order to try and replace the output lost in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Additionally, China’s COVID-19 outbreak appears to be worsening, with new case numbers topping 21,000 on Thursday. Shanghai’s lockdown was supposed to end earlier this week but is still in place, and traffic congestion levels at peak hours are 40% lower than a year ago.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $96.56 a barrel, on course for a loss of 3.7% this week, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $100.94, down 4.3% so far this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,931.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0868."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will make a ""dedicated"" self-driving taxi that will ""look futuristic,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Thursday, without giving a timeframe.
The 50-year-old billionaire, wearing a black cowboy hat and sunglasses, made the comments at the opening of Tesla's $1.1 billion factory in Texas, which is home to its new headquarters.
""Massive scale. Full self-driving. There's going to be a dedicated robotaxi,"" Musk told a large crowd at the factory.
Musk has several times missed his targets of full autonomy. In 2019, he said robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020. 
In January he said he would be ""shocked"" if Tesla did not achieve full self-driving that is safer than that of humans this year.
Tesla will expand its ""Full Self-Driving"" beta software to all North American FSD subscribers this year, he said on Thursday. 
Tesla now sells the advanced driver assistance systems for $12,000, with a promise of more features. It says the software does not make its vehicles autonomous, and requires driver supervision.
The beta version, launched in late 2020, aims to enable cars to navigate city streets better. By January, it had been installed in nearly 60,000 vehicles in the United States. 
Musk said Tesla had started deliveries of Texas-made Model Y electric sport utility vehicles, with a goal of producing half a million a year at the Texas factory, which he said would be the biggest car factory in the United States. 
He gave no details of such Model Ys, but they are likely to be lower-priced versions to better take on cheaper competitors. 
Tesla will start production next year of its Cybertruck as well as a humanoid robot, Optimus, Musk said.
The firm's new giga factories in Texas and Berlin, which will make vehicles and its own battery cells, face challenges of ramping up production with new processes https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musks-plan-tesla-built-batteries-has-an-acceleration-challenge-2022-03-11, analysts have said. 
Musk said Tesla was simplifying car making by making a car using three major parts. 

Despite record deliveries in the first quarter, a recent COVID-19 spike in China has forced Tesla to suspend production at its Shanghai factory for several days. 
Thursday's event comes after Musk surprised the market this week by revealing he had bought a stake of 9% in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and will join the board of the social media network.

JetBlue made an unsolicited offer of $33 per share in cash earlier this week, beating a near $25 per share cash-and-stock bid from Frontier made in February.
""We look forward to engaging with the Spirit Board to finalize our combination, to create a national low-fare challenger to the four large dominant U.S. carriers that will result in lower fares and better service for customers,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said.
Frontier did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spirit said the discussions with JetBlue would be in keeping with the terms of its merger agreement with Frontier. 
Denver-based Frontier and JetBlue are in a tug of war for Florida-based Spirit to capture a larger share of the leisure market and better compete with legacy carriers.
The moves towards consolidation come at a time when the pandemic battered airlines industry is working through higher fuel and labor costs to keep up the demand from travelers.
Either deal is sure to invite a close scrutiny from U.S. antitrust authorities, who have taken an aggressive stance under the Biden administration toward deals that reduce competition and raise prices.

JetBlue is already facing an antitrust lawsuit over its partnership with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. The suit filed in September alleges the deal would lead to higher fares in busy northeastern U.S. airports.
Shares of Spirit have lost 1.5% since JetBlue made its bid on April 5, while those of JetBlue have dropped 11.4%.

The Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 3% in Friday early trading, with video streaming firm Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. among the worst performers. Meituan was also a drag on the gauge, following news that Sequoia Capital reduced stakes.  
Read: Tencent Closes Game Streaming Site After Beijing Blocks Merger
Tencent’s decision comes more than a year after Beijing blocked a merger between its investees, an entity which the soon-to-be closed platform Penguin Esports was expected to be folded into. China tech stocks have come off a record low in mid-March, but yet to stage a sustainable rally amid regulatory risks.
Shares of live-streaming platforms led a decline in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks on Thursday. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closed 4.5% lower.  
“The falling of tech shares here today are mainly following the overnight ADR moves, and Sequoia Fund’s selling of Meituan shares could also hurt sector sentiment,” said Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong.
Tech shares have been hit especially hard recently, following Beijing’s crackdown on the live-streaming sector’s tax evasion and a series of hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve. 
Chinese authorities have repeatedly vowed to add policy stimulus and stabilize markets, but that’s done little to soothe investors worried of a spillover from higher U.S. interest rates, among other risks.    
On Friday, China’s regulator said it will start a campaign until early December to curb violations in internet companies’ algorithm. 
The Hang Seng Index also headed for a third day of declines, shedding as much as 1.1% on Friday. China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index also fell.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, while U.S. equity futures steadied amid cautious trading. Investors continue to monitor both the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plan to tighten its monetary policy and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.19% by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the current account n.s.a. was JPY1.648 trillion ($13.31 billion) in February, while the adjusted current account was JPY520 billion.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.53%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.69% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.95%.
U.S. shares saw modest gains on Thursday, and global equities are set for a weekly loss as concerns that the Fed’s policy could lead to a recession continue.
U.S. Treasury yields retreated, and the bond curve remained steeper, as the impact of the Fed’s hawkish tone in the minutes from its latest meeting continues. In the minutes, released on Wednesday, the central bank outlined plans to pare its balance sheet by more than $1 trillion annually.
Oil was mostly on a downward trend, with the International Energy Agency and the U.S. planning to release millions of barrels of crude from strategic reserves and China’s COVID-19 outbreak dampening fuel demand.
The prospect of sharp Fed rate hikes alongside a reduction in its bond holdings, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and China’s COVID-19 outbreak, with the city of Shanghai topping 21,000 daily cases, are all dampening investor sentiment and risk appetite.
“Stocks have had a little bit of a harder time this week digesting the fact that interest rates are going to be higher” amid a major shift in expectations around monetary policy, Ameriprise Financial Inc. global market strategist Anthony Saglimbene told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, a slew of Fed policymakers chimed in on policy moving forward at separate events on Thursday.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he prefers hiking the policy rate to 3% to 3.25% in the second half of 2022. However, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and his Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said that they favor hiking rates to neutral while continuing to monitor the economy.
The Reserve Bank of India will also hand down its policy decision later in the day.
Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine that started with Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 could last weeks, or even years, the U.S. warned. The European Union also reached an agreement to ban coal imports from Russia, the first time that the bans have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues."

(Reuters) - Graincorp said on Friday it expects underlying profit for fiscal 2022 to be around 2.5 times that of last year, as the Australian agribusiness firm benefits from supply constraints due to the Ukraine war, sending its shares to a record high. 
Australia, the world's sixth-largest wheat exporter, is set to ship a record volume this year as buyers look for suppliers to replace cargoes from Russia and Ukraine. [nL3N2VB1MM] 
Shares of Graincorp soared as much as 8.9% to A$9.46, their highest ever.
""The conflict in Ukraine and resulting trade disruptions in the Black Sea region have created uncertainty in global grain markets, with buyers looking for alternate sources of supply,"" Graincorp Chief Executive Officer Robert Spurway said.
The company said its ports were operating near capacity despite disruptions caused by flooding on the east coast.
Shipping slots on the eastern and western coasts of the country have been booked up since March, following a second straight year of a record wheat crop, which has kept a lid on Australian wheat prices.
""GNC continues to benefit because ultimately their (logistical) assets act as a bottleneck to exports, which allows them to control price - extremely advantageous when other supply chains are tight"", analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.
Graincorp expects annual underlying net profit after tax between A$310 million and A$370 million ($231.82 million - $276.72 million), up from its previous forecast of A$235 million to A$280 million and far higher than the A$139 million reported last year. 
The upgraded forecast also trounced Refinitiv analysts' expectations of A$266.2 million net income for the year. 
The company added that its processing business was also performing strongly, with oilseeds benefiting from strong global demand for crude and refined vegetable oils. 

It also pointed to higher export supply-chain margins and a good crop season, both supporting its higher profit outlook.

For drugs similar to Aduhelm, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would allow coverage if the medication is approved after a standard review by the Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA approved Aduhelm last June under an accelerated approval pathway, finding that the drug's ability to clear amyloid plaque from the brain offered enough evidence that it would likely help slow cognitive decline for Alzheimer's patients.
Medicare, however, disagreed with that assessment. The agency in January said it had significant doubts about the potential benefits of Aduhelm and proposed restricting use to clinical trials for it and similar experimental treatments.
Biogen, in an emailed statement, said the ""unprecedented CMS decision effectively denies all Medicare beneficiaries access to Aduhelm,"" and said it is ""carefully considering its options"" as it evaluates the business impact of the decision.
Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people who might use the medicine are in the government plan.
Medicare's action ""likely spells the end for Aduhelm ... though we believe this outcome was expected by most,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note on Thursday.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd each have plaque-clearing drugs in late-stage development.
Under Medicare's final decision, drugs approved by the traditional FDA process that show clear patient benefit would not have any subsequent clinical trial requirements.
Both Lilly and Eisai, which is partnered with Biogen, have said they plan to seek accelerated approval of their Alzheimer's drugs. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wall Street analysts had projected last year that Aduhelm - the first new Alzheimer's drug to win U.S. approval in 20 years - would be a multibillion-dollar product. But sales have been marginal following the backlash over the FDA's controversial approval decision.
Wall Street currently estimates 2022 Aduhelm sales of just $69 million, according to Refinitiv.
Thursday's decision comes despite significant pressure from patient advocates and drugmakers seeking wider access to the drug. They argued that Medicare's trial requirement would unfairly restrict use of a drug approved by the FDA for a broader patient population.
Alzheimer's Association Chief Executive Harry Johns in a statement said, ""Denying access to FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments is wrong,"" adding that the patient group was ""very disappointed"" with Medicare's decision.
Patient groups last month launched a public advertising campaign aimed at persuading Medicare to loosen its proposed restrictions. They had also been meeting with lawmakers and Biden administration officials.
Others, including some prominent neurologists, have praised Medicare's plan, citing concerns over the approval of Aduhelm after only one of two late-stage trials showed that it helped slow cognitive decline for people with early Alzheimer's.

Investigations have been launched into the FDA's decision taken over objections of its own outside advisers, and doctors have held back on prescribing Aduhelm.
Roche and Eisai each expect to report results from late-stage Phase III trials later this year. Lilly anticipates Phase III results by mid-2023.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 07:40PM ET</span>",Donald Trump should be held in contempt of court -NY attorney general,"By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York's attorney general on Thursday asked a state judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court for not turning over documents she subpoenaed for a civil probe into the former U.S. president's business practices.
In a court filing, Attorney General Letitia James said Trump failed to honor a court order that he comply ""in full"" with her subpoena for documents and information by March 31.
James asked that Trump be fined $10,000 a day, and perhaps more, until he complies.
""The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J. Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,"" James said in a statement. ""Instead of obeying a court order, Mr. Trump is trying to evade it.""
Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and called the probe a ""witch hunt.""
“We are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the attorney general's office,"" Trump's lawyer Alina Habba said in an emailed statement. ""Our client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the attorney general’s office over the years.""
James' three-year probe and a parallel criminal probe led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.
Last week, James said her probe had found ""significant evidence"" suggesting that for more than a decade the company's financial statements ""relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits.""
James has questioned how the Trump Organization valued the ""Trump brand,"" as well as properties including golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump's own penthouse apartment in midtown Manhattan's Trump Tower.
On Feb. 17, Justice Arthur Engoron of the New York state court in Manhattan ordered Trump to produce documents covered by the subpoena by March 3, and for Trump and his adult children Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump to be questioned under oath.
Trump later obtained an extension through March 31 to produce documents. He and his children asked a state appeals court to overturn the ruling requiring their testimony.
'THE SHIP HAS... SAILED'
In a March 31 filing, another lawyer for Trump objected that the subpoena was ""grossly overbroad"" and unduly burdensome, and sought information protected by attorney-client or executive privilege.
But James said on Thursday that Engoron's order was not an ""opening bid"" entitling Trump to renegotiate the subpoena.
""The ship has long since sailed on Mr. Trump's ability to raise any such objections,"" she wrote.
James said that given Trump's ""purported meticulous involvement"" at his company, ""it seems incredible that now virtually no documents exist"" suggesting he had a personal role in reviewing asset valuations.
And while James has received Trump's personal tax returns from 2011 to 2018, she said Trump has stonewalled on providing other materials, including documents or notes in his own handwriting.
In February, Trump's longtime accounting firm Mazars USA cut ties with him and the Trump Organization, saying it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements.
The Trumps have called James' probe ""a politically-motivated gambit that was commenced in bad faith,"" and intended to advance her career at their expense. 
James, a Democrat, is seeking reelection in November. Trump, a Republican, may seek a second White House term in 2024.
The status of Bragg's criminal probe has been uncertain, following the resignation in February of the two senior prosecutors who had led it.
According to the New York Times, Bragg, who took office in January and inherited the criminal probe from fellow Democrat Cyrus Vance Jr, has expressed doubts about charging Trump.

In a statement on Thursday, Bragg said his office's investigation is continuing and defended his handling of it.
""Prosecutors fulfilling their duties cannot and do not bring only cases that are 'slam dunks,'"" he said. ""I pledge that the office will publicly state the conclusion of our investigation - whether we conclude our work without bringing charges, or move forward with an indictment.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock indexes mostly rose on Thursday as investors snapped up beaten-down shares, while the U.S. dollar climbed to its highest in nearly two years and the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield touched a three-year high following hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve.
Wall Street stocks reversed early declines to end the day higher.

""We've been trading in relatively thin liquidity the last two weeks, which makes it easier to have (bigger) moves both up and down."" 
St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, said the Fed remains behind in its fight against inflation despite increases in mortgage rates and government bond yields. A day earlier, minutes released from the Fed's March meeting suggested the U.S. central bank's balance sheet reduction could start next month. 
U.S. Treasury yields have jumped along with expectations of faster policy tightening by the Fed and other central banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.06 points, or 0.25%, to 34,583.57, the S&P 500 gained 19.06 points, or 0.43%, to 4,500.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.48 points, or 0.06%, to 13,897.30.
The S&P 500 ended lower for the last two sessions in a row.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.21% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.11%.
In Treasuries, the 2 year-10 year spread widened as traders sharpened their focus on the pace and scope of the Fed's plans to reduce its balance sheet.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 3.8 basis points to 2.647% while the 2-year note yield was down 4.5 basis points at 2.457%, leaving the 2-10 spread at 18.72 basis points.
The near 27 basis point widening of that spread so far this week is the most for any week back to June 2013. Last week the spread tightened 27.5 basis points in the sharpest weekly tightening since September 2011. The yield curve inverted last week, signaling to some investors that a recession may be coming in a year or two.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Joe Biden's pick to be the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, a former official for defense acquisition in the administration of President Barack Obama.
Bill LaPlante, who was head of Charles Stark Draper Laboratories Inc, was approved by voice vote to be the next undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment at the Department of Defense.
Last month, Biden sought a record peacetime national defense budget of $813 billion, including the largest research and development budget in history.
At the same time, the budget slows the Defense Department's purchasing of the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, after Air Force leaders complained that technological improvements to the jet's hardware were too slow.
Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.
Only 61 F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) were requested by the Pentagon, down from a request of 85 last year, though experts believe Congress will increase that figure during the budget process.
The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
The 2023 fiscal budget, which starts on Oct. 1, boasts the Pentagon's largest research and development budget ever, with $130 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Chinese national has been sentenced to 29 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to conspiring to steal trade secrets from agricultural company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) to benefit the Chinese government, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
Xiang Haitao, 44, who was employed by Monsanto and a subsidiary from 2008 to 2017, had pleaded guilty in Missouri federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage.
On Thursday, he was sentenced to 29 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and a $150,000 fine, the Justice Department said in a statement.
""Xiang conspired to steal an important trade secret to gain an unfair advantage for himself and the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division.
""Economic espionage is a serious offense that can threaten U.S. companies’ competitive advantage, and the National Security Division is committed to holding accountable anyone who steals trade secrets to benefit a foreign government,"" Olsen said.
Federal officials found Xiang in possession of copies of a proprietary predictive algorithm developed by Monsanto as he was waiting to board a flight to China in June 2017, the Justice Department said.

He was allowed to fly to China, where he worked for the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Soil Science. He was arrested when he returned to the United States in November 2019, the Justice Department added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House and Senate lawmakers said Thursday they have chosen negotiators to hammer out a deal on a bill to provide $52 billion in government subsidies for semiconductor production after months of discussion.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy named about 80 House lawmakers including the chairs and top Republicans on some key committees that will take part in a process known as a ""conference committee"" to reach a compromise version.
The Senate first passed chips legislation in June that also authorized $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China, while the House passed its version in early February that contained different provisions aimed at boosting competition with China.
A persistent industry-wide chip shortage has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some companies to scale back production.
There are growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors and the White House says funding is an urgent national security concern to ensure long-term U.S. supply of chips.
In 1990, the United States produced 37% of all chips while today it accounts for only 12% of global production.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday they are also both naming 13 negotiators.
""The Senate must now restore a product that reflects what passed this chamber with bipartisan support,"" McConnell said. ""Without major concessions and changes from House Democrats, this legislation has no chance of becoming law.""
The House bill has several trade provisions and would authorize $8 billion in U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established by the Paris Agreement to combat climate change.
Schumer said negotiators will ensure ""the Senate-passed bill stays on track to create more good-paying jobs, boost domestic manufacturing, and spark American ingenuity.""

On Wednesday, the White House held a classified briefing with lawmakers to discuss the ""escalating vulnerabilities"" to the U.S. economy from the chips supply chain.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando said the administration would work to help lawmakers reach consensus, saying the legislation ""brings home manufacturing jobs, secures our supply chains, and helps America stay globally competitive.""

(Reuters) -HP Inc's stock soared to a record high on Thursday after billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it had taken an 11.4% stake valued at about $4.2 billion in the maker of personal computers and printers.
Berkshire revealed in a Wednesday night regulatory filing that it owned nearly 121 million HP (NYSE:HPQ) shares, including 11.1 million purchased this week.
Shares of HP closed up $5.15, or 14.8%, at $40.06, after earlier rising to $41.46.
Companies' stock prices often rise when Berkshire discloses new stakes, regarded as a stamp of approval from Buffett.
Berkshire does not regularly invest in technology companies, despite ending 2021 with a $161.2 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Buffett considers the iPhone maker more of a consumer company that he can understand.
""Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world's most respected investors and we welcome them as an investor,"" HP said in a statement.
Separated in 2015 from the former Hewlett-Packard, HP is benefiting from increased demand as people spend more time working and being schooled at home.
The Palo Alto, California-based company agreed last month to buy audio and video accessories maker Poly, once known as Plantronics (NYSE:POLY), for $1.7 billion.
Buffett has struggled to invest Berkshire's cash, which totaled $146.7 billion at year end, citing high valuations and competition from private equity and other investors.
But in the last month, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate said it has committed approximately $22 billion to major new investments.
These include a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) and an $11.6 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2016.
Berkshire also owns dozens of businesses including Geico auto insurance and the BNSF railroad.
It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said HP might appeal to Berkshire because HP is aggressively returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and higher dividends.

""HP operates in markets that are challenging to (durably) grow at heightened rates, so focusing on margins and returns are the best way to reward shareholders,"" Cash said. ""Within tech, HP can be considered a value play.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Qatar Airways and Airbus clashed in court on Thursday over the fate of billions of dollars of jet orders as their 25-year partnership unravelled in scenes resembling a corporate divorce trial.
The two sides have been locked for months in a dispute over damaged lightning protection within the painted skin of the A350 that Qatar says has forced it to ground jets and stop taking deliveries.
Their dispute widened to the industry's best-selling model in January when Airbus revoked an order from Qatar for the smaller A321neo, declaring ""enough is enough"" after the public clash over A350 safety.
On Thursday, Qatar asked a UK judge to freeze the cancellation pending a full trial expected to be months away. The first A321neo is due to be delivered 2023. A lawyer for Airbus said a Boeing (NYSE:BA) jet would be a suitable replacement, a statement which the airline noted was at odds with the plane maker's marketing pitch.
The judge deferred a decision until at least April 26, when a further hearing is due on a separate issue in the intertwined A350 dispute.
The case has illustrated the delicate relations between France, where Airbus is based, and one of its closest Gulf allies. Qatar is a major gas producer and Europe is looking to reduce reliance on Russian gas.
Court filings have also shed light on industrial planning and details of usually secretive aircraft negotiations.
Qatar launched the A350, Europe's answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with an order for 80 in 2007 to serve its Doha hub, becoming the jet's biggest operator.
Since last year, however, it has grounded 23 of the jets, voicing concerns over problems with lightning protection exposed by cracked and bubbling paint.
It is suing Airbus for steadily rising compensation that now exceeds $1 billion.
""One would certainly not want to be sitting under a roof in that condition,"" Qatar Airways' lawyer Philip Shepherd told the court, referring to damage on the crown of the fuselage of A350s.
The world's largest planemaker has acknowledged quality problems but insists damage is well within safety tolerances, noting European regulators consider them airworthy and other airlines keep flying them despite various degrees of similar findings.
Lightning strikes jets about once a year and the A350 includes a layer of copper foil to protect its lightweight carbon fuselage.
Airbus told the court relations with the Gulf carrier had ""seriously broken down"" after what it describes as a manoeuvre to win compensation and cover up weak demand for plane tickets.
Qatar says Airbus has failed to honour its promises and insists it desperately needs more planes to host the World Cup this year.
""Airbus considers that Qatar Airways' conduct has broken relations,"" Airbus lawyer Sonia Tolaney said.
The two sides had what amounted to an industrial custody row in court, arguing over whether they could work together on other planes still in the fleet or yet to be delivered.
The issue of co-operation is significant as the judge ponders whether to keep the A321neo deal alive for now.
Qatar also accused Airbus of tilting the argument by increasing the threshold for problems with the anti-lightning mesh allowed in the repair manual.
""That is simply making the goal smaller at their end, half way through the game,"" Shepherd told the hearing. 
Airbus said this misrepresented the facts but confirmed it had increased the maximum gap to 1,000 mm2 from 200 mm2 following engineering analysis.
'NOT UNIQUE'
To decide on Qatar's request for an injunction, the judge will also weigh which side has most to lose and to what extent the plane is unique in its category.
That issue goes to the heart of Airbus's battle for sales with rival Boeing in the busiest part of the market. Arguments in court appeared to contrast with rhetoric at air shows.
Airbus told the court Qatar Airways could replace the cancelled A321neos with the rival Boeing 737 MAX, which it provisionally ordered in December, or Airbus jets that are available from leasing companies.
The MAX has ""comparable if not better range,"" Airbus lawyer Tolaney said.
Last year, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said the A321neo had ""unmatched capabilities (and) operating economics"". Airbus has outsold Boeing four to one at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets.
It was left to Qatar Airways to play up the ""unique"" benefits of the A321neo though the airline faced repeated questions from the judge on whether it could rely on leasing firms or Boeing instead.
Analysts say the largest MAX variant has less range than the A321neo, prompting Boeing to think about designing a new jet.

Airline chiefs contacted by Reuters did not share Qatar's concerns over airworthiness of the A350 but voiced impatience over the plane's sporadic surface problems and the breakdown of an industry consensus over safety.
""It is not good for the industry. They both need to get it out of the courtroom and find an agreement,"" the chief executive of one Airbus customer told Reuters.

The administration said in a statement ""there was broad consensus that charging stations and vehicles need to be interoperable and provide a seamless user experience, no matter what car you drive or where you charge your EV.""
Musk has often been at odds with the White House, frequently firing off harsh tweets directed at President Joe Biden. In February, Biden publicly acknowledged the role of Tesla in U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing, after Musk repeatedly complained about being ignored.
Congress last year approved $7.5 billion in government funding for EV charging stations, but legislation has stalled for new tax incentives to purchase and build EVs. 
Biden wants at least 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley, Chrysler-parent Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Americas chair Jeremie Papin were among other auto leaders who took part in Wednesday's meeting, which discussed U.S. funding to ""create a national network of 500,000 chargers.""
On Thursday, Farley posted a tweet praising the meeting's focus on charging, including for commercial vehicles.
Also in attendance were Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu.
Granholm said Thursday on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it was a ""very productive meeting - as we roll out EVs and charging infrastructure the CEOs were very forthcoming about government's role as a partner in electrifying the transportation sector.""
Executives from Hyundai Motor America, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) of America, Mazda North America,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) North America Mercedes-Benz USA and Kia Motors America also took part.
Each auto executive received about 90 seconds to talk about their EV plans and spoke about a wide range of issues around EVs, including battery supply chain concerns, one company executive told Reuters. Biden last week invoked the Defense Production Act in a bid to boost U.S. production of minerals needed for electric vehicles.

Last week, automakers backed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new tougher vehicle emissions regulations in a court challenge brought by some states and ethanol groups.
Corn growers, a  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) subsidiary and other ethanol producers said the new EPA rules revising emission requirements through 2026 ""effectively mandate the production and sale of electric cars rather than cars powered by internal combustion engines.""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Thursday, with  Pfizer  and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fueling a late-session rally while investors eyed the war in Ukraine and a potentially more aggressive Federal Reserve. 
Tesla Inc rose 1.2% and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) added 0.6%, helping lift the S&P 500 and provide the Nasdaq a modest gain. 
Also supporting the S&P 500, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) jumped 4.3%after it said it would buy privately held ReViral Ltd in a deal worth as much as $525 million, its second acquisition in less than six months to boost its drug portfolio.
The S&P traded at a loss for much of the day before rallying near the end of the session.
“We don't know how Ukraine is going resolve itself. We don't know how this hawkish Fed is going to impact the economy. We don't know if they can navigate a soft landing. What it equals is a whipsaw market,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. “If you're following trends, then you're lost in this market because all this market is is chop.”
Mega-cap growth stocks came under pressure earlier this week after comments from Fed policymakers and minutes from the central bank's March meeting suggested a rapid removal of stimulus measures put in place during the pandemic.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank's short-term policy rate should reach 3.5% later this year.
Minutes released on Wednesday showed that Fed officials ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase since 2018.
""The realization for investors continues that the Fed is still not at max hawkishness and we're going to err on the side of them wanting to do more to continue to control inflation,"" said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital Network, an investment marketplace firm.

U.S. companies will start reporting first-quarter results in the coming weeks, with banks set to kick off the season in earnest next week. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' earnings to have grown 6.4% in the March quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. That compares with over 30% growth in the prior quarter.
""As we get into the heart of earnings season, I expect volatility to be very prominent,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""We could see strong results that beat the highest expectations, but weak expectations for the next 12 months.""
Among the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, real estate was among the deepest decliners, while the health sector index was among the top gainers.
Adding to cautious sentiment, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that contained ""unacceptable"" elements, while the U.S. Senate voted to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia in one bill and ban oil imports in another.

Investing.com – Stocks are ending Thursday on a positive note after investors soaked in the Federal Reserves signals about how it plans to tighten monetary policy.
But now the market enters a fairly quiet period as people head out on spring break vacations, with earnings from large companies expected to roll out later this month.
It appeared to be dip buying investors who pushed the indexes higher on Thursday after they were mixed to down earlier in the session. The Fed plans to start paring back its bond purchases as early as May, when it has its next policy meeting. 
Analysts believe the first quarter will be a good one for tech companies, though higher yields on bonds may take some of the investor momentum out of the space. 
Also taking space on the calendar is next month’s annual meeting of Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb), back in-person for the first time in two years. The event is usually a lively blend of entertainment, shopping and folksy investment advice from Buffett and his long-time lieutenant, Charlie Munger.
Buffett has been making waves lately, late Wednesday disclosing an 11% stake in HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the computer maker after only recently buying the insurance company Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) for $11.6 billion. Perhaps elephant hunting season has finally arrived for the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Wholesale inventories
U.S. month-over-month wholesale inventories data will be released Friday at 10:00 AM ET. Analysts predict wholesale inventories, which gauge the change in the total value of goods held in inventory by wholesalers across the United States, will come in at 2.1%, above the previously reported 0.8%.
2. Signs of life
The U.S. Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count, which is considered a leading indicator of demand for oil products, will also be reported Friday at 1 PM ET. The last count had the number at 531, according to data tracked by Investing.com.
3. Congress recess
After confirming President Joe Biden’s pick for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to become the first Black woman jurist on the high court, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are leaving for recess with some business hanging. That includes the confirmation votes for Biden’s Fed nominees, including Chair Jerome Powell’s second term, and more funds for his Covid preparedness plans, which were stuck in the Senate as of midday Thursday.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 04:01PM ET</span>",Amazon faces shareholder vote on treatment of warehouse workers,"By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber
LONDON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc., the world's biggest retailer, will face a shareholder vote calling for an independent audit of its treatment of warehouse workers after the top U.S. securities regulator turned down the company's request to skip the resolution.
The decision means Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) investors will get to vote on the issue for the first time, proponents said, taking advantage of guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November that made it more supportive of votes on significant social issues.
Founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, Amazon has drawn increasing criticism in recent years for its treatment of workers, including claims of poor working conditions at its warehouses and its attempts to block workers unionising.
With investors globally pushing companies to look after their workforce as part of an increased focus on social issues, London-based retail investor activist platform Tulipshare helped file a resolution seeking to shine a light on Amazon's practices.
Specifically, the proposal - filed under the name of a Tulipshare investor, Thomas Dadashi Tazehozi - asked the company to commission an independent audit and report on working conditions at the company.
While Amazon asked the SEC to let them refuse to put the resolution to a vote, claiming the issue relates to ordinary business operations, an April 6 letter from the SEC disagreed.
""In our view, the Tazehozi Proposal transcends ordinary business matters,"" said the letter seen by Reuters. 
Amazon declined to comment on the SEC response when contacted by Reuters. An annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled for May 25. 
A separate shareholder resolution seeking an audit on workplace health and safety submitted to the company by investors including the Domini Impact Equity Fund was not backed by the regulator, though.
Noting that the second resolution was ""substantially duplicative"" of the first, the SEC said there was some basis for the company's request that it be allowed to skip the vote, and it would not recommend enforcement action if Amazon were to do so.

Last week some 55% of workers who cast a ballot at a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to form the first U.S. union at Amazon.
In its objection filed with the National Labor Relations Board, Amazon on Thursday accused the union, called the Amazon Labor Union, of threatening to act against staff unless they voted for organising. An attorney for the union called the assertion ""really absurd.""

MILAN (Reuters) -The Benetton family, which controls Italy's Atlantia, has told Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield it is not interested in the funds' takeover approach for the Italian road and airport operator.
In a statement issued on Thursday by Edizione, the family's holding company, the Benettons said the investment in Atlantia is strategic and they want to preserve the group's Italian roots and its integrity.
They also confirmed discussions are under way with Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), as a partner, for their own deal that would strengthen their grip on Atlantia but added that no agreement had yet been reached.
GIP and Brookfield earlier confirmed they had pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia, which operates airports in Rome and southern France and motorways in Europe and Latin America.
Shares in Atlantia, which has a market capitalisation of more than 16 billion euros ($17.5 billion), surged as much as 12% on the prospect of a bidding war also involving Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid soccer club.
They ended up 6.9% at 20.3 euros.
The two funds, which specialise in infrastructure investments, confirmed they met Edizione on March 3 and 23 and presented the proposal to it on March 30. Edizione owns 33% of Atlantia.
The funds have an agreement with Perez's ACS for the Spanish construction company to acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer was completed.
The idea is to create two companies to extract more value, a source close to the funds said, adding Atlantia would be delisted.
GIP and Brookfield are working with Rothschild and another bank while Edizione and Blackstone have enlisted the help of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), two separate sources said. 
GOLDEN POWERS
GIP and Brookfield had cautioned that they might not make a bid for a company, with an enterprise value of more than 45 billion euros once net debt is factored in.
Politics also risk complicating the situation, with the Italian government having veto ""golden powers"" over ownership of the country's airports. 
""The theoretical deal would be markedly complex due to valuation, political and financing considerations,"" Kepler Cheuvreux said in a note, referring to any deal by ACS and its partners.
Alessandro Benetton was appointed chairman of Edizione this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments. Edizione said at the time it deemed its investment in Atlantia to be strategic.
Perez and the Benettons are already linked through their joint ownership of Spanish highway operator Abertis.
Through ACS, Perez previously pursued a bid for Atlantia's Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia but did not manage to secure the backing of the Italian government.

Atlantia eventually sold the unit, focus of a dispute with the government after the deadly collapse of a bridge in 2018, to Italian state lender CDP and allies. It is set to pocket 8 billion euros from the deal this year.

However, it now acknowledges the ""diminishing virulence of COVID-19.""

640,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 02:36PM ET</span>",New lithium technology can help the world go green -- if it works,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), General Motors and even the U.S. Energy Department are investing heavily in a crop of newer technologies that could revolutionize the way lithium is produced for electric vehicle batteries.
Now those technologies just have to prove they work on a commercial scale.
If they do, miners will be able to boost global lithium production with a footprint far smaller than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds, which often are the size of multiple football fields and unpopular with local communities.
These so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies extract the white metal from brine using filters, membranes, ceramic beads or other equipment that can typically be housed in a small warehouse. But they often use lots of potable water and electricity, and none have worked at commercial scale.
Global automakers, mining companies and investors are pouring millions of dollars into DLE companies, betting they can supply the bulk of the lithium needed to power the electric vehicle revolution.
""It's such a game changer. There's huge opportunities,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told an energy conference last month about DLE.
Granholm's department has given Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc a $15 million grant to test DLE technology at California's Salton Sea, under which sit large geothermal lithium deposits, and is considering funding other DLE projects.
DLE technologies would challenge traditional miners such as  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp, the world's largest lithium producer, and prospective miners such as Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, ioneer Ltd and Piedmont Lithium Inc.
Albemarle is studying various DLE technologies but its executives have said DLE likely works best when engineered for a specific lithium deposit, which could curb enthusiasm.
Large water usage by several types of DLE technologies has raised eyebrows. The technology General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is relying on to supply a ""sizeable amount"" of its lithium from the Salton Sea region uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced.
Privately held Lilac Solutions Inc, backed by BMW and Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, developed that technology and said it could use a desalination plant to filter brackish water to avoid using potable water.
""If needed, we're willing to make those capital investments to ensure we're not jeopardizing anyone's freshwater,"" said Lilac CEO Dave Snydacker. ""New technology is absolutely essential for society to obtain the volumes of lithium that are necessary for electric vehicles.""
Prominent short seller Hindenburg Research issued a 59-page report in February questioning whether the DLE technology from Standard Lithium Ltd even works, despite backing for its Arkansas project from chemical giants Koch Industries Inc and  Lanxess  AG (DE:LXSG).
""DLE is one of those technologies that's been a hope and a prayer, Hail Mary for most, so that's fertile ground for stock promoters,"" said Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg.
Standard disputed the allegations in the report, which erased more than $300 million in Standard's market value in one day and stoked fears about the DLE movement. The stock has partially recovered.
'I'M A SKEPTIC'
There are dozens of DLE-focused companies worldwide, some with their own technologies, some with brine-rich acreage and some with both.
""Direct lithium extraction is becoming a hot subject,"" said Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Inc, which is developing DLE technology with Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp. It hopes to supply Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Nevada Gigafactory, but has acknowledged it must find a way to produce the metal without potable water.
U.S. and global ambitions to go green are at stake. At least 70% of the U.S. lithium deposits are held in brine reserves, according to the Energy Department. Elsewhere, DLE offers a chance to produce lithium in areas where open-pit mines face strong opposition.
In Germany, Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd aims to use DLE the produce the metal for Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) and other automakers from Germany's Black Forest.
""As the EV transition accelerates, we can grow with that market,"" said Horst Kreuter, Vulcan's CEO.
Privately held Luna Lithium Ltd plans to use DLE in Nevada, CEO Emily Hersh said. In Utah's Great Salt Lake, Compass Minerals International (NYSE:CMP) Inc has been trying to chose a DLE technology for more than a year and hopes to make a decision this summer.
Galvanic Energy LLC aims to sell to sell the 100,000 brine-rich acres it controls in Arkansas if it finds a DLE technology that works.
""These companies promote and talk about what they can do, but I'm a skeptic until proven otherwise,"" said Brent Wilson, a former Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) geologist who formed Galvanic in 2018. 
Rio Tinto Ltd paid $825 million last December for an Argentina DLE project, which it said ""has the potential to significantly increase lithium recoveries as compared to solar evaporation ponds.""
Privately held Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, known as EnergyX, has developed a DLE technology that uses membranes to filter lithium, but in some cases, EnergyX's DLE membrane technology may have to be paired with another DLE technology, said CEO Teague Egan.
""Our DLE membrane technology is very good, but DLE doesn't have to mean one technology or another. I think that's what people fail to see,"" said Egan, who aims to take EnergyX public by mid-2023.
EnergyX recently sent a pilot version of its technology to Bolivia in the hopes of convincing La Paz to chose it to develop the Uyuni salt flat, one of the world's largest lithium deposits. 

Lilac, as well as several Chinese and Russian companies, are also competing for the Bolivian project, pointing to the rising global attention paid to the industry.
""DLE is not a magic wand, but it is a very valuable tool in the toolkit,"" said Luna Lithium's Hersh.

(Reuters) -The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said on Thursday it granted  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) an extension to build two pipelines in Texas and Louisiana to connect to a Texas liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, and NextDecade (NASDAQ:NEXT) Corp is also seeking more time to build a Texas LNG project.
Sempra Energy was granted an extension until March 31, 2023, for the two pipelines that will connect to its Port Arthur LNG plant. NextDecade Corp on Wednesday also sought an extension, to November 2028, for its Rio Grande LNG project in Brownsville, Texas.
NextDecade did not reply to a request for comment.
NextDecade on Wednesday also announced it had reached a 20-year deal to supply 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the proposed Rio Grande facility to a unit of China's ENN Natural Gas Co.
Several LNG developers have announced new deals this year that could push ahead proposed plants.  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) signed a 2.7 MTPA deal with ENN while Mexico Pacific Ltd received a 2 MPTA deal from Chinese gas and power supplier Guangzhou Development Co. 

In January, NextDecade said a financial investment decision for the Rio Grande LNG project would be delayed until the second half of the year. It was originally expected to start producing LNG in 2023.
At the start of 2020 and again in 2021, roughly a dozen firms signaled plans for financial investment decisions on proposed projects. But only Sempra's Costa Azul in Mexico started construction in 2020. Numerous others have been pushed into 2022.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 02:16PM ET</span>",Analysis: JetBlue faces struggle in selling Spirit takeover bid to investors,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Robin Hayes, the ebullient chief executive of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp, was on an Amtrak train on Tuesday coming back from Boston when news broke that his company had made an offer to acquire  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc.
Hayes said the company was not yet ready to go public with its offer for the ultra-low-cost carrier, but the news leak forced its hand. On a conference call the next morning, the reasons were apparent as JetBlue struggled to convince investors of the rationale behind its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid.
The surprise move by the New York-based carrier has baffled Wall Street because it seeks to combine two companies with very little in common other than fleets dominated by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) jets. As a result, the deal is expected to be very expensive for JetBlue, which raises questions about any assumed synergies.
JetBlue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company's stock has fallen about 19% since the news broke. JetBlue shares were down 4.2% at $11.92 on Thursday afternoon.
A main concern of investors is the starkly different business models of the two carriers.
Spirit is a no-frills carrier that relies on fares stripped down to the lowest possible level, supplemented by charges for extras such as booking through a call center, a strategy known as unbundling. 
The success of its business model is driven by a low cost structure that has allowed it to offer low base fares and maintain high profit margins.
In contrast, JetBlue is a premium leisure airline. Its offerings include free checked bags, an assortment of complementary food and private suites.
Hayes is promising lower fares following the deal's completion. Delivering on that promise, however, would be a tall order, analysts say.
JetBlue's costs and fares are already higher than those at Spirit and other ultra-low-cost carriers. Since the company would have to raise salaries of Spirit pilots to bring them in line with its pay structure, the cost pressure is expected to worsen.
Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James, estimates wages for Spirit pilots would need to increase in the range of 7% to 51% to reach parity with JetBlue's current rates.
The company also plans to retrofit Spirit's fleet in order to provide more leg room and a ""superior"" onboard experience to customers, which it said would be a multiyear investment. Industry experts say the move would leave the airline with fewer seats to fill with passengers, resulting in lower productivity.
Equally daunting will be the task of integrating the culture of two airlines that have been following different service models. JetBlue told investors that cultural integration would be critical to the deal's success.
Aviation analyst Robert Mann reckons JetBlue's offer was ""rushed to market."" ""Everybody is kind of somewhere between pulling their hair out and just dismissing it,"" he said.
'A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY' 
JetBlue, however, views the deal as a way to expand its domestic footprint amid persistent labor and aircraft shortages. It tried to buy Virgin America in 2016, but lost out to  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Inc.
Hayes said the company had been thinking about how to pursue growth for a long time. And once budget carrier Frontier Group Holdings Inc announced a deal in early February to merge with Spirit, he said it created ""a window of opportunity that if you don't act in it, it's gone."" 
The company is betting a combination with Spirit would accelerate its growth in Florida and Los Angeles and open up opportunities in Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta and Miami.
Following the deal, the two carriers will have a combined fleet of 455 aircraft, with deliveries of another 220 jets from Airbus expected by 2027. It offers greater flexibility at a time when airlines cannot get new aircraft delivered fast enough.
Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group, said growing in size would also allow JetBlue to attract pilots by offering them better careers.
""Clearly, the airline wants to be more than just a domestic airline,"" Harteveldt said. ""So a combined JetBlue and Spirit would be appealing to pilots who want to work for a growing airline in the future.""
EXECUTION RISK
Despite these potential long-term benefits, industry experts say the deal is fraught with execution risks.
Veteran budget airline investor Bill Franke, who masterminded Frontier's tie-up with Spirit, once said that failing to remain disciplined about the business model and allowing other costs to creep in was the ""path to hell"" for airlines.
Franke stuck to that formula in the deal with Spirit. The two carriers not only have no-frills business models but also have highly complementary networks and both use Airbus jets.
In comparison, JetBlue and Spirit have a high degree of concentration in South Florida, which is expected to draw scrutiny from regulators.
Analysts at UBS said while the merits of a Frontier-Spirit combination were more straightforward, JetBlue's bid was a ""head-scratcher.""
The prospect of a tie-up between ultra-low cost and hybrid business models is reminiscent of Wizz Air Holdings Plc's unsuccessful overtures toward Britain's Easyjet Plc last year, which the latter rejected.

Wizz is also part of Franke's investment stable, though his support for a move that seemingly breaks his own investment rule was unclear. Analysts at the time questioned the mixing of airline types, in what proved to be a precursor of the present debate over JetBlue's strategy.
""It's kind of half-baked, honestly,"" said analyst Mann, referring to JetBlue's bid.

LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity trader Trafigura and other firms are moving to take large amounts of zinc out of London Metal Exchange approved warehouses in Asia, sources familiar with the matter said, fuelling concern about more problems at the exchange after chaotic nickel trading last month.
A Trafigura spokesperson in response to request for comment said ""we don't usually comment on commercial matters"".
The LME, the world's biggest market for industrial metals, suspended nickel trading on March 8 and cancelled billions of dollars in trades after prices spiked by more than 50% in a matter of hours to a record above $100,000 a tonne.
Stocks of zinc, used to galvanise steel, in LME warehouses have fallen 40% since December to 127,675 tonnes.
This week, the proportion of zinc due to be leaving LME warehouses shot up to 65% from 26%, LME data showed. 
Title: LME Zinc Prices Soar, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanboejpa/LME%20Zinc%20Prices%20Soar%20as%20Inventories%20Tumble.png 
An LME spokesperson said: ""We note the current tightness in the zinc market and are monitoring all metals closely to ensure market activity remains orderly.""
Rapid falls of metals in LME warehouses that underpin the exchange's physically-deliverable futures contracts can result in price volatility.
""Some market participants fear that the zinc market could experience similar turmoil as the nickel market has,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Daniel Briesemann said.
Traders said low liquidity on the 145-year-old exchange could also contribute to erratic price movements in zinc, which should be limited by the 15% daily price limits introduced by the LME after the nickel fiasco. 
Trafigura is bringing the metal from Asia to Europe to replace lost production at Belgium's Nyrstar, in which it has a majority stake, zinc market sources said. 
Zinc is leaving the LME system because of significant shortages created by producers cutting output due to record power prices. Production of zinc is energy intensive. 
The problem is especially acute in Europe. Of the 500 tonnes of zinc stored in LME warehouse in Europe, only 25 tonnes is available to the market.
Premiums for physical metal in Europe have soared due to zinc smelter cutbacks, which also affected commodity trader and miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
""It's possible that some of that metal is being pulled out by people looking to take advantage of the premium at the moment or by parties that have commitments and need metal,"" said Duncan Hobbs, research manager at Concord Resources.
The premium for special high-grade zinc at the Belgian port of Antwerp has spiked to a record $460 per tonne from $170 last October before the winter heating crisis kicked in, according to Fastmarkets.
Benchmark zinc hit a record high of $4,896 a tonne last month on escalating worries about supplies. 

Zinc stocks in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses have climbed this year, but logistics issues mean it is not easy to rebalance the market. 
""We've also had these very high freight rates, especially container freight rates, which have impeded the flow of metal from one region to another,"" Hobbs added.

The ""Call of Duty"" maker, which is being acquired by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for $68.7 billion, said it will raise the minimum hourly wages for these employees - from the Activision Publishing and Blizzard divisions - to $20 or more and also offer them access to full company benefits.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) turned its back on a takeover approach from KKR on Thursday when it refused to grant the U.S. fund access to its books because it had not confirmed bid terms. 
KKR first approached TIM last November with a non-binding offer valuing the company at 10.8 billion euros ($11.8 billion) but TIM only agreed to open talks last month.
In a statement after a board meeting, TIM said that it cannot grant KKR access to its data room as the fund did not validate the terms of its initial 0.505 euro per share approach, confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters.
""Should KKR submit a deliverable, complete and attractive offer ... TIM Board of Directors would be open to reconsidering its decision in the interest of all shareholders,"" TIM said.
KKR declined to comment.
Leading TIM shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) had said the KKR approach was too low, even though it is well above the current price of 0.31 euros. 
TIM's move comes as new boss Pietro Labriola is pressing ahead with a strategy to revamp the company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its services business.
STANDALONE STRATEGY
Details of the Labriola's plan, aimed at unlocking what the debt-laden group calls its untapped value, would be fleshed out by the summer. 
As part of this, TIM has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber. 
Such a deal, advocated by the government, could entail a role for infrastructure and private equity funds, including KKR, sources have previously said.
""KKR ultimately confirmed its interest in exploring any other transactions in the interest of the company, its shareholders and Italy,"" TIM said in its statement.
KKR is already an investor in TIM's last-mile fixed-line network, having invested 1.8 billion euros to secure a 37.5% stake in a venture called FiberCop.
CDP, which holds a 10% stake in TIM, holds a 60% stake in Open Fiber and aims to secure full control of any combined network entity, sources have said.
Separately, TIM is assessing an approach by European private equity fund CVC which submitted a non binding bid for a minority stake in an enterprise services business that could be spun out of the group. 

Other private equity funds, including Apollo and Apax Partners, are circling TIM with the view to buy into its services business, sources have said.

Tata Neu, which has been in the works for about two years, is a single platform for the group's brands, including Westside fashion, Air Asia tickets, Croma electronics, the Taj group of hotels, BigBasket online grocery and 1mg online pharmacy.
""Our aim is to make the lives of Indian consumers simpler and easier,"" Tata's Chairman N Chandrasekaran said on LinkedIn, adding that its joint venture airline Vistara and recently acquired Air India, as well as watch brand Titan will be available on the app soon.
The 154-year-old group, which raked in $103 billion in revenue in 2020-21, is a leading player in steelmaking, IT outsourcing and utilities but arguably best known internationally as the owner of British luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover. It also makes cars at home under its own brand. 
Tata also has an expansive offline retail portfolio, including a joint venture with  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). Its fashion and watch stores are ubiquitous on Indian high streets and it operates stores for  Inditex  (MC:ITX) fashion brand Zara.

Despite launching the Tata CliQ online marketplace in 2016, the group has been a minnow in an e-commerce market widely projected to be worth $200 billion by 2026. With Tata Neu the group is determined to change that, sources told Reuters last year.
Tata Neu will offer a membership program and a cross-brand loyalty scheme where customers can earn and redeem rewards while making purchases on the app.

The rouble ended the day 5% higher at 75.75 against the dollar after briefly touching 74.2625, its strongest level since Feb. 11.
Moves in the rouble were jittery and trading volumes on the Moscow Exchange were small compared with levels seen before Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The rouble has recently been steered by mandatory conversion of dollar and euro revenues by export-focused companies, while demand for forex has been limited by capital controls that the central bank imposed as the rouble crashed to record lows in March.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that his ministry together with the central bank were working on measures to make the rouble exchange rate more predictable and less volatile.
Against the euro, the rouble firmed more than 6% to 81.45 after touching its strongest level since late October of 80.69.
On the interbank market the rouble was weaker. Banks offered to buy dollars at 76.75 and sell them at 81.75. The euro/rouble rates stood at 83.50 and 88.95, respectively.
The Russian currency has so far shrugged off fears that Russia was edging closer to a potential default on its international debt as it paid dollar bondholders in roubles and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves were blocked by sanctions.
On the stock market, the rouble-based MOEX Russian index climbed 0.9% higher to 2,635.4 after falling the day before when shares took a hit from new sanctions. 
The United States on Wednesday announced a new round of penalties targeting Russian financial institutions, as well as Kremlin officials and their family members.
The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 5.6% to 1,092.4 points, its highest since Feb. 23.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department stepped up its crackdown against Russian airlines on Thursday, slapping Aeroflot , Azur Air, and UTair with enforcement actions for violating American export controls issued after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The enforcement action denies the three Russian cariers export privileges and targets the entire airlines, not just specific planes. The U.S. government believes the actions will over time make the carriers largely unable to continue flights.
Previously, the United States had identified more than 170 Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes that Russian airlines were operating in violation of U.S. sanctions, including about 40 Aeroflot Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes, 21 Azur Boeing planes and 17 UTair Boeing aircraft.
The export controls bar companies around the world from providing any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services to the identified airplanes.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said the message was clear: ""Defy our export controls at your own peril.""
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said the government believes ""Aeroflot, Azur Air and UTair and their fleet of aircraft will over time largely be unable to continue flying either internationally or domestically as they are now cut off from the international support and the U.S. parts and related services they need to maintain and support their fleets.""
The airlines did not immediately respond to request for comments.
""Our export controls are working,"" Graves said, adding U.S. exports to Russia of items subject to new licensing requirements have decreased by 99% by value.
The orders prohibit service for maintenance contracts and the use of any U.S. parts to service identified planes but the Commerce Department could approve safety-critical parts on a case-by-case basis.
The Commerce Department said that after it placed the planes on restrictions in March, Aeroflot continued to fly them to Beijing, Delhi, Antalya and Istanbul, Dubai, and on some domestic Russian flights.
Azur Air continued to fly to Turkey, Dubai and Vietnam as well as some domestic flights in Russia, while UTair flew to Tajikistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan as well as some Russia domestc flights, the Commerce Department said.
Any U.S.-origin aircraft or foreign aircraft that includes more than 25% controlled U.S.-origin content is subject to a license requirement if it is Russian-owned or operated and exported to Russia.

The United States, European Union and other countries have barred Russian planes from U.S. airspace.
Russia’s biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group, said on March 18 it suspended all flights using Boeing aircraft due to Western sanctions. Volga-Dnepr said it stopped operations of two of its subsidiaries - AirBridgeCargo and Atran. S7, Russia’s biggest private airline and second largest overall, also said on March 4 it was ceasing all international flights.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 01:00PM ET</span>",Brazil picks technocrat to lead Petrobras after succession plan mess,"By Gram Slattery and Gabriel Araujo
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - After two messy, drama-filled weeks struggling to fill the top job at state-run oil company Petrobras Brazil's government turned this week to low-profile technocrat José Mauro Coelho, and investors welcomed the move.
Coelho's record indicates he is not keen on sacrificing Petrobras profits to keep fuel prices low for Brazilian drivers, or to accomplish other policy aims. He was picked on Wednesday, and Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, shot up 3% on Thursday morning.
Last week, energy consultant Adriano Pires backed out of the government's nomination to take the helm at Petrobras, shortly after soccer magnate Rodolfo Landim declined a nomination as chairman. Coelho, whose appointment as CEO needs to be confirmed at a shareholders' meeting next week, is a relative unknown compared to those two. 
But Coelho's stance on fuel prices should allay concerns for investors as President Jair Bolsonaro is under pressure to rein in pump prices ahead of a heated October election contest.
Those views line up broadly with high-profile oil and gas consultant Pires, who withdrew his name from consideration after charges arose of conflicts of interest with longtime clients. 
Late last month, Bolsonaro ousted current Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna amid tensions over rising fuel prices. The government approached Landim and Decio Oddone, CEO of oil independent Enauta Participacoes SA, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, though both declined.
Coelho, a long-time researcher at Brazil's state energy think tank, now serves as chairman of Pre-Salt Petroleum (PPSA), a government agency that receives and sells oil handed over by offshore producers as a condition of their operating concessions. For a year and a half ending in 2021, he also served as the secretary of oil, gas and biofuels at Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry.
Coelho and PPSA did not immediately respond to requests for an interview. In an October interview on state television, he defended the current, market-friendly policy of Petrobras pricing its fuel in line with global oil markets, saying this was necessary to avoid fuel shortages. 
""We have to have domestic market prices related to import prices,"" Coelho said at the time. 
In another interview Coelho granted upon receiving an award in mid-2021, he made the case for Petrobras to keep a narrow focus on deepwater oil production, by far the firm's most profitable division.

Analysts and investors were heartened to see the government settle on a no-thrills technocrat. Still, they warned that the risk of political interference remains significant, particularly if crude prices remain high and Brazilian voters feel pain at the pump.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock traded 1% higher Thursday after the company said it is raising pay for drivers, an effort aimed at retaining and attracting more staff to operate its giant trucks.
In-house truck drivers will now be able to earn up to $110,000 in their first year at the company, the company said in a release. At the high end, that’s 26% higher than the previous average pay for newly hired drivers, Bloomberg said.
Drivers who have been with Walmart longer can earn even more, based on factors like tenure and location, it said.
The retailer also touted a private fleet development program to train and help staff become drivers. Employees in Dover, Delaware, and Dallas have earned commercial driver’s licenses over the course of the 12-week program, Walmart said.
Walmart’s latest exercise reflects the anxiety of retailers as they struggle to stock up their stores and deliver supplies to customers while facing a massive shortage of drivers and other staff.
The company, which employs about 12,000 truck drivers, had to hire 7,000 over the last two years, including a record 4,500 in 2021, the spokeswoman said. The U.S. is short by 80,000 drivers, according to the American Trucking Associations."

(Reuters) - Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc announced on Thursday the executive team to lead the soon to be formed Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), leaning heavily on a trusted group of lieutenants, many of whom have worked with its chief executive since his days at NBC. 
The $43 billion merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia is expected to close as soon as Friday. The newly formed company will be led by Discovery CEO David Zaslav.
Discovery’s chief financial officer, Gunnar Wiedenfels, will oversee finance at the new company. Jean-Briac Perrette, Discovery’s chief executive of streaming and international, will be the new president of Warner Bros Discovery Global Streaming and Interactive Entertainment, with responsibility for HBO Max and Discovery+. Bruce Campbell, Discovery’s chief development officer, will assume the role of chief revenue and strategy officer. 
Campbell and Perrette played pivotal roles in launching Hulu, the streaming service started in a joint venture of NBC and the former News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). These senior Discovery executives helped execute its $18 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks in 2018, which added Food Network and HGTV to Discovery’s cable portfolio. 
The future chief executive of Warner Bros Discovery retained three key WarnerMedia creative executives, Casey Bloys, who continues as chief content officer of HBO/HBO Max, Toby Emmerich, chairman of Warner Bros Picture Group, and Channing Dungey, chairman of Warner Bros Television Group. They are expected to report directly to Zaslav, reflecting the executive’s preference for a flat management structure.

""Today's announcement combines a strong team of professional managers in a simpler organizational structure, with fewer layers,"" Zaslav said in a statement.
Nine high-level WarnerMedia senior executives, including Chief Executive Jason Kilar and Studios and Network chief Ann Sarnoff, announced their exits ahead of the formation of the combined company.

(Reuters) - The top lawyer at the agency that enforces U.S. labor laws said on Thursday she will ask the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to prohibit businesses from requiring workers to attend meetings discouraging unionizing, which would eliminate a major tool employers use to counter union campaigns. 
Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel of the NLRB, said in a memo that so-called captive audience meetings discourage employees from exercising their right to refrain from listening to anti-union messages, making them illegal under federal labor law.
“This license to coerce is an anomaly in labor law, inconsistent with the (law's) protection of employees’ free choice,"" wrote Abruzzo, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.
Abruzzo said that in a future case she will ask the five-member NLRB to overturn its own precedent going back to the 1940s that says captive audience meetings are legal. The general counsel acts as a prosecutor, filing complaints against businesses that are then heard by the board. 
The NLRB in past cases has said the meetings are a valid exercise of employers' free-speech rights, but Abruzzo said those decisions failed to balance those rights with the ability of workers to freely choose whether to join unions.
The memo comes amid a spate of high-profile union campaigns involving companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), both of which have reportedly held https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/union-says-amazon-continues-interfere-with-election-alabama-warehouse-2022-02-22 captive audience meetings. Some studies have estimated that more than 90% of employers facing union elections hold mandatory anti-union meetings. 
Amazon and Starbucks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday that employers use captive audience meetings to spread disinformation and intimidate workers.
""The question of whether workers want a union should be the workers' choice – not the employers' – free of intimidation and interference,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Conagra Brands Inc cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as multiple price hikes and resilient demand failed to provide a bulwark against inflationary pressures and costs stemming from supply chain snarls.
Global food companies, stretched since the pandemic outbreak by elevated freight and labor expenses, are now staring at higher costs of corn, wheat, proteins, and edible oils as the Russia-Ukraine conflict fuels a rally in commodities.
The maker of Duncan Hines cake mixes expects gross inflation of about 16% for the year, higher than its previous view of about 14%. 
""We've experienced a lot of inflation, but we've also been aggressive in taking the justified actions to offset it,"" Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said in a call with analysts.
The Slim Jim maker now expects adjusted profit to be about $2.35 per share, compared with the about $2.50 it projected earlier.
""Though the guidance reduction itself wasn't exactly surprising, the degree was a bit more than perhaps anticipated,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Like rivals Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Conagra has increased prices in recent months with little to no push back from consumers and expects benefits from its latest hikes to show in the first quarter of its fiscal 2023 year, which begins this June. The hikes will target Conagra's frozen foods and snacks.
Connolly said Conagra would continue to see a lag between the timing of inflation and the benefits from higher prices even as demand remains strong.
""When the consumer has to get more out of their budget, they evaluate all alternatives,"" Connolly said. ""They see our products are better value."" 

He added that Conagra has not seen consumers swapping out their branded products for cheaper store brands. However, the company's spreads business, which includes Fleischmann's margarines and Smart Balance and Earth Balance products, is sensitive to private label pressures, he said. 
Still, the Act II microwave popcorn owner topped third-quarter revenue estimates and raised its annual core sales forecast, riding on the back of higher prices and sustained demand. Its shares were marginally up in a choppy broader market.

(Reuters) -European shares reversed early gains to skid on Thursday, as risks from a hawkish Federal Reserve and Washington's new sanctions on Russia kept investors on edge, while defensive stocks advanced.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.2%, paring back gains made earlier in the day, after losing 1.5% in their worst session in a month on Wednesday. 
All major regions were in the red, while sectors more resilient to economic downturn outperformed, with healthcare jumping 1.4% to a record high, and construction and chemicals adding 0.3% and 0.4% respectively.
Oil stocks led losses, dipping -1.6%, while tech stocks lost -1.0%.
Shell (LON:RDSa) dropped 2.1% after saying it would write down up to $5 billion in the first quarter as a result of its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed.
European shares fared better than stocks markets in Asia and the United States, which weakened after minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed that officials ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings to fight surging inflation. 
""The risk of stagflation has risen substantially... Despite the hit to economic activity from the war, the strength of inflation will prompt the ECB to begin tightening monetary policy sooner than is currently priced into markets,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.
European Central Bank policymakers appeared keen to unwind stimulus at their March 10 meeting, with some pushing for even more action, accounts of the gathering showed. Markets see around 43 bps worth of rate hikes this year, up from around 30 bps seen before the meeting. [ECBWATCH]
Fanning fears over recession risks in the euro area, a Reuters poll saw euro zone inflation staying high for the remainder of 2022.

659,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 12:07PM ET</span>",French elections: Hedging for Macron's exit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Suddenly confronted with the possibility of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's French presidential elections against incumbent Emmanuel Macron, traders are scrambling to hedge portfolios against the risk of market turmoil. 
A Le Pen victory, while still unlikely, is now within the margins of error before the first voting round on Sunday, opinion polls show. While she no longer advocates ditching the euro, markets are uneasy about her agenda of protectionism, tax cuts and nationalisation.
Berenberg analysts, who now assign a 30% chance to a Le Pen win versus 10% previously, said Le Pen would ""throw sand in the gears of the EU. While she would not be able to roll back European integration, further progress would likely stall."" 
Exit polls from the first polling round will emerge between 1800-2000 GMT. There will be a televised debate on April 20 and a second round on April 24.
This is how various assets could react and how traders are hedging against downsides. 
EURO PAINS
A Le Pen win in the first round could send the euro, currently around $1.09, down to $1.05, but if she won the presidency and also the June legislative elections, the euro could fall below parity to the dollar, Nomura analysts warned. 
They said demand for FX hedges was adding to pressure.
Derivative markets show that risk reversals -- or the ratio of puts to calls -- over the one-week period covering the first election round have flipped firmly in favour of puts or option contracts expecting more euro weakness.
Refinitiv data shows investors have bought put options on euro/dollar between $1.07-$1.08 levels in recent days and one trader said it is now 10% costlier than last week to buy a euro put against the dollar at $1.08.
Nomura recommends buying put spreads expiring in a month's time as that covers both polling dates.
Euro implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings, has also pushed higher than broader FX gauges. One-week euro/dollar implied volatility is at a three-week high.
""The rise in the French election risk premium could weigh on the euro until the second round on 24 April,"" said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier in Geneva. 
EATING YOUR OATs
In bond markets, the spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds -- essentially the risk premium on French debt -- has risen to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the 2020 market crash.
Spreads are well below levels seen at the height of the ""Frexit"" worries of 2017, but banks say clients have become more averse to French risk. 
Mizuho rates strategist Peter McCallum noted spillover shorting activity rippling over from French bond futures into Italy. Many investors hedge bond exposure in the more liquid futures market.
Italian bonds actually underperformed French bonds during this week's selloff, widening the spread between the two markets. 
Open interest has risen while prices on both French and Italian bond futures have fallen. That is indicative of a build-up of short positions, said UBS strategist Rohan Khanna. 
""I think there is appreciation of the fact that a Le Pen victory is an EU-level question,"" Khanna said. 
Italian bonds ""become your principal instrument to short given all the fragilities in the Italian system."" 
NATIONALISATION TARGETS FOR SALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) estimates a Le Pen win carries a maximum drawdown risk of 8% on French stocks. But they saw small- and mid-cap firms at greater risk than the internationally exposed CAC 40 Paris benchmark. 
Broader European banks and Italian stocks, highly sensitive to EU integration, would also face extra downside, they added.

However, traders reported little equity hedging activity. The choice, instead, appears to be to sell bank stocks and holders of motorway concessions like Eiffage and Vinci, which may be targeted for nationalisation by Le Pen. 
A chill has fallen over French dealmaking activity, according to one trader, who said, ""none of my contacts has mentioned anything for weeks.""

Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz are expected to speak at the event.
According to FOX Business, Tesla has even secured a permit for a fireworks display, conditional on the weather.
Although this party is being held as a launch party, the $1.1 billion factory has begun producing Tesla Model Ys for delivery. The plant is designed to make about 500,000 cars in its initial configuration. Tesla likely will expand the plant in the future and add battery-making capacity on site.
It will take time to ramp up capacity at the new plant. Analysts estimated the plant might produce 100,000 vehicles in 2022. Full production rates should be reached in about a year. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter calculated that Tesla's most productive plant in Shanghai can produce roughly 3,400 vehicles a day. That's about 1.2 million vehicles a year. However, car plants typically can't run full out all year. For example, the Giga Shanghai factory was shut down in late March due to covid restrictions and has yet to reopen.
Tesla bull Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research called the event a ""very strong catalyst"" for the stock. He even said a production schedule update for the Cyber Truck and Tesla Semi is ""very likely.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp set up a special committee on Thursday to resume a strategic review that could see the Japanese industrial conglomerate go private after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan last month.
The 146-year-old company has been under growing pressure from major shareholders to consider a private equity buyout that would allow them a quick exit with potentially solid returns.
The new committee, comprised of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s six external directors, will engage with potential investors and sponsors and also ""identify the privatisation offer that is best for our diverse stakeholders,"" Toshiba said in a statement.
Relevant information about the review will be provided prior to the annual general meeting in June, according to the statement.
The company also said it would temporarily suspend divestitures that were part of the now rejected plan, including sales of its elevator and lighting businesses, as well as its discussions with Toshiba Tec Corp about the fate of the listed subsidiary.
During a five-month review leading to the restructuring plan last year, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers, angering some hedge fund investors hoping for a private equity buyout.

Its top shareholder, Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, said last week that it had agreed to sell its 9.9% stake to Bain Capital if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer.
But sources close to the company have told Reuters that taking Toshiba private would not be an easy task, as the company owns national security technologies such as nuclear power and semiconductors.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) stock traded 2% higher Thursday after the company raised its annual forecast for organic net sales despite cost pressures.
The company now expects core net sales for the year to grow by more than 4% compared to its previous forecast of over 3%.
Growing economies and strained supply chains have all combined to push transportation costs higher. Prices of ingredients such as corn, wheat, proteins, and edible oils have touched record highs. Companies have hiked prices to pass on cost pressures and met with mixed success.
Because of the lag in the implementation of the price hikes, the company does not expect to fully offset the cost pressures in the current financial year. With inflationary expectations now pegged higher, it expects adjusted operating margins to take a hit of 1 percentage point to be around 14.5%.
Adjusted profit per share should come in at around $2.35, lower than the previous forecast of $2.5, according to the company’s new forecast.
Challenges notwithstanding, the company grew its net revenue by over 5% to $2.91 billion in the third quarter ended February 27. Margins eroded.
Adjusted profit per share fell 1.7% to 58 cents but was higher than estimates."

It’s already playing out. CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) Inc., which was named among potential takeover targets in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 event-driven trading desks, fund managers and analysts, was acquired Thursday morning. Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) Inc. also was popular software name on the list. 
Kohl’s Corp. was named by survey participants as the most likely company to complete a deal over the next three months. The retailer is already working with potential bidders amid a push by activist investors to explore strategic options.
The mergers and acquisition market in the U.S. is off to a decent start this year against the uncertain backdrop of rising rates, soaring inflation and the war in Ukraine. The total value of pending and completed deals announced in the first three months of 2022 reached $414 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That’s the best first quarter performance in the past five years, though the pace will have to quicken considerably for the rest of the year to approach 2021’s record run. 
“There are many opportunistic dealmakers and activists pushing companies to explore a sale or bidding for the companies themselves,” said Tyler Silver, a partner at New York-based investment firm Apex Capital. “Acquisitive big tech and private equity firms with loads of cash will help. Some PEs just have an unlimited appetite for deals.”
Software Sweet Spot 
Small to mid-sized software companies are in the sweet spot for consolidation, according to the survey respondents. Merger investors are optimistic that cash-rich strategic and financial buyers will want to take advantage of cheaper valuations caused by the recent tech selloff. The S&P 500 Software Industry index is down more than 10% this year compared with a 5% decline in the S&P 500 Index and a 9% drop in the Nasdaq 100 Index.
Seven out of 20 survey respondents saw a takeover of Zendesk as likely after the company scrapped its acquisition of Momentive Global Inc. and a group of private equity firms was said to line up loan for a refreshed buyout offer. The issue will be price since Zendesk already rejected a bid between $127 and $132 because it was too low. Zendesk closed at $122.58 on Wednesday, down from its February 2021 record high of $158. In addition, two people surveyed said they expect Momentive to also return to the M&A spotlight.
CDK Global was the third most mentioned company in the poll, which was conducted from March 28 to April 1. On Thursday, Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU) announced a $6.4 billion all-cash deal to acquire the auto dealer software provider. Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) Inc., which in September scrapped its planned sale to  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc., also appeared on the list.
Representatives for Kohl’s, Zendesk, CDX Global and Momentive did not respond to requests for comment.
In addition, Wall street analysts flagged a list of software names to watch after PE firm Thoma Bravo in March announced plans to buy cloud-based software maker  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) Inc. for $10.7 billion. Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein touted battered stocks like Datto Holding Corp. and Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) Corp., while Bloomberg intelligence’s Anurag Rana pointed to C3.ai Inc. and  Elastic  (NYSE:ESTC) NV among the potential targets with cratering valuations.
“The tech, and software in particular, space should continue to be a favorite given the need for increased productivity and cost cutting in the context of supply chain issues, among other things,” said Frederic Boucher, a risk-arbitrage analyst at Susquehanna International Group. He added that private equity firms still have plenty of dry powder at their disposal.
To be sure, whether financial buyers pick up the dealmaking pace also depends on the debt markets. Their choppy performance this year has stirred fears about potentially cooling private equity buyouts.
Meanwhile, big tech players with strong balance sheets remain another source of transactions. However, they might grow cautious with any deals that could get caught in the crosshairs of antitrust regulators, survey respondents said. 
M&A desks in U.S. are closely watching the evolving regulatory environment, which has been a constant concern. At the moment, their eyes are on UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH).’s pending acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG) Inc. The pair just extended their agreement as they wait to litigate the Department of Justice’s suit to block their merger plan.

To Aaron Glick, a merger-arb specialist at Cowen & Co., this is an important demonstration of how willing some buyers are to defend their acquisitions in court.
“Companies that entered into deals this year went in eyes-wide-open knowing that the odds of litigation were higher than they had been in prior administrations,” said “Still, each situation is unique.”

Investing.com -- Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) stock is trading 26% lower Thursday after Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill downgraded the stock to Sell from Hold, slashing its price target to $1 from $16.
The downgrade comes ahead of the company's fourth-quarter results, which are due April 14. 
The analyst said Covid has ""hastened the decline"" of the company's retail pharmacy segment, and he sees a potentially ""dramatic negative inflection point"" for the stock. 
Hill added that the company's preliminary fiscal 2023 outlook ""seems to be unattainable.""
The key focus for investors will be Rite Aid's guidance for 2023, with the company previously stating it could generate over $430 million in EBITDA. 
However, he states that if the number comes in ""below $400mm, the equity arguably has no value as the company is not in a position to generate real returns to shareholders."""

It thus became the first major automotive company to produce an all-electric vehicle in Turkey in large volume, with the E-Transit model to be sold in Europe and produced at the company's plant in Kocaeli, northwest Turkey.
Ford Otosan, jointly owned by the U.S. automaker and Turkey's largest conglomerate Koc Holding, will raise the factory's annual vehicle capacity to 650,000 from 455,000 under the 2 billion euro investment announced in 2020.
An assembly line will be established for the production of at least 130,000 batteries in the factory. 

Ford officials said more than 5,000 orders have been received for the fully electric vehicle, which is now being sold in Europe. Sales of the vehicle in the domestic market will also begin this year.

The outlay is part of a wider 8.7 billion euro long term plan that Italy announced earlier this year to support its carmaking industry. This allocates 700 million euros in 2022 and 1 billion euros per year from 2023 until 2030.
The wait for incentives, which Rome had announced earlier this year, weighed on car sales in the first months of 2022, with analysts and lobby groups saying buyers were postponing purchases while waiting for the government to implement them.
New car registrations in Italy fell around 23% in February and 30% in March from the year earlier periods.
Rome will subsidise up to 5,000 euros of the purchase price of new electric vehicles costing up to 35,000 euros excluding VAT. 
That includes a 2,000 euro contribution linked to the scrappage of a polluting combustion-engine car, the decree showed.
The purchase of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles costing up to 45,000 euros will be subsidised by up to 4,000 euros, while the plan also includes an incentive of 2,000 euros for state-of-the art combustion-engine (Euro6) cars costing up to 35,000 euros when older vehicles are scrapped.

Funds are also available for incentives to buy new motorcycles and for small- and medium-sized business to buy fully electric vans, according to the decree.

(Reuters) -Citigroup has started to allow holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies to cancel them, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Citi's move follows steps taken by banks such as BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase in the last two weeks. 
After cancelling a depositary receipt, which are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange, clients receive the underlying share in the Russian company.
This is the first step investors must take to liquidate their frozen holdings. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) halted trading in the depositary receipts of Russian companies roughly a month ago after prices plunged due to a slew of Western sanctions slapped on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Still, due to sanctions imposed by Russia, foreign investors are not allowed to sell their shares.
On Wednesday, Russia's lower house of parliament has passed a bill on delisting depositary receipts in Russian companies traded on foreign bourses.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) stock traded 3.7% lower Thursday on fears of write-offs owing to the company’s exposure to Russia.
Worries over rising raw material costs, a factor the company countered with price hikes in the first quarter, are also adding to the losses.
The maker of the iconic denim jeans said in a filing it would review assets specific to Russian commercial business for impairment in the second quarter, according to Reuters.
The company last month suspended operations in Russia, including new investments, following the country's invasion of Ukraine.
Levi’s first-quarter sales and profit topped estimates, driven by strong demand for its jeans, tops and jackets, and price hikes.
Cost pressures notwithstanding, the company improved its gross margins. It attributed this to selling more to consumers directly, lower promotional expenses, lower share of discounted sales and price increases.
The company recorded double-digit sales in every market, led by Americas, Europe and Asia in that order.
""We're not seeing any real pushback on pricing at all at this point,"" Reuters quoted CEO Charles Bergh as telling analysts in the earnings call, adding that there was room for stronger pricing in the second half of the year.
First-quarter revenue rose about 22% to $1.59 billion. Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh said supply chain-related issues cut revenue opportunities by about $60 million, or 5%, primarily in the U.S.
Adjusted profit per share for the quarter ended February 27 was 12 cents higher at 46 cents.

MADRID (Reuters) - Banks and supervisors are concerned about implementing sanctions against Russian oligarchs as they vary in scope and in who they target across different jurisdictions, Bank of Spain Director General for Supervision Mercedes Olano said on Thursday.
""For internationally active banks it's a puzzle because sanctions are not the same in Europe as in the U.S. or in Britain or Japan,"" she said, adding that talks were being held to clarify how financial institutions should act. 
""Which sanctions do the banks have to comply with, the European ones, the American ones, all together, separately?"" Olano asked herself during a press briefing.
Targets of wide-ranging Western sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have already included banks, oligarchs and investment. On Thursday, Ukraine renewed a call for financial sanctions crippling enough to force Moscow to end what it refers to as its ""special operation"" in the country. 
Olano said lenders, banks and market supervisors were trying to determine which sanctions should be applied, and how. 
""In broad terms, we all know what to do, but then when you have to actually include it into your (daily) operations, to set up systems (...) so that you are warned if you are not complying with a sanction, that's complex,"" Olano said.
It was not a question of whether sanctions were being implemented in time but rather a question of ""how difficult it was to make sanctions compatible,"" she added.
Last week, the European Central Bank said euro zone banks' direct exposure to Russia was relatively minor but sanctions could still reverberate through the financial system through volatility in energy and commodity prices.

Spanish banks in general rank among those less exposed to Russian credit, with Spain's central bank estimating their credit risk at just above 700 million euros.
Olano said that meant they should be less affected by the implementation of sanctions.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, as an unexpectedly sharp drop in jobless claims and more hawkish rhetoric from Federal Reserve officials kept the fear of tighter money at the front of the market's mind. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 84 points, or 0.2% at 34,413 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1%, however, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. That still represents only a modest bounce after two days of heavy losses as the market adjusted to signals from the Fed that interest rates will have to rise faster than previously expected in order to bring inflation down. 
One of the main reasons for that is the tightness of the labor market, which was underlined again in data released earlier by the Labor Department. Initial jobless claims fell to 166,000, while previous weeks' data were also revised down to reflect changes to the process of seasonal adjustment by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Layoffs are now running at their lowest in over 50 years, while vacancies are close to record highs and the unemployment rate is down to a paltry 3.6%.
Elsewhere, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who has been the most outspoken and earliest advocate for tightening monetary policy at the Fed, said the central bank is still well ""behind the curve"" in fighting inflation, and indicated that the fed funds rate may need to rise to around 3.5% or more to bring inflation down. That's the latest in a series of warning from Fed officials in the latest week that have prepared the market for bigger rate hikes and a faster balance sheet reduction than its top leadership had wanted last year. 
HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock was the biggest mover in early dealings, soaring 16% after Warren Buffett put a $4.2 billion bet on the maker of laptops and other electronics hardware. The deal is the third big one in quick succession for Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb), and suggests that the world's most famous 'value investor' is no longer as concerned about U.S. stocks being overvalued.
Elsewhere, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) stock fell 4.3% despite the maker of denim wear reporting better-than-expected quarterly numbers and upholding its previous guidance for sales growth of around 12% this year. Citigroup analysts cut their target price on the stock to $27 in a note released to clients earlier, but the stock still trades nearly 33% below that. 
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs fell 3.6% after the Chinese e-commerce giant said its founder and CEO Richard Liu has stepped down with immediate effect. He's been succeeded by Lei Xu, a long-term executive at the company who has most recently served as its president.
The social media space remained buzzy, even two days after Elon Musk's acquisition of a 9.2% stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Reports suggested that Facebook owner Meta Platforms is working on a Plan B for digital assets after the failure of its Diem stablecoin project. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock eked out a gain of 0.3%, but it remains the most pressured of the tech megacaps, against a backdrop of tightening regulation and a likely slowdown in ad spending as inflation bites into consumer spending power. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock, a more established play on the prospects for monetizing the so-called Metaverse, fell 1.1% despite  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts rating it as a buy after its recent selloff.

The move will provide Pfizer with access to experimental therapies developed to combat the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus that infects the respiratory tract and leads to symptoms similar to a normal cold.
ReViral is developing four RSV therapies, two of which are currently in mid-stage studies, including its flagship therapy candidate sisunatovir.
This is the second buyout deal for Pfizer in less than six months after the U.S. biopharmaceutical giant acquired Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion in December.
The RSV prevention market is expected to grow by 14x to $6.3 billion in the period between 2020 and 2030, according to GlobalData, urging global drugmakers to capitalize on the opportunities in this market.
BMO analyst Evan Seigerman said that he would have liked to see something more impactful for Pfizer's nearer-term P&L. Still, he added that the ReViral acquisition doesn't prevent Pfizer from doing a bigger M&A.
With a potential of $1.5B in peak sales from these treatment assets (64M infections annually, 160k deaths globally), the company must continue with BD to expand the pipeline. We're interested in assets such as Trikafta/CF, Tepezza/Krystexxa, Vyvgart, assets in targeted oncology (adagrasib), neuroscience (Nurtec's US rights), and dermatology (e.g., Opzelura), the analyst said in a client note.
Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas commented:

""Management also said on the 4Q21 call that to achieve the upper part of the ˜15-17% revenue growth guidance range for '22, the macro backdrop would need to improve. But that was before inflation worsened and the Russia/Ukraine war broke out.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. consumer watchdog plans to ramp up enforcement actions against lenders that illegally charge credit card late-payment fees and may rewrite its rules that set thresholds for such fees, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The development marks an escalation of a broader crackdown by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on what it calls ""junk fees,"" a catch-all for overdraft, credit card late-payment fees, bounced check fees, and other charges. 
Banks and credit unions pulled in more than $15 billion in overdraft and related fees in 2019 and $12 billion in late credit card fees in 2020, according to CFPB estimates. 
The agency's director, Rohit Chopra, says lenders have become too reliant on such fees. He has also said the fees appear to be excessive, not transparent to consumers, and in many cases act as penalties rather than compensation for a legitimate service.
In January, the CFPB issued a request for public input on how banks and companies charge such fees and the impact they have on American families, the deadline for which is April 11. The agency has not yet said how it plans to proceed.
One of the sources said the agency would review the comments, but it would be taking a tougher line on enforcement with respect to such fees and expected to rewrite some rules.
Card issuers generally charge a late-payment fee when a customer misses their minimum payment deadline. The current rules contain a legal safe harbor which allows lenders to charge late fees provided they do not exceed a ""reasonable and proportional"" regulatory cap which is set annually by the CFPB.
The agency is considering rewriting the rules on how it calculates that threshold, according to the two sources. 
The CFPB is also exploring how it can bring more enforcement actions for potentially illegal fees under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which protects consumers from unfair practices by credit card issuers, the sources added.
""Every year, junk fees hit millions of Americans with expenses they do not expect and did not consider when choosing their financial institution,"" Brian Shearer, a CFPB senior adviser, told Reuters in a statement, without commenting on the agency's plans. 
INDUSTRY DEFENSE
The banking industry has launched a united defense against Chopra's ""junk fees"" scrutiny, saying most lenders are not overly reliant on fee revenue and that the CFPB is wrong to suggest lenders hide the fees or that the fees show banks are not offering competitive services. 
The Consumer Bankers Association (CBA) and the American Bankers Association, among other groups, are preparing comment letters highlighting the slew of existing rules requiring banks disclose such fees, according to two other industry executives.
Creating those rules required the government to perform extensive focus-group testing, an expensive process that the CFPB has not proven is worth repeating, they argue. They add that overdrafts and other lending products are critical services for most Americans. 
""America's leading banks have always listened to their customers and are taking proactive steps to help them avoid unintended fees while protecting their access to a much-needed emergency safety net,"" said Richard Hunt, the CBA's chief executive.
Several big banks have recently changed their policies on overdraft and nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees - penalties charged when a customer bounces a check or automated payment. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which declined to comment for this story, have said they would stop charging NSF fees and have changed their policies on charging overdraft fees.

The industry says those changes show banks are trying to compete on such fees. 
""Recent announcements on overdraft fees by some of the largest banks show that real change is possible, and we are going to keep pressing to increase competition and save Americans money,"" said the CFPB's Shearer.

The Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce giant initially targeted an IPO valuation of $50 billion and planned to pursue its listing in 2022. However, the company has reportedly delayed the IPO for 2023 as it wants to further increase its valuations by focusing on its two new units - online healthcare and travel bookings, as per the report.
Furthermore, Flipkart's IPO plans have also been affected by the current market uncertainty as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Last year, the e-commerce company purchased an Indian travel booking platform Cleartrip and introduced its Health+ app this week to provide medicines, but also healthcare-related products and services.
In December, analysts asked Walmart CFO Brett Biggs about Flipkart's timeline, to which he replied that the company was performing almost exactly like we thought, adding the initial public offering is still very much in the cards.
Biggs did not provide a clear timeline for the IPO, though the reports now say that the company is eyeing the early-to-mid period in 2023.
Brick-and-mortar retail companies in India have been raising concerns over the past years that Flipkart and Amazon have been evading federal regulations, encouraging Walmart to pursue IPO plans for Flipkart.

Under the agreement, which requires a judge's approval, the payment will be made to settle claims brought on behalf of those who bought the company's shares between March 28, 2013 and Sept. 20, 2013.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the company was planning to settle the lawsuit to avoid trial in the United States.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court granted a request from the company's lawyers and shareholders to adjourn their planned trial to negotiate a preliminary settlement.
Shareholders accused the company of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.
Lawsuits accusing companies of misleading shareholders are common in the United States, but few go to trial.

While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, it never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones, which led to BlackBerry's decision to stop making phones in 2016.

UBS analyst Michael Lasser is also positive on COST and sees more upside for shares.
""We think Costco is taking the right steps to remain relevant in a post-pandemic world. Plus, heightened pressure on the consumer could drive another leg of growth in both membership and retail spending. We don't think the co's shares fully reflect these tailwinds,"" Lasser wrote.
Cost stock price closed at $584.79 yesterday.

Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee has lowered earnings estimates for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with the lowered revenue growth projection for iPhone (led by iPhone SE) and Services.
The analyst notes that the overall reduction in earnings estimates is fairly modest and brings J.P. Morgan mostly in line with the consensus for FY2022. Chatterjee cut the street-high iPhone volume outlook for CY22 to 245 million from 250 million. This is mostly led by the reduction in estimates for iPhone SE3, from 30 million to 24 million.
Our estimates for iPhone 13 remain largely intact as we expect the combination of recent color variant launches, as well as a higher than typical inventory level in the channel against the backdrop of existing supply chain constraints to provide offsets to lower customer spending, Chatterjee said in a client note.
Chatterjee's actions come after the bank removed Apple from its Analyst Focus List amid a more cautious view on the consumer spending outlook, led by lowered growth forecasts for the smartphone market.
We remain above consensus expectations for FY23 and FY24, led by our forecasts for better than expected growth in Products as well as margin and earnings trajectory on the back of robust growth in Services. Our positive view on the shares, long term, leads us to maintain our Overweight rating, Chatterjee added.
The analyst notes a slowing services momentum against tough comparables.
Gross app store revenue, new downloads, as well as gaming revenue, worsened in relation to y/y growth trends in C1Q22, which while partly on account of tough comparables is also the first q/q sequential moderation in gross revenue since C4Q19. We expect the slower engagement on the App Store to limit Services revenue growth in the +15%-20% y/y range in FY22 and thus we lower our estimates on our expectations for more modest sequential growth in Service revenues through the fiscal year.
Still, J.P. Morgan remains bullish on Apple as the company is well-positioned to deliver resilient performance in product revenue growth, led by share gains of hardware products."

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – ADRs of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) traded 2% lower in premarket Thursday after the company said its founder Richard Liu has stepped down as chief executive officer.
Xu Lei, who was recently promoted to president after more than a decade, takes the helm at China’s second largest online marketplace immediately.
Liu’s lieutenant joins JD’s six-member board while Liu remains chairman, the company said in a filing Thursday. Liu has a nearly 14% stake in the retailer, according to Reuters.
JD.com had a market cap of over $90 billion at close Wednesday. The stock is down over 29% in the last year, still escaping the burn at most Chinese shares.
While most Chinese tech and online firms have been hit by the sweeping campaign to rein in Big Tech in the mainland, the company has benefited by complying with the new rules. It has added new or seen the return of brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) to its platform.
Liu will continue devoting his time to guiding the company’s long-term strategies while mentoring younger management, JD said in its statement.

(Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta has removed hacking campaigns, influence networks and scam operations amid the war in Ukraine, according to a report released on Thursday by the social media company, which also said it was reviewing additional steps to address misinformation from Russian government pages.
""We're constantly reviewing our policies based on the evolving situation on the ground and we are actively now reviewing additional steps to address misinformation and hoaxes coming from Russian government pages,"" said Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, on a call with reporters.
Russia has battled big tech companies to control online information flows after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" It has banned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram, and throttled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by slowing its service. Twitter said this week it will not amplify or recommend Russian government accounts to users.
In its first quarterly adversarial threat report, Meta said government-linked actors from Russia and Belarus had engaged in cyber espionage and covert online influence operations, including an influence operation linked to the Belarusian KGB. 
It said there had been other continued attempts from networks it had previously disrupted, including further efforts by the threat actor Ghostwriter to hack the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukraine military members. 
Meta said in the report it had also removed a network of about 200 accounts operated from Russia that coordinated to falsely report people, mostly in Ukraine and Russia, for violations like hate speech or bullying. 
The mass reporting was primarily coordinated in a cooking-themed Facebook Group which had about 50 members when Meta took it down in March. 

Meta said it had also removed tens of thousands of accounts, pages and groups trying to use the war in Ukraine to scam users and make money by driving people to ad-filled websites or selling them merchandise. It said spammers around the world had used tactics such as streaming live-gaming videos or reposting popular content including other people's videos from Ukraine to pretend they were sharing live updates from the crisis. 
Meta detailed other takedowns including the removal of two cyberespionage operations from Iran, an influence campaign in Brazil that posed as environmental activists defending deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and a network in the Philippines that claimed credit for bringing down and defacing news websites.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The likely huge insurance claims related to the cancellation of aircraft leases in Russia is already leading to ""horrendous"" hikes in the cost of renewing policies, the chief executive of major lessor BOC Aviation Ltd said on Thursday.
Over 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion remained in Russia after a March 28 deadline to cancel the contracts in line with Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, leaving lessors facing heavy potential writedowns or a long insurance battle.
In a trading update on Thursday, BOC said the net book value of the 17 owned aircraft it was in the process of recovering from Russia - net of all cash collateral held in respect of the aircraft - was $589 million or 2.5% of its total assets.
All letters of credit held in respect of the aircraft had been successfully drawn, it added.
""Because there are going to be huge claims on these insurances this year for confiscation or theft if the aircraft aren't given back, this will then have a knock on effect on insurance costs,"" Robert Martin told an aviation conference.
""This is one of the unforeseen circumstances that is going to hit us later this year and I'm hearing some horrendous numbers for some of the near term renewals due at the end of March. We fortunately don't go until January next year.""
The world's top aircraft lessor AerCap said last week that it had submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets stuck in Russia, the largest exposure in the sector.
BOC's Martin said the consequences of the battle ahead may force the aviation business to completely rethink how it does insurance and that having too much concentrated on one single market is not healthy.
Martin said BOC had taken out ""some"" aircraft it manages from Russia. The Singapore-based lessor said on Thursday that one managed aircraft remains in Russia as well as the 17 it owns.

""We will continue to gradually take the other aircraft out. The only way is by negotiation, there is no magic wand, and I feel sorry for our Russian customers, they've been put in this situation not because of something they've done,"" Martin said.
""Whatever doesn't get resolved will end up in an insurance claim.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) chief Luca de Meo wants to press ahead with plans to create separate divisions for electric (EV) and combustion engine vehicles despite potentially costly uncertainty over its interests in Russia, three sources told Reuters.
Playing catch-up with rivals like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the French automaker first outlined its strategy shift in February, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying its turnaround plan was ahead of schedule. 
An internal assessment on progress will be made in three months, two of the sources said. The Renault group's top selling EVs are the Dacia Spring and the Renault Zoe - long a market leader but becoming an ageing model.
""Despite the Russian x-factor, Luca de Meo wants to move quickly on the creation of the two entities,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
Several working groups are actively working on the creation of two separate legal structures, codenamed ""Ampere"" for the electric and ""Horse"" for the thermal and hybrid assets, two of the three sources said.
Renault declined to comment. 
The war in Ukraine has resulted in Western powers imposing extensive sanctions against Russia, leaving Renault, majority owner of Russia's biggest carmaker Avtovaz, faced with what de Meo has called a ""very complex situation.""
POTENTIAL COSTS 
Renault in late March said it would cut its forecast for operating profit and cash flow and is considering a 2.3 billion euro ($2.4 billion) non-cash writedown to reflect the potential costs of suspending operations in Russia. 
According to the three sources, Renault plans to make progress on the split between electric and conventional engines within the next three months. An internal assessment of the progress made is due in July, two of the sources said. 
Talks with unions should start by the summer, the third source said. 
The growing preference among investment managers for companies focused on low-carbon technology has helped Tesla become the world's highest-valued automaker, and led some investors and analysts to urge other carmakers to consider separating their combustion and electric businesses.
One of the sources said Renault is still pursuing a previously announced plan under which a ""pure electric entity"" could be based in France, while a separate one for combustion engine and hybrids could be based abroad and open to partnerships. 

Several media outlets reported this week that management had told analysts that all options were open regarding the envisaged split, including a stock market listing of the electrical part.
Shares in Renault, which plans a capital markets day of briefings for analysts and investors in the autumn, have lost around 30% of their value since the start of the war.

Shares in Atlantia, which has a market capitalization of over 16 billion euros ($17.5 billion), surged 10% on Thursday as the company finds itself caught in a potential bidding war also involving the Benetton family and Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid soccer club.
Here's what you need to know on the company:
WHO ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS?
Benetton's holding Edizione owns 33% of Atlantia's shares.
Its control is equally divided among four holding companies, each relating to one of the four Benetton siblings who founded the family's economic empire.
New governance rules approved in January envisaged a lock-up period of five years and mechanisms, including pre-emption rights, to ensure that control of Edizione remains in the hands of the Benettons through the generational transition.
GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, has a 8% stake in Atlantia, Italy's market watchdog figures show.
Italian banking foundation CRT has a 4.5% stake in Atlantia, and is among the long-time investors in the group.
WHAT ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN BUSINESSES?
Atlantia runs five airports and nearly 10,000 kilometers of motorway around the world, the group's figures show https://www.atlantia.com/en/about-us/the-group. 
The holding company owns a controlling stake in the Nice airfield and nearly 100% of Rome's two airports. 
Atlantia also owns 50% plus one share of the equity of Abertis, the first national operator of toll roads in countries such as Spain, Chile and Brazil. Perez's ACS is a co-investor in Abertis.
Atlantia also owns 51% in digital toll payment company Telepass and 15% of Eurotunnel operator Getlink .
In June, Atlantia signed an agreement to sell its controlling stake in the Italian unit Autostrade per l'Italia (Italian motorways) to a consortium which includes state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and investment funds Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Macquarie.
The deal is worth more than 8 billion euros and Atlantia expects to pocket the cash by May.
LATEST FINANCIAL DATA
On March 11, Atlantia reported a 4 billion euro EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and proposed a dividend of 0.74 euros per share. In 2021 the overall motorway traffic was up 21%, the company said in the last annual report.

WHICH ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN 2024 TARGETS?
In the last financial report, the company saw core profit reaching 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) by 2024, matching the figure it plans to invest over the same period. The conglomerate also expected revenues to rise to 7.7 billion euros by 2024. ($1 = 0.9191 euros)

(NASDAQ:SOFI) are down roughly 5% in premarket trading Thursday after the company lowered its full-year net revenue guidance and announced board resignations.
For the full fiscal year, SoFi expects adjusted net revenue of $1.47 billion, compared to its previous guidance of $1.57 billion and consensus estimates of $1.53 billion. The personal finance company expects FY adjusted EBITDA of $100 million, down from the previous forecast of $180 million and missing the analyst expectations of $176.8 million.
SoFi expects Q1 adjusted net revenue in the range of $280 million to $285 million, short of the consensus projection of $287.8 million. It expects adjusted EBITDA from $0 to $5 million in the first quarter, compared to analysts expectations of $2.79 million.
The guidance cut comes after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration ordered the extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium from May 1 until August 31.
Separately, the fintech company announced that three members of its Board of Directors will be stepping down, including Clay Wilkes (the Founder of Galileo Financial Technologies), as well as SoftBank's Michel Combes and Carlos Medeiros.
Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev cut the price target to $14.00 per share (from $17.00) on Buy-rated SoFi stock following changes to the guidance and a less hospitable environment for FinTech multiples in general.
""The specter of an extension has been weighing on the stock for weeks. Many investors believe the guide-down includes additional weak spots; however, our analysis shows the drag on the P&L is only due to extending the moratorium. We see no incremental weakness. With the three board members stepping down, including Galileo's founder, we see this as more of an optics issue than an indication of a problem.. Our long-term views of SOFI remain unchanged. Buy,"" Dolev said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck is more cautious than Dolev as she pays special attention to boardroom changes. Graseck also lowered estimates to in-line with the new guidance.
""SoftBank is the top shareholder of SOFI. This announcement is likely to act as an additional overhang on the stock in the near-term,"" Graseck said in a client note.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stock surged 13% in premarket trading Thursday on disclosures that Warren Buffett has taken a roughly 11.4% stake in the maker of laptops, printers and other peripherals.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed on Wednesday that it has purchased nearly 121 million of HP’s 1.05-billion share base. The holding is valued at about $4.2 billion based on the personal computing company's closing stock price on Wednesday of $34.91.
The HP stake is Berkshire's third big investment since February 26, when Buffett said in his annual shareholders letter that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and little ""excites us"" in equity markets. He recently said that American stocks were overvalued.
On March 21, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion in cash. Earlier in the same month, Berkshire revealed a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), spending over $6 billion for its stake in the energy firm.
Buffett has mostly shied from investing in technology companies even though his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investment has been one of his “Big Four” companies, others being Berkshire's insurers, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Generali is locked in a battle with rebel investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who wants to shake up Europe's third-largest insurer and has proposed an alternative board and CEO.
Generali's top shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) backs the insurer.
Shareholders vote on the make-up of the board at an annual general meeting on April 29.
""I am in favour of the current management team,"" Union Investment's Reiner Kloecker told Reuters by phone, adding that the existing team ""has done a good job over the last years. It has replenished the balance sheet after the last financial crisis, it has reduced the debt ratio, it has over-delivered on the three-year business plan and nicely increased the dividend"".
Union Investment is the number 16 investor in Generali, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The battle may be tight, Kloecker said. 
With a stake of more than 9%, Caltagirone is the second-biggest investor in Generali, behind Mediobanca, which owns just under 13%.
The challenger plan forecasts earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, of more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period, compared with a 6-8% target under the strategy Donnet presented in December.
The rebel camp has been building up its stake, pushing shares in Generali, which has a market capitalisation of 32 billion euros ($34.84 billion), to a 13-year high of 21.55 euros.
The share price could be at risk after the AGM, Kloecker said.
""If the Caltagirone pack wins, then Generali is likely forced to do much more M&A, which is bad for shareholders,"" he said.
""If Mediobanca wins the vote, then we have the risk (of) some stakes being unwound.""

Caltagirone could mount a legal challenge if he loses by a narrow margin, a candidate for the chairman's role told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, more than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company said on Thursday.
The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. 
Shell, whose market capitalisation is around $210 billion, had previously said the Russia writedowns would reach around $3.4 billion. The increase was due to additional potential impacts around contracts, writedowns of receivables, and credit losses in Russia, a Shell spokesperson said.
Shell shares were down 1.2% at the start of London trading.
The start of 2022 marked one of the most turbulent periods in decades for the oil and gas industry as Western companies including Shell rapidly pulled out of Russia, severing trading ties and winding down joint ventures following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shell said it will exit all its Russian operations, including a major liquefied natural gas plant in the Sakhalin peninsula in the eastern flank of the country.
Shell did not provide any guidance on the future of its stakes in Russian projects.
Benchmark oil prices soared to an average of more than $100 a barrel in the quarter, their highest since 2014, while European gas prices hit a record high.
The unprecedented volatility in commodity prices in recent months has pushed several traders to the brink as they scrambled to sharply increase downpayments for oil and LNG cargoes.
Shell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, said earnings from LNG trading were expected to be higher in the quarter compared with the previous three months. Earnings from oil trading are set to be ""significantly higher"" in the quarter.

Cashflow in the quarter would be negatively impacted by ""very significant"" outflows of around $7 billion as a result of changes in the value of oil and gas inventories.
Shell's fuel sales averaged 4.3 million barrels per day in the quarter, down from 4.45 million bpd in the previous quarter, Shell said. LNG liquefaction volumes were slightly higher on the quarter, averaging 8 million tonnes.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",Rebel Generali investor ready for legal action in case of narrow AGM board defeat,"By Carolyn Cohn, Pamela Barbaglia and Valentina Za
LONDON (Reuters) -A rebel investor in Generali (MI:GASI) could mount a legal challenge if his bid to appoint new top executives at Italy's largest insurer loses by a narrow margin in a shareholder vote this month, a candidate for the chairman's role said.
In an interview with Reuters, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna said Generali investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone could challenge in court a victory by the opposite side at the April 29 AGM called to elect a new Generali board if the margin is less than 6%.
The tussle for control of Europe's third-largest insurer not only threatens the stability of the Italian giant - which as a major holder of the country's government debt is considered a cornerstone of the financial system - but calls into question the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, who was put forward by Generali's board for a third mandate. 
It also shines a spotlight on the legacy of cross shareholdings that for decades has dominated the country's ""salotto buono"" - the fine drawing room - a system based on influence and connections interlocking Italy's biggest companies. 
Costamagna - who has been proposed by Caltagirone as the insurer's new chairman - said the Italian tycoon's camp was ""hopeful"" of securing the vote of Italy's Benetton family, which owns around 4% of Generali and is yet to take sides in the feud pitting the construction magnate against Generali's board and its main investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
The Benetton family could not be reached for comment.
With a stake of more than 9%, Caltagirone is the second-biggest investor in Generali, behind Mediobanca which owns just under 13%.
To counter Caltagirone's weight and that of fellow Italian billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, who is Generali's No. 3 investor with a stake of around 8%, Mediobanca has borrowed shares in Generali to give it a 17.2% voting stake at the AGM.
Mediobanca can also count on the vote of Italy's De Agostini group, which plans to sell its 1.4% stake in Generali only after the AGM and has expressed appreciation for Donnet.
Costamagna said Caltagirone would challenge a victory that reflected merely Mediobanca's borrowed shares and the De Agostini stake.
""They have about 4.5% borrowed and ... the De Agostini stake is already sold ... which means the day after the AGM they have 6% less,"" Costamagna said.
""If they win by a margin of less than 6%, they're not going to be legitimate anymore,"" he added.
Caltagirone and Generali declined to comment.
The International Securities Lending Association (ISLA) advises against using borrowed shares to vote at shareholder meetings. 
A source close to the matter told Reuters that ISLA, which in 2018 said that it ""has never condoned the practise of borrowing securities for the sole purpose of voting,"" had written to Mediobanca in this respect.
Mediobanca said in an emailed comment that ISLA, whose rules are not binding, was reiterating provisions in the UK's money market code.
""The share lending in question is a market transaction aimed at protecting an investment worth nearly 4 billion euros where the interest of Mediobanca coincides with that of other Generali shareholders,"" Mediobanca said.
Union Investment, also a Generali shareholder, told Reuters on Thursday it supported existing management.
'CHERRY ON THE CAKE'
Costamagna said acquisitions in key areas including asset management would play a role in boosting Generali's growth, but dealmaking wouldn't be the main priority.
""We have the cash to do it, but it's the cherry on the cake and we have to find the cherry and the cake has to be ready,"" he said.
""If there is the right target, which can bring us what we're lacking and can really complement our business, I have no problem in going ahead and trying to do it,"" he added.
The challenger plan forecasts earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, of more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period, compared with a 6-8% target under Donnet's current strategy. 
Detractors say Caltagirone's estimated earnings are too ambitious without sizable acquisitions. 
However, Costamagna said the focus was mainly on technology, cost cutting and overhauling Generali's holding structure while keeping dividend payments as retail investors - including wealthy families - had expressed concern over possible cuts to payouts. 
""We stressed the M&A side a bit too much… and people thought they're going to acquire the world,"" he said.

Yet, he said asset management deals would be pursued, despite hefty valuations.
""We are very careful, but you know, Bernard Arnault at LVMH has created one of the best companies in Europe and has always overpaid for all his targets, always.""

696,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 07:15AM ET</span>",Elon Musk's arrival stirs fears among some Twitter employees,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -News of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk taking a board seat at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media firm's ability to moderate content, company insiders told Reuters. 
Within hours of the surprise disclosure this week that Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" acquired enough shares to become the top Twitter shareholder, political conservatives began flooding social media with calls for the return of Donald Trump. The former U.S. president was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter after the Jan 6. Capitol riot over concerns around incitement of violence. 
""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK TRUMP!,"" tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on Monday. 
Despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful content. 
With Musk on the board, the employees said his views on moderation could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a place of healthy discourse, and might allow trolling and mob attacks to flourish. 
In the wake of Trump's ban from Facebook and Twitter, the billionaire tweeted that many people would be unhappy with U.S. tech companies acting ""as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""
MUSK'S INTENTIONS
Musk has not articulated what he wants to do as a new board member but he has telegraphed his intentions with his Twitter activity. A week before Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter, he polled his 80 million followers on whether the site adhered to the principle of free speech, and the majority voted 'no.'
The employees, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, point to Musk's history of using Twitter to attack critics. In 2018, Musk came under fire for accusing a British diver who had helped rescue children trapped in a cave in Thailand of being a pedophile. 
Musk won a defamation case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-musk-lawsuit-idINKBN1YA13U brought by the diver in 2019. 
When asked for comment, a Twitter spokesperson repeated a statement from Tuesday that the board ""plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service,"" but daily operations and decisions are made by Twitter's management and employees. 
""Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,"" the spokesperson said.
Some employees that Reuters spoke to were not so sure about the company's commitment to this. 
""I find it hard to believe (the board) doesn't have influence,"" said one employee. ""If that's the case, why would Elon want a board seat?"" 
But other employees Reuters spoke to said that Musk's involvement could help quicken the pace of new feature and product launches, and provide a fresh perspective as an active user of Twitter.
Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment.
Twitter's board figures prominently in discussions within Twitter, more so than at other tech companies, one employee said. That is because unlike Meta Platforms Inc, where founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls the company through a dual class share structure, Twitter only has a single class of shares, making it more vulnerable to activists like Musk. Teams within Twitter often consider how to communicate a strategy or decision to the board, for instance, the employee said.
On Thursday, Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1511982702819520512?s=20&t=icqGAAlqCZdXjrowWZk0zw an image from 2018 of him smoking weed on the Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), with the text: ""Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit.""
TRUMP'S RETURN?
One employee familiar with the company's operations said there were no current plans to reinstate Trump. A Twitter spokesperson said there were no plans to reverse any policy decisions. 
But a veteran auto analyst who covers Musk's operating style at Tesla said such a decision may only be a matter of time. 
""If Donald Trump was actually rich, he would have liked to have done the same thing but he couldn't afford it. So Elon is doing what Trump would have liked to have done,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. 
""I wouldn't be surprised"" if Twitter restores Trump's account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company,"" he said.
Longer term, employees said Musk's involvement may change Twitter's corporate culture, which they say currently values inclusivity. Musk has faced widespread criticism for posting memes that mocked transgender people and efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, and for comparing some world leaders to Hitler.

Several employees were alarmed by the warm welcome Musk received from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and cofounder Jack Dorsey, which prompted them to hit the job market this week.
""Some people are dusting off their resumes,"" one person said. ""I don’t want to work for somebody (like Musk).""

697,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 07:02AM ET</span>","Ladbrokes owner Entain attracts punters to retail shops, U.S. venture grows","By Amna Karimi
(Reuters) -Ladbrokes owner Entain saw a rise in first-quarter revenue, boosted by a rebound in its retail betting shops and an expansion of its U.S. joint venture, but shares slipped as online sales fell for the second straight quarter.
The London-listed gambling company, which also owns Coral betting shops and the bwin and partypoker online brands, said on Thursday total net gaming revenue jumped 31% for the three months to March 31 despite an 8% fall in revenues from online. 
Shares in the company listed on the FTSE 100 index were down 1.5% at 1030 GMT.
Gambling firms profited during the lockdowns as stay-at-home punters went online for entertainment, but online demand has slowed since economies reopened and people ventured out again, with inflation worries also pressuring spending. 
Many firms, including Entain, are also turning to the U.S. market as it opens up to sports betting. Entain's U.S. joint venture with MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), BetMGM, is now live in 23 markets with four new additions in the period, Entain said. 
""In the U.S., BetMGM is firmly established as the number two operator, and our market launches during Q1 mean that we now have access to over 41% of the U.S. adult population,"" Entain Chief Executive Jette Nygaard-Andersen said in a statement. 
BetMGM is expected to turn a core profit this year compared to a loss a year ago on revenues of more than $1.3 billion, Entain said in January.

""Very impressive BetMGM looks to be ticking over nicely,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Matt Britzman said, adding that increased online demand, which brings in better margins, also seems to be faring well for Entain despite the return to retail.
Entain, previously known as GVC, has withheld dividend payments in the past two years, and last month said it would use excess cash on acquisitions. It said in January it was considering developing products for virtual reality systems.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, rebounding after a losing streak, with investors cautiously digesting signals of aggressive central bank policy tightening and the likely impact on economic growth.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 65 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed lower Wednesday, the second consecutive losing day, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 150 points, or 0.4%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite over 2%. 
These losses followed the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in March, the gathering which saw the U.S. central bank hike interest rates for the first time since 2018.
The Fed policymakers signaled they were prepared to act more quickly than previously suggested, planning to shrink its balance sheet by more than $1 trillion a year while raising interest rates “expeditiously” to counter rampant inflation. 
The central bank next meets in May, and investors will likely study the employment and inflation data carefully ahead of this, starting with weekly jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This release is expected to show claims of only 200,000 last week, indicative of a vibrant labor market. 
Additionally, FOMC members James Bullard, Raphael Bostic, and John Williams are scheduled to offer their thoughts on the economic outlook during the session.
In corporate news, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) will be in the spotlight after the jeans retailer impressed with its quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday, while HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock is seen sharply higher premarket after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed it had bought a $4.2 billion stake in the company.
Oil prices rebounded Thursday after Wednesday’s sharp losses on the back of International Energy Agency member countries confirming that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180-million-barrel release announced by the United States last week.
Adding to Wednesday’s woes, data from the Energy Information Administration showing crude inventories rose by over 2 million barrels last week, the first climb in three weeks, raising questions about energy demand in the world’s largest oil-consuming country.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $97.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $102.57. Both benchmarks settled more than 5% lower on Wednesday, falling to a three-week low.

OSLO (Reuters) - Belgian oil tanker group Euronav (NYSE:EURN) and smaller Oslo-listed rival Frontline (NYSE:FRO) plan to merge in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.2 billion that they said would cut costs and help in their low-carbon transition.
Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, the largest owner of Frontline and the second biggest in Euronav, said the deal would establish a market leader and position the group for continued shareholder value creation.
Euronav's owners will get 59% of the combined group and will also receive a cash dividend before the deal closes, while Frontline owners will hold the remaining 41%, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.
The merged company will use the Frontline name and will be led by Euronav CEO Hugo De Stoop.
Euronav's shares were up 9.5% at 1011 GMT while Frontline's were down 4.8%.
The combination offers economies of scale that will facilitate increased fleet utilisation and ease a transition to digitalisation of logistics and the adoption of lower-carbon fuels for tankers, the companies said.
""The combination would be a leading global independent oil tanker operator,"" KBC Securities wrote in a note to clients, while cautioning that there were no assurance yet that a definitive merger agreement will be reached.
The rise of Euronav's share price on Thursday, and Frontline's fall, reflected the planned exchange ratio of the two shares compared to Wednesday's stock market closings, Arctic Securities analyst Lars Bastian Oestereng said.
""You can implicitly buy Frontline shares through buying Euronav shares cheaper ...It's an arbitrage opportunity,"" he said.
The new firm would have a fleet of 146 tankers, including 69 very large crude carriers (VLCC) and 57 Suezmax vessels.
""I am very excited and give my full support and commitment to this combined platform,"" veteran shipping investor John Fredriksen said.
The 77-year-old owns 39% of Frontline and 9% of Euronav according to the firms' websites, and is set to control around one fifth of the new firm's stock, according to a Reuters calculation.

The transaction remains subject to agreements on the transaction structure and terms, due diligence and regulatory approvals.
Euronav was advised on the deal by Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), while Frontline used ABG Sundal Collier. In addition, independent directors on Frontline's board retained DNB Markets.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 06:17AM ET</span>",Job wars: Employers wince as Amazon warehouse rises in Indiana town,"By Timothy Aeppel
ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - What happens when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plops over 1,000 new jobs in one of the hottest blue-collar job markets in the country?
The RV Capital of the World is about to find out.
Like many other manufacturing hubs around the United States, this patch of northern Indiana about 100 miles (161 km) east of Chicago has struggled to fill factory jobs throughout the pandemic, due in large part to an unprecedented boom in the recreational vehicle industry that dominates the local economy. 
New U.S. manufacturing jobs were minted at a rate of about 32,000 a month over the past year - the swiftest clip in more than a quarter century - but the regional variations are sizable. Around Elkhart, whose population is about 52,000, the share of the total workforce that is employed in factories and manufacturing is 51.5%, compared with a share of 8% nationally, according to the Labor Department.
The region's jobless rate sank to 0.9% in December, the lowest rate in the country, according to the Labor Department, though it has since edged up slightly. 
That is why when Amazon announced in October it would open a sprawling fulfillment center as well as a smaller last-mile delivery station in town, many of Elkhart's existing employers winced.
""I'm not 100% clear on the thinking of putting another 1,000 jobs in this tight labor market,"" said Bob Martin, chief executive of  Thor Industries  (NYSE:THO) Inc, the country's largest RV maker, which has plants dotted around Elkhart.
The new jobs have roiled all types of employers. Amish Shah, chief executive of Kem Krest, a distributor of automotive chemicals and accessories such as paint pens used to touch up scratches on cars at auto dealerships, said, ""The community at large is up in arms."" 
Shah estimates his 700-employee company is short 100 workers, despite constant recruiting, and noted he has gone to new extremes to retain employees and keep them happy. The company recently opened a free medical clinic at its main warehouse, for instance, and last week held a contest for workers with six months of perfect attendance. Top prize? Free use for a year of a new Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV, which typically retails for over $26,000.
""We have people who have already gotten calls from Amazon, saying 'come work for us,'"" said Shah, adding that no one has jumped ship for Amazon just yet.
RV BOOM
Amazon's new warehouse is rising from a muddy field in one of the most prominent spots in the county - just across the freeway from the RV Hall of Fame and Museum, a local landmark. When it opens next year, it will have space equal to 14 football fields. The other facility, designed for last-mile deliveries, has yet to break ground but is also expected to open in 2023.
Amazon declined to discuss whether it worried about filling jobs in Elkhart's tight labor market - or whether it expected to pay more than usual to attract willing hands.
The company, which has faced tough criticism for working conditions in its facilities and is battling labor unions seeking to organize its workers, has said only that its jobs come with an average starting pay of $18 an hour. Just last week workers at an Amazon facility in New York City voted to form a union despite the company's campaign against it. 
The company often emphasizes the other benefits it offers when it creates new jobs, including health benefits and aid for continuing education.
""Amazon is proud of this job creation and we also think employees will be excited to grow their career at Amazon in the Elkhart community,"" said spokesman Andre Woodson, in a statement.
Elkhart's tight job market is driven largely by the booming RV industry, where demand has soared as Americans sought new ways to travel while staying away from strangers during the pandemic.
An estimated 30,000-40,000 workers commute to Elkhart County each day for work, giving the otherwise rural-looking roadways regular doses of heavy traffic. The county's total workforce is about 115,000, according to the state's Department of Workforce Development, so the commuters are vital to filling existing jobs, which numbered just under 140,000 at the end of September, federal employment data showed.
""Just looking at the numbers, it doesn't make a lot of sense. They already have far more jobs than workers,"" said Michael Hicks, an economist at Ball (NYSE:BLL) State University who studies Indiana's industrial economy.
WHO WILL COME?
A key question is what the Amazon jobs will ultimately pay. Many local officials expect the company will need to pay more than the $18 an hour average, given the extremely tight labor market. Elkhart County ranked No. 4 among the largest 344 U.S. counties in year-over-year weekly wage growth as of the third quarter of 2021, the latest Labor Department data shows.
""I think they'll do what they have to do to meet demand (for labor),"" said Chris Stager, president of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County.
Stager and other local officials said the region faces a daunting challenge even without adding a big new employer. Housing is in short supply and more companies in Elkhart have started expanding in other regions simply to find enough workers.
Thor Industries is one of them. The company is building several factories about 30 miles away in Sturgis, Michigan, as part of its latest expansion and recently acquired a company in Alabama that gives it access to a more plentiful pool of labor.
""Amazon is competition, and sometimes competition makes you a better company,"" said Thor's CEO, Martin.
But analysts believe the big RV makers are more insulated from losing workers to Amazon than many other types of employers. The RV industry uses a wage structure that offers production-driven incentives on top of relatively low hourly rates that can massively boost factory wages during good times, as is the case now. It is not unusual for assembly workers in plants to make the equivalent of $50 or more an hour.
One question is how long the boom lasts.
""The music is going to stop at some point,"" said Pete McCown, president of the Community Foundation of Elkhart County. High gas prices and rising interest rates could put a damper on the industry, though there is no obvious sign yet of a major slowdown.
'A GLOW'
To be sure, there remain many workers in Elkhart who would likely get a raise by jumping to Amazon - including many who earn less in restaurants and other lower-paid service industries.
As of May 2021, the county had about 6,500 food-service workers earning an average of $12.46 an hour, Labor Department data released last week showed. In all, about half the county's workers then earned less than $19 an hour. While that wage has certainly risen since then given the competition for limited workers, it would still leave tens of thousands in the county earning less than the $18-an-hour starting average that Amazon promotes.
Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), the largest parts supplier to the RV industry, said companies in the region that offer competitive pay and good working conditions should not worry. He includes LCI in that group.
""The restaurants are the ones who always get blitzed,"" he said, ""because they have the lowest pay.""

He thinks Amazon will burnish the region’s ""glow.""
""Others will look at the county and say, 'Wow, this big tech company went there, so there must be something good in Elkhart.'""

702,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 06:11AM ET</span>","Analysis-As bond prices swoon, U.S. banks may slow stock buybacks","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bankers have long talked about how higher interest rates will deliver additional revenue from loans and higher-yielding securities.
Now that rates are rising, bankers must confront the downside: as yields rise the bonds they already own lose value and erode their capital.
For the biggest U.S. banks, this means less excess capital to fund share buybacks. Fewer buybacks mean less growth in earnings per share, which puts more pressure on stock prices. 
The S&P Banks Index has declined by 11% since the start of the year, almost double the 6% decline of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period.
""You're going to see a lot lower buybacks than you did last year in the U.S. banking system,"" said bank analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) could show one of the biggest capital declines from falling bond prices when banks start reporting quarterly results next week, analysts said, since it moved more aggressively than others to invest extra cash in securities last year.
""I'm pretty sure you will see that they have slowed their buybacks considerably in the first quarter and primarily due to this issue,"" Peabody said.
Bank of America declined to comment.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
The lost capital should eventually be compensated by higher rates improving net interest income. But the timing is inconvenient for buybacks, analysts said.
""Rising interest rates are a double-edged sword for the banks,"" Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin wrote in a report.
In the first quarter, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 0.83 of a percentage point to 2.34%. A full 1-point increase would have shaved Bank of America's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a key regulatory measure, to 10.2% from 10.6%, Usdin estimated.
That would leave the bank close to the 10% to 10.5% level that Bank of America executives have said the bank will maintain to keep a cushion over its 9.5% requirement from regulators.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) would have had its CET1 ratio reduced by 0.22 of a point while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) would have seen a 0.15-point cut, Usdin.
Citigroup and JPMorgan have additional reasons to reduce buybacks, Peabody noted. Citigroup probably will have to take some losses on its Russian assets and it has said those could rise to nearly $5 billion in a ""severe"" scenario.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a letter to shareholders on Monday that his bank's buybacks ""will be lower in the next year or so"" because it faces higher capital requirements and needs to invest in businesses it recently acquired.
When banks post results, analysts will examine how each one has changed its mix of cash and securities to increase interest income and managed the risk of unrealized losses on securities. 
Banks have been taking steps to reduce damage from the unrealized losses, including hedging holdings as Bank of America does.
Banks can also make an accounting choice that tempers the risk. They can classify some bonds as ""held-to-maturity"" (HTM) and not be required to count changes in value if they commit to keep the securities until they are repaid.
Or, banks can keep the bonds as ""available-for-sale,"" (AFS) which means having to count unrealized losses against capital but being free to sell the securities, such as to raise money to make more loans.
Bank securities portfolios have shifted to 47% held-to-maturity from 28% two years ago, according to Usdin.
Most banks are small enough that regulators don't require them to count the changes in AFS securities toward their capital requirements.
Whether AFS or HTM, the unrealized losses do not reduce earnings.

Peabody expects investors will focus more on changes in capital in coming quarters if bond prices continue to fall. That's because changes in capital, also known as book value, can be a better indicator than earnings of whether companies are creating value for shareholders or piling up losses to be realized later.
Usdin estimated that book value per share for 20 banks he covers would decline an average of 4% with a 1 percentage point increase in 10-year yields.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Benettons, who control Atlantia with a 33% stake, are united in ruling out any transaction that would involve a break-up of the Italian infrastructure group, one source close to the family told Reuters on Thursday.
Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIPC) pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia last week after talks with the family, the two funds said, adding they were also working with Spain ACS on the deal. 
 
"
704,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 05:52AM ET</span>",Analysts' view on looming bidding war for Atlantia,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Atlantia jumped almost 12% to their highest levels in over two years after Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIPC) pitched a possible takeover of the Italian road and airport operator.
The funds have an agreement with ACS under which the Spanish construction company could acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer was completed.
The two funds said they had pitched a potential takeover of Italian road and airport operator last week after meetings with its main shareholder, Benetton family's Edizione.
However, the Benetton family, investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and other long-time investors in Atlantia are studying a counter-move to buy the company, three sources with knowledge of the matter said late on Wednesday. 
COMMENTS: 
KEPLER CHEUVREUX:
The potentially very large size of the transaction, given Atlantia's capitalization vs. ACS's one, as well as hypothetical interest from other investors, led the broker to ""think that the theoretical motivation could be, for example, the break-up of the Italian company.""
""We believe that for this hypothetical transaction to succeed, ACS and its potential partners would need the support of Atlantia's main shareholder, the Benetton family. Even on this assumption, the theoretical deal would be markedly complex due to valuation, political, and financing considerations.""
SANTANDER:
Based on current information, ACS is interested in Atlantia's toll road assets, but probably also the Italian's company 16% stake in Hochtief; joint offer with funds ""could mean a final shareholding for ACS below 50%, and ACS would avoid the consolidation of Abertis.""
ALANTRA:
""The deal (for ACS) looks big, complex, difficult to execute, and could be expensive especially if a bidding war takes place. In addition, this would be the second time that ACS makes a move for Atlantia, which raises the chances of it paying up to succeed.""
JBCAPITAL: 
""At this stage, it is unclear if there will be a bidding war for Atlantia. If it is the case, ACS will have to explain how a competing bid can add value for its shareholders,"" it says.
""The competition to acquire top-quality infrastructure assets is very high, particularly from infrastructure funds and pension funds. Consequently, we expect ACS to try to leverage its relationship with the Benetton family and Atlantia to test waters ahead of a potential deal with any of the former two.""
EQUITY SALESPERSON AT AN ITALIAN BANK:
""If stock is up 10-15% in the next few sessions I would be more a seller than a buyer as this is going to be another special situation with politics involved"" and, with Benetton controlling one-third of the capital, any hostile bid would be ""quite hard to materialize.""
BANCA AKROS:
Any combination with ACS may lead to further synergies on Atlantia's Latin America business. The broker adds however that given stake that Benetton hold in Atlantia, and the ongoing buyback, ""a hostile bid could be challenging.""
INTESA SANPAOLO:
Analysts at Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) agree that an unfriendly bid of ACS seems ""unlikely to succeed and it would also put into question the partnership with Atlantia on Albertis.""
BESTINVER:

Bestinver says instead that a possible war for control of Atlantia ""would undoubtedly benefit minority shareholders but would risk becoming too costly for the contenders."" 
Hence, the brokerage does not rule out that the Benetton and Florentino Perez, who owns ACS, may come to an agreement, jointly delisting the Italian group and then proceeding with a break-up.

(Reuters) -British online gambling firm 888 will pay a smaller price to buy William Hill's international assets from U.S.-based owner Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment, the companies said on Thursday, citing changes in economic and regulatory conditions.
Shares in London-listed 888 soared nearly 30% after the British company also said it would have to raise less capital to partly fund the purchase.
Las Vegas-based casino operator Caesars bought British bookmaker William Hill in a $4 billion deal last year and agreed in September to sell William Hill's non-U.S. assets to 888 for 2.2 billion pounds ($2.88 billion).
The purchase, 888's largest since listing in London nearly two decades ago, will give the online pure-play company access to William Hill's 2 million active UK customers and 1,408 betting shops across the UK.
The two companies have agreed that the assets now have an enterprise value of between 1.95 billion pounds and 2.05 billion pounds.
That means 888 will have to pay a cash consideration of about 585 million pounds, nearly 30% below the previously agreed 834.9 million pounds, 888 said.
William Hill is subject to an ongoing licence review by the UK's gambling commission and is addressing action points raised by the regulator in relation to its ""social responsibility and anti-money laundering obligations"", 888 said in the statement.
The review comes at a time when British businesses are facing rising inflation and consumers are struggling with a cost-of-living squeeze.
888, which has online sports betting, poker and casino platforms, said it now plans to issue up to 70.8 million new shares, which represents about 136 million pounds as of Wednesday's close, versus prior plans to raise about 500 million pounds.
Analysts at Jefferies said in a note they believe the deal ""makes strategic and financial sense"", adding that this will materialise in 888's balance sheet.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by June 2022.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's top court on Thursday cleared the way for passengers to seek compensation for delayed flights from non-EU airlines operating flights on behalf carriers from within the bloc.
The ruling from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the latest to boost passengers' rights to be reimbursed for flight delays or cancellations.
Thursday's case concerned three passengers, who made a single reservation with Lufthansa via a travel agency for a flight from Brussels to San Jose in the United States. The flight was entirely operated by United Airlines.
The three travellers arrived at their destination with a 223-minute delay and subsequently sued United Airlines in a Dutch court for compensation.
The CJEU backed their claim, saying United Airlines could then seek compensation from third parties.
""Passengers of a delayed flight may claim compensation from a non-EU air carrier where that carrier operates the entirety of the flight on behalf of an EU carrier,"" judges said.

""The operating air carrier (United Airlines) which is obliged to compensate a passenger retains the right to seek compensation from any person, including third parties, in accordance with the applicable national law.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus and Qatar Airways are set to face each other in court as a dispute over billions of dollars of jets enters a theatrical phase and rattles some airline leaders.
The Gulf carrier will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend an order that prevents Airbus revoking a contract for 50 A321neo jets, pending fuller hearings.
Airbus took the exceptionally rare step of halting the order in January in retaliation for Qatar's refusal to accept delivery of larger A350s, citing a breakdown in relations that has the makings of a corporate divorce trial.
Qatar has grounded 23 of the A350 jets, voicing concerns over the safety impact of gaps in a layer of lightning protection left exposed by cracked and bubbling paint.
It says it will not take further deliveries until the cause is formally explained and is suing Airbus for steadily rising compensation that now exceeds $1 billion.
The world's largest planemaker has acknowledged quality problems with the jets but insists the damage is well within safety tolerances, noting that European regulators consider them airworthy and other airlines continue to fly them.
Airline chiefs contacted by Reuters did not share Qatar's concerns over airworthiness of the A350 but voiced growing alarm over the scale of the dispute which has disturbed a broad industry consensus over safety and generated a trail of intricate filings.
""It is not good for the industry. They both need to get it out of the courtroom and find an agreement,"" the chief executive of one Airbus customer told Reuters.
Several industry players have offered to mediate but so far there are no signs of such a breakthrough, though neither side has definitively closed the door to discussion and Airbus has said it wants an ""amicable"" settlement.
Thursday's hearing, which is due to start at 0930 GMT, will be the first in-person clash after procedural sessions were held online because of COVID-19 restrictions.
'DANGEROUS GAME'
Statements filed in advance of the unusual hearing shed new light on industrial planning and details of aircraft negotiations that are typically kept under wraps.
The case has also shone a spotlight on delicate relations between France, where Airbus is based, and one of its closest Gulf allies at a time when Qatar's role as a gas producer has come to the fore as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russia.
In order to decide on Qatar's request for an injunction, a judge will weigh which side has most to lose if the A321 contract is scrapped and to what extent the plane is unique in its category. That issue goes to the heart of Airbus's battle for sales with rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the busiest part of the market.
Airbus has outsold Boeing about four to one at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets and Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said last year the A321neo had ""unmatched capabilities (and) operating economics"".
In statements pre-filed to the court, however, Airbus said Qatar Airways could replace the cancelled A321neos with the rival Boeing 737 MAX, which it provisionally ordered in December, or Airbus jets available from leasing companies.
The case has also given a glimpse of the stakes involved as leasing companies handle an uneven recovery while waiting for lease rates to catch up with the levels they planned before the pandemic.
Airbus told the court leasing companies are looking for homes for 80 A320s and 48 A321s in 2023 - a relatively high number a year before delivery, according to market sources.
""It shows that lessors believe the lease market is going to move up and are holding back before placing airplanes acquired before the pandemic - but it's a dangerous game,"" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
Qatar Airways, in turn, revealed normally closely held details of product plans for the A321neo, including pedal controls for seats and toilets adapted from those on the luxurious A380 superjumbo. Such details are usually jealously guarded until airlines are ready to reveal them in a highly competitive travel industry.

After the glare of proceedings at the High Court in London this month, the two sides are heading for a potentially uncomfortable meeting at the airline industry's largest annual event in June, relocated to Qatar because of travel restrictions in China.
Willie Walsh, the head of the International Air Transport Association, said on Wednesday he did not expect the dispute to distract from the meeting which is likely to focus on the impact of the Ukraine conflict.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses on the aggressive stance by Federal Reserve policymakers, but the U.K. market underperformed with oil major Shell (LON:RDSa) lifting the cost of writing off its Russian assets.
By 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, while U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.
The major corporate news Thursday came from the much-watched oil sector, as U.K. energy giant Shell stated it will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed.
The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, the company said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. It had previously estimated the Russia write-downs would reach around $3.4 billion.
Shell’s stock fell 1.1%, dragging BP’s stock down 1.4% as the rival also has substantial interests in Russia to unwind. The losses of these two highly-weighted stocks resulted in the FTSE 100 index underperforming its European peers.
Elsewhere, the major European indices rebounded after posting sharp losses on Wednesday, weighed by the expectation the U.S. central bank is prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the U.S. economy to contain rampant inflation.
Investors remain concerned the meatier interest rate hikes from the Fed down the line to combat inflation will severely cut growth in the world’s largest economy, and the major global driver. 
Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank became the first big bank on Wall Street to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023. 
German industrial production rose 0.2% on the month in February, better than expected but still a hefty drop from the gain of 2.7% the previous month. Eyes will now turn to the release of Eurozone retail sales data for February.
Investors are also continuing to keep an eye on developments surrounding the war in Ukraine, after the United States announced new measures on Wednesday to punish Moscow, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters and Russia's Sberbank, and a ban on Americans investing in Russia.
Oil prices rebounded Thursday after the previous session’s sharp losses on the news that a number of major consuming nations will release crude from emergency reserves to offset supply lost from Russia. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced Wednesday that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180-million-barrel release announced by the United States last week.
Adding to Wednesday’s woes, data from the Energy Information Administration showing crude inventories rose by over 2 million barrels last week, the first climb in three weeks, raising questions about energy demand in the world’s largest oil-consuming country.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $96.58 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $101.33. Both benchmarks settled more than 5% lower on Wednesday, falling to a three-week low.

Xu, who has worked at JD (NASDAQ:JD).com for more than a decade, will start the top job immediately, the company said in a statement, adding that he will also join the board as an executive director. 
Xu's appointment comes as JD.com deals with slowing growth, with competition rising and consumer spending shrinking amid tightened regulations in China that have targeted e-commerce platforms.
JD.com has been cutting jobs recently and expanded layoffs in March, according to local media, as have other Chinese technology companies that are slashing their workforce to cut costs in a weaker, pandemic-ravaged economy. JD.com's U.S.-listed shares have nearly halved since their peak in February 2021.
Reuters reported last month that Chinese internet giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) are preparing for layoff rounds this year that might cut tens of thousands of jobs.
JD.com's core e-commerce business remained solid and the job cuts were happening at its marginal businesses, said Liu Xingliang, president of tech consultancy China Internet Data Center.
""Richard Liu is handing over the baton to Xu Lei, who will take care of the everyday business,"" he said.
Richard Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998 and a few years back had called out what he said were ""slackers"" in his firm, will spend more time mentoring younger management and focus on the company's business in rural areas.
With 80% of its voting share as per the company's 2020 annual report, and a nearly 14% stake, Liu will remain chairman of the board. 

Liu's control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2018 following a rape allegation. He denied the allegation and was not charged with a crime. 
Last September, JD.com had said Liu would step away from the day-to-day operations, handing those responsibilities over to Xu and switching his focus to JD.com's long-term strategy.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 03:15AM ET</span>","Walmart's Flipkart raises IPO valuation target to $60-70 billion, eyes 2023 listing-sources","By Aditya Kalra, Aftab Ahmed and Anirban Sen
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Indian e-commerce company Flipkart has internally raised its IPO valuation target by around a third to $60-70 billion, and now plans a U.S. listing in 2023 instead of this year, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters. 
Flipkart, which competes with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in India's booming e-commerce space, had earlier set an IPO valuation goal of $50 billion, Reuters has reported.
The main reason for waiting for the IPO is due to Flipkart's internal plan to boost valuations further by focussing on two of its relatively new businesses -- online healthcare services and travel bookings, two of the sources with direct knowledge said.
Two separate sources familiar with Flipkart's plans said the ongoing global market turmoil sparked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis also forced the Indian company to reconsider its timeline.
Flipkart acquired Indian travel booking website Cleartrip in 2021, and this week launched a ""Health+"" app to offer medicines as well as other healthcare products and services. 
""Flipkart thinks there is an even bigger upside of valuation than originally envisaged ... The travel business has started showing great signs already for them,"" said the first source. 
The first source said the IPO valuation target could be as high as $70 billion, while the second said it could be between $60-65 billion.
Flipkart didn't respond to a request for comment. 
Asked about the IPO's timeline, Walmart CFO Brett Biggs told an analysts conference in December that Flipkart's business was ""performing almost exactly like we thought"" and an ""IPO is still very much in the cards"", without specifying when the company will list.
The listing, according to sources, is now being planned for early-to-mid 2023. Flipkart is incorporated in Singapore and wants to list in the United States, they added.
The IPO planning comes amid growing protests from Indian brick-and-mortar retailers that Flipkart and Amazon bypass federal regulations and favour select sellers, allegations the companies deny. India is also working on a slew of e-commerce sector regulations that could spook foreign giants. 
Walmart acquired a roughly 77% stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion in 2018 - its biggest deal ever - and said later that year that it could take the company public in four years. 
Just last year, Flipkart raised $3.6 billion in a funding round, giving it a valuation of $37.6 billion.
That fund raising helped bolster the company's financial position, and it had enough cash right now for expansion, meaning an IPO wasn't a necessity at this stage, said one of the sources. 

India's IPO market has slowed after having boomed as enthusiastic retail investors and a pandemic-induced flood of easy money pushed prices to record highs, encouraging a slew of Indian tech companies like Paytm and Zomato to go public.
More than 60 companies made their market debut in India in 2021 and raised a total of more than $13.7 billion, which was more than the previous three years combined.

The operator of 7-Eleven convenience stores has been under pressure from activist fund ValueAct Capital to make structural reforms and sell off assets.
The company said in a statement it would name two female and three non-Japanese nominees to the new roles of independent outside directors, making external members the majority in its board composition.
The revamp is intended to add diversity and bring in new skills as the company pursues growth outside Japan, it said.
Seven & i said it would continue reforms of its business portfolio, and that it had hired a financial adviser to conduct a strategic review of its Sogo & Seibu department store unit.
ValueAct, which holds a 4.4% stake, had urged the company to sell off Sogo & Seibu, saying in February that Seven & i could more than double its share price by focusing on its convenience stores.

Seven & i made the announcement along with full-year financial results. Operating profit rose 5.8% to 388 billion yen ($3.14 billion) in the year through February, it said in a separate statement.

Financial markets finally appear to be waking up to the reality that the Federal Reserve will soon start taking the axe to its asset holdings in another aggressive step to put inflation back in its bottle. 
So in addition to the prospect of an aggressive half-point rate hike in May, minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed, officials agreed to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central banks asset holdings. That move could also begin next month.
No need to imagine how the spectre of a faster tightening in financial conditions than anticipated went down.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index fell over 2% for a second straight day. Wall Street ended broadly lower, futures suggest another day of selling. European shares are also expected to open lower, Japan's blue-chip Nikkei fell 1.5%. 
Bond markets are calmer today, but they'd already sold off as comments from Fed officials earlier in the week highlighted a debate about reducing the Fed's balance sheet, worth roughly $9 trillion.
Signalling about recession risks from the 2-10 year segment of the yield curve have also eased. But note  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) now believes geopolitical upheaval, soaring inflation and hefty Fed tightening will likely tip the U.S. economy into a recession by late next year.
Minutes from the European Central Bank's March meeting meanwhile are out later, just a week ahead of the ECB's next gathering. In the euro area too calls to take action against inflation are only getting louder. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said on Wednesday rates may have to rise soon. 
And with French bonds coming under pressure, a government bonds auction later may be worth watching as a gauge of investor sentiment before the April 10 first round presidential election.

715,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 02:25AM ET</span>",Shell Sees $4 Billion-$5 Billion Hit from Exiting Russia in 1Q Results,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Shell (LON:RDSa) expects a hit to earnings of as much as $5 billion after-tax in the first quarter as a result of its abrupt exit from Russia, the energy giant said Thursday.
Europe's biggest oil and gas producer announced it would divest Russian businesses almost immediately after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. While it continued to buy Russian oil for its trading operations, it soon had to discontinue that, too, after outrage at its participation in an export tender by one of the country's largest producers. 
The company said its adjusted earnings will still accurately reflect the company's performance, which will be heavily influenced by the surge in oil prices during the quarter. A $10 rise in Brent generates roughly $2.5 billion in Shell's adjusted earnings from oil and another $1 billion in earnings from gas, according to its latest estimates.
Trading profit is expected to leap as its indicative refining margin widened to $10.23 a barrel from $6.55 three months earlier. Shell's refineries also operated at a slightly higher level in the quarter, at a utilization rate of between 72% and 74%. However, its cash flow from operations is expected to show a $7 billion outflow due to the soaring cost of replacing inventory and other factors.
Shell said it expects to report production of between 1.9 million and 2.05 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down around 50,000 boe/d due to the transfer of its Canada Shales assets to Integrated Gas. Underlying operating costs are seen at around $2.5 billion.
Its other main profit driver, chemicals, will report margins roughly unchanged from the previous quarter (due to higher feedstock costs) but will be supported by the fact that its chemicals plants, like its refineries, ran at slightly higher utilization rates."

LONDON (Reuters) - A month of the war in Ukraine briefly erased a year's worth of gains for European equities but the continent's bourses have quickly recovered as investors have poured money into sectors such as energy and defence which are poised to benefit from one of the deepest policy shifts in the region in decades. 
The largest war in Europe since World War Two has suddenly awakened governments to the urgent need of making their economies less reliant on oil and gas imports from Russia and building their own military security capabilities.
After initially plunging to 12-month lows amid record outflows on worries the war could cause a stagflation shock, European equities have swiftly recovered. Shares in German defence company Rheinmetall are worth twice as much as before the conflict while shares of wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems have jumped around 40% so far. 
The broader market has recovered 11% in one month, and is within striking distance of a record high on Jan. 4 with overall valuations at a 34% discount to the U.S. market. 
""The TINA argument (""There is No Alternative"" to stocks) is not as strong as it was but ... the yields you can get on many parts of the equity space - particularly energy, materials and financials - are still your better source of income at the moment,"" said Benjamin Jones, director of macro research at Invesco. 
Graphic: Europe PE discount to U.S.: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzybzykvw/Europe%20PE%20discount%20to%20US.PNG 
Investors' shopping bag has changed dramatically since Feb. 24 when Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
""Europe will transition to be more independent and redefine many of its sectors and economic paradigms,"" said Eric Lopez, head of EMEA Equity Research at BofA Global Research. 
""The consequences will range from the development of new industries, the acceleration of existing ones, additional infrastructure and technologies, while reaching independence and leadership for some,"" he said. With its costly REpowerEU plan, the European Commission wants to replace over 70% of Russian gas imports this year by ramping up liquefied natural gas purchases, green energy and gas storage. Investment flows at a regional level continue to be in negative territory for Europe with net outflows of $17.9 billion so far this year, according to BoFA. 
But Morningstar data showed 2.1 billion euros of fund inflows to the European energy sector this year, while shares of a handful of European defence companies have attained double-digit returns since the start of the war. 
Graphic: European defence shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkbexxvq/European%20defence%20shares.png 
Germany and Sweden said they plan to sharply increase spending on defence to around 2% of their economic output. 
BofA estimates 200 billion euros ($218.08 billion) of incremental annual spending in the sector if all European countries moved to devote 2% of their gross domestic product spending on defence. 
Commodity-linked stocks alongside financials shares have been the preferred sectors since the start of the war as oil and other commodity prices surged. Healthcare is back in vogue for its defensive traits.

""SO AWAY FROM THESE INDEXES""
Lale Akoner, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management, said her top picks are commodity-rich London FTSE 100 and the Norwegian index. She is avoiding Germany's Dax, for its heavy exposure to Russian energy. 
""What I'm saying to clients is that you have ... to understand the nuances on which country is more dependent on natural gas and energy supply from Russia,"" she said. ""So away from these indexes"". 
There is a lot of investor interest in Europe's energy sector with the REPowerEU plan expected to be positive for pure renewables players like RWE, Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and EDP Renováveis.

Plans to speed up the development of alternative gas supplies and LNG will need supporting infrastructure, which could put E.ON, Italgas, Snam, Terna, Red Eléctrica and Enagás in the spotlight for potential network development. 
""What's happened in Russia and Ukraine all of a sudden meant that the energy transition from fossil fuels to more renewables alternatives is now not just an environmental issue, it is also now a security issue as well,"" Invesco's Jones said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Thursday, continuing the sharp losses from the previous session with investors wary after U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers suggested the need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The Fed signaled in its minutes on Wednesday that it was prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the economy to contain rampant inflation, including pare-down of its balance sheet of bonds more quickly than originally anticipated.
This news pressured the major averages on Wall Street, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite the hardest hit, dropping 2.2% on Wednesday. The major European indices also suffered, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both closing around 2% lower.
Investors are concerned the likely meatier interest rate hikes down the line–with ”many"" policymakers now prepared to lift interest rates in 50-basis-point increments at coming meetings–will severely cut growth in the world’s largest economy, and the major global driver. 
Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank became the first big bank on Wall Street to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023. 
Investors are also continuing to keep an eye on developments surrounding the war in Ukraine, after the United States announced new measures on Wednesday to punish Moscow, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters and Russia's Sberbank, and a ban on Americans investing in Russia.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West to do more, in his daily video address early on Thursday, seeking sanctions that are economically destructive enough for Russia to end its war.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A Japanese battery start-up said on Thursday it would launch a commercial fleet service using electric vehicles from China's Geely Holding Group, joining a growing field of services aimed at helping companies reduce their carbon footprint.
Yokohama-based 3DOM Inc, a university-led venture set up in 2014 to develop separators for batteries, said it would offer the carbon neutral EV service through subscription or lease so that users could avoid high purchase costs.
Companies are under increasing pressure from investors and the public to reduce their carbon footprint, and Chinese automakers have led the way in Japan through their relatively low-cost battery electric vehicles.
Leading Japanese delivery firm Sagawa Express Co plans to start replacing all 7,200 of its commercial mini-vehicles with EVs supplied by Guangxi Automobile Group this year. Another firm, SBS Holdings, has plans to use electric trucks produced by Dongfeng Motor group.
3DOM said the electricity that would power Geely's light commercial van would be produced from wind power and other green sources in partnership with utilities. The running cost for the service to lease the vans would be on a par with a gasoline-powered fleet, it said.

3DOM said the fleet would comprise about 7,500 vehicles and several companies including delivery services and supermarket operators were considering its service. It did not elaborate.
Among Japanese automakers, Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp provides EVs for the postal service, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has a trial service with convenience store operators to use its fuel-cell hydrogen electric vehicles.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 01:15AM ET</span>",Stock rebound wobbles as investors zero in on hawkish Fed,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rebound that saw U.S. stocks surge from last month's lows has started to falter, as investors factor in faster monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, soaring inflation and ongoing geopolitical upheaval stemming from the war in Ukraine. 
The S&P 500 is down 7% from its recent high after about cutting its year-to-date loss 50% in a dramatic rally during the final weeks of March. Volatility in both stocks and bonds is once again on the rise and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) earlier this week became the first big Wall Street bank to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023 and a ""transitory"" 20% decline in stocks. 
Still, markets have proven resilient in the past, and April has historically been one of the best months of the year for equities. With corporate earnings around the corner, here is a look at where markets stand less than a week into the second quarter of 2022. 
GRAPHIC: Rebound- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwqgzbpo/Pasted%20image%201649252797681.png
The S&P 500 is down 6.5% year-to-date after a swoon of nearly 13% earlier in the year, though that rebound appears to be running out of steam. 
The index's recent wobble has come alongside forecasts for big rate hikes from Wall Street and a hawkish tilt from policymakers, as well as an inversion of key parts of the Treasury yield curve – a signal that has preceded past recessions.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, released Wednesday, appeared to set the stage for meatier interest rate hikes down the line, as well as a $95 billion per month trimming of the Fed's balance sheet later this year.

The worries about the outlook for stocks come amid a tightening in financial conditions – the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding in the economy. 
GRAPHIC: Different roads- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjbnwnve/Pasted%20image%201649252054580.png
Meanwhile, volatility is picking up in stocks. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, which slipped as equities rallied last month, has inched higher in recent sessions, though it remains about 12 points below its early March closing high. Treasury market volatility has remained elevated, as yields have continued their steady move higher. 
GRAPHIC: Short stack- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/REBOUND/lbvgnmmqkpq/chart.png 
At the same time, bearish bets against the S&P 500 have declined from recent peaks, though they remain near recent highs. Some market watchers believe high short interest, along with other signs of defensive positioning such as hefty levels of cash, to be a contrarian indicator presaging stronger stock performance. 
GRAPHIC: AAII Sentiment Survey- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykjlywpg/Pasted%20image%201649252971512.png
Many have argued that a recession is by no means inevitable and said signals such as yield curve inversions are poor tools for timing stock performance. 
The S&P 500 has risen by an average of 11% in the 12-months following five out of the past seven inversions, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, in a recent note. 
Sentiment among retail investors appears to be growing more positive as well. For the first time since January, the percentage of investors who are bullish on the market is larger than those who are bearish, a weekly survey held by the American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey (AAII), showed.
GRAPHIC: Seasonally strong- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/REBOUND/myvmnqygapr/chart.png

At the same time, the S&P has logged an average gain of 1.5% in April since 1928, making it the second strongest month of the year for stocks, and has now been a positive month for equities for nine straight years. 
This year, much may hinge on how corporate results come in over the next few weeks. Analysts note that growth expectations have not moved much in recent months, despite the upheavals in the stock market: first-quarter earnings growth is forecast to be 6.4%, down from 7.5% at the start of the year, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 01:00AM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics Q1 profit tops market expectations on solid chip demand,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd reported on Thursday an estimated 50% jump in quarterly operating earnings to post its highest first-quarter profit since 2018, beating expectations as solid demand underpinned prices for memory chips.
Earnings at the world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker were also supported by brisk smartphone sales in the quarter, along with a disruption at a rival NAND Flash chip plant, analysts said.
Samsung (KS:005930) put its first-quarter profit at 14.1 trillion won ($11.6 billion) in a preliminary earnings release, versus a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 13.3 trillion won. Revenue likely rose 18% from the same period a year earlier to a record 77 trillion won, also above market expectations. 
""The guidance beat market expectations, probably due to memory chip shipments and prices being better than expected,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
Although memory chip prices dipped in the first quarter, analysts said solid demand from data centre clients as well as cautious investment spending by chipmakers and limited capacity expansion buoyed Samsung's chip earnings, which make up about half of its total profits. 
The chipmaker also likely benefited from a disruption at a rival NAND Flash chip plant owned by Japan's Kioxia and American firm  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) due to contamination of raw materials.
""After the contamination issue at Kioxia, I think there were rush orders for NAND Flash chips made to Samsung for products that were meant to be secured from Kioxia,"" Park said.
The disruption at the Kioxia plant in early February is expected to drive up NAND Flash prices by 5%-10%, offsetting the effects of modestly high inventories maintained by buyers, data provider TrendForce said. 
Samsung shipped an estimated 72 million smartphones in the first quarter, Counterpoint Research said, down some 11% from a year earlier, mostly due to a later than usual release of its newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22. 
The Galaxy S22 series globally sold some 50% more in the first week after its late February launch than its previous model S21, according to Sujeong Lim, an associate director at Counterpoint. 
Samsung is estimated to have shipped slightly over 6 million units of the S22 series by the end of March, Lim said, adding that sales were in line with initial expectations. 
Samsung is due to release detailed earnings on April 28, when investors will be interested to hear any comments on its M&A plans, how it plans to operate its memory chip business to boost profitability, and chip demand outlook. 

Samsung shares fell 0.2% in morning trade, versus a 0.9% drop in the wider market.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 12:25AM ET</span>",More than half of Europeans support cannabis legalization -report,"By Rithika Krishna
(Reuters) - More than half of the European population support legalization of adult use of cannabis and around 30% of them are interested in purchasing it, according to polling data by industry consultants on Thursday.
Europe's liberal approach could reap multiple financial and economic benefits as seen in the United States, which has witnessed a surge in cannabis use during pandemic-induced lockdowns.
While majority of Europeans support regulated cannabis shops, most do not favor growing the plant at home, according to the report by London-based consultancy Hanway and pot producer Curaleaf International.
The report comes a week after the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a bill to end the federal ban on marijuana, which has created legal headaches for users and businesses in the states that have legalized it.
""We see the European market as three to four years behind (the U.S.), but it actually looks like Europe may initiate sweeping reform before the United States,"" said Boris Jordan, executive at U.S.-based Curaleaf.
Many European countries, including Germany, have legalized cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, while others have decriminalized its general use. Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and personal use of cannabis.
The European cannabis market is expected to cross 3 billion euros ($3.27 billion) in annual revenue by 2025, up from about 400 million euros last year, according to a report from research firm Prohibition Partners. Germany has been the biggest market in the continent so far.
""There is clear political desire and willingness in Germany to legalize recreational use,"" Joe Bayern, chief executive officer of Curaleaf, told Reuters.

""Given it (Germany) is the largest economy in Europe, we think it will lead the way and create a domino effect for rest of the continent,"" Bayern said.

(Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX meant for China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) subsidiary Shanghai Airlines landed in Shanghai on Thursday, flight tracking websites showed, amid uncertainty over when the model will resume flying in China.
Flight BOE631 from Guam came more than three weeks after the first 737 MAX bound for a Chinese customer since a 2019 grounding began its journey from Seattle to Boeing's completion plant in Zhoushan.
The plane, painted in Shanghai Airlines livery, had been stuck on the ground in Guam since March 15 due to a minor technical issue. It landed at 12:02 p.m. Shanghai local time (0402 GMT), tracking websites showed.
Boeing said it was bringing the plane to its facility in Zhoushan to be closer to its customer and support a smooth and convenient delivery process. 
""The airplane will be delivered only when the customer is ready,"" Boeing said in a statement.
China Eastern did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The flight to Shanghai, which is in the middle of a strict COVID-19 related lockdown, came as Chinese authorities scrutinise China Eastern's safety processes following the crash of a 737-800 on March 21 that killed all 132 people on board.
While that model is the predecessor to the MAX, analysts have expressed concern it could set back Boeing's efforts to regain ground in the world's biggest aircraft market and deliver more than 140 737 MAX jets already constructed for Chinese customers.
China's aviation regulator in early December provided airlines with a list of fixes required before its return to commercial flying, which it predicted would occur by the beginning of this year. So far, however, there have been only test flights.
China Eastern has grounded all 223 of its 737-800 planes as a precaution while the crash is investigated. Chinese authorities are leading the investigation but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is helping them to read the plane's black boxes.

Depending on the results of the probe, China Eastern risks consequences including fines, aircraft groundings and unfavourable treatment when applying for new routes and airport slots, Morningstar analyst Cheng Weng said.
China Eastern has not released any forecast of when it expects MAX deliveries to resume, though rival China Southern Airlines said last week it could take some of the planes this year.

724,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 11:18PM ET</span>",China Allows Evergrande Creditors to Sue Locally to Recoup Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- Several Chinese lenders have been told they can file legal cases against China Evergrande Group in local courts, in an apparent easing of a restriction that required all such lawsuits to be handled in a single court, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move may help onshore creditors gain control of assets ahead of a looming debt restructuring. At least three lenders in Zhejiang and Shandong province were told by courts last month that they can file the cases against the embattled developer in their own jurisdictions rather than to a court in Guangzhou, where Evergrande was based for decades, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Some cases have already been accepted, said the people.
Creditors have filed hundreds of lawsuits to the Intermediate People’s Court of Guangzhou after China’s Supreme Court in early August ordered all cases against Evergrande and its affiliates to be processed there. The backlog and protracted process have led to slow progress for many banks, trusts and suppliers to seize assets and recover their losses.  
Evergrande, started 28 years ago by billionaire Chairman Hui Ka Yan, officially became a defaulter in December and aims to provide creditors with a preliminary overhaul proposal by the end of July. Both onshore and offshore investors are closely watching the development of what could be one of the nation’s biggest restructurings, as they are prepared for a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains.
Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Calls to the Supreme Court and the Intermediate People’s Court of Guangzhou went unanswered.  
The August order to centralize cases had given Evergrande some breathing room as it helped hold off creditors’ attempts to freeze accounts while allowing the developer to complete more than one million unfinished homes. Smaller rival Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. in November flagged it was also resorting to this approach to prevent assets being frozen by courts under numerous lawsuits.
However, the Guangzhou court alone can’t deal with hundreds of filings from the country, the people said. As of Dec. 9, it has accepted 367 cases with claims totaling 84 billion yuan ($13 billion), the Financial Times reported in December citing official records. 
The latest change may allow creditors to gain faster control of Evergrande’s real estate projects, many of which were being pledged for borrowings, said the people. 
Signs have already emerged that Evergrande is speeding up on disposing of stakes in some property projects. At least three trust companies have bought stakes in at least seven projects from Evergrande this year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning. U.S. equity futures were also on a downward trend after the Federal Reserve revealed plans to hike interest rates and pare its balance sheet by more than $1 trillion a year in the minutes from its March meeting.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.81% by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.3%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.59% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.1%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.4% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.69%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts fell on Wednesday, with technology shares leading a retreat that saw the Nasdaq 100 post its worst two-day loss in almost a month.
U.S. Treasuries rose, with the yield curve steepening, as investors continue to digest Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting. In the minutes, the Fed said it is considering half-point interest rate hikes and reducing its massive bond holdings at a maximum pace of $95 billion per month to tighten financial conditions.
The central bank’s plan to trim its near $9 trillion balance sheet could pose risks to economic growth and introduce further volatility into the market. Some investors are also concerned that a recession is inevitable.
“This job of orchestrating a soft landing is going to be difficult,” Wells Fargo Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Reuters.
“We’ve only seen quantitative tightening once before and it was to a lesser degree than it will be this time, and it ended shortly after it started.”
A slew of Fed policymakers, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at separate events later in the day.
Contrary to the Fed’s hawkish stance, China again signaled its intention to loosen monetary policy as the country deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak and a slumping property market. Officials will use monetary policy tools at an “appropriate time” and consider other measures to boost consumption, according to the readout from a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, commodity markets continue to be roiled by the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia also edged closer to a technical default after foreign banks declined to process around $650 million of dollar payments on its bonds. This forced the country to offer payment in Russian rubles instead."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Cinctive Capital Management is expanding beyond its bread-and-butter stock trading and has hired former Brevan Howard trader Giles Coppel to lead a team that will bet on interest rates and currencies as global macro investments find new favor.
""We are moving to a different paradigm and this is a time for macro investing,"" said Richard Schimel, who co-founded Cinctive with Larry Sapanski in 2019, confirming the moves.
Fresh market volatility coupled with a spike in inflation and an expected end to generous central bank stimulus are combining to create ideal conditions for these types of strategies after a period of lackluster returns.
Cinctive, with more than $3 billion in regulatory assets, according to recent filing, hired Coppel to lead the team as the firm's anchor investors and others said they wanted to put money into macro strategies as making money in stocks becomes harder.
Since January, macro-oriented strategies delivered some of the hedge fund industry's best returns, gaining 2% in the first two months of 2022, according to Hedge Fund Research data. At the same time, the average hedge fund lost 2% and the broader S&P 500 stock index tumbled 8%.

The shift in conditions prompted Schimel and Sapanski to expand with a team of five. Coppel, who joined in February, will be Cinctive's macro chief investment officer. He cemented his reputation at Brevan Howard and ran his own firm, Phillimore Investments. Macro strategist Greg Kaldor, who worked with Coppel at Phillimore, also joined Cinctive in February.
Joining this month will be Raymond Wang, as a portfolio manager responsible for macro rates trading and global relative value after working at BlueCrest Capital Management; Mitch Nadel, the former head of America's Macro Trading at MUFG Securities; and Rak Natrajan, an execution trader who previously worked at Autonomy Capital.

The benchmark CSI 300 gauge has gained more than 2% since the financial hub of Shanghai introduced a two-stage lockdown early last week. An index of Shanghai-listed developers and a Bloomberg gauge of Chinese real estate firms have both climbed more than 10% during that period.
Bets are mounting that China’s policy makers will deploy more stimulus to shore up growth before President Xi Jinping seeks to secure a third term before year-end. A weak services sector report on Wednesday highlighted the risks for the world’s second-largest economy, with holiday spending figures pointing to more damage ahead amid widespread Covid curbs.
“We’ve seen and quelled such outbreaks so many times before and have plenty of experience, it’s only a matter of time once the nation sets its mind on it,” said Chen Shi, a fund manager at Shanghai Jade Stone Investment Management Co. “Looking in retrospect to 2020, the largest returns in stocks came in tandem with the period of the greatest uncertainties over the virus in the first two quarters.” 
Chen, who has been confined to his compound for more than 20 days, expects policy loosening to translate into better valuations even if earnings are impacted. The wider range of treatment options, more extensive testing and a lower fatality rate indicate that the outbreak can be contained, he said.
The domestic optimism contrasts with growing concerns from market participants elsewhere over China’s worsening outbreak. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) slashed their target for the CSI 300 Index by 16% last week, citing risk factors such as property defaults and city-wide lockdowns, according to a research note.
In terms of stimulus, the Chinese authorities have a variety of tools at their disposal, including cutting rates and taking steps to boost the property sector. Officials will use monetary policy tools at an “appropriate time” and consider other measures to boost consumption, according to the readout from a meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.
China Vows to Use Monetary Policy Tools at Appropriate Time (2)
Beijing loosened home-buying rules in more than 60 municipalities in the first quarter, abandoning restrictions on the number of residences households can own to stimulate demand. 
Hopeful investors may be waiting for a repeat of the dramatic rebound in 2020, when the CSI 300 Index gained nearly 40% in the four months between a low in March - when Wuhan was still in lockdown - and July, when daily cases had dwindled to the single digits.
“There has to be loosening at this rate, and hopes are mostly around more relaxation for the property sector, as it’s the most important part of the economy,” said He Qi, fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management. 
“There are long-term goals for property, then there are imminent emergencies, and the task now is first to make it through this.”

(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed on Wednesday that it has purchased nearly 121 million shares of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the latest in a series of large investments by the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett.
The investment gives Berkshire a roughly 11.4% stake in HP, worth about $4.2 billion based on the personal computing and printing company's closing stock price on Wednesday of $34.91.
Shares of HP rose 9.9% to $38.38 in after-hours trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
HP, based in Palo Alto, California, had about 1.06 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31.
Neither HP nor Berkshire immediately responded to requests for comment.
The HP stake is Berkshire's third big investment since Feb. 26, when Buffett said in his annual shareholders letter that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and little ""excites us"" in equity markets.
On March 21, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion in cash, adding to its portfolio of insurers including Geico.
Earlier in March, Berkshire revealed a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), which cost well over $6 billion to amass.
Before announcing the Alleghany purchase, Buffett had gone six years without a major acquisition, leaving Berkshire with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Buffett has pledged to keep at least $30 billion of cash on hand.
Berkshire did not say whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are responsible for the HP stake, though Buffett normally handles larger investments.

Buffett is chiefly responsible for Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), calling the iPhone maker one of the ""Big Four"" companies accounting for much of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's value.
The other ""Big Four"" companies are Berkshire's insurers, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Energy.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 08:05PM ET</span>",Factbox: How Western sanctions target Russia,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The West's punishment of Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine ramped up this week following the discovery of civilians shot dead at close range in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, seized from Russian forces. 
Below are details on Western sanctions so far:
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS
The U.S. imposed ""full blocking sanctions"" on Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfabank, the country's fourth largest financial institution. That means U.S. persons cannot do business with the lenders, while any of their assets that touch the U.S financial system are frozen.
Britain also on Wednesday froze Sberbank's assets.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday was set to sign an executive order prohibiting new investment in Russia by U.S. persons, which includes a ban on venture capital and mergers, U.S. officials said. 
Previous sanctions by the U.S., Britain and other Western allies in the days following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which it calls ""a special military operation,"" kicked the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of those countries, although some activities were allowed to continue. 
U.S. banks were required to sever correspondent banking ties, which allow banks to make payments between one another, with Sberbank. Russian lenders VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank, were also subject to full blocking sanctions. 
European Union sanctions hit 70% of the Russian banking system.
INDIVIDUALS
The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's wife and daughter, and senior members of Russia's security council.
Separately, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday said it charged Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev with violating existing sanctions, saying he provided financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea.
The U.S. government on Feb. 25 joined European countries in slapping sanctions on Putin and Lavrov.
More than 100 Russian elites, including members of Putin's inner circle, members of the Russian parliament, and Russian executives and businessmen, have been sanctioned since Feb. 24 by Western nations.
SWIFT BAR 
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada in February and March blocked certain Russian lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system, preventing the lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide.
The move also placed restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves, the nations said in a joint statement.
SWIFT is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS 
This week, the United States stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at U.S. banks. 
Under earlier sanctions, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. lenders were frozen, but the Treasury had allowed Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis. On Monday, Washington decided to cut off Moscow's access to the funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson.
In late February, Britain, the European Union and the United States put new restrictions on dealing in Russian sovereign debt. 
Britain announced a ban on Russian sovereign debt sales in London, the European Union banned EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds, and U.S. investors, who were already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly, were banned from purchasing it in the secondary market from March 1.
ENERGY 
U.S. President Biden on March 8 imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022.
Berlin on Feb. 22 halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany. The following day the United States imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building the pipeline.
The United States and the EU already had sanctions in place following Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea on Russia's energy and defense sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
CURBING TECHNOLOGY
Sanctions proposed by the European Union on Tuesday, which the bloc's 27 member states must approve, would bar Russian imports worth 9 billion euros ($9.8 billion) and exports to Russia worth 10 billion euros, including semiconductors and computers, and stop Russian ships entering EU ports.
The EU earlier vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software. 

The U.S. Commerce Department imposed export controls that severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities. 
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former McKinsey & Co partner who helped advise  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on its recent purchase of fintech lender GreenSky Inc was sentenced on Wednesday to two years in prison for insider trading on the takeover. The defendant, Puneet Dikshit, 41, had pleaded guilty in December to a securities fraud charge.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon, who imposed the sentence in federal court in Manhattan, also ordered Dikshit to forfeit $455,017, representing his illegal profit. 
Dikshit admitted that he bought GreenSky call options, a bet that the company's stock price would rise, shortly before the $2.24 billion merger was announced on Sept. 15, 2021, and said he was ""profoundly sorry.""
Prosecutors said the Manhattan resident purchased his 2,500 call options without receiving pre-clearance from McKinsey, and sold them soon after the merger was announced. 
Dikshit had led McKinsey's unsecured lending practice in North America and been a lead partner advising Goldman, prosecutors said.
The married father of two young children will be deported after serving his sentence. A native of India, Dikshit had lived in the United States for more than a decade.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 07:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street ends lower after Fed minutes,"By Lewis Krauskopf, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Praveen Paramasivam
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday, with steep declines in tech and other growth stocks, after minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting sharpened investors' focus on the U.S. central bank's plans to fight inflation.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq logged a decline of over 2% for a second straight day.
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting showed policymakers rallying around plans to cut the central bank's massive balance sheet as soon as next month.
Wall Street's main indexes already had been solidly lower ahead of the minutes' release, building on declines from a day earlier when Fed Governor Lael Brainard's comments raised concerns about more aggressive Fed action to fight inflation.
""The Fed is determined to rein in inflation, and we just hope and pray that there will there will be a soft landing of the economy and not a hard landing that sends us into a recession,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 144.67 points, or 0.42%, to 34,496.51, the S&P 500 lost 43.97 points, or 0.97%, to 4,481.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 315.35 points, or 2.22%, to 13,888.82. 
The technology and consumer discretionary sectors both fell about 2.6%, while the S&P 500 growth index dropped about 2%. 
Defensive sectors gained, led by a 2% rise for utilities and a 1.6% increase for healthcare and real estate.
Wall Street's indexes already had been down sharply for a second straight day before the closely watched minutes, as investors continued to digest Brainard's remarks from Tuesday.
Brainard said she expected a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.
""She is one of the more dovish members of the FOMC and so for her to come out as aggressively in stamping out inflation pressures with really more aggressive rate tightening and policies, I think that took the market off guard a little bit and I think you are seeing that continue today,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise.
The prospect of a more hawkish Fed led to a rocky start to the year for equities, and in particular tech and growth shares whose valuations are more vulnerable to higher bond yields. The Ukraine crisis has added to concerns, particularly about worsening inflation as commodity prices spike.
In company news, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) shares fell 8.7% as it mounted a vigorous defense of its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid to acquire ultra-low-cost carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE).
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.56-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 202 new lows.
About 12.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 13 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 07:15PM ET</span>",Explainer: How is Japan's government connected with Russia's biggest cigarette maker?,"By Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government has severed banking and trade ties with Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but a tobacco company in which it owns a one-third stake is still operating there and churning out Winston and Camel brand cigarettes. The government's inaction on  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) Inc's puts the administration in an awkward position as it steps up sanctions. 
Here's what's at stake:
WHY IS RUSSIA SO IMPORTANT TO JAPAN TOBACCO?
Japan's population is shrinking, and domestic smoking rates are declining, making revenue overseas increasingly important for Japan Tobacco (JT).
Russia, the world's fourth-biggest tobacco market, is JT's biggest overseas market, generating an estimated 12% of group revenue and 20% of operating profit. JT has the largest market share in Russia at almost 40%, with 4,000 employees in four factories, producing brands including Winston, Camel, and Mevius, formerly known as Mild Seven.
HOW HAS JT REACTED TO RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE?
JT said soon after the invasion that it had halted production at its factory in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, saying at the time that its 900 employees were safe.
Last month, the company said its Russian subsidiary would suspend investment, marketing, and the launch of a heated tobacco product. But it said manufacturing would continue, although those activities could be suspended amid ""unprecedented"" challenges.
Other Japanese companies are taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach as well. Trading houses Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp are holding on to stakes in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia, from which Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc has announced plans to exit.
WHY IS THIS A POLITICAL HOT POTATO FOR THE GOVERNMENT?
Japan has joined with Group of Seven economies in a steady escalation of sanctions to try to pressure Russia to end hostilities.
But its stance has come in for criticism; on the one hand it says it stands by Ukraine, but on the other hand it controls a major company doing business in Russia and reaps a large portion of the profits of that enterprise.
JT is one of Russia's biggest individual tax payers, accounting for 1.4% of the nation's total budget revenue in 2020, the company's website says.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INVESTORS?
JT's shares have sunk more than 5% since Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, as business prospects in the region darken. The benchmark Nikkei index has gained 5%.
The company's shares have lagged the broader market's performance for the last five years, but remain popular among investors for their ample dividends. JT pays out about 75% of profits compared to an average 30% among other Japanese companies. That provides about 100 billion yen ($815 million) to the Japanese government each year, based on Reuters estimates over the past three years.
WHAT NEXT?
JT is the third-biggest tobacco seller in the world and some analysts believe it will have to exit Russia eventually as other major brands pull out. Rivals British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) and Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) have announced their intention to exit the country.
Such a decision doesn't come without risk though. The company could face huge losses if Russia decides to seize its assets, so a less risky option would be to sell its assets to a Russian partner.
Even if JT stays on, trade sanctions could interrupt its business, especially if it isn't able to import tobacco leaves.
WHY IS JAPAN IN THE TOBACCO BUSINESS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

JT is a legacy company from Japan's history of government-controlled monopolies in tobacco and salt. The company operates a museum in Tokyo dedicated to the history of those commodities in Japan.
JT in its current form was founded in 1985, and while the government has reduced its stake over time, the Ministry of Finance is mandated to hold at least one-third of its shares in a business that the government sees as important for fiscal revenues and the wider economy.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 07:06PM ET</span>",White House warns of 'escalating vulnerabilities' to U.S. from semiconductor shortage,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House held a classified briefing on Wednesday with some U.S. lawmakers on the dire risks to the American economy from semiconductor supply chain issues as it pushes Congress for $52 billion in funding to subsidize production. 
White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told reporters ""the best estimates are the lack of available semiconductors probably took a full percentage point off of GDP in 2021.""
The briefing included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to ""discuss the urgent need to invest in made-in-America semiconductors as well as research and development that will protect our economic and national security,"" the White House said. 
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production. There have been growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors.
""A significant interruption to our supply of semiconductors could cause historic damage to the U.S. economy – damage far greater than the impact of chips shortages on the American auto industry right now – and would undercut our technological competitiveness and military advantages over adversaries globally,"" the White House said.
The White House has been pushing Congress to approve U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing after months of discussions.
The Senate first passed $52 billion in chips funding in June that also authorized $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China, while the House of Representatives passed its version in early February. Deese said he hopes both the Senate and House will appoint negotiators this week to ""quickly"" begin a formal process to finalize a compromise bill.
""The risks are profound,"" Deese said of what would the U.S. economy face with a severe disruption. Deese cited ""economic moves by key competitors - most notably China around the escalating vulnerabilities we have from the semiconductor issue.""
A Commerce Department analysis that was prepared for the briefing seen by Reuters noted semiconductor fabs take years to construct.
""There is no quick fix in the face of emergency,"" it said, adding private sector investment in U.S. chips production is not enough and ""will not be sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the current U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities.""

The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
The Biden administration notes the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips in 1990 while today it accounts for only 12% of global production.

735,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 06:52PM ET</span>",Biden signs U.S. Postal Service financial reform bill,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation to provide the U.S. Postal Service with about $50 billion in financial relief over a decade, paving the way for future reforms as the service aims to overturn years in the red.
Struggling with diminishing mail volumes despite having to deliver to a growing number of addresses, USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. In February, it booked a quarterly net loss of $1.5 billion.
""The Postal Service is central to our economy and central to rural America,"" Biden said at a White House ceremony.
The new bill enacts some measures proposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in a March 2021 reform plan that aims to eliminate $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade.
In particular, it eliminates a requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a condition faced by no other business or federal entity, saving $27 billion over a decade. Future postal retirees must now enroll in government health insurance, a move that will save it $22.6 billion over 10 years.
On the day of the signing, USPS filed notice with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to raise prices of first-class mail stamps from 58 cents to 60 cents and raise First-Class Mail prices approximately 6.5%.
Asked in an interview why USPS was seeking the price hike, DeJoy was blunt: ""Because we need money.""
Even after the legislative changes and PRC pricing changes approved in 2021, USPS still needs to cut more red ink, he said, speaking after the White House event.
""I've still got about $80, $90 billion to do and we have a lot of plans to keep moving that forward,"" DeJoy said. ""Now it's really about improving our service, reducing our cost from waste, investing in our facilities and employees and growing our business.""
Biden last month also proposed $5 billion for USPS to handle election mail over the next decade. His predecessor Donald Trump criticized voting by mail that was used by a record 46% of 2020 voters.
""The Postal Service delivers democracy,"" Biden said on Wednesday.

Still, the postal service has faced criticism from the White House and Democrats in Congress over a decision to buy mostly fossil fuel powered vehicles for its next-generation delivery fleet from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense.
USPS ""needs to do more to modernize and electrify its fleet of vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to save money,"" Biden said.

The move, which is reported to be in its early stages, comes as Meta grows its focus on services centered around the metaverse, a virtual environment where people interact, work and play.
If implemented, it could also give Meta a new revenue channel and control over transactions in its suite of apps and services, which include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, WhatsApp and the Meta Quest virtual reality platform.
Meta's cryptocurrencies, internally dubbed ""Zuck Bucks"", are intended for the metaverse and may not be based on blockchain, the FT report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Meta could introduce in-app tokens that would be centrally controlled by the company, the report said, and such tokens could be used to pay favorite creators on Instagram or reward people who make meaningful contributions in Facebook groups.
""We have no updates to share today,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that the company is focused on building for the metaverse ""and that includes what payments and financial services might look like.""

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, said last month that Instagram will introduce non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the ""near-term"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackBerry Ltd plans to settle a more than eight-year-old lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by inflating the success and profitability of its long-discontinued BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) 10 smartphones.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court granted a Wednesday request by lawyers for BlackBerry and the shareholders to adjourn their planned trial so they could negotiate a preliminary settlement in the class action.
Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Thursday. Any settlement would require the judge's approval.
Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. BlackBerry and its law firm did not immediately respond to similar requests.
While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, it never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones.
This led to BlackBerry's 2016 decision to stop making phones. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company now focuses on cybersecurity.
Shareholders accused BlackBerry of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.
The lawsuit began in October 2013. Other defendants include Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, former Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka and former Chief Legal Officer Steve Zipperstein.
Lawsuits accusing companies of misleading shareholders are common in the United States, but few go to trial.

From 1997 to 2021, less than 1% of federal securities class actions went to trial, while most were settled or dismissed, according to Cornerstone Research.
The case is Pearlstein v BlackBerry Ltd, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07060.

MILAN (Reuters) -Atlantia found itself at the centre of a potential bidding war on Wednesday between Spanish tycoon Florentino Perez and the Benettons, the Italian infrastructure group's main investor.
Perez's construction company ACS said it was interested in buying Atlantia's motorway concessions business, teaming up with two investment funds.
But Italy's Benetton family, investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and other long-time investors such as Italian banking foundation CRT were studying a counter-move to buy the whole infrastructure company and shield it from the attack led by the Spanish billionaire, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Atlantia has just finalised a deal to sell its controlling stake in Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia and will pocket 8 billion euros by end-June from a consortium led by Italy's state lender CDP.
""The Benettons are united to shield the group and may decide to delist it to protect the cash due to arrive from Autostrade deal,"" one of the sources said. 
In a statement after the market close, ACS said it has an exclusive agreement with two investment funds, GIP and Brookfield, for the potential acquisition of a majority stake in the motorway concession business of the Italian infrastructure company.
""No decision has been taken to date"", ACS said in the statement where it did not clarify if it has discussed the eventual offer with Atlantia's board or main shareholders, the Benetton family.
""Atlantia is and will remain a strategic long-term asset for Benetton Holding Edizione"", a source close to the Benetton family told Reuters. 
Earlier on Wednesday, shares in Atlantia surged almost 9% after a Bloomberg News report that Spanish tycoon Perez was weighing an offer for the Italian roads and airports group.
Any bid for Atlantia, which has a market capitalisation of more than 15 billion euros ($16.4 billion), would need the backing of Edizione, the holding company of the Benetton family, which recently increased its stake in the group to 33%. 
Atlantia was not immediately available for comment.
Alessandro Benetton was appointed chairman of Edizione this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments, including at Atlantia. Edizione said at the time it deemed its investment in Atlantia strategic.
EXISTING TIES
Perez, the president of Real Madrid soccer club, and the Benettons are already linked through their joint ownership of Spanish highway operator Abertis.
Perez's ACS, which itself has a market capitalisation of 7.2 billion euros, has been Atlantia's partner in Abertis since the two groups' joint acquisition of the company in 2017.
As well as motorways, Atlantia also operates airports in Rome and southern France and is investing in technology to help regulate traffic flows.

Through ACS, Perez previously pursued a bid for Atlantia's Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia but did not manage to secure the backing of the Italian government to go ahead with a binding offer. 
Atlantia eventually sold the unit, the focal point of a dispute with the government following a deadly collapse of a bridge in 2018, to Italian state lender CDP and allies. Following the divestment, Atlantia kept highway assets in Spain, France and Latin America. ($1 = 0.9168 euros)

The first ads will air on Thursday during Major League Baseball's opening-day games, following Monday's resumption of Bolt production at its plant in Orion Township, Michigan. 
Bolt could finish with the second highest media spend this year for Chevy behind the Silverado pickup, Chevy marketing director Steven Majoros said on a conference call, without disclosing detailed spending plans. GM spent $3.3 billion on advertising and promotions last year.
The Bolt ads shown to reporters on the call did not address the recall, which Majoros said had not damaged GM's reputation.
He forecast record sales for Bolt this year and even more in 2023, topping the previous high of 23,300.
GM had previously stopped sales and widened its recall to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules after a series of fires in parked vehicles. It said in August it had recalled all Bolt vehicles built since production began in 2017.
The Detroit automaker had conducted two weeks of limited production at Orion in November to provide courtesy transportation vehicles for customers during recall repairs.
U.S. safety regulators said they had reviewed reports of 24 Bolt fires, while GM previously said it suspected 18 fires were linked to the battery issue. 
GM previously said its deal with LG Electronics and LG Chem, which owns GM's battery partner LG energy Solution, allowed it to offset most of the estimated $2 billion in recall costs.

On Tuesday, U.S. safety regulators said they had opened a review to ensure all defective batteries produced by LG Energy Solution had been recalled by automakers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated two new commissioners to serve at the nation's securities regulator in a move that will help the agency regain its full strength amid vacancies. 
The two Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hopefuls would first need to be confirmed in the Senate before they can assume office.
Jaime Lizárraga has been nominated to fill a Democratic seat currently occupied by commissioner Allison Lee, who has said she plans to leave the agency once a successor is in place.
Mark Uyeda, an SEC staffer who has been temporarily on detail to the Senate Banking Committee, has been tapped to replace a January vacancy created by former Republican commissioner Elad Roisman.
Biden's nominations of the new SEC officials would bring the five-member commission to a full voting capacity and Democrats would maintain an even larger majority. 

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, applauded the selection of Lizarraga. ""As Commissioner, Jaime will be a force in safeguarding the interests of the investing public, improving transparency in our financial markets and building a more equitable financial future for all,"" she said.
U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, said of Uyeda: ""Having personally worked with Mark during his time as SEC attorney detailed to the Senate Banking Committee, I know first hand that Mark's depth of knowledge on securities and markets is unrivaled.""

748,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 05:03PM ET</span>",Volatility surge causes liquidity strain in rate options market as Fed tightens,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in hedging to protect against aggressive Federal Reserve tightening has caused liquidity problems in the interest rate options sector, reflecting a trend that has been going on in some parts of the bond market. 
Strong demand has hoisted volatility on so-called swaptions, or options on interest rate swaps, which give the buyer the right to enter into a contract in the future at a pre-determined price. Swaptions are one segment of the roughly $490 trillion over-the-counter interest rate derivatives market.
Volatility or ""vol"" is a key measure of how much risk is perceived, and is a major input in the price of an option. Demand for options for hedging or speculation tends to lift vol and the higher the vol, the greater the perceived uncertainty over a given time frame. 
In rate markets, swaps, a gauge of the cost of exchanging fixed-rate cash flows for floating-rate ones over a specific period, are often used by investors to bet on where Fed policy rates are headed.
The surge in hedging in the swaptions market has come from fixed-income investors and equity portfolio managers who would normally not hedge using rate options, market participants said. They have been doing so in the last few months since the Fed shifted its stance on inflation and telegraphed that it would soon start tightening, which it did for the first time in 3-1/2 years last month.
Analysts said the appetite for rate options increased further after Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the National Association for Business Economics on March 21 that the Fed must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched.
""Equity managers understood very well the risks of a tighter Fed and tighter financial conditions to portfolios and found a decent hedge in the rates vol space,"" said Bruno Braizinha, director, U.S. rates strategy, at BoFA Securities in New York.
""Not only did equity guys buy vol, they bought directional vol. That created a bit of a one-way market - you have rates clients buying that vol and you have equity clients buying that vol as well,"" he added, which he said caused liquidity issues.
Liquidity has also been an issue in the U.S. Treasuries market, with the spike in yields.
In an illiquid market, the bid-offer spreads on options widen because dealers need to take into account the difficulty in hedging a position.
Traders said investors bought ""payer swaptions"" involving U.S. one-year and two-year swap rates, with expiries from anywhere between six months to two years.
Payer swaptions give the buyer the right to enter into an interest rate swap where the buyer pays fixed rate and receives a floating rate. The buyer therefore benefits if rates rise.
Normalized volatility on shorter-dated swaptions such as one-year at-the-money options on one-year swap rates, that part of the curve in which Fed policy is being priced, soared to 145 basis points on Tuesday, from 110 basis points at the start of March. 
In late March, normalized vol hit 152 basis points, the highest since at least February 2013, according to Refinitiv data. Since Powell's hawkish speech on March 21, vol on one-year swap rates surged about 17 basis points.
""Liquidity tends to be poor when volatility is high,"" said Amrut Nashikkar, managing director and senior rates strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""But then, there's also some contribution the other way, where illiquid markets cause volatility."" (Graphic: Swaption volatility - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxojgmnpx/image-1649216195437.png) 
VOLATILITY SURROUNDING FED'S TERMINAL RATE
That volatility reflects how investors view uncertainty around the Fed's terminal rate, or the peak of the U.S. central bank's rate-hike cycle.
The U.S swaps forward market sees the terminal rate hitting between April 2023 and April 2024 at roughly 3%, based on the one-year and two-year forwards of one-year swap rates, analysts said..
The 145 basis-point volatility on one-year at-the-money options suggested that the terminal rate could hit 3% sometime in the fourth quarter of 2023, but that rate could land at either 1.5% or 4.5%. 
""That's a huge gap to navigate and lot of uncertainty as to where the Fed is going to land over the next year,"" said BoFA's Braizinha, which he said therefore creates the need for protection.
The spike in volatility, though, benefited asset managers like pension funds who bought options for risk management purposes during the pandemic when vol was subdued and premiums were low, as the Fed cut rates to zero. 

""Real money bought a lot of upside protection in the last two years when vol was much, much lower,"" said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Philadelphia.
""They were buying for hedging purposes. But now, it's like they bought lottery tickets and won the lottery.""

Our initial program, HIL-214, is a virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine candidate for the prevention of moderate-to-severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by norovirus infection. It is estimated that norovirus causes nearly 700 million cases of illness and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide per year, as well as significant additional economic and social burden. To date, HIL-214 has been studied in nine clinical trials conducted by Takeda Vaccines, Inc. (Takeda) and its predecessor, LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 04:55PM ET</span>",AI is explaining itself to humans. And it's paying off,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn boosted subscription revenue by 8% after arming its sales team with artificial intelligence software that not only predicts clients at risk of canceling, but also explains how it arrived at its conclusion.
The system, introduced last July and described in a LinkedIn blog post https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/the-journey-to-build-an-explainable-ai-driven-recommendation-sys on Wednesday, marks a breakthrough in getting AI to ""show its work"" in a helpful way.
While AI scientists have no problem designing systems that make accurate predictions on all sorts of business outcomes, they are discovering that to make those tools more effective for human operators, the AI may need to explain itself through another algorithm.
The emerging field of “Explainable AI,” or XAI, has spurred big investment in Silicon Valley as startups and cloud giants compete to make opaque software more understandable and has stoked discussion in Washington and Brussels where regulators want to ensure automated decision-making is done fairly and transparently. 
AI technology can perpetuate societal biases like those around race, gender and culture. Some AI scientists view explanations as a crucial part of mitigating those problematic outcomes.
U.S. consumer protection regulators including the Federal Trade Commission have warned over the last two years that AI that is not explainable could be investigated. The EU next year could pass the Artificial Intelligence Act, a set of comprehensive requirements including that users be able to interpret automated predictions.
Proponents of explainable AI say it has helped increase the effectiveness of AI’s application in fields such as healthcare and sales. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud sells explainable AI services that, for instance, tell clients trying to sharpen their systems which pixels and soon which training examples mattered most in predicting the subject of a photo.
But critics say the explanations of why AI predicted what it did are too unreliable because the AI technology to interpret the machines is not good enough.
LinkedIn and others developing explainable AI acknowledge that each step in the process - analyzing predictions, generating explanations, confirming their accuracy and making them actionable for users - still has room for improvement.
But after two years of trial and error in a relatively low-stakes application, LinkedIn says its technology has yielded practical value. Its proof is the 8% increase in renewal bookings during the current fiscal year above normally expected growth. LinkedIn declined to specify the benefit in dollars, but described it as sizeable. 
Before, LinkedIn salespeople relied on their own intuition and some spotty automated alerts about clients' adoption of services.
Now, the AI quickly handles research and analysis. Dubbed CrystalCandle by LinkedIn, it calls out unnoticed trends and its reasoning helps salespeople hone their tactics to keep at-risk customers on board and pitch others on upgrades. 
LinkedIn says explanation-based recommendations have expanded to more than 5,000 of its sales employees spanning recruiting, advertising, marketing and education offerings.
""It has helped experienced salespeople by arming them with specific insights to navigate conversations with prospects. It’s also helped new salespeople dive in right away,"" said Parvez Ahammad, LinkedIn's director of machine learning and head of data science applied research.
TO EXPLAIN OR NOT TO EXPLAIN?
In 2020, LinkedIn had first provided predictions without explanations. A score with about 80% accuracy indicates the likelihood a client soon due for renewal will upgrade, hold steady or cancel. 
Salespeople were not fully won over. The team selling LinkedIn's Talent Solutions recruiting and hiring software were unclear on how to adapt their strategy, especially when the odds of a client not renewing were no better than a coin toss.
Last July, they started seeing a short, auto-generated paragraph that highlights the factors influencing the score.
For instance, the AI decided a customer was likely to upgrade because it grew by 240 workers over the past year and candidates had become 146% more responsive in the last month. 
In addition, an index that measures a client's overall success with LinkedIn recruiting tools surged 25% in the last three months.
Lekha Doshi, LinkedIn's vice president of global operations, said that based on the explanations sales representatives now direct clients to training, support and services that improve their experience and keep them spending.
But some AI experts question whether explanations are necessary. They could even do harm, engendering a false sense of security in AI or prompting design sacrifices that make predictions less accurate, researchers say.
Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said people use products such as Tylenol and Google Maps whose inner workings are not neatly understood. In such cases, rigorous testing and monitoring have dispelled most doubts about their efficacy.
Similarly, AI systems overall could be deemed fair even if individual decisions are inscrutable, said Daniel Roy, an associate professor of statistics at University of Toronto.
LinkedIn says an algorithm's integrity cannot be evaluated without understanding its thinking. 
It also maintains that tools like its CrystalCandle could help AI users in other fields. Doctors could learn why AI predicts someone is more at risk of a disease, or people could be told why AI recommended they be denied a credit card. 

The hope is that explanations reveal whether a system aligns with concepts and values one wants to promote, said Been Kim, an AI researcher at Google.
""I view interpretability as ultimately enabling a conversation between machines and humans,"" she said.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 04:47PM ET</span>",Rare vaccine-related blood clots tied to gene; concentrated antibodies may help the immunosuppressed,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Vaccine-related blood clots tied to gene, antibody variants
New research may help shed light on a rare but serious blood-clotting problem associated with the COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). 
Five unrelated people with this clotting complication, known as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, all had unusually-structured antibodies against a protein called PF4 that is involved in blood clotting, the researchers found. Furthermore, all five had a specific version of a gene responsible for producing these antibodies, they reported on Monday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.22272975v1 ahead of peer review. ""The combination of a variant in a gene and the evolution of this antibody towards targeting in a highly deleterious manner the PF4 protein... leads to this disastrous complication,"" the researchers said. The prevalence of this gene varies and is highest in people of European descent, according to the report.
The finding ""paves the way for a potential genetic screening tool to identify patients carrying this gene variant who are at risk of this severe complication"" after receipt of these vaccines, said Tom Gordon and Jing Jing Wang of Flinders University of South Australia, two of the study's authors. ""Additionally, this provides a unique opportunity for targeted, specific therapy development aimed at neutralizing this highly damaging but very specific antibody.""
Concentrated antibodies may help immunosuppressed patients
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are severely immunocompromised may benefit from treatment with a purified, highly-concentrated form of antibody-rich blood plasma from previously infected people known as hyperimmune globulin, according to a small trial.
Netherlands-based researchers measured the need for mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, readmission for COVID-19 after hospital discharge or lack of clinical improvement among 18 subjects four weeks after administration of either SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin or immune globulin that did not contain antibodies to the coronavirus. These adverse outcomes occurred in 20% of patients who received the hyperimmune globulin with COVID-19 antibodies, compared to 88% of those who did not, according to a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.04.22273314v1 ahead of peer review. The trial participants were organ transplant patients taking strong immunosuppressive drugs and others with diseases or medication regimens that impaired the function of immune cells called B cells.
In severely immunocompromised patients, SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin ""may reduce the risk for severe COVID-19 and can be used when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available,"" the researchers concluded.
Glasses wearers may have lower COVID-19 risk
People who regularly wear glasses have a moderately lower risk of contracting COVID-19 while contact lenses offered no added protection, according to a large study that highlights the importance of the eye as a route of coronavirus infection.
More than 19,000 participants in the Virus Watch study in England and Wales responded to a questionnaire on the use of glasses and contact lenses. Starting as early as June 2020, participants had been reporting weekly on their COVID-19 status, and more than 11,000 provided monthly blood samples to show whether or not they had been infected with the coronavirus. After taking other risk factors into account, the researchers found a 15% lower risk of infection for those who reported wearing glasses always for general use compared to those who never wore glasses. The protective effect was reduced in those who said their glasses interfered with mask wearing, and there was no protective effect seen for contact lens wearers, according to a report posted on Monday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.29.22272997v1 ahead of peer review.

""Protective eye wear should be considered as part of broader strategies to prevent community transmission of infection and may be valuable to consider in the event of future pandemics and in high exposure occupations including healthcare,"" the researchers said.

The federal regulator's enforcement division has asked for emails and communications from several senior Amazon executives, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the report.
Amazon has been repeatedly accused of knocking off products it sells on its website and of exploiting its vast trove of internal data to promote its own merchandise at the expense of other sellers. The company has denied the allegations.

Following a series of media reports in 2020, Amazon launched an internal investigation to review whether its employees used sellers' data to promote Amazon's private-label business. 
The company, however, declined to provide the findings to a congressional committee that earlier investigated the e-commerce major and other technology companies, according to the report.

Investing.com -- The Dow slipped Wednesday, as tech was pressured by rising Treasury yields after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting signaled that central bank members were in favor of stepping up the pace of the monetary policy tightening next month.
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.42%, or 144 points, the S&P 500 fell 1%, and the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.
The Fed is “well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May,"" the Fed minutes showed on Wednesday.
Under the plan, the Fed would allow about $60 billion in Treasury securities and about $35 billion in agency MBS to roll off its balance sheet, which current stands at nearly $9 trillion.
Fed members also discussed the prospect of 50-basis-point rate hikes at one or more up coming meetings, but this was less hawkish than market expectations of 50 basis points at most meetings. 
""The commentary from the minutes on the 50 basis points hikes was maybe a little less hawkish because we had seen the market price in 50 basis point at several of the meetings or most of the meetings for the rest of the year, but they [Fed members] only discussed one or more 50 basis hikes,"" John Luke Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday. 
""I think that also maybe led to a little bit of softness in the front end of the yield curve,"" Tyner added. 
The 10-year yield topped 2.6% to surged to more than three-year highs, while the 2-year yield, which is more sensative to rate hikes, cut gains to end the day lower.  
Growth sectors of the market like tech, which are less attractive in periods of rising rates and inflation, continued to creep lower, pressuring the broader market.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) led big tech lower, down more than 3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell more than 1%.
Chip stocks also struggled, pressured by a nearly 6% slump in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and weakness in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).
Intel fell 1%, however, after the chipmaker said it would end or scale back operations in Russia following the latter's invasion of Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. workers and labor groups filed 57% more petitions to be represented by unions in the last six months as high-profile organizing campaigns at  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other companies have taken off.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) received 1,174 such requests during the first half of its fiscal year 2022, from Oct. 1 through March 31, versus 748 during the first half of fiscal 2021, it said on Wednesday.
If that pace continues for the full year, it would be the highest annual total in at least the last 10 years.
""There is a surge in labor activity nationwide,"" said NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo in a statement.
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. Starbucks locations have asked the NLRB for union elections since August, with at least 10 locations voting in favor of the Workers United union.
And after employees won a vote to form a union at an Amazon warehouse in New York's Staten Island on Friday, workers at 50 more locations across the country contacted organizers.

Once employees petition the NLRB for an election, eligible workers can vote on whether they want to join the union. 
Abruzzo said Congress needed to provide the agency with more staff and funding to handle the growing case loads, which also include an increase in unfair labor practice charges and other filings.

After highlighting a government task force on worker organization he launched a year ago “to make sure the choice to join a union belongs to workers alone,” Biden called out the online retail giant, whose own workers at a New York City warehouse voted last week to unionize.
“And by the way, by the way, Amazon here we come. Watch. Watch,” he said during a speech to the North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) Legislative Conference.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. 
Widely considered the most pro-union president in decades, Biden has swiftly ousted government officials deemed by unions to be hostile to labor and reversed rules of past President Donald Trump that critics said weakened worker protections.
Asked at a briefing with reporters whether Biden was endorsing unionization at Amazon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said he was not sending a message that he or the U.S. government would get involved directly in such efforts.
""What he was conveying is his long-time support for collective bargaining, for the rights of workers to organize, and their decision to do exactly that in this case,"" she said. 
Last week some 55% of workers at a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to form the first U.S. union at Amazon, America's second-largest private employer, building on recent grassroots successes by labor activists pushing into new industries. 
Amazon has said it may file objections, due on Friday, before the election outcome is certified.

Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) locations have likewise voted to unionize as well.
Biden's task force, which includes more than 20 heads of agencies and Cabinet officials such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, seeks to help reverse decades of declining union membership and power, labor experts said.

Investing.com – Stocks anticipated more aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve as early as May, sending them into a tumble before recovering ground late in the afternoon.
The Fed signaled in its minutes on Wednesday that it was prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the economy to damp inflation. That includes acting to pare down its balance sheet of bonds more quickly than originally anticipated.
The central bank next meets in May, after it has the chance to see another set of jobs and inflation data for the month of April. With Russia’s war on Ukraine throwing uncertainty into the mix, and volatile energy prices, investors will be closely scrutinizing the earnings reports that start rolling out next week from major U.S. companies.
In the meantime, data on jobless claims comes out on Thursday, with the recent trend showing a drop in joblessness not seen since the late 1960s.
The Senate is expected to vote on President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, this week before Congress sets off on a two week Easter holiday. Also pending on Capitol Hill is a $10 billion spending package for Biden’s Covid planning efforts.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Spirits earnings
Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) will report earnings before the opening bell on Thursday. The international beverage and alcohol company beat earnings and revenue forecasts in its previous report, and tomorrow, it will be hoping for a repeat. Analysts polled by Investing.com predict Constellation will report {{erl-8034||earnings per share} }of $2.10 on revenue of $2.02 billion.
2. ConAgra earnings
ConAgra Foods Inc (NYSE:CAG) will also release earnings for the latest quarter before the bell on Thursday.

Investing.com --  Frontier Group Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:ULCC) said it remains ""committed"" to its combination with  Spirit Airlines  Inc (NYSE:SAVE) after news broke yesterday evening that JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) had made an alternative bid for the carrier. 
In February, Spirit and Frontier announced a combination that would have seen Spirit shareholders receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each existing Spirit share they own.
However, with JetBlue making a bid for Spirit, that move could be scuppered. 
Nevertheless, Frontier remains focused on the merger. In a regulatory filing, the company disclosed a letter sent to employees which said they are confident the proposed transaction ""is in the best interest of consumers and team Frontier.""
""Together we would create America's most competitive airline, offering more ultra-low fares to more travelers in more destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Nothing changes today as a result of this news,"" the letter read.
The company added that the agreement remains in place, but the next steps will see Spirit and Frontier's board of directors review the proposal from JetBlue. "

In letters sent to the chief executives of four of the biggest U.S. consumer banks, James said the majority of overdraft fees are levied on ""the most vulnerable consumers with the lowest average account balances.""
James's letters come as banks are facing increased scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for charging overdraft and other fees on consumers.
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the federal consumer watchdog, launched a campaign earlier this year to address what it calls ""junk fees,"" a catch-all for overdraft, credit card late payment fees, mortgage closing costs and other charges.
The banking industry earned $17 billion in overdraft fee revenue in 2019, according to a report commissioned by the industry group the Consumer Bankers Association. 
In January, the CFPB issued a request for public input on whether banks and companies charge excessive fees on top of their upfront price -- as well as the financial impact of fees on American families -- the deadline for which is April 11. The agency has not yet said how it plans to proceed, however.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America,  Citigroup  and Wells Fargo & Co have stopped charging non-sufficient funds fees - a penalty charged for bounced checks or automated withdrawals that overdraft a customer's account. The banks have also changed their policies on charging overdraft fees, each in different ways.
In her letter, James asked the four banks to eliminate overdraft fees altogether, citing Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) as an example of a bank that eliminated these fees.

The banks did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Last month, a group of U.S. Senate Democrats -- including Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown -- sent letters to seven large banks pressing them to scrap or significantly reduce overdraft and other fees they charge customers. [L2N2VS1GA]

763,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>",French government says McKinsey will pay all taxes it should pay,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday confirmed that a preliminary investigation linked to tax fraud had been launched into the French arm of US consultancy firm McKinsey by France's national financial prosecution office PNF. 
PNF earlier on Wednesday said launched a tax fraud probe linked to consulting firms without specifying which firms were the target of the preliminary investigation.
""We will know at the end of this judicial investigation if there had been fiscal fraud by this company or not,"" Macron was cited as saying in an interview with paper Le Figaro. 
The use of private consultants by the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has lost momentum in opinion polls ahead of the first round of presidential elections on Sunday, has emerged as a surprise issue in the campaign.
McKinsey said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to respond to all questions that French authorities may have and that it respects French fiscal and social regulations.
""McKinsey's fiscal approach is ... in line with OECD directives and has been shared with the French tax administration,"" the firm said.
The French Senate, which is dominated by the conservatives, in March had launched legal action against McKinsey, alleging that a company executive gave false testimony when he told senators McKinsey was paying corporate taxes in France.
The controversy comes as rivals of President Emmanuel Macron accuse the government of lavishly spending taxpayers' money on international consultancies during its term.
According to a French Senate report last week, French ministries have more than doubled spending on outside consultants from 379 million euros ($417 million) in 2018 to 894 million euros last year.
Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who in the last days ahead of the first vote on Sunday has been gaining momentum, called the controversy a ""state scandal"".
Macron in the Figaro interview denied political responsability for the controvery around the government's hiring of consultancies. 

He said that ""it is not the president who signs the contracts (with consultancies)"", adding ""it is the responsability of the administrations, ministers and service providers.""
According to the latest opinion polls, Macron would beat Marine Le Pen in the country's presidential election later this month, though Le Pen has significantly gained ground.

Spinning Eagle joins a slew of companies which have canceled offerings this year at a time when volatility in the U.S. market has jumped due to rate hike concerns, geopolitical tensions and a sell-off in technology stocks.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 02:51PM ET</span>","JetBlue, Frontier each make case for Spirit takeover","By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Nathan Gomes
(Reuters) -JetBlue Airways Corp on Wednesday mounted a vigorous defense of its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid to acquire ultra-low-cost carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), saying the company is ""highly confident"" of securing regulatory approval for the deal.
The New York-based carrier on Tuesday surprised Wall Street with a $33 per share cash offer, potentially derailing a $2.7 billion merger plan between Spirit and Frontier Group Holdings Inc.
Frontier on Wednesday said it remained committed to its merger with Spirit as that would create the country's ""most competitive"" airline and offer more ultra-low fares to consumers. 
JetBlue's proposed deal is widely expected to attract close antitrust scrutiny from President Joe Biden's administration, which has taken a tough stance against mergers that may reduce competition and increase prices for consumers.
The carrier said while it expects a lengthy regulatory process, it is counting on its track record of lowering fares and increasing competition to get the nod.
""We are convinced... that average fares come down more when JetBlue flies into a legacy market than when an ultra-low-cost carrier does,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes told investors on a call.
Some analysts, however, are not sure the administration will buy the argument that the acquisition would translate into lower consumer costs as JetBlue's fares are higher than Spirit's. JetBlue also has plans to remove some seats on Spirit's planes.
White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese on Wednesday declined to comment on JetBlue's bid, but said the Biden administration takes ""very seriously"" the impact of industry consolidation.
JetBlue and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc are already facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice over their Northeastern Alliance.
The partnership, announced in July 2020, allows the carriers to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs in a move aimed at helping them better compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.
Hayes said the company would not sacrifice the Northeastern Alliance in order to secure regulatory approval for the Spirit deal.
COSTS & BENEFITS
Analysts are also questioning the benefits of JetBlue's Spirit bid. 
Raymond James downgraded the company's stock, calling its offer for Spirit an ""indecent proposal.""
While both carriers have fleets dominated by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), any potential cost savings from the deal will be diluted by JetBlue's need to bump up the pay of Spirit pilots, who are on a lower band, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, said, adding that execution risk is higher in JetBlue's proposed deal than for the potential Spirit-Frontier merger.
JetBlue does expect higher labor costs as a result of the deal. But it said the transaction would result in certain economies of scale, producing savings of $600 million to $700 million within three years. It also expects the transaction to be accretive to its earnings in the first year.

The company committed to maintain compensation and benefits for Spirit employees for at least 12 months. 
Shares of Spirit were off 1.7% at $26.45 in afternoon trade, suggesting investors were skeptical of the deal going through. JetBlue stock was down 8%, while Frontier was off nearly that much.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum (Amplats) has received enquiries from manufacturers and carmakers seeking palladium in the wake of Western sanctions on top producer Russia, CEO Natascha Viljoen said on Wednesday. 
Palladium users with no existing contracts with the company have contacted Amplats about ""potential alternative sources of palladium"", Viljoen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the PGMs Industry Day, a platinum group metals (PGMs) mining conference in Johannesburg. 
Uncertainty is causing ""desperation"" in the market as metal consumers try to pin down reliable supply, Viljoen said.
Russia produces 25-30% of the world's supply of palladium, a metal used by automakers in engine exhausts to reduce emissions.
""Where we can accommodate them [new customers] after looking after our long-term customers, we will obviously try as much as possible,"" Viljoen said, adding however that ""we can't make any firm commitments"".
Miners typically utilize long-term contracts, making surplus supply scarce. 
It would take at least five years for South African palladium to ramp up to replace Russian production of the metal, and it may never fully get there, Viljoen said. 
Russian metal can reach the market through other avenues, like China, so the supply chain is likely to shift rather than Russian supply fully stopping, she said.

Instead, the sanctions on Russia may result in a premium on South African palladium, while there may be a discount on palladium being sold into China, Viljoen said.
The world's biggest producer of primary platinum group metals (PGMs), Amplats produced 4.3 million ounces of PGMs in 2021.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 01:11PM ET</span>",JetBlue offers $3.6 billion for Spirit in U.S. low-cost carrier battle,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) said Tuesday it made an unsolicited $3.6 billion bid for  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), potentially snarling merger plans between the ultra-low-cost carrier and Frontier Group Holdings.
JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said the deal would make the New York-based airline a stronger competitor to the so-called four legacy U.S. airlines that control nearly 80% of the U.S. passenger market.
""The number one complaint we get is why don't you fly to more places,"" Hayes said in a Reuters interview late Tuesday. ""What we want to do is create a bigger JetBlue"" that can serve more consumers.
JetBlue, the sixth largest U.S. passenger carrier, would operate Spirit under the JetBlue brand and he does not think any divestitures are needed.
The move comes as airlines face higher fuel and labor costs, and work to attract more leisure travelers, who have returned at a faster rate than business travelers since pandemic restrictions were relaxed.
JetBlue offered $33 a share all cash, about 33% higher than Frontier's offer of 1.9126 shares of stock and $2.13 in cash, which would value Spirit at $24.93 per share as of Tuesday's closing price.
Shares of Spirit closed up 22% at $26.92, their highest level since mid-February. Sprit's 52-week high is $39.19. Just before COVID-19 lockdowns became widespread, Spirit shares traded around $45.
Spirit declined to comment beyond a written statement that it would review the offer.
Hayes said he expects a vigorous antitrust review from the U.S. Justice Department that could last into 2023.
""We've had unprecedented amounts of consolidation, which the DOJ has approved and now it's about how do we make sure the rest of us can continue to discipline the legacy carriers and create that competition,"" Hayes said. ""We believe ultimately this is the best deal out there that is going to really drive more competition.""
Andre Barlow of Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC said the Biden administration ""is concerned about consolidation that could lead to higher prices. This one impacts consumers, so I think it gets a tough look.""
The Justice Department declined to comment.
The department filed an antitrust lawsuit last September against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports. Hayes said JetBlue is ""very committed"" to its alliance with American regardless of whether it was successful in acquiring Spirit. 
Hayes said he expects the litigation over the American Airlines alliance will be completed before the Spirit deal review is completed.
He is speaking with analysts and reporters on an 8 a.m ET call Wednesday to tout the proposal that he says would boost operations in key markets such as Florida and access to constrained hub airports like Atlanta, Detroit, Miami and Chicago. 
Meanwhile, Frontier said it was ""surprising that JetBlue would consider such a merger at this time given that the Department of Justice is currently suing to block their pending alliance with American Airlines."" American did not immediately comment. 
JetBlue said the deal if completed is expected to deliver $600 million-$700 million in net annual synergies and that the combined airline is projected to have annual revenue of about $11.9 billion based on 2019 revenue.
Frontier said its Spirit offer ""is in the best interest of consumers and shareholders and would deliver $1 billion in annual savings for consumers"" and argued ""significant East Coast overlap between JetBlue and Spirit would reduce competition and limit options for consumers."" 
In February, Frontier and Spirit proposed a merger that would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline. 
Spirit's customer service has often faced criticism and the airline canceled 35% of its flights Monday amid weather issues.

""We don't think customers should have to choose between a low fare and a good experience - they should have both,"" said Hayes, noting JetBlue's presence in markets typically prompts larger airlines to lower airfares in what he called the ""JetBlue Effect."" But larger carriers do not always lower fares to match prices from ultra-low cost carriers like Spirit or Frontier. 
The Spirit-Frontier deal faced criticism from some lawmakers and public interest groups warned in March that a merger between the carriers ""would destroy competition in the only competitive market segment of the highly consolidated airline industry.""

Investing.com – Gogo stock (NASDAQ:GOGO) surged 14% Wednesday, a day after the company was added to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index.
The stock has risen as high as $22.27 so far Wednesday. It’s up 88% in the last year.
Gogo, the world's largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market, replaced SPX FLOW in the index.
Being part of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index means passive investors who manage trillions of dollars will have to include it in their portfolios, as it will now be part of more funds and derivatives benchmarked against the index.
According to the annual guidance given by the company last month, total 2022 revenue is seen between $380 million and $395 million, compared to about $336 million for the year ended Dec. 31.
Adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization is seen at $155 million at midpoint of the guidance range, reflecting a planned increase in 5G investments.
The company is also looking to grow its annual revenue at a compound annual rate of about 15% from 2021 through 2026.

Investing.com -- RPM International Inc (NYSE:RPM) shares gained 5% on Wednesday after the company reported record earnings for the third quarter.
The manufacturing company saw third-quarter revenue reach a record $1.43 billion. The 13% increase compared to the prior-year quarter also beat analysts' estimates of $1.41 billion.
In addition, adjusted earnings per share were also able to beat forecasts of $0.30, coming in at $0.38. 
The company reported a record EBIT of $66.9 million and a 2.3% growth over the prior year. 
""We have been fast to respond to supply chain challenges by quickly scaling up in-house resin production at the manufacturing plant we acquired in Texas last September,"" said Frank C. Sullivan, RPM chairman and CEO.
He added that ongoing investments are causing ""accelerated growth"" in its building construction and coating systems.

Their depositary receipts will be converted into equities traded in Russia, the bill showed.
Several major Russian companies have listings abroad, which has always been a matter of prestige for them. But since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, Western bourses have halted trading of Russian securities.
The new bill obliges companies that are registered in Russia and have foreign listings to take steps to dissolve agreements that allow trading of depositary receipts outside Russia. 
""It is not allowed to place and/or organise the circulation of shares of Russian issuers outside the Russian Federation by placing, in accordance with foreign law, securities of foreign issuers that are certifying rights in respect of shares of Russian issuers,"" the bill published on the Duma website said.
The bill will not affect companies with Russian roots that carried out initial public offerings (IPOs) on foreign exchanges, such as  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) or TCS Group.
Lawmakers approved the bill after the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in the depositary receipts -- which represent shares in a foreign company -- of Russian companies in early March after prices crashed to record lows.
In London, depositary receipts in Russia's largest lender Sberbank fell to almost zero days after Russian sent thousands of its troops to Ukraine.
In Moscow, Sberbank shares in Moscow rose 8% to 141.6 roubles ($1.77) per piece in the past 10 trading days after Moscow Exchange gradually resumed trading following a nearly month-long hiatus.
The new bill needs to be approved by the upper house of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law.

The central bank said last month Russian stock exchanges will keep listings of securities of foreign companies with Russian roots even if they delist from foreign bourses.

(Reuters) - European shares fell almost 2% on Wednesday, as investors grappled with the twin worries of aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes potentially hurting growth and more Western sanctions on Russia further stoking inflation. 
Breaking a three-day winning streak, the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.5% to log its worst day in nearly a month. Losses were broad-based, with technology and travel stocks the biggest drags. 
U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday she expected interest rate rises and a rapid balance sheet runoff to take U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year. Her comments sparked a global selloff. [MKTS/GLOB]
""Markets are responding to an anticipated faster, steeper tightening in U.S. monetary policy than previously considered... The Fed appears willing to tolerate any impacts such a move may have on growth and stock markets - European indices are all losing ground,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.
Adding to the pessimism were fears around rising inflationary pressures yet to be felt from the war, Cole added. 
The U.S. announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian banks as well as Kremlin officials and their family members on Wednesday, while the EU proposed to ban Russian coal and even oil imports on Tuesday.
Further fuelling concerns about slowing growth, data showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in February on weaker demand from abroad.
Calls for more tightening by the Fed ahead of minutes from its last policy meeting come as European Central Bank members voiced the need to curb stimulus to keep inflation expectations from rising beyond the central bank's 2% target. The ECB's next policy meeting is next week. 
European equity funds faced their first monthly outflow in two years last month as the war and energy prices hurt prospects for profit growth and margins this year.
Election nerves also continued to grip investors, with French stocks falling 2.2% after marking their worst session in nearly a month on Tuesday.
President Emmanuel Macron would beat Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election, leading the first round on April 10 and winning later on April 24, a poll showed, though Le Pen has gained ground in recent weeks.

Among individual stocks, Danish wind turbine maker Vestas fell 3.2% after it said it would withdraw from Russia, where the firm has two factories.

PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus delivered between 140 and 142 aircraft in the first quarter, up almost 13% from the same period last year, industry sources said on Wednesday.
Airbus declined comment ahead of monthly orders and deliveries data due on Friday.
The figures imply March deliveries of some 62 jets, at least some of which came from long-term storage, the sources said.
Airbus is in the midst of planned production increases of single-aisle jets, but faces growing concern over manufacturing supply chains.
Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie this week estimated total quarterly deliveries of 139 aircraft but said ""production challenges"" and demand were under scrutiny.
According to an Airbus court filing connected to a legal dispute with Qatar Airways, as of March the planemaker was producing 50 narrowbodies a month, including 27 A321neos.
It plans to increase this to 61 a month by end-2022 of which 33 will be A321neos, the filing said, adding that the planemaker ultimately aims to raise production above 70 a month by 2025.
""This is clearly a challenging target, and the pressure on suppliers to keep pace is high,"" it said.
Airbus has so far publicly committed to raising output to 65 a month by the summer of 2023, without giving interim steps.
It has said it is asking suppliers to be ready for output of 70 a month by the first quarter of 2024, if a decision to raise output again is taken, while exploring rates up to 75 by 2025.
QATAR DISPUTE
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in February Airbus was on a trajectory to reach 65 a month by summer next year. Higher rates beyond 2023 were ""still in the assessment phase"".
Analysts say production of the larger wide-body A350, which competes in the weaker long-haul market, remains uncertain though Airbus this week reiterated its guidance.
Bloomberg News reported this week that Airbus may delay a planned increase in A350 production because of Russian sanctions and the dispute with Qatar Airways, which is refusing to take A350s in a row over damage to the surface of the jets.
Airbus has begun efforts to remarket some of the A350s at the centre of the dispute to new customers including Air India, industry sources said. 
Airbus declined to comment. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Airbus has more than 20 A350s on order from Qatar Airways but is revoking them one by one as the airline rejects delivery on safety grounds. So far, three A350s have been cancelled by Airbus, which says there is no safety issue.

Qatar is suing Airbus for $1 billion of A350 compensation, with Airbus making a counter-claim to claw back millions of dollars of credits connected to the original A350 contract.
The two sides will square off in court on Thursday when Qatar Airways will seek to freeze an Airbus decision to revoke a separate contact to supply A321neos. The feuding firms disagree on whether deals for the two models are contractually linked.

The United States on Wednesday announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions, as well as Kremlin officials and their family members, in response to what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The new sanctions hit Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfa Bank, the country's fourth largest financial institution, U.S. officials said. But energy transactions were exempted from the latest measures, the officials said.
U.S. Treasury said transactions with Sberbank and Alfa Bank need to wind down through April 12 and May 5, respectively.
""The sanctions will not have a significant impact on the bank's operations and will not affect service to Russians as the system has already adapted to the previous restrictions,"" Sberbank said in a statement.
Shares in Sberbank tumbled on the Moscow Exchange after the sanctions were announced and ended the day 8.1% lower at 141.60 roubles ($1.79) per piece.
Washington said earlier on Wednesday that energy transactions will be exempted from the sanctions on Sberbank.
Alfa Bank said it will temporarily halt transactions in U.S. dollars with its counterparts but will continue transactions in roubles, euros and other currencies.
An Alfa Bank representative told Reuters it was not immediately clear what would happen to U.S. dollar accounts that its clients had with the bank.

(Reuters) - European equity funds faced their first monthly outflow in two years in March as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising energy prices hurt prospects for profit growth and margins this year. 
According to Refinitiv Lipper, European equity funds witnessed an outflow of $27 billion last month, their first outflow since March 2020.

At the same time, U.S. equity funds received $20 billion, and Asian equity funds obtained $8.7 billion in March, the data showed. 
The divergence in flows highlights investors' reluctance to be exposed to markets deemed vulnerable to the ongoing conflict and on account of Europe's higher trade links with Russia and Ukraine. 
Analysts expect higher inflation levels will raise companies' input costs and squeeze their profit margins.
Euro zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March, as the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel and natural gas prices to record highs. 
""The growth outlook is slowing,"" Sarah McCarthy, analyst at Bernstein, said in a note. 
""It is easy to raise prices to counteract increases in input costs when the economy is roaring, less easy in a slowdown.""
The data showed Zwitserleven Duurzaam Index Aandelenfonds Europa had outflows worth $912 million, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) European Dynamic A Acc and iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF faced outflows worth $503 million and $468 million respectively last month.
Last month,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lowered its earnings per share growth forecast for Europe to 3% in 2022 from its earlier forecast of 10%. 
""With real GDP growth set to fall below inflation in 2022, margins could fall about 100 basis points this year,"" the brokerage said.
According to Refinitiv data, Euro zone's large and mid-cap companies' earnings are expected to grow 4.4% this year, much lesser than the U.S. firms' growth of 10.3% and Asia's 15.3%.
Europe's STOXX 600 has declined 6% so far this year.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 12:01PM ET</span>",Toyota cuts '22 U.S. new-car sales industry outlook on supply-chain issues,"DETROIT (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp on Wednesday cut its 2022 outlook for the U.S. auto industry's new-car sales, citing the struggles in the supply-chain caused by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.
The Japanese automaker's new outlook of 15.5 million vehicles was down from its prior forecast of 16.5 million, Bob Carter, executive vice president of sales for Toyota Motor North America, said on a conference call.
""The supply-chain challenges that we're seeing ... will remain with us for a while,"" he said.
The global auto industry had already been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shortage of semiconductor chips even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine snarled parts of the supply chain and contributed to soaring prices of raw materials such as aluminum and nickel.
Carter said the U.S. industry's sales rate in the first quarter was an annualized 14.3 million, but he is ""reasonably confident"" in the new forecast. However, he said there is a ""downside scenario"" of 14.9 million to 15 million sales if the supply chain struggles continue.
Carter emphasized that the U.S. sales outlook is not based on demand as a sales rate in the mid-16 million range could be achieved if automakers could build that many vehicles.
""That is an adjustment that quite frankly is not based on consumer demand,"" he said. ""It's based solely on what our projections of the supply environment is going to be."" 
Carter said Toyota expects U.S. sales this year for its Toyota and Lexus brands to finish at about 2.35 million vehicles.
While Carter expects some of the higher raw material costs to be passed on to consumers, he does not see vehicle affordability being an issue this year. He said it will take six months for inventory rates to normalize after the supply chain recovers.

Toyota's day's supply of vehicles in the U.S. now stands at less than two versus an historic rate of 40 to 45 days. He expects that to recover to 30 days as the supply chain recovers.
""The vehicles are being sold literally before they are built,"" he said.

Even after more than a 120% rise in the last year due to record-high crude prices, Stifel analyst Michael Scialla believes the stock is attractively priced owing to an under-appreciated low carbon business.
The stock has attracted much attention lately after billionaire Warren Buffett came to acquire more than 13% of the company.
“An emerging low carbon business centered around direct air capture is largely underappreciated, in our view, due to its reliance on voluntary and compliance offset markets for hard to abate emissions and the consensus opinion that it will generate low returns,” he wrote in the report, according to StreetInsider.
According to Scialla, the pace of offset market expansion could surprise investors while the improvement in enhanced oil recovery resources and margins positively impacts direct air capture economics.
A rapidly deleveraging balance sheet and share repurchase program should also support the stock, he wrote."

San Francisco (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) unit Woven Planet has joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in trying to advance self-driving technology without expensive sensors such as lidars. 
Woven Planet told Reuters it is able to use low-cost cameras to collect data and effectively train its self-driving system, a ""breakthrough"" that it hopes will help drive down costs and scale up the technology. 
Gathering diverse driving data using a massive fleet of cars is critical to developing a robust self-driving car system, but it is costly and not scalable to test autonomous vehicles with expensive sensors, it said. 
Tesla has been betting on cameras to collect data from over 1 million vehicles on the road to develop its automated driving technology, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo and other self-driving car firms added expensive sensors like lidars to a small number of vehicles.
""We need a lot of data. And it's not sufficient to just have a small amount of data that can be collected from a small fleet of very expensive autonomous vehicles,"" Michael Benisch, vice president of Engineering at Woven Planet, said in an interview with Reuters. 
""Rather, we're trying to demonstrate that we can unlock the advantage that Toyota and a large automaker would have, which is access to a huge corpus of data, but with a much lower fidelity,"" said Benisch, a former engineering director at  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s self-driving division, which Toyota acquired last year. 
Woven Planet uses cameras that are 90% cheaper than sensors that it used before and can be easily installed in fleets of passenger cars. 
It said using a majority of data coming from low-cost cameras increased its system's performance to a level similar to when the system was trained exclusively on high-cost sensor data. 
He said, however, Toyota would still use multiple sensors such as lidars and radars for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to be deployed on the road, as this currently seemed to be the best, safest approach to developing robotaxis. 
""But in many, many years, it's entirely possible that camera type technology can catch up and overtake some of the more advanced sensors,"" he said.

""The question may be more about when and how long it will take to reach a level of safety and reliability. I don't believe we know that yet."" 
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said it can achieve full autonomy with cameras this year after missing his previous targets several times.

Launched in 2019, the company is operated by BAM Trading services, the U.S. partner of Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange by trading volume. Binance.US and Binance have a licensing agreement but operate as separate legal entities.
Binance.US said RRE Ventures, Foundation Capital, Original Capital, VanEck and Circle Ventures were among the investors that participated in the fundraise, which was its first external funding round.
It added that the funds would be used to invest in its spot trading platform and toward the development of new products and services.
Last month, Binance rejected calls for a blanket ban on all Russian users after Moscow invaded Ukraine.
Its decision last month to stay in Russia, which was a divergence from mainstream finance firms such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Holdings Ltd and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), had irked the Ukrainian government.

Binance has also been trying to deepen links with the United Arab Emirates as the country tries to style itself as the world's new digital assets hub.
The crypto industry continues to face the wrath of regulators internationally, who worry about how a meltdown in crypto assets, seen as highly volatile and opaque, will feed into the wider financial sector, leading to a global push for more regulation.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>","Cutting EU reliance on UK clearers like ending use of Russian energy, says commissioner","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union must cut its heavy reliance on derivatives clearing in London in the same way as the bloc is ending its dependency on Russian energy due to the war in Ukraine, EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said on Wednesday.
The EU has agreed to allow clearing houses in Britain, such as the London Stock Exchange's LCH arm, to continue serving banks and asset managers in the bloc until June 2025 to give time to build up clearing capacity inside the EU.
McGuinness said she would propose legislation in October which could include incentives for banks to clear inside the bloc, and disincentives, such as potential capital charges, when clearing in London.
Pension funds and public entities could be required to clear their derivatives in the EU, she added.
""It's time now for Europe, the EU of 27, to make very strong decisions on the financial stability and the financial system, just as we are doing today very critically and very urgently around our over-dependency on energy from Russia,"" McGuinness told a European Central Bank event.
LCH clears the bulk of euro denominated interest rate swaps, long a bone of contention with EU authorities and the European Central Bank, but pressure on banks to voluntarily move clearing from London to Frankfurt has made little headway.
""There is some resistance to change because people say today the system works so why would we change it,"" she said.
The EU must cut overdependence on UK clearers in the medium term to build up its own capital market and avoid threats to financial stability, she said.
""Ideally, I would like this one to happen faster,"" she said, adding that she wants the ""heavy lifting"" done by the time her term as commissioner ends in 2024 to ensure a smooth transition.

Feedback from a public consultation now closed will be used to create a balanced legislative proposal.
""This isn't about us trying to take the business from the United Kingdom... I see this potentially as a win-win for the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" McGuinness said, adding that a stronger EU capital market is good for global markets.

Investing.com -- Mullen Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:MULN) shares have jumped 241% in the past month, but they have dipped slightly on Wednesday after Hindenburg Research released a short report on the electric vehicle firm. 
Mullen stock is down 3.68%.
Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, wrote in a report titled ""Mullen Automotive: Yet Another Fast Talking EV Hustle"" that the company has made ""bold claims of ground-breaking technology, near term production of its EV vans, and a major as-yet-unnamed Fortune 500 customer.""
However, they add that a recent update about its battery technology is a ""rehash of testing the company had already announced in 2020,"" and Mullen ""apparently misrepresented the test results, according to the CEO of the company that performed the tests.""
""Mullen’s battery claims were based on technology licensed from a 1-year-old Chinese battery technology company. After hyping the importance of the relationship, Mullen made one payment under the deal and promptly terminated the relationship. The Chinese company’s website no longer works,"" stated Hindenburg.
Hindenburg also goes on to claim that two electric cargo vans Mullen says it will be manufacturing are ""actually Chinese EVs rebranded with a Mullen logo,"" while it also has other production hurdles such as no EPA certificates for its vans or any vehicle, and it hasn’t begun significant hiring.
""We have seen this story before, but Mullen strikes us as one of the worst. With echoes of Nikola, Lordstown, Kandi and Ideanomics, we think Mullen is just the latest in a long line of EV hustles,"" said Hindenburg."

Lufthansa will offer replacement train connections to passengers who booked the affected flights, a spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Earlier Wednesday, Fraport warned of cancelled flights from this week as it was struggling to hire enough people after massive job cuts due to the COVID-19 crisis, especially in the field of ground handling.

A spokesman for the group, which runs aviation facilities in nine countries worldwide and the main airport in Germany's Frankfurt, said the cancellations would be decided by the airlines and were expected as of Friday, April 8.
The company did not specify the number of flights that would be cancelled.

In late March, Fraport warned about likely delays around Easter due to staff shortages in departments crucial for processing flights, though it aims to hire 1,000 employees in 2022 and took on about 300 people between January and March.
Fraport is not the only European company facing a staffing problem. Britain-based low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) and British Airways as well as Ireland's Ryanair have also reported issues.

Stryker stock opened up around $257.87. It currently trades at about $259.50, down around 3.36%.
Spruce Point said in its short report that while Stryker shareholders had been enjoying an ""impressive ride,"" the ""story had now changed.""
The short sellers highlighted that the $118 billion company has $16.4 billion of debt and ""just"" $1.5 billion of unrestricted cash.
""Financial flexibility is lower, actionable targets of size to grow Stryker are fewer, and Stryker’s track record of paying rich premiums for targets is working against it,"" wrote Spruce Point.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airlines will pass on rising oil prices to passengers through higher fares relatively quickly, but the spike in energy costs will worsen the industry's overall outlook in 2022, the head of the International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday. 
Speaking after JetBlue launched a counter-bid for U.S. budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), Director General Willie Walsh also said he saw further scope for consolidation among airlines in the United States.
""It clearly took the market by surprise,"" Walsh told a regular industry news briefing.
""It is evidence that the financial strength of U.S. airlines does stand out from the rest of the world,"" he said, adding that consumers had benefited from major investments in new products.
IATA said global passenger traffic rebounded in February as the impact of the Omicron variant retreated outside Asia. The war in Ukraine has yet to feed through into monthly data. 
In February, passenger traffic stood at 54.5% of levels seen in the same month of 2019, up from 50.6% in January but below the 55.1% seen in December. Cargo volumes were at 111.9%.
Airlines are grappling with a rise in oil prices which accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a move Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"". 
The rise has worsened an outlook already expected to include an industry-wide loss in 2022, although some airlines will make a profit as the world stages an uneven recovery, Walsh said.
In the past, the rule of thumb was that oil prices would take six months to feed through to airfares, he added.
But that could happen more quickly because of the market's dramatic volatility as well as lower-than-usual levels of forward bookings already in the system following the pandemic.
Walsh also said airlines and airports were moving to tackle staff shortages after a spike in demand, but some factors were outside their control.

Thousands of holidaymakers have seen getaways disrupted or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand as pandemic restrictions are eased in Europe.
""The challenge the industry faces is bringing back front- line staff where they require background security checks,"" Walsh said, adding that a process which used to take five to six weeks is taking ""much longer now"".

In a statement on Wednesday, HSBC said its Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio, managed by its asset management arm, will focus on investing within the metaverse ecosystem across five segments - infrastructure, computing, virtualisation, experience and discovery, and interface.
""The metaverse ecosystem, while still at its early stage, is rapidly evolving,"" said Lina Lim, regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions, Asia Pacific, at HSBC. ""We see many exciting opportunities in this space as companies of different backgrounds and sizes are flocking into the ecosystem.""
The metaverse comprises a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialise and play. It has come into sharper focus since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name to Meta last year to reflect its bet on the sector.
HSBC said its discretionary portfolio was designed for its high net worth and ultra-high net worth professional investors and accredited investor clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Last month, HSBC said it was buying a plot of virtual real estate in an online gaming space, becoming the second global bank to invest in a popular metaverse platform after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) set up a presence in blockchain-based Decentraland.

HSBC is putting $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business, in line with its ambition to become Asia's top wealth manager by 2025.
Global wealth managers, including UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), have been ramping up headcount in Asia as countries such as China and India minted more billionaires and millionaires.

As a result, Cano stock price is down about 8% heading into the New York open today.
Despite cheap relative valuation to peers, Tassan says he can't recommend CANO shares to investors. Among other things, the analyst notes that an FY22 capital allocation prioritizes revenue retention over growth.
On the 4Q21 call, management signaled that affiliate tuck-ins would be FY22 investment priority #1. CANO will pare back FY22 de novo builds vs. 54-59 originally forecast. We believe this year's ramping investments in affiliate tuck-ins will draw attention to CANOs practice of consolidating affiliate financials. Because affiliates are already consolidated, tuck-in M&A yields effectively no incremental membership, revenue or adjusted EBITDA. It is an investment in retention, not growth. ""We do not think this dynamic is widely appreciated, but expect heightened scrutiny in FY22,"" Tassan said in a client note.
Tassan estimates that owned providers generate 50% of CANO's P&L, with the remainder generated by affiliated providers.
He further expects that owned providers will deliver $1.72 billion of revenue in FY23E and $145 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, the analyst says that the fundamental outlook is uniquely challenged, hence the downgrade to Underweight.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Wednesday, extending the losses that they posted on Tuesday in response to warning words from Lael Brainard and other high-ranking Federal Reserve officials.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 282 points, or 0.8%, at 34,360 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was underperforming with a loss of 1.7%. 
The moves came as benchmark 10-year interest rates rose to a new high for the year of 2.64%, having lurched higher on Tuesday when Brainard, nominated as the Fed's new vice-chair, said that the Fed could start selling bonds out of its portfolio as early as May at a faster pace than previously envisaged. 
Brainard's comments were echoed later by Kansas City Fed President Esther George and San Francisco president Mary Daly. They led analysts from Deutsche Bank to conclude that there is now a high risk of the U.S. economy going into a recession in 2023 as the Fed is forced to raise interest rates above their neutral level in order to bring inflation down. Richmond Fed president Tom Barkin was meanwhile quoted by newswires as saying Wednesday that he thought interest rates were still around 2.5% below what the Fed considers neutral.
Barkin added that the economy ""no longer needs"" Fed intervention to support it. Last week's March labor market report had showed the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest since the start of the pandemic at 3.6%, Barkin said.
Long-term interest rates were in focus with the day's earlier economic data, as the Mortgage Bankers Association said its reference 30-year mortgage rate had risen another 10 basis points last week to 4.90%, its highest since early 2019. Recent data have shown increasing mortgage finally starting to have an impact on the housing market.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock, all lost over 2%, while Nvidia stock lost 4.0% and Tesla stock 3.6%, the latter's Shanghai plant still remaining closed due to an extended COVID-19 lockdown.
Also grabbing headlines in early trading was  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK) stock, after the medical device company attracted the attention of another short-seller. Stryker fell 3.6% after Spruce Point Capital accused it of creative accounting and highlighted that it has only $1.5 billion of unrestricted cash, but over $15 billion in debt.
 Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) stock fell 4.2% after a sharp rise on Tuesday in response to JetBlue's all-cash offer, which at current levels represents a steep premium to Frontier Group's (NASDAQ:ULCC) offer for the discount airline. JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock, meanwhile, fell another 9.3%

Investing.com -- Array Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock surged 14% Wednesday after the solar tracker technology provider issued an upbeat outlook following a robust fourth quarter.
The company is projecting its 2022 revenue to be higher by over 85% at the midpoint of its guidance range of $1.45 billion-$1.75 billion. It expects its legacy business alone to grow at around 40% at mid-point, despite module challenges and supply chain disruptions.
The company’s acquisition of Soluciones Técnicas Integrales Norland, one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of solar trackers, was completed in January.
Array’s estimate-beating performance came in even as it ran into higher-than-expected material costs in the quarter due to changes in its supply chain plan to maintain customer delivery schedules.
The company’s executed contracts and awarded orders at the close of the year totaled $1.8 billion, a new record.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $220 million, primarily driven by continued strong demand for its solar solutions. Margins eroded due to higher raw material and freight costs.
The company’s adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was impacted by the mix of deliveries which skewed heavier on the legacy, lower margin projects than it had forecasted.
Adjusted net loss in the quarter was $7.8 million compared to adjusted net income of $10.6 million in the same period a year ago."

LONDON (Reuters) -European investor campaign group Better Finance said on Wednesday it has set up a foundation to help 30,000 investors recover the 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) they lost when German payments company Wirecard collapsed in 2020.
Better Finance said the foundation has been set up under Dutch law to target the global parent of EY, the accounting firm which audited Wirecard's books.
""The advantage of using a Dutch foundation opens up the possibility of reaching a settlement with EY, including EY Global, for all injured Wirecard investors in Europe,"" said Marc Tuengler, managing director of DSW, a German investor group which has teamed up with Better Finance to set up the foundation.
""The choice of a Dutch foundation offers options that are not available under German law,"" Tuengler said in a statement, adding that he envisioned a timeline of three to four years for the legal process.
EY said it continues to regard claims against EY Germany, including any claims by DSW, as unfounded.
""All first-instance court rulings by various chambers of the Munich Regional Court 1 that have already been issued in this context confirm EY's position: there are no claims against EY for damages,"" EY said.
The Munich Higher Regional Court similarly has referenced the high hurdles for sustaining claims against EY, it added.
Wirecard, founded in 1999, began by processing payments for gambling and pornography websites before becoming a fintech star and a member of Germany's blue chip DAX index.
It ended by filing for insolvency in June 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, after disclosing a 1.9 billion hole in its accounts that EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.

Klaus Nieding, of Nieding+Barth law firm, said if EY in Germany or globally is unwilling to settle amicably, then the investors will go to court, with litigation costs covered by the foundation.

Yap notes that prolonged city lockdowns in China will hurt the overall economic activity, which will impact Alibaba's profit growth for FY4Q22.
We believe the COVID impact will drag on into FY1Q23 and possibly delay CY2H22 recovery trend.

In fact, BABA mgmt noted last quarter that it expects investment losses in Taobao Deals and Taocaicai to narrow gradually in the coming quarters. Nevertheless, with continued merchant support measures, revs mix shift towards lower margins or loss-making business, overall EBITA growth will remain under pressure, Yap said in a client note.
Regardless, the analyst says Alibaba shares look attractive at current levels given US$15.8bn outstanding in REPO, strong cash flow generation and trading near historical trough.

(Reuters) - Wedding guests should prepare for a few surprises at this year's post-pandemic U.S. nuptials as people discard their sweatpants for sheer layering and body-hugging dresses.
Retailers are racing to tailor ensembles that capture that mood, with evening gowns and cocktail dresses taking pride of place at stores and websites as the United States prepares for 2.5 million ceremonies, the most since 1984.
""We have absolutely seen a push for sleek, bold, and more sensual styling with this year's brides. After spending the last few years living in loungewear, she is embracing all things celebratory,"" said Lori Conley, the executive in charge of merchandise at fashion brand Anthropologie's bridal business.
Apparel inspired by period dramas ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and HBO's ""The Gilded Age"" is also gaining popularity, Durand Guion, head of Macy's fashion office, said.
The rebound underscores a return to pre-pandemic lifestyles in the United States as vaccinations have helped with the removal of restrictions and eased fears of infections. 
Total sales in 2022 of wedding-related products and services such as attire and catering will likely jump 31% to $68.66 billion from a year earlier, also well above pre-pandemic levels, The Wedding Report estimates. 
BHLDN, Anthropologie's wedding gown designing arm, has nearly doubled its inventory from last year, while clothing rental company Rent the Runway's assortment for special occasions, which includes weddings and other social events, is 10% higher from pre-pandemic levels. 
""The thousands of styles that we're bringing in are more over-the-top celebratory in attitude than we've ever had on our platform in the past. We are embracing sexier styles and more fashion forward merchandise,"" Rent the Runway Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jennifer Hyman told Reuters. 
Department store chains Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) are also stocking up on evening gowns and party wear, with Kohl's expanding space dedicated to dresses by 75%.
For Rent the Runway, the return of weddings and parties provides an opportunity to re-energize subscriber growth - its main revenue source - after the health crisis hit demand. 

Months of supply chain disruption are still haunting retailers, however, with recent COVID-19 lockdowns in China likely to add to headaches over keeping shelves stocked.
""The supply chain was supposed to be largely back to normal by the middle to the end of the year. But as we move into wedding season ... it doesn't feel like supply is totally back to normal,"" said Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock climbed 12% in premarket trading Wednesday after the cannabis producer reported an unexpected profit for the third quarter.
The company’s distribution tie-up with supermarket chain Whole Foods, which will sell the hemp powders produced by its Manitoba Harvest subsidiary, was also adding to the gains.
Tilray said it is on course to hit its target of $4 billion in revenue by the end of financial year 2024.
Quarterly net revenue increased 23% to $152 million, driven by 32% growth in cannabis revenue to $55 million, 64% rise in beverage alcohol revenue of $20 million and wellness revenue of $15 million.
Tilray said its merger with Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) has yielded $76 million in savings on a run-rate basis to date. It expects to reach an $80 million synergy target by May-end, five months ahead of schedule.
The company said international cannabis revenue soared over 4,000% from the prior-year quarter with market share in Germany, Europe’s largest market for the item, close to 20%.
Tilray said Whole Foods will market the brand’s Hemp+ Matcha and Supergreens powders exclusively at its North America locations.
Net income in the quarter was $52.5 million with adjusted EBITDA at $10.1 million, making it the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA."

Nevertheless, Street analysts are mostly positive on the stock after the company's CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said that revenue is tracking ahead of expectations as sales continue to grow at a fast pace.
In the long run, Analog expects its sales to grow in the high-single-digit range between 7% and 10%, Mahendra-Rajah told investors.
The company also said it sees a path to $15 of adjusted earnings per share and a 40% free cash flow margin by 2027.
We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we execute our long-term vision to build and empower the intelligent edge by bringing digital technologies and software closer to the edge, making it more intelligent and prescient, said Vincent Roche, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of ADI.
Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg reiterated a Buy rating and a Top Large-Cap Pick designation after the event. His three key takeaways from the meeting are:
1) ADI's focus on the high-end of the analog/mixed-signal IC market is a key differentiator, driving high margins/FCFs by delivering high systems-level value; 2) doubling down on its hybrid manufacturing model, leveraging foundry IP to drive mfg. efficiencies while maximizing flexibility, resulting in high and stable profit margins; and 3) New long-term financial targets that rank among the best across semiconductors and the S&P 500, Svanberg wrote in a report.
Bank of America BAC analyst Vivek Arya said that ADI is well-positioned to continue delivering best-in-class FCF generation and growth.
We come away optimistic, with ADI delivering line of sight to $15 of EPS power by 2027e (almost 2x accretion over the next 5 years) with EBIT margins of 42-50% (vs 46% in FY22e) and sales growth of 7-10%, unrivaled amongst analog peers, Arya commented.

The Street consensus currently stands at roughly 235,000 subs added with Post expecting PTON to potentially add 250k-260k gross sub adds.
Total visits to Pelotons US, Canada, UK, Germany and Australia sites for F3Q declined 24% y/y, vs down 1% in F2Q, but continues to be well above competition. Q/Q total visits were up 3%, while street estimates call for a significant Q/Q decline in gross adds (lower conversion rates are likely in F3Q vs F2Q), Post said in a client note.
Peloton term searches were down 28% YoY, worse than the decline of 21% in the prior quarter. Similarly, downloads for Peloton were down 49% YoY, much worse than the 27% decline in F2Q. For Post, this signals that the reopening headwinds continue to hurt Peloton.
Net-net, Post continues to be generally positive on Peloton, especially after the new CEO Barry McCarthy took over.
Key driver for stock on earnings call likely to be sentiment on new CEO's commentary on business model changes and potential subscriber growth acceleration, with risk that Peloton incurs higher upfront costs to accelerate subscriber growth. Other risks are lower usage metrics on reopening and a potential seasonal increase in F4Q churn. We think Peloton subscriber and content base are strong assets in the space, with advantages vs peers to transform business model under new CEO. We also think highly of new CEO Barry McCarthy's track record at subscription companies, Post added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kyle Ash snapped up 2,000 pounds ($2,615) worth of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares as soon as he heard that Elon Musk had become the social media company's largest shareholder. 
The 25-year-old retail worker from Reading, Britain bought into Twitter on Monday after shares surged 27% on news of Musk's investment in the San Francisco-based company.
Ash paid $49 per share on average, versus the $44 price target from analysts covering Twitter's stock. Bullish bets that go against Wall Street's conventional wisdom have been a hallmark of the ""meme"" stock trading frenzy that has swept many individual investors in the past 15 months.
Ash, who has also invested in meme stocks such as video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and movie-theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, said he hoped celebrity billionaire Musk would bring the same hype to Twitter's stock. ""Everything Elon touches creates a wave in the beginning. I have faith in people's faith in him,"" Ash said.
Millions of investors flocked to Twitter's stock after Musk, who has more than 80 million Twitter followers, disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company, making it the most bought U.S. stock by retail investors on Monday, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research shows. The $152 million inflow to the stock on Monday was the largest among all stocks and ETFs on U.S. exchanges for the day.
Musk has developed a loyal following of investors who stuck with his company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for most of the past decade while it was still struggling to streamline production of electric cars and make them affordable. 
Tesla is now among the world's most valuable companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.
Musk, who is also behind other ventures such as rocket maker SpaceX, is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $290 billion. 
Musk's popularity with retail investors was one of the reasons why Twitter agreed this week to offer him a seat on its board of directors, people familiar with the matter said. 
Musk and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. 
Twitter shares have fallen behind peers amid the company's push to make its advertising more lucrative and generate more revenue from subscription products. The stock sank 38% in the 12 months to April 1, before Musk unveiled his stake, versus a 13% rise in the S&P 500 Index. 
Retail investors account for 9.9% of Twitter's investor base, according to Vanda. While that is higher than Tesla, where retail investors account for 1.5%, it is significantly lower than AMC, the most popular meme stock, where retail investors account for 40.9% of the investor base. 
""Given Musk's following on social and other media, we expect the news to drive significant retail investor interest in, and activity for, the stock,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analyst Justin Post said in a research note this week. He cautioned that the hype could also attract investors who like to short stocks.
GAMESTOP, AMC PLAYBOOK
In investing in Twitter, Musk is borrowing a page from the playbook of AMC and GameStop, whose leaders have also capitalized on their popularity with retail investors to place bets on other companies.
Last month, AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp, a troubled gold and silver mine operator. Retail investors followed, and Hycroft shares are now trading at seven times what they were worth a month ago. 
An investment by GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) last month led to a doubling in that company's market value. 
Some analysts cautioned the boost in Twitter's stock based on hype may not be enough to keep retail investors engaged. 

Musk's long-term contribution to Twitter will hinge on whether he can help make the company more profitable, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note this week.
""The goal is to better monetize the platform, and we think Musk can only help, not hurt the process, with his recent criticism of the company as a refreshing sign,"" Zino wrote.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",Production from Stellantis Italy plants to fall for fifth year due to chip crisis-union,"MILAN (Reuters) - Vehicle production from sites owned in Italy by Stellantis and previously its predecessor Fiat Chrysler is set to fall for a fifth consecutive year in 2022 due to the microchip supply crunch, the FIM CISL union said on Wednesday. 
Fiat Chrysler and Peugeout-maker PSA merged at the start of last year to form Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker. At the time of the merger PSA did not have any production facilities in Italy. 
FIM CISL said overall Stellantis production in Italy fell 13.5% year-on-year in the first quarter due to the semiconductor shortage, which is weighing in particular on the Melfi and Sevel plants, two of the group's main sites in the country.
In particular, car production fell 2.6% to 123,484 units, while van production fell 30.4% to 56,690, it added. 
Melfi covers around 40% of Stellantis car production in Italy, while Sevel is Europe's largest van production plant.
FIM CISL Head Ferdinando Uliano said exceptional factors such as the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing chip shortage were becoming a constant.
""The war in Ukraine is having an impact on supplies,"" he said while presenting the union's quarterly report on Stellantis production in Italy. 
""There was hope that 2022 could mark an improvement on semiconductors and raw material supplies, but we now doubt this can happen,"" 
FIM CISL said that based on trends seen in the three months, 2022 production could fall below 600,000 vehicles, with cars amounting to less than 400,000 units.

That would mark a fifth consecutive year of declining output, including COVID-hit 2020, and compares with a total of over 1 million vehicles leaving the assembly lines in 2017, the last time Fiat Chrysler reported rising annual production in Italy.
Stellantis declined to comment.

The American carmaker said it produced 2,553 vehicles and delivered 1,227 cars in the first quarter, compared to 1,015 produced and 920 delivered units last year.
Last month, the company warned that issues related to the supply chain could halve its 2022 production target to 25,000.
Rivian's factory in Normal, Illinois can produce 150,000 vehicles per year, with the company planning to increase that capacity to 200,000 by 2023. Rivian currently makes its R1S sport utility vehicle, R1T pickup truck, and a delivery van for Amazon in that factory.
The carmaker plans to open another factory close to Atlanta in 2024, which is set to increase the company's capacity to 400,000 vehicles annually.
RBC analyst Joseph Spak reiterated an Outperform rating and a $100.00 per share price target.
""We have more confidence in our 2022 production forecast of 25.5k (and company indicated well positioned to deliver on their 25k production guidance), but we are slightly adjusting our deliveries for 2022 to account for longer in-transit times. Our new 2022 delivery forecast is 23.7k vs. ~24.9k prior and this does modestly tweak our 2022 P&L forecast. We believe production is the focal point, we just previously highlighted deliveries because we didn't have a consensus production forecast,"" Spak said in a client note.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Wednesday, with investors cautiously awaiting the release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, looking for clues of future monetary policy.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 185 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 32 points, or 0.7%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 160 points, or 1.1%.
The main Wall Street indices weakened Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 280 points, or 0.8%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling 1.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 2.3% lower, after a senior Federal Reserve official hinted at more aggressive tightening in the months ahead to keep inflation in check.
Lael Brainard, who is awaiting confirmation as Vice Chair of the U.S. central bank, called for interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year. 
Now, attention will turn to the release of the minutes of the Fed meeting last month, when the policymakers decided to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018, for guidance on the path for future interest rate hike path and any comments on tapering.
Money markets are currently factoring in the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 225 basis points by the end of the year, which, when including March’s 25 basis point increase, would mean the most aggressive annual tightening since 1994.
Elsewhere, the U.S. is coordinating with its European allies on a new round of sanctions, including a bar on all new investments in Russia, on the back of mounting allegations of atrocities by Russian forces in Ukraine. 
In corporate news, executives from a number of oil companies, including BP (NYSE:BP),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), have been invited to appear in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss the high gas prices and the industry’s role in pricing markets.
Additionally, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) announced Tuesday it had made an unsolicited $3.6 billion bid for  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), attempting to create a stronger competitor to the four major U.S. airlines.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, with traders having to balance supply concerns on the back of likely new sanctions on Russia with fears of weaker demand after a build in U.S. crude inventories and a prolonged COVID lockdown in Shanghai, the Chinese financial hub.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed a build of just over 1 million barrels for last week, the first increase in crude stocks in three weeks.
Investors now await official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the session for confirmation.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $103.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $108.06.

By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -Carlyle Group Inc said on Wednesday it has raised $4.6 billion for its second credit fund that provides debt financing to companies, including family-owned businesses and private equity-backed firms.
The new fund, Carlyle Credit Opportunities Fund II, exceeded its initial target of $3.5 billion and is expected have up to $6 billion to deploy when accounting for its ability to borrow.
The fund has already invested $3.8 billion of its available capital in 22 businesses across North America and Europe, Alex Popov, Carlyle's head of illiquid credit strategies, said in an interview. It is nearly double the size of the inaugural fund, which collected $2.4 billion from investors in 2019 and had generated a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 15% as of the end of last year.
""We are continuing to see significant transitional capital opportunities in the current market,"" Popov said.
The fund provides transitional capital for companies and businesses for circumstances including ""a major acquisition, expansion into a different market, or a change of ownership,"" he said.

Carlyle's investments include a 320 million pounds debt financing package to The Caffè Nero Group, a British coffee chain. Carlyle also provided financing, alongside  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), for Digital Intelligence Systems LLC, a Virgina-based outsourcing firm, to acquire a smaller rival, Signature Consultants LLC.
Carlyle has been seeking to bolster its credit platform, which had $73 billion in assets under management as of December. Last week, Carlyle reached a deal with Fortitude Re to raise $2.1 billion in equity financing for the reinsurer and manage $50 billion of its assets. Carlyle also agreed to acquire credit manager CBAM in March, which will add an additional $15 billion to its assets under management.

Musk, who now holds a 9.1% stake in Twitter, has been buying shares of the social media giant almost on a daily basis for more than two months, according to a new 13D filing which suggests that Musk wishes to take on a more active role in Twitter's business.
The previous 13G filing indicated that the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO holds a passive stake in the company, meaning he has no plans of exerting influence. However, the new SEC filing now shows otherwise.

In addition to becoming an active investor, Musk will also be joining Twitter's board of directors, said Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal.
The new filing showed that Musk made the biggest purchase on February 7 when he acquired over 4.8 million Twitter shares for $176 million.

821,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>","Tesla Halted, Chips Pile Up as Shanghai Lockdown Upends Business","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) factory shutdown has stretched out to at least 12 days, much-needed semiconductors are piling up at manufacturers amid a shortage of truck drivers, and bankers are camping in their offices as Shanghai’s Covid-19 lockdown disrupts businesses in China’s financial hub. 
Cases are at a record in the city, now the epicenter of China’s worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, and the lockdown has been extended indefinitely. While the country is sticking to its rigid Covid-Zero containment playbook, President Xi Jinping’s request to limit the economic consequences is becoming harder to achieve in the face of the highly transmissible omicron variant. 
The lockdowns and virus containment measures threaten to slow China’s economic growth this year to below the government’s 5.5% target, according to Bloomberg Economics. They also risk further havoc on already stressed global supply chains, with companies from chip giant Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to a South Korean noodle maker caught up in the fallout.    
Why China Is Sticking With Its Covid Zero Strategy: QuickTake
Electric-car pioneer Tesla on Tuesday told some suppliers and workers that its Shanghai factory -- which has been shuttered since the city went into a phased lockdown on March 28 -- will remain closed at least through Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. 
Following a separate a two-day shutdown in March, Tesla has now lost 12 days of production in recent weeks, including this week’s holiday. The first Gigafactory outside Tesla’s home country produced half of its vehicles last year, and builds cars not just for the lucrative Chinese market, but for export to Europe and elsewhere in Asia. 
A spokesperson for Tesla China didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Staff at banks and fund management firms that were called back to work before the lockdown started remain stuck in their offices.
One fund manager said he and colleagues plugged up a floor drain on concern it could facilitate viral spread after a few people on the level above tested positive but were delayed moving into a quarantine facility, mandatory for all Covid cases in China regardless of severity. 
Workers are worried about an outbreak emerging, and while the firm has been trying to come up with a solution it’s a difficult problem to solve, said the person, who asked not to be named talking about private company matters. 
What Bloomberg Economics says:
Shanghai’s lockdown has dealt a blow to China’s economy. But an out-of-control outbreak would lead to an even worse outcome. Choosing lockdowns -- despite their growing costs -- suggests China is not yet ready to take an alternative Covid exit path. -- Eric Zhu, economist
Some companies, including chip giants Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SMIC, as well as iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. have been able to keep plants running by implementing a so-called closed loop system where workers live on-site and are tested regularly. For the likes of SMIC, a new headache is emerging: securing the trucks they will need to get their chips to clients. A representative for SMIC declined to comment on logistics.

South Korean companies are also being affected, with operations at the Shanghai plants of noodle maker Nongshim Co., confectionery manufacturer Orion Corp. and cosmetics producer Amorepacific Corp. suspended since early this month. The companies all told Bloomberg News that they have been following instructions from local authorities and don’t know when they can reopen.
Singapore’s  Spindex Industries Ltd  (SI:SNEX), which supplies precision components used by the automobile industry, has extended the closure of its Shanghai plant until April 10 or whenever local authorities allow work to resume. The uncertainty over the extension of the lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the company’s financial performance, it said in an exchange filing.

""The company anticipates further negative impact on Sabra’s operating results in 2022, including in Sabra’s sales volumes and profit, which may also impact the company's results,"" Strauss said in a statement. 
""Currently it is not possible to estimate the influence on Sabra's or the company's results.""
Strauss, a maker of snacks, fresh food and coffee with an Israeli market share of 12.4%, last month said it posted 2021 profit of 639 million shekels ($199 million) on a 7.4% rise in revenue to 8.7 billion shekels.
Sabra, its international dips and spreads joint venture with  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), recorded in the same period a 42% drop in operating profit to $11 million due to an increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the partial shutdown of the plant in December as well as increased labour costs.
After an inspection and warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December, Strauss had said it started an adjustment plan at Sabra's plant in Virginia bringing a temporary reduction in production capacity and manufacturing costs.
In February, Strauss had said it expected a return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2022.
But it updated that timeline on Wednesday, blaming further delay on manufacturing disruptions in the past few days.

""There will be substantial delays and changes in scope and timing to the adjustment plan,"" it said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores worldwide, has bought nine solar photovoltaic (PV) park projects in Germany and Spain for a total of 340 million euros ($373 million) in its push to generate more renewable energy than it consumes. 
The world's biggest furniture retailer said on Wednesday it was buying the projects, which would have a combined capacity of 440 megawatts, from German developer Enerparc. 
""The expected production ... will be sufficient to cover all IKEA stores and warehouses in the two countries, making the operations of Ingka Group climate positive,"" it said in a statement.
IKEA operates through a franchise system with Ingka Group the main franchisee to brand owner Inter IKEA. IKEA as a whole aims to be climate positive, or reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than its entire value chain emits, by 2030.
""The projects are at early stages and are expected to become ready for construction at the end of 2022, continuing into 2023. The construction itself will take roughly six months,"" Ingka Group said.

The group now owns 547 wind turbines in 14 countries, 10 solar parks and 935,000 solar panels on the roofs of IKEA stores and warehouses, which together produce more than 4 Terawatt hours of electricity.

""We have to decide on a calendar to take 100%, but I think it would take minimum 18 months,"" Gallego said during an event called 'Wake Up Spain,' held in Madrid. He didn't detail how much IAG would eventually pay for Air Europa. 
The company will also have to secure antitrust approvals in several countries, Gallego said.
IAG announced in late 2019 it had agreed to buy its smaller rival for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) with the goal of building a big hub in Madrid, but the COVID pandemic and antitrust concerns derailed the merger.
As the pandemic tipped the airline industry into crisis, hitting Air Europa particularly hard, shareholders in both companies agreed to cut the deal's price tag to 500 million euros. 
Spain's government approved a 475 million euro rescue package for Air Europa in November 2020, a part of which could be converted into equity, meaning the Spanish government has also been involved in the talks since then. 
Negotiations had all but ground to a halt until last month when IAG agreed to grant Air Europa a 100 million euro loan convertible into a 20% stake.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS shareholders on Wednesday approved the bank's climate roadmap, after its first-ever such vote faced pushback from several investors and climate campaigners as not going far enough.
In all 77.74% of shareholder votes backed Switzerland's biggest bank's climate proposal -- presented to investors as their first ""Say-on-Climate"" -- setting interim targets to progress towards net zero emissions by 2050.
""Our 'Say-on-Climate' advisory vote is a key milestone on UBS's journey to net zero and as the first bank to have taken this step proactively, we are pleased with this result,"" UBS said in a statement.
The approval rate was the lowest of any of the proposals put to shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting.
UBS in March set targets aiming to cut its financing of fossil fuel emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, joining other lenders setting targets for the first time this year.
However, NGOs and shareholder groups pointed to gaps in the proposals.
""Globally we welcome UBS's decision to submit its climate plan to shareholder vote and the bank's commitment to net zero,"" said Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive at Swiss pension fund adviser Ethos. ""However, the current targets do not cover essential element(s) of the banking activity.""

Ethos recommended investors reject UBS's climate roadmap, saying its new reduction targets covered less than 50% of UBS's lending portfolio, excluding key areas such as capital markets underwriting. 
Proxy adviser Glass Lewis had recommended investors abstain from voting over a lack of disclosure concerning governance of the vote, while ISS had recommended approval.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 04:11AM ET</span>","Exclusive-India probes debt trustee units of SBI, Axis, IDBI on suspected fee cartel","By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust body is investigating the trustee units of State Bank of India, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank for suspected collusion on fees, triggering a lawsuit by a group representing them, documents seen by Reuters showed.
Indian regulations mandate that companies raising debt appoint a so-called ""debenture trustee"" to protect the interests of investors. The trustees charge a fee from the companies issuing the debt and make independent due-diligence checks on them.
The three under investigation - SBICAP Trustee Company, Axis Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship - are among the leaders in the business in India overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars by rendering trustee services for not just debt securities, but also real estate and other investment funds.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in a confidential December order stated the Trustees Association of India - a body where the trio are founding members - last year ""substantially"" increased the fee for assisting companies raising debt and prevented members from going below a floor price, thereby hurting competition.
The association has launched a court challenge in Mumbai that seeks to quash the antitrust investigation directive it has termed ""illegal"" and ""capricious"", according to court filings. The lawsuit will be heard on Thursday.
The antitrust probe and the impending court hearing, details of which have not been previously reported, could have ramifications on India's nearly $500 billion corporate debt market by altering costs and affecting the way trustees operate. 
A finding of cartelisation could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the fee was fixed by the trustees, or 10% of annual revenue for the period of violation, whichever is more. 
SBICAP Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship didn't respond to requests for comment. Axis Trustee, which is listed as President of the Trustee Association in documents, also didn't respond.
The CCI, which does not publicly disclose its cartel probes that are underway, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
COMPLAINT BY BORROWER
The antitrust case was triggered by a complaint from Indian gold financing company Muthoot Finance. When it wanted to raise debt in August last year, Muthoot received a costing proposal which was 300% higher than previous rates.
The documents showed that when Muthoot protested, IDBI said in an August email ""the new pricing structure is decided by the Trustee Association"", adding that ""any deviation by us in quoting the price would lead to adverse repercussion on us"".
The CCI, while ordering its investigation, noted: ""Such collective decision making by the association ... affects competition in the markets.""
In February it asked the trustee association to submit their meeting records and explain its role in fixing a minimum fee structure, one document showed.
The trustee association has defended itself in the court filings by saying the higher fee was justified as their cost burden had gone up over the years due to enhanced regulatory compliance requirements. 
It said it had informed the market regulator SEBI last year that the pricing structure will be decided by trustees, but it ""will not be below the benchmark floor price"".
The group said that the matter, by law, can only be investigated by a ""specialised sectoral regulator"", in this case SEBI.
SEBI, already ""provides enough checks and balances to deal with any price rigging (cartelisation),"" it argued.

Before approaching the antitrust body, Muthoot also lodged a complaint against the trustees with SEBI, which is still being reviewed, the documents stated.
SEBI and Muthoot did not respond to Reuters queries.

By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% while U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
The United States and Europe are set to announce later Wednesday new sanctions to punish Moscow over alleged atrocities in Ukraine, something Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky described as ""war crimes"" in a speech to the United Nations security council.
The European Commission has already proposed new sanctions including banning Russian coal imports and halting trade worth nearly 20 billion euros ($22 billion), and the White House said late Tuesday that its new measures will target Russian banks and officials and ban investment in Russia.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions already levied by the West as punishment have roiled markets, causing sharp rises in commodity prices, prompting fears of sharply slower growth this year. 
German factory orders fell 2.2% on the month in February in the runup to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, falling for the first time in four months and underscoring concerns over weaker growth in Europe’s largest economy. 
Also, dragging on the European markets are set to receive a negative handover from Asia and Wall Street after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard raised expectations of aggressive interest rate rises by the U.S. central bank, added to by hawkish comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard, normally seen as one of the more dovish members of the central bank policymakers.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 03:30AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Bond bears get their claws out,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
Treasury markets are in full-fledged selloff mode ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting. 
With a half-point interest rate rise mostly baked in for May, the debate has moved on to whether the Fed could kick off balance sheet reduction next month as well.
On Tuesday two normally dovish Fed officials, governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly, precipitated a fresh Treasury selloff with suggestions the run-off might commence next month -- alongside a rate hike.
Ten-year Treasury yields have jumped to the highest in three years, up some 20 basis points since Friday. And with the Fed apparently poised to become even more aggressive on inflation, the 2-year/10-year Treasury curve has normalised, having been inverted for around a week.
What bears watching is the ""real"" or inflation adjusted Treasury yield, the variable that can determine how much sense it makes to invest in riskier assets such as stocks and emerging markets.
Ten-year real yields remain negative but at -0.26%, they are on their way back to zero, levels not seen since March 2020. Remember, they were below -1% at the start of this year. 
On stocks, Tuesday's Nasdaq-led Wall Street selloff carried into Asia, pushing Japan's Nikkei 1.7% lower. Some stabilisation is creeping in however, with European shares marginally lower and U.S. equity futures flatlining. 
Europe has other problems to contend with, and not just the prospect of economic recession caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. French markets have woken up to the possibility that the country's two-round presidential election (April 10 and 24) might yield a shock win for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
The euro has slipped to a one-month low versus the buoyant dollar. Further weakness may be bad news for the inflation outlook especially as factory inflation is likely to have topped 30% in March.

Backed by China's Ant Group and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), Paytm raised $2.5 billion in India's biggest initial public offer (IPO) last November, but made a dismal debut on widespread concerns over its high valuation. 
Its shares, which have lost more than 70% from its IPO price of 2,150 rupees, rose as much as 4.3% on Wednesday to a near three-week high of 635.4 rupees following the news.

""We expect this to continue, and I believe we should be operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven in the next six quarters.""
Sharma said his stock grants would vest only when the firm's market capitalisation crossed the IPO level on a sustained basis.
Paytm shares also suffered after the central bank last month barred its payments bank from adding customers, and ordered a comprehensive audit of its IT systems, citing ""material"" supervisory concerns.

Retail banks or even smartphone banks such as Revolut or N26 have only a limited and standardised offering. This also applies, for example, to the U.S. robo-adviser Wealthfront, which UBS acquired this year.
Weiss said the group was primarily targeting clients with liquid assets of 100,000 to 1 million Swiss francs ($108,000 to $1.08 million). Weiss would not disclose fees, but called them ""significantly less"" than those of traditional private banks.
Alpian has secured 48 million francs in several rounds of financing so far. 

The firm, which also has offices in Rome and London, aims to employ around 100 people by year's end, from just under 70 now.
An initial public offering was not envisaged for now, but another round of financing was possible. Alpian wants to break even in 2025. ($1 = 0.9281 Swiss francs)

840,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 12:36AM ET</span>",U.S. buybacks seen at record highs ahead of earnings reports,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - U.S. stock buybacks appear to be hitting new records as companies head into quarterly earnings season, even as some investors worry about the growing threat of inflation, a potential recession and stagnant share prices. 
New repurchase announcements by U.S. companies reached over $300 billion in the first quarter, with March showing a strong year over year increase, suggesting buybacks have remained resilient in recent weeks, according to financial data firm EPFR, Informa Financial Intelligence.
Seen as a major contributor to Wall Street's gains in the past several years, stock buybacks will be in the spotlight when results are unveiled. Companies typically buy back their shares when they are feeling confident about the future and view their stock prices as undervalued. 
Investors are broadly worried about inflation and the threat of a recession on corporate outlooks, which could sour the willingness of companies to return money to shareholders in the form of big buybacks and dividends.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Monday his bank would reduce its stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules.
Also on Monday,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) said it would pause billions of dollars of stock buybacks to invest more in employees and stores at a time when the coffee seller faces growing unionization of its U.S. workforce.
""I don't think these are one-offs. I think you're going to see more companies perhaps slow down their buyback process and be more like they were in early 2020, thinking, 'how much cash do I need on my balance sheet to weather this particular storm if in fact we go into a recession',"" predicted Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
Graphic: S&P 500 buybacks hit record highs- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/BUYBACKS/akvezjyawpr/chart.png
S&P 500 companies plowed around $880 billion into buying their own shares last year, up from $520 billion in 2020, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report last month estimated S&P 500 companies in 2022 will spend $1 trillion buying up their own shares.
EPFR, Informa Financial Intelligence analyst Winston Chua, who tracks new buyback announcements, said that - at least for now - companies appear to be aggressively repurchasing their shares. New buybacks announced in March reached about $74 billion, compared to $54 billion in March 2021, Chua said. 
Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank in London, predicted that major companies' relatively strong balance sheets will give them the security to continue their current strong pace of buybacks.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' earnings to have grown 6.4% in the March quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, compared to over 30% growth in the prior quarter. 

The benchmark stock index remains down almost 6% from its record high close in early January, partly recovering from a loss of about 13%.
""Earnings look robust yet there is huge volatility. That's a classic thing company boards would look at,"" Peters said.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 11:50PM ET</span>",China's cash-strapped Kaisa in strategic pact with state firms,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Kaisa Group entered into a strategic co-operation agreement with state-owned China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings and China Great Wall Asset Management on joint venture arrangements and asset acquisitions.
Analysts said Kaisa's move could set an example for other distressed property developers, including China Evergrande Group and Shimao Group, to introduce state-owned enterprises or local governments for their restructuring.
Chinese state-owned firms are expected to acquire more assets from highly indebted private developers as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over the crisis-hit property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy. 
Kaisa said in a filing late on Tuesday the cooperation agreement will include new opportunities in property development in the Greater Bay Area, as well as other businesses such as cultural tourism and ferry.
The agreement is ""conducive to... revitalising (its) assets of commercial and residential projects, and alleviating short-term liquidity difficulties,"" the firm said in the filing.
Kaisa, the second-largest U.S. dollar bond issuer among Chinese developers after Evergrande, is restructuring its $12 billion offshore debt after defaulting on some bonds last year.
China Merchants Shekou, a flagship company of China Merchants Group, specialises in the development of commercial and industrial parks, while China Great Wall, owned by the finance ministry, is one of the country's four biggest managers of distressed debt.

""This is the first major restructuring announced by a developer so far and we think market should consider it as positive because this should pave the way for the smooth solving of its problems,"" Raymond Cheng, head of China research at CGS-CIMB Securities said. 
Kaisa's shares listed in Hong Kong has been suspended from trading since April 1 as required by listing rules because it was not able to publish its 2021 financial results by the March 31 deadline.

842,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 11:18PM ET</span>",China Tech Stocks Track Overnight Weakness After Hawkish Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese tech stocks fell, tracking overnight weakness in their U.S. peers, as hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve dampened sentiment toward richly-valued growth shares.
The Hang Seng Tech Index slid as much as 4.1% in early Wednesday trading after a one-day holiday in Hong Kong, with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. among the biggest decliners. The broader Hang Seng Index dropped as much as 2.1%. 
The slide suggests sentiment remains weak in the sector even after Chinese regulators over the weekend sought to defuse U.S. delisting risks with a radical rule change proposal. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index fell 4.6% overnight, after a two-day 12% rally, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index dropped 2.2%.
“Risks remain for the broader Chinese economy as Covid lockdowns prompt analysts to cut GDP and earnings forecasts, with the results season unable to ease worries,” wrote Marvin Chen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. 
In China, where stock markets opened for the first time this week, the CSI 300 Index fell by as much as 0.9%. Among worries included Shanghai’s growing Covid outbreak, the nation’s worst to date, with harsh restriction measures hurting the outlook for growth. 
Economists have been rushing to cut China’s growth forecasts as lockdowns and various curbs cover vast swathes of the nation. A Wednesday report by Caixin Media and IHS Markit showed China’s composite purchasing managers’ index for March slumped to 43.9, the lowest in more than two years and falling deeper into contraction. 
Asian stock markets also broadly fell, triggered by comments from Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who said the central bank will raise interest rates steadily while starting balance sheet reduction as soon as next month.

(Reuters) - Australian fertility services provider Virtus Health said on Wednesday it will consider a revised buyout offer from minority owner BGH Capital, weeks after it accepted a sweeter bid from rival suitor CapVest Partners.
In a takeover battle that has seen Virtus shares climb 55% since last December, private equity firm BGH Capital, which already owns 19.9% of Virtus, is now offering A$8.0 per share, valuing the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) specialist at A$683.5 million ($518 million) in total.
The revised offer is at a discount of 0.9% to Virtus' last closing stock price, and is 4.6% higher than BGH's previous offer of A$7.65 apiece.
Melbourne-based BGH's new proposed bid comes weeks after Virtus unanimously recommended to shareholders - including BGH - a cash offer of A$8.25 per share from investment firm CapVest, valuing Virtus at A$704.8 million. Virtus' deal with CapVest allows it to consider a superior proposal from BGH or another party.
London-based CapVest did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
""Virtus board is considering the BGH takeover bid, and in particular, whether it constitutes a 'superior proposal' under the transaction implementation deed signed with an entity controlled by CapVest Partners,"" Virtus said in a statement.
Shares in Virtus which has operations in Australia, Ireland, Denmark, Britain and Singapore, were up 0.7% at A$8.13 as of 0251 GMT while the broader market was down 0.7%. (AX)
BGH's new off-market takeover bid is structured as an all-cash offer, with no reliance on any tax rulings or capital returns, the private equity firm said.
The offer would provide shareholders with ""an opportunity to divest as much Virtus stock as they deem appropriate"" without having to pay brokerage fees, BGH said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Wednesday morning, with investors bracing for the U.S. Federal Reserve to reduce its debt holdings much quicker to curb inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.55% by 10:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.28%. Chinese markets re-opened after a two-day holiday, and the Caixin Services purchasing managers index for March 2022 was 42.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.74%, with markets also re-opening after Tuesday’s holiday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.94% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.88%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.82%.
U.S futures fluctuated in reaction to Wall Street’s losses overnight. Treasuries extended their losses, with the 10-year yield at the highest level since 2019 and in Asia Pacific, Australian and New Zealand bonds also dropped.
Worries about the war in Ukraine, triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, also remain. The U.S., European Union (EU) and Group of Seven are coordinating on a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, which could isolate the country even further and increase the war’s economic impact.
The sanctions under discussion include a U.S. ban on investment in the country, an EU ban on coal imports and increased penalties on financial institutions. They could also target Russian President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, political figures and tycoons.
On the central bank front, Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said that getting inflation under control is “paramount,” adding that the central bank could begin paring its balance sheet more quickly as soon as May 2022.
Brainard’s comments drew even more attention to the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due later in the day. Investors will be parsing the minutes for clues on how fast the central bank will hike interest rates and the pace of quantitative tightening. Concerns are also mounting that a more restrictive Fed monetary policy could lead to an economic downturn.
“The key risk for Wall Street correlated world stock markets remains the Federal Reserve tightening cycle,” Jefferies LLC global head of equity strategy Christopher Wood said in a note. Debt levels mean the impact of a tighter monetary policy will be much quicker, particularly if quantitative tightening comes alongside rate rises, the note added.
Investors will also be paying attention to speeches from other Fed policymakers throughout the week. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak later in the day, while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at separate events on Thursday.
In another sign of diminishing risk appetite, Bitcoin was on a downward trend and fell below the $45,000 mark."
845,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 09:05PM ET</span>",Analysis-Tesla's Musk may add to U.S. SEC ire with late report about Twitter stake,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Chris Prentice
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Did Elon Musk break U.S. securities laws again? 
Former securities officials and professors said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive may have missed a key disclosure deadline and filed the wrong paperwork when he bought 9% of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), a platform regularly used by the outspoken billionaire. Securities and Exchange Commission regulators could use any shortfall to try to punish Musk more for other lapses, some believe.
Musk on Monday disclosed that he bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the micro-blogging site's largest shareholder and triggering a rise of more than 27% in the company's shares. The filing said that March 14, 2022, is the date of the event that required the disclosure.
U.S. securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company, and in Musk's case the 10-day deadline was March 24. A late report could lead to a per-violation civil penalty of up to $207,183, according to Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
That is a financial slap on the wrist for Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $302 billion, according to Forbes, but the SEC could look into market manipulation allegations regarding the Twitter stock purchase and seek harsher sanctions in an ongoing investigation regarding his Tesla stock sales, experts say.
""This is not really a gray area. He acquired it and didn't file within 10 days. It's a violation. And so this is a slam-dunk case from the SEC perspective,"" Adam C. Pritchard, a law professor at University of Michigan Law School, said.
In addition, Musk filed a ""13G"" disclosure form for investors who plan to hold their shares passively, even though it emerged on Tuesday that Musk will take a Twitter board seat in order to push change at the company. 
That means he should have filed the ""13D"" form used by activist investors, officers and directors who have the ability to influence the management and policies of an issuer, said several lawyers. 
Eleazer Klein, co-chair of the global Shareholder Activism Group at Schulte Roth & Zabel, said Musk's use of the 13G form was not appropriate and that regulators could have reason to review the matter. 
Musk on Tuesday amended his earlier filing and filed the 13D form to report a change in his status to an active investor.
The SEC is already investigating Musk's Nov. 6, 2021, tweet asking his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. 
Musk is also bound by a 2018 SEC settlement that requires him to obtain preapproval on some of his tweets, after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said that he defrauded investors. 
Musk says the SEC is harassing him in a bad-faith effort to punish him for criticizing the government, and he is fighting to nullify the deal.
Pritchard said the SEC could ""tell a court that he's a recidivist violator of the securities laws and that he needs to be dealt with harshly.""
SEC and Tesla did not respond to requests for comments. 
Tesla shares closed down 4.7% on Tuesday. 
""REAL RISKS"" 
Musk also made comments about Twitter after his purchase but before disclosing his stake.
On March 25, Musk tweeted a poll: ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?""
A day later, Musk said he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform.
""Musk is taking real risks here,"" said Georgetown Law's Velikonja. Musk was playing a game with the SEC officials, saying, ""'Stop me if you can, but you can't,'"" she said, adding, ""I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file.""
Musk has been critical of Twitter and its policies of late, accusing the company of failing to adhere to free-speech principles.
""Arguably, his social media posts about potential alternatives to Twitter can be seen, in light of his previously undisclosed stake, as a form of market manipulation to affect the share price, but proving that seems difficult,"" said Howard Fischer, a former SEC counsel and a partner at law firm Moses & Singer. 
""The fact that the revelation of his stake caused a price rise that resulted in Musk's stake increasing in value is something that the SEC might look into.”
Twitter shares have surged since mid-March when Musk purchased his stake. The stake, valued at around $2.4 billion at the closing price of March 14, jumped to $3.7 billion as of Monday's closing price.
In addition, some well-timed trades in Twitter options days before Musk revealed his purchase are raising eyebrows among options analysts. 

The SEC would likely investigate if anyone who knew about the acquisition of the shares traded in advance of the filing, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement attorney and government investigations and securities enforcement practice chair for law firm Dickinson Wright.
""I really think that would be the focus rather than the tardiness,"" Frenkel said.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has complained of increased military pressure by Beijing to try and force the democratically ruled island to accept its sovereignty.
The package would include training, planning, fielding, deployment, operation, maintenance and sustainment of the Patriot Air Defense System and associated equipment, the Pentagon said, in a notification to Congress.
""This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" it said. 
""The proposed sale will help to sustain the recipient's missile density and ensure readiness for air operations. The recipient will use this capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen homeland defense.""
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties and the anger such weapons sales always generate in Beijing.
Taiwan's presidential office noted this was the third arms sale announced since President Joe Biden took office, and showed the ""rock solid"" nature of their relationship.
""Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself, and continue to deepen cooperative partnerships with the United States and other like-minded countries,"" spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement. 
Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.
The Pentagon said Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) was the prime contractor for the possible sale.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it expected the deal to ""become effective"" within the month.
The United States is Taiwan's main international arms supplier.

The Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said on Tuesday it will launch disciplinary proceedings into what is dubbed the ""China Union Pay process"", which was uncovered at Victoria's royal commission into Crown's licence.
Crown said in a statement on Wednesday they will fully co-operate with the VGCCC on the royal commission report's findings.
Shares of Crown were down 0.5% in early trading. 
According to the Royal Commission into the Casino Operator and Licence (RCCOL), the China Union Pay process involved use of the China Union Pay bank card between 2012 and 2016 to ""allow international patrons to access funds in order to gamble at Crown Melbourne,"" evading Chinese currency restrictions. 
RCCOL found that ""Chinese patrons were assisted in illegally transferring up to A$160 million in funds."" 
""As a first step, we are acting on the Royal Commission's findings that Crown's China Union Pay process breached important Victorian regulatory obligations, was illegal and constituted serious misconduct,"" VGCCC Chair Fran Thorn said, with the regulator promising there will be more to come.

(Reuters) - WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said the future of Hollywood is in the blockchain as he prepares to leave the media company that he helped lead into the streaming era.
Kilar said he saw new opportunities at the intersection of storytelling and technology although he declined to discuss his next pursuit. 
The veteran tech executive said he had no plans to retire after announcing his departure from AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unit WarnerMedia ahead of its merger with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc in a deal expected to close this month.
Kilar's career has straddled Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and he sees blockchain, the digital ledgers that keep track of transactions across computer networks, as transforming the entertainment business, especially as the process of acquiring unique digital collectibles such as Non Fungible Tokens becomes simpler.
""I think that's going to be a potential wave that's going to be coming to Hollywood, in the same way that the DVD wave came to Hollywood in the '90s,"" Kilar told Reuters in an interview after he announced his departure to staff on Tuesday. 
""Obviously, that changed the economic fortunes of a lot of these companies, WarnerMedia included.""
The blockchain may also open up new forms of financing, Kilar said.
STREAMING WAR 
Kilar has a long track record of pushing technology and change in entertainment.
The former Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive was recruited to lead Hulu, because he did not rely on a set of assumptions about the way television should work, according to executives who were involved in the creation of Hulu. 
Within two months of Hulu's launch in March 2008, the site, once dubbed by critics in the blogosphere as ClownCo, surged in popularity.
Kilar left Hulu in 2013, following disagreements with the company's owners, the former News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), NBCUniversal and the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which had pushed for more advertising and an end to the free version of the service. 
Kilar launched his own subscription video service for social media content, Vessel, which was subsequently sold in 2016 to Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and four years later he joined WarnerMedia, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading.
That experience led him to changes which threaten to reshape Hollywood. Faced with closed movie theaters and surging competition online, Kilar shattered the traditional release ""windows"" for films, which have always brought movies into homes after lengthy showings in theaters.
Kilar premiered new films in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day, during the pandemic. The experiment began with the premiere of ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on Christmas Day 2020, and continued through 2021. 

The move provided a steady flow of new entertainment to the service at a time when the pandemic had disrupted production schedules throughout the industry. It also helped the fledgling HBO Max, and the HBO cable TV network, to add 73.8 million subscribers.
“History has shown that incumbents tend to fight trends that challenge established ways,"" to their detriment, Kilar wrote in a 2011 blog post.

(Reuters) -Twitter Inc said on Tuesday it will offer Elon Musk a seat on its board of directors, a position the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss and entrepreneur plans to use to bring about significant improvements at the social media site after disclosing a sizeable holding.
Musk reported in a regulatory filing on Monday that he had amassed a roughly 9% stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), making him its largest shareholder. 
""Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months,"" Musk tweeted. Parag Agrawal is Twitter's CEO. 
Beyond the promise of big change at Twitter, Tesla Inc's CEO, who often chooses unconventional paths, has provided little detail.
Musk will be involved in strategic decisions, including the direction of Twitter's Bluesky project and the addition of an edit button, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
He will not have a say on the platform's moderation, what speech gets banned or whose accounts get restored, the source said - a policy that applies to all board members.
Twitter shares closed up 2%, at $50.98, on Tuesday, after gaining over 27% on Monday. Tesla shares were down 4.7%. 
Musk's appointment will potentially block chances of his making a takeover bid because Musk, whom Forbes ranks as the world's wealthiest person, cannot own more than 14.9% of Twitter's stock either as an individual shareholder or as a member of a group as long as he is on the company's board.
The disclosure of his stake on Monday stoked widespread speculation, ranging from a full takeover of the platform to taking an active position. 
Musk has not indicated an interest in acquiring the company, the source said.
Musk on Tuesday made an amendment to the securities filing to report a change in his status from a passive investor to an active one, amid controversy that he may have filed a wrong paperwork. https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-may-add-sec-ire-with-late-report-about-twitter-stake-2022-04-05
“Not one to shy away from controversy or speaking his mind, Musk always carries some compliance risks,"" said Andrew Wang, managing partner at Runnymede Capital Management. 
Musk also disclosed in his filing on Tuesday that he bought the combined 73 million shares in Twitter for $2.64 billion from Jan. 31 to April 1. That works out to an average price per share of $36.14.
Twitter shares had closed at $39.31 on Friday, ahead of Musk's disclosure of his stake.
""INTENSE CRITIC"" OF TWITTER SERVICE
Twitter executives tweeted out congratulations after the announcement. There is hope that Musk's presence can revive the platform, which has struggled to attract users, and possibly stir interest from retail investors. 
""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term,"" Twitter CEO Agrawal said in a tweet.
Musk, who calls himself a free-speech absolutist, has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a Twitter poll asking users if they believed the platform adheres to the principle of free speech. 
After disclosing his stake on Monday, Musk put out another poll on Twitter asking users if they want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media platform has been working.
Bluesky is a company funded by Twitter to develop a new operating standard for social media. The company is working on building an open protocol that would allow different social media companies to operate together. 
Musk reached out to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Agrawal shortly after he built his stake on March 14, telling them he wanted to join the board, according to a source familiar with the situation. They were eager to bring him on board, believing he could bring buzz to the platform as well as good ideas, the source said.
Dorsey tweeted that he is ""really happy Elon is joining the Twitter board!"" adding that Agrawal and Musk will be ""an incredible team."" 
NERVOUSNESS
Musk's board position ""may lead to some nervousness about Mr. Musk getting too much influence about the way Twitter is run, with a view to bolstering his own personal brand and that of his companies,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, has made a number of announcements to his over 80 million followers on the social media platform. 
""Our day-to-day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees,"" a Twitter spokesperson said. 

His board term expires at Twitter's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the company said. 
Musk's new role as a board member at Twitter could be a further distraction from work at Tesla. He is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and tunneling venture the Boring Company. He said in January that Tesla would not launch a $25,000 electric car, saying, ""We have ... too much on our plate, frankly.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on global indexes fell on Tuesday while U.S. Treasury yields rose to multi-year highs as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard put investor focus on the possibility of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the central bank to curb inflation.
The U.S. dollar hit its highest in nearly two years.
Brainard said she expects a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.
Separately, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly pointed to the next meeting, scheduled for May 3-4, as a possible start to the balance sheet reduction.
Wednesday brings the release of minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting. The ECB will publish its equivalent minutes on Thursday.
Tech and growth shares led the decline on Wall Street, with higher rates seen as a negative for growth stocks.
""For the rest of this week, the market will be driven by interest rates and it will be driven by the Fed's comments about interest rates,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Investors were also keeping a close watch on developments on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the West preparing to expand sanctions to include a ban on all new investments in Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that Russia must be held accountable over allegations of war atrocities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 280.7 points, or 0.8%, to 34,641.18, the S&P 500 lost 57.52 points, or 1.26%, to 4,525.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 328.39 points, or 2.26%, to 14,204.17.

In Treasuries, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 13.1 basis points to 2.543%, while the 2-year note yield was up 7.2 basis points at 2.500%, leaving the 2-10 spread at 3.97 basis points after having been negative for the most part since last week.
The dollar index rose as high as 99.526, the highest since late May 2020.
The euro weakened amid concerns about the outcome of the French elections. It was down 0.6% at $1.0901 and matched a low of $1.09 hit on March 14.
The Australian dollar gained, boosted by the prospect of policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Aussie dollar rose 0.4% to US$0.77521, while the New Zealand dollar gained 0.2% to US$0.6937.
Soaring global energy and food prices mean almost 60% of developed economies now have year-on-year inflation above 5%, the largest share since the late 1980s, while it is above 7% in more than half of the developing world.

Oil prices eased Tuesday, partly because of the rising U.S. dollar and increasing COVID-19 cases.
Brent futures fell 89 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $106.64 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.32, or 1.3% to settle at $101.96.

The report comes on the same day as WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar announced his departure, just ahead of the closing of a merger between the AT&T (NYSE:T) unit and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc.
A representative of AT&T did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Earlier in the day, Variety reported that Andy Forssell, HBO Max executive vice president and general manager, is leaving the company.
Sarnoff joined WarnerMedia in 2019 and oversaw HBO and HBO Max, the Warner Bros studio, cable channels and the consumer products division. Forssell, who reports to Kilar, also joined the firm in 2019.
AT&T on Feb. 1 agreed to spin off WarnerMedia in a $43 billion transaction to merge its media properties with Discovery. Shareholders of Discovery and the U.S. Department of Justice have cleared the deal.

The move by the agency, which had already pulled its authorization for the sotrovimab therapy in much of the U.S. northeast last month, sent shares in Vir Biotechnology 11.5% lower.
The highly contagious BA.2 coronavirus sub-variant is estimated to make up about three of every four COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the latest government data.
GlaxoSmithKline and Vir have said treatment with sotrovimab retains neutralizing activity against the BA.2 sub-variant, but others, including researchers from Columbia University, disagree.
Vir Biotechnology in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the two companies were preparing a package of data to support the use of a higher dose of sotrovimab for the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, which will be shared with regulators globally, reiterating the companies' plan from last month.
Vir still expects to recognize about $1.1 billion in collaboration revenue when sotrovimab doses are delivered in the first half of 2022.

The companies also plan to submit an application for full approval of the drug in the second half of the year, and expect to start two late-stage trials in the second quarter to assess whether sotrovimab can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised patients, Vir said.
GSK spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer said the company will continue to work with governments and health systems, and ensure ongoing access to sotrovimab.

(NYSE:SAVE) confirmed media reports it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) for $33 per share, making the total bid value approximately $3.6 billion (all-cash transaction). This price offer represents a roughly 40% premium to  Frontier Group Holdings  Inc's (NASDAQ:ULCC) cash and share offer for Spirit in early February, with an implied value of approximately $23 a share at current prices. Following the news, Spirit's shares rose more than 22% today before being halted, while JetBlue closed around 7% lower.
According to the industry analysts, the Spirit and Frontier merger, which was expected to bring about $1 billion in annual savings for consumers and make the combined company the nation's fifth-largest airline by market share, makes sense due to the overlapping business models and different regional strengths of the companies. In a Spirit and JetBlue merger, the analysts see less of a clear fit, given that both airlines are heavily concentrated in the Eastern US. Furthermore, Spirit keeps costs and fares low by charging extra for add-ons, while JetBlue, the sixth-largest airline in the US, offers more premium options and free in-flight perks.
While the board of directors of Spirit has not made a decision yet on which deal to pursue, it will review JetBlue's bid.
Either deal has the potential to face scrutiny from the Biden administration. Several progressive lawmakers expressed misgivings about the Frontier and Spirit merger during the last month, with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont warning about the risks related to ticket prices increases and lower customer service if the deal goes through."

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell on Tuesday, pulling back from a record intraday high, as the potential for aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes weighed on investor sentiment.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended down 154.77 points, or 0.7%, at 21,930.83, after earlier touching a record level of 22,213.07.
Wall Street's main indexes also fell after comments from Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard spooked investors about potential aggressive actions by the central bank to control inflation.
The drop in U.S. stocks was a ""headwind"" for the Toronto market, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.
""Canada is definitely more of a resource market than the United States and when you're at the beginning of a rate hike cycle - that can be a bit of a headwind.""
Canada's energy sector retreated 1.6% as oil prices fell. U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.3% lower at $101.96 a barrel, pressured by a rising U.S. dollar and growing worries that new coronavirus cases could slow demand.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday, dragged by weakness in tech and other growth stocks, after comments from Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard spooked investors about potential aggressive actions by the central bank to control inflation.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its biggest daily percentage drop in about a month, with declines in heavyweight stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) .
At a conference on Tuesday, Brainard said she expects methodical interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.
Brainard's comments ""drove home the point that the Fed is poised to get more aggressive,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
“That is certainly having a negative effect on equities because of concerns that this increases the probability of a recession,"" Hooper said. ""It’s going to be increasingly difficult for the Fed to engineer a soft landing the more aggressive it gets.”

Among S&P 500 sectors, technology slumped 2.2% while consumer discretionary fell 2.4%. The utilities sector rose 0.7%.
U.S. Treasury yields rose to multi-year highs with yields taking off after Brainard's comments.
The prospect of a more hawkish Fed led to a rocky start to the year for equities and in particular for tech and growth shares whose valuations stand to be more pressured by higher bond yields. Stocks have rebounded in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 now down about 5% so far this year.
Focus on the Fed will continue on Wednesday, when the central bank releases minutes of its March meeting.
“For the rest of this week, the market will be driven by interest rates and it will be driven by the Fed’s comments about interest rates,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Investors also remain focused on the Ukraine crisis, which has led to rising commodity prices that stand to worsen an already-worrisome inflationary picture.
In economic news, data showed U.S. services industry activity picked up in March, boosted by the rolling back of pandemic restrictions, but businesses continued to face higher costs as supply strains persisted.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase on Tuesday started to allow holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies to cancel them, two sources familiar with the matter said, giving some investors a way to liquidate what have largely been frozen holdings.
The move comes after the London Stock Exchange (LSE) halted trading in the depositary receipts of Russian companies roughly a month ago after prices plunged due to a slew of Western sanctions slapped on Russia for its invasion of the Ukraine. 
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.
The sources did not want to be identified because the information was private.
JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, is the issuer of a handful of depositary receipts in Russian companies listed on the LSE, such as oil major Rosneft, according to Refinitiv.
Investors in depositary receipts have the right to cancel them, but issuers suspended cancellations after the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring local Russian shares. With those restrictions recently lifted, issuers are able to reopen cancellations.

JPMorgan is the second depositary receipt issuer to reopen cancellations after BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) started offering clients an option to withdraw from the receipts and receive in turn the underlying shares in Moscow for a fee last week.
Last week, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said the country was mulling forcing Russian companies whose depositary receipts are traded abroad to return to the domestic market.

Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who is awaiting a confirmation vote to take the reins as Fed vice chair, said the Fed is “prepared to take stronger action, if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”
Brainaird also said the Fed could start to “reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.”
The hawkish remarks come ahead of the release of the Fed’s meetings from its March meeting expected to reveal more about the central bank’s plan to begin balance sheeting reduction.
Treasury yields jumped sharply, with the 10-year yield rising above 2.5% rising to a nearly three year high to growth sectors of the market including tech.
Big tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) excluded, was in the red. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), were down more than 1%, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), however, bucked the trend lower, adding to its gains from a day earlier after the social media company announced that Elon Musk would join its board.
Consumer discretionary stocks also dragged the broader market lower as weakness in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and casino stocks including Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (NYSE:LVS) offset gains in cruise stocks.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) was up 1% and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) rose more than 2% after the latter reported record one-day bookings, stoking investor optimism about the return of demand for cruises following a pandemic-fueled lull.
Energy stocks were on back foot as oil prices gave up gains even as the European Union detailed plans to impose new sanctions on Russian oil imports.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Major online platforms face a yearly fee up to 0.1% of annual net income to cover the costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring them to do more to police their content, an EU document shows.
The Digital Services Act (DSA) rules are likely to be agreed between EU countries and lawmakers later this month. Levying such a fee would be a first for the European Commission, which is the bloc's executive body.
The move comes as the Commission seeks new sources of revenue to fire up the region's economic growth in the wake of the pandemic and also foster a greener and more digital economy. It would need scores of experts to enforce the new tech rules.
""The overall amount of the annual supervisory fees shall be based on the estimated costs the Commission incurs in relation to its supervisory tasks under this Regulation,"" said the document, which was seen by Reuters.
""The fee shall not exceed 0.1% of the global annual net income of the provider of very large online platforms (or very large search engine) in the preceding financial year.""
The fee should be proportionate to the size of the service as reflected by the number of its recipients in the EU, it added. The Commission defines very large online platforms subject to the DSA as those with 45 million or more monthly active users.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told lawmakers and member states last month that the fee could raise between 20 million euros ($22 million) and 30 million euros annually, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Not-for-profit providers of very large online platforms and very large online search engines will be exempt from the fees, the document said, a move that will benefit companies such as Wikipedia and research bodies.
Vestager's proposal is likely to get the nod from member states and EU lawmakers, which are scheduled to meet on April 22 for the fourth round of negotiations and widely expected to result in a deal.

868,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 03:52PM ET</span>","FOMC Minutes, Oil Inventories, Oil Executives: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com – Stocks fell on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve official hinted at more aggressive tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check in the months ahead.
Lael Brainard, who is awaiting confirmation as Fed Vice Chair, said getting inflation down was a top goal of the central bank, which could start to reduce the size of its balance sheet by May and shrink rapidly.
Those words were enough to send tech stocks tumbling, with the Nasdaq down more than 2% in late trading.
But the world will be watching for the words the Fed officials shared during their meeting last month for guidance on what the Fed plans to do next. Those words, in the minutes of the meeting, come out on Wednesday.
Investors are also bracing for a fresh round of sanctions on Russia to be announced this week, which could take aim at the financial and energy sectors, after reports of atrocities on Ukraine civilians.
Meanwhile, the markets are awaiting the next batch of earnings, which start pouring out later this month. With war in the Ukraine creating more uncertainty by the day, energy prices remain elevated and investors will be eager to hear what corporate executives say about costs and labor trends.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Awaiting Fed minutes
Market participants will be keeping a close eye on the FOMC March meeting minutes, which will be released Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET. Traders will be examining monetary policymaker's thoughts on the future interest rate hike path and any comments on tapering.
2. Inventories
The Energy Information Administration's crude oil inventories data, which measures the weekly change in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by U.S. firms, will be released tomorrow at 10:30 AM ET. Analysts forecast a draw of 2.056 million, above the previous draw of 3.449 million barrels.
3. Energy execs testify
The House Energy and Commerce committee invited a bunch of oil company executives, from  BP  PLC (LON:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and others, to answer their questions about high gas prices and the industry’s role in pricing markets. The hearing starts at 10:30 AM ET.

""Even if the government is not actively supporting the environmental agenda, we are maintaining our investment plans with private companies emphasizing that this is important for them to be more resilient to the effects of climate change,"" Martin Spicer, IFC's director for Latin America and the Caribbean, told Reuters.
Spicer's comments highlight the investment group's willingness to keep sustainability as its main guideline for investments in the country. About 60% of the nearly $2.8 billion invested annually by the group in the region have this condition.
In addition to ongoing investments in renewable energy projects, IFC sees opportunities for it to participate in sanitation-related projects in the country after a new framework for the sector was approved, according to the executive.
Besides the environmental agenda, IFC, which is part of the World Bank Group, has also discussed investing in more basic education projects using technology and health, especially for emerging businesses.

In March, the group signed a $150 million loan to Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil to finance small businesses in the health sector in the country.
""Investing in venture capital is part of our business,"" Spicer said, adding that the effects of the pandemic in Latin America have opened up a number of new opportunities to support companies with high growth potential in such areas.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday they will develop a series of lower-priced electric vehicles based on a new joint platform, producing potentially millions of cars from 2027 in a bid to beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in sales.
The announcement expands on plans for GM to begin building two electric SUVs for Honda starting in 2024 - the Honda Prologue and an Acura model.
The automakers said the new deal is for ""affordable"" EVs, including compact crossover vehicles, built using GM's Ultium battery technology. The compact crossover is the biggest selling auto sector in the world with annual volumes of more than 13 million vehicles, the companies said.
The companies declined to say how much they are investing as part of the new collaboration.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Tuesday at an Axios event the pricing will come in below the $30,000 price tag planned for the electric Chevrolet Equinox SUV. She said the new lower-priced vehicles would be ""attainable EVs.""
She said the new vehicle is part of GM's plan to surpass Tesla in EV sales.
""We have a very important goal... that by mid-decade, by 2025, we'll sell more EVs in the U.S. than anyone else and to do that, you need to have a portfolio of vehicles,"" Barra said, noting GM plans a wide range of small to large EVs. ""We definitely can scale and can do it quickly.""
The companies said they will also discuss future battery technology collaboration for electric vehicles in a push to drive down costs.
The deal is part of GM's push to achieve carbon neutrality in its global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles in the United States by 2035. 
Honda has said it aims to reach carbon neutrality on a global basis by 2050.

The Japanese carmaker owns a stake in GM's Cruise self-driving car subsidiary and the carmakers are co-developing the Cruise Origin autonomous EV. The companies also have a joint venture to develop and produce hydrogen fuel-cell systems at a plant in Brownstown, Michigan.
""Honda and GM will build on our successful technology collaboration to help achieve a dramatic expansion in the sales of electric vehicles,"" Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on Tuesday said it has sanctioned KPMG LLP's former vice chair of audit for his role in a high-profile scandal involving leaked information from the accounting industry oversight body.
The PCAOB fined Scott Marcello $100,000, its largest ever penalty against an individual, for failing to reasonably supervise KPMG personnel who engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain and use confidential PCAOB information. The settlement marked the first time the PCAOB has imposed sanctions for ""failure reasonably to supervise,"" the board said in a statement.
PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said the ""first of its kind"" disciplinary action was a sign of the board's commitment to sanctioning top-level personnel at the largest firms.
During Marcello's tenure as KPMG's vice chair of audit from July 2015 until April 2017, several of his subordinates obtained confidential lists of upcoming audits, which they used to help pass the firm PCAOB inspections. Marcello failed to take appropriate action after learning about the leak in early 2016, the board said.
Marcello could not be reached immediately for comment. KPMG fired Marcello and five employees involved in the scheme in 2017. The Justice Department later charged the five employees.
A spokesperson said the KPMG is a ""stronger firm as a result of the actions taken since 2017 to strengthen our culture, our governance and our compliance program"".
KPMG, one of the Big Four accounting firms, paid a $50-million civil penalty in 2019 to the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the leak and other misconduct that agency's enforcement director at the time described as ""astonishing"" in its breadth and seriousness.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. authorities on Tuesday announced criminal and civil charges against the former head of a now-defunct British company for making a fraudulent bid to buy U.S. aerospace and defense company  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) for about $13.8 billion.
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Melville ten Cate and his London-based Xcalibur Aerospace Ltd were never in a position to complete a tender offer for Textron, including because they lacked financing.
Prosecutors said ten Cate, 53, a dual U.S.-Dutch citizen now living in Dubai, is at large. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
The defendant was accused of making overtures to Textron over nearly two years before placing a Nov. 9, 2020 advertisement in the New York Times - which he never paid for -offering to buy Textron shares at $60.50 each, a 56% premium.
According to the SEC, ten Cate falsely claimed on Xcalibur's website to have lined up $11 billion in financing, and in an interview with the regulator's staff lied about the financing and his company's ability to complete the tender offer.
Xcalibur claimed to have produce high-speed unmanned aircraft systems.
Shares of Textron rose as much 15.9% after the tender offer, which the Providence, Rhode Island-based maker of Beechcraft and Cessna business jets dismissed as ""fictitious."" Textron reported having 228.9 million shares at the time.
The Justice Department separately accused ten Cate of trying to defraud banks and investors out of $500 million by inflating Xcalibur's financials and prospects, and saying the company had nearly 9.8 billion British pounds ($12.8 billion) in cash.
""Fraudsters talk big and hope no one looks too closely at the bottom line,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan said in a statement.
The Justice Department charged ten Cate with tender offer fraud, securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.

The SEC filed related civil charges and is seeking a fine. Both cases were filed in Manhattan federal court.
A British court put Xcalibur into liquidation last July, the U.S. authorities said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, under pressure from falling tech stocks after U.S. government bond yields surged as Federal Reserve officials continued to back aggressive monetary policy tightening to rein in above-target inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%, or 145 points, the Nasdaq slumped 1.8%.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who is awaiting a confirmation vote to take the reins as Fed vice chair, said the Fed is “prepared to take stronger action, if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”
Brainaird also said the Fed could start to “reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.”
The hawkish remarks come ahead of the release of the Fed’s meetings from its March meeting expected to reveal more about the central bank’s plan to begin balance sheeting reduction.
Treasury yields jumped sharply, with the 10-year yield rising above 2.5% rising to a nearly three year high to growth sectors of the market including tech.
Big tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) excluded, was in the red. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), were down more than 1%, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), however, bucked the trend lower, adding to its gains from a day earlier after the social media company announced that Elon Musk would join its board.
Consumer discretionary stocks also dragged the broader market lower as weakness in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and casino stocks including PENN and LVS offset gains in cruise stocks.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) was up 1% and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) rose 2% after the latter reported record one-day bookings, stoking investor optimism about the return of demand for cruises following a pandemic-fueled lull.
Energy stocks were on back foot as oil prices gave up gains even as the European Union detailed plans to impose new sanctions on Russian oil imports.
“If this [an EU embargo on Russia oil] were to happen, demand would switch to an even greater extent to other sources of supply, which would result in considerable price rises,” Commerzbank said in a note.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) led the sector to the downside.
On the economic front, services activity in March slightly missed forecasts, though economists continue to expect the sector to rebound as the reopening gathers pace. 
""Demand for services remains robust, and we expect that this will continue through the Spring and into the Summer at a minimum,"" Jefferies said in a note."

Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow cut the rating for Ralph Lauren to equal weight from overweight, lowering the price target to $110 from $135. 
Boruchow said the company operates in the highly competitive and fragmented apparel sector that has probably been ""over-earning"" for 12-18 months.
In addition, the analyst pointed to increasing consumer challenges that could dampen future spending. If there is a slowdown in the apparel sector, he believes mid-tier players such as Ralph Lauren are most at risk.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian Economy Ministry official Caio Mario Paes de Andrade has emerged as a strong candidate to lead state-run oil company Petrobras, after energy consultant Adriano Pires declined the government's nomination, a government official told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The source, who requested anonymity to comment on private discussions, said Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has avoided participating actively in the selection process, but he supports the nomination of Paes de Andrade given his defense of a smaller and more efficient public sector. Guedes has long called for the privatization of Petrobras.
Paes de Andrade and the Economy Ministry declined to comment on the matter. 
The Mines and Energy Ministry said it was evaluating new candidates to lead Petrobras.
""At the moment we are looking at profiles, not names,"" Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque told Reuters, without saying whether Paes de Andrade was in the running for the position.
Paes de Andrade, who holds a master's degree from Duke University and currently advises Guedes on digital governance, had been considered for the job even before Pires was tapped to be chief executive, according to a second government source.
Pires backed out of the nomination on Monday, saying it was clear he could not reconcile his consulting work with running the oil company, known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
Pires had been tapped by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to take over as the top executive of Petrobras on March 28, following disagreements between the far-right leader and current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna over the company's fuel pricing policy.
Newspaper O Globo first published on Tuesday that Paes de Andrade had become a likely candidate for Petrobras CEO. Valor Economico and O Estado de S.Paulo also reported that Paes de Andrade was in the running.
According to the O Globo report, which did not cite specific sources, several ministers are now backing Paes de Andrade for the job and he has already been interviewed by Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque.
Asked on Monday about who could be chosen for the job after Pires declined, Guedes said he had ""no light"" to shine on the matter. 

Petrobras said in a securities filing late on Monday that it had not yet received any information from the Mines and Energy Ministry on who could replace Pires.
Petrobras shares were little changed in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo, slipping 0.1% as the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1.2%.

Generali had asked IVASS in February whether a 16.3% combined stake acquired by two of its main investors, Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, and a third smaller shareholder Fondazione CRT, would have required prior authorisation.
Generali declined to comment on the IVASS decision.
Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle that has cast doubts on the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, whose term ends in April and is backed by the largest investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and the outgoing board. 
The three investors had struck a consultation pact last year to challenge Mediobanca over the renewal of Generali's board.
Caltagirone quit the pact in January, to prevent, sources said at that time, regulatory scrutiny on whether the alliance was indeed a consultation pact or represented a more substantial concert party which could have seen its voting power curtailed.

Del Vecchio and CRT dissolved the pact last week. Caltagirone has put forward an alternative candidate for the role of CEO in a challenge to Donnet's reappointment.
As part of its ordinary supervisory activities, IVASS continues to closely monitor events regarding the company's shareholding structure, and it reserves the right to take steps if needed, it said in a statement.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc has secured rocket launches with three companies, the company said on Monday, as it spends billions on putting together a satellite constellation to beam broadband internet that will rival Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink.
The e-commerce giant said its Project Kuiper has secured 83 launches over five years and includes a deal with Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and chairman Jeff Bezos. 
The race to beam broadband internet using thousands of satellites in low earth orbit is heating up, with SpaceX so far gaining advantage over other players. Project Kuiper plans to launch its first two prototype satellites by year's end. 
""Amazon is investing billions of dollars across the three agreements. Together, it is the largest commercial procurement of launch vehicles in history,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters.
The contract includes 18 launches with Arianespace's Ariane 6 rockets, 12 launches with Blue Origin's New Glenn - with an option to add up to 15 more - and 38 launches with the Vulcan Centaur rocket made by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
Together, they will provide capacity for the company to deploy the majority of its satellite constellation, the company said.
The deals are betting on three heavy-lift rockets that have yet to fly and whose development has been delayed. Arianespace’s Ariane 6, under development, could launch up to 40 Kuiper satellites each mission, said the company’s chief executive Stéphane Israël. 
Also under development, Blue Origin’s New Glenn will carry 61 Kuiper satellites while ULA’s Vulcan will carry 45, the companies’ CEOs said Tuesday at a conference in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Dave Limp, head of Amazon’s devices unit, said the company “wanted diversity in our launch partnerships,” which includes previously announced deals with ULA and rocket startup ABL Space.
""It's the largest contract ever signed by Arianespace in its history,"" ArianeGroup CEO André-Hubert Roussel told Reuters, declining to provide financial details. ""It's the result of two years and half of talks with them,"" he said, adding that the launches would take place between 2024 and 2027.
Project Kuiper aims to use over 3,000 satellites in low earth orbit to beam high-speed, low-latency internet to customers, including households, businesses and government agencies.

Securing launch capacity from multiple providers reduces risks associated with launch vehicle stand-downs and saves costs that can be passed on to customers, said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper.
Blue Origin's BE-4 engine, which will also power the Vulcan rocket, has faced multiple delays.

The Kaluga region, 190 kilometres (120 miles) southwest of Moscow, says it has attracted more than 1.3 trillion roubles ($15 billion) in investment, mostly foreign, since 2006.
But Western sanctions imposed in recent weeks after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine have exacerbated lingering component shortages and halted production at two flagship car plants, Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Sweden's Volvo. 
A third, the PSMA Rus plant that is a joint venture between Stellantis and Mitsubishi and employs 2,000, may halt production soon due to a lack of parts, Stellantis' chief executive said last Thursday. 
""It is not clear what will happen. They don't give us any concrete information,"" said Pavel Terpugov, a welder at the PSMA Rus plant. 
Terpugov said he needs twice as much money to buy groceries than before the sanctions. Analysts have forecast Russian inflation could soar to 24% this year, while the economy may shrink to 2009 levels.
The United States and Europe are weighing more sanctions against Russia after Ukraine accused Russian forces of civilian killings in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave was found in Bucha, outside Kyiv.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" and the Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.
One source of hope for some in Kaluga, with its 325,000 residents, is the West may be reluctant to hurt its own companies. 
""Does it make sense to impose sanctions on its own plant and lose money?"" said Valery Uglov, an auto mechanic at the Volkswagen plant. ""Does it make sense to lose the Russian market?"" 
""We hope to return to work as soon as possible and everyone will have confidence in the future again,"" Uglov said.
Volkswagen, whose factory employs 4,200 people, in early March suspended operations. A spokeswoman said production remained frozen.
Volvo Group, which employs over 600 people to build trucks, also suspended production.
Even before the sanctions, Russian car sales had contracted from 2.8 million units from when the Volkswagen factory opened in 2007 to 1.67 million units last year, damaged by both sanctions after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Some factories cut output last year due to disruptions caused by the pandemic.
""We have had similar furloughs at the factory... but now, of course, the situation is different, more serious,"" said Alexander Netesov, a warehouse foreman at the Volkswagen plant. ""But we are waiting anyway, we are not losing hope,"" he said. 

In a sign of the squeeze workers are feeling, Netesov said a new Polo car he ordered with a factory discount had increased in price by 20% since his pre-order.
Others in the city, which also boasts production by pharmaceutical and food companies as well as Samsung (KS:005930) televisions, derive optimism from the fact that almost every crisis that has ravaged the Russian economy over the past two decades has been followed by a boom. ""I hope, we all hope, that in the near future everything will stabilize,"" said Angelina Minnigulova, a marketing executive at Volkswagen dealer KorsGroup, which has seen a fall in demand as car prices soar.

FROB said on Tuesday it had bought a 4.24% stake in Sareb, set up in 2012 to take on bad loans after the financial crisis, to raise its holding to 50.14%. No price was given but several sources with knowledge of the matter said it was merely symbolic.
The move comes after the government in January approved a legal framework allowing FROB to surpass the 50% threshold in Sareb following the EU order.
FROB didn't say which banks had sold their stakes but a source at Sareb said some smaller holders, such as Bankinter, had tendered their stakes. Bankinter declined comment.
Santander (MC:SAN) remains the biggest private shareholder with a 22.2% stake, followed by Caixabank with 12.2%.

Several Spanish banks have been planning to sell their stakes in Sareb, which has struggled since its creation as a slump in real estate prices has depressed the value of loans and assets, but most had retained their holdings for tax reasons.
After selling 17.1 billion euros of all debt issued, Sareb still holds 33.7 billion euros in senior debt.

The investment cements a ""very strategic, very deep partnership that we want between the two groups,"" Farfetch CEO José Neves told Reuters in an interview, noting it was the largest deal for the online retailer in the U.S.
The move comes as luxury groups rush to meet strong demand for high end fashion and accessories in the U.S., which emerged as the key market for the sector last year, boosted by a quick rebound in local consumption.
Under the partnership, Farfetch will power the website and mobile application of Bergdorf Goodman, the New York-based luxury department store that Neiman Marcus acquired in 1972.
Both Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus will join Farfetch's online marketplace, adding brands in key markets globally, the companies said.
The expansion of Bergdorf Goodman's ecommerce business into markets abroad could take place in a ""matter of months,"" once the store's platform is outfitted with services from Farfetch, said Geoffroy van Raemdonck, CEO of Neiman Marcus Group.
The deal is a ""strategic opportunity for Farfetch to stand out among service providers and to benefit from the strength of the local US customers,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein, noting the move represented consolidation of the sector with Farfetch benefitting from sales assistant tools developed by Neiman Marcus. 

Farfetch joins Neiman Marcus' existing investors, which include PIMCO, Davidson Kempner Capital Management and Sixth Street.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)removed its COVID-19 notice against cruise travel on March 30, roughly two years after introducing a warning scale showing the level of coronavirus transmission risk on cruise ships.
Miami-based Carnival said 22 of its 23 ships are now back in operation at its U.S. ports.

Cruise operators said the health agency was discriminating against the industry, when hotels and airlines could operate with limited or no restrictions.
In the wake of the Ukraine conflict, Carnival has already modified its trips to avoid stopping at Russian ports in the summer, and will also withdraw from any halts in the country for the remainder of the year.

The disruption involved attempts to place one of the two jets under development onto jacks but the weight on some of the jacks exceeded the limit, causing concerns over aircraft damage, the report added. (https://on.wsj.com/3u95Swi)
Boeing and the Pentagon are in negotiations over a delivery schedule for the new Air Force One jets, the Journal reported.
Last year, Boeing said that it found two empty tequila bottles on one of the Air Force One planes being developed in San Antonio facility, though alcohol is banned at all Boeing factories, according to media reports.
Former President Donald Trump had criticized the U.S. planemaker for high price tags for the heavily modified 747-8 aircraft. The company, however, received a $3.9 billion contract in 2018 to build two aircraft to be used as Air Force One jets.

Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has also been plagued by production defects, while delivery delays have led to multiple complaints from airlines.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Acuity Brands stock (NYSE:AYI) plunged 9% Tuesday after the lighting products maker cited cost increases and shortages of raw materials as major challenges.
The company uses steel and aluminum to make its products, and prices of both of those materials have climbed to record highs in recent times in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A shortage of microchips is another worry for the company.
The company has also decided not to apply recent price increases to its backlog, honoring original agreements, according to MarketWatch.com. This is even as margins eroded in the second quarter.
CEO Neil Ashe told analysts in a conference call the company's backlog rose slightly from last quarter. He said transportation costs should ease, assuming upcoming talks with labor at the West Coast ports are resolved soon.
Net sales in the second quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 17% year-on-year to top $909 million.

(Reuters) - The European Commission proposed sweeping new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday including banning coal imports and halting trade worth nearly 20 billion euros ($22 billion) in retaliation over possible war crimes in Ukraine.
Here is a rundown of the measures, which must be approved by all 27 European Union states. 
They could be adopted this week.
IMPORT BAN
The proposals include banning imports of coal, wood, cement, liquors and seafood worth about 9.5 billion euros ($10.4 billion) a year, according to the European Commission. A source said the restrictions would also hit caviar, vodka, rubber and chemicals.
Coal alone is worth 4 billion euros a year, the Commission said. As a comparison, the EU imported about 100 billion euros of oil and gas from Russia last year. The Commission said it was working on possible sanction on oil, as well. 
EXPORT BAN
Brussels is proposing a ban on exports to Russia worth another 10 billion euros a year, including of advanced semiconductors, quantum computers, and other electrical and transport equipment. The export of technology for liquefied natural gas (LNG) would also be banned, according to a source.
SHIPPING
Russian vessels and trucks would be prevented from accessing the EU, further crippling trade. Energy products, food and medicines would be exempted, meaning for example that LNG cargoes from Russia would not be affected.
Applying the sanctions may be complicated, officials have repeatedly said because it is not always easy to identify the origin of a cargo ship.
The new sanctions would effectively halt transport of goods by road and sea. The EU has already banned air traffic with Russia.
RUSSIAN BANKS
The commission also proposed banning all transactions with VTB and another three Russian banks which have already been excluded from the SWIFT messaging system.
INDIVIDUALS
Thirty six more individuals, including oligarchs and politicians, will be added to the EU's sanctions list, according to an EU source. The existing sanctions list already comprises hundreds. In addition to this, separatist leaders would also be added.

COMPANIES
The Commission also proposed a ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement in the EU and the exclusion of all financial support to Russian public bodies.

(Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday as investors awaited a batch of fresh sanctions on Moscow, while France's blue-chip index slumped after opinion polls for presidential elections due later this month tightened.
French markets woke up to the risk of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's elections against Emmanuel Macron after Le Pen captured 48.5% of voter intentions in a poll on Monday - the highest she has ever notched.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.2%, paring back some gains made earlier in the day, while France's benchmark CAC 40 index lost 1.3% to clock its worst day in nearly a month.
""A victory for Le Pen would worsen public finances and place a question mark over France's place in Europe, unnerving investors,"" said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.
""At best, (Le Pen) would undermine and frustrate European policymaking and at worst, seek to dismantle EU structures from the inside... If polls continue to move in her favour, investors are likely to become much more concerned,"" Hinds said.
The spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds – the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt – rose to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the COVID-19 crash of 2020.
In response to civilian killings in a Ukrainian town, the European Union proposed sweeping new sanctions, including a ban on coal imports, which, if approved, would bar Russian imports worth 9 billion euros and exports to Russia worth 10 billion euros.
European utilities outperformed on the day, gaining 2.3%. Gains across renewables also boosted the Spanish blue-chip index IBEX, which was up 1.2% at more than six-week highs. 
Further boosting the utilities sector,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) double-upgraded Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind to ""outperform"", which pushed the stock up 8.6%.
""We see the evolution of regulation at the EU level as supportive to the sector, both in terms of renewables development and possible adjustments to the market design,"" CS said in a note.
Meanwhile, PMI surveys showed euro zone business growth got a boost last month from the re-opening of economies, but soaring energy costs and the war threaten recovery.

The STOXX 600 index has recovered about 14% from lows hit after Russia's ""special military operation"" into Ukraine began, but it is still down around 5% for the year. 
Aareal Bank rose 3.4% after a buyout group seeking to take over the German lender in a $2.2 billion deal said it had secured commitments from shareholders to tender around 37% of stock after it raised its offer price again.

(Reuters) -WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar will depart from the company after the AT&T (NYSE:T) unit's merger with media firm Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, according to a memo seen by Reuters. 
""With the pending transaction with Discovery nearing close, now is the right time to share with each of you that I will be departing this amazing company,"" Kilar said in the memo to employees on Tuesday. The merger is expected to close this month. 
Kilar took over as head of WarnerMedia in April 2020, just before the launch of the HBO Max streaming service. He oversaw a sweeping restructuring of the company that summer, focusing it on the streaming service and installing new leadership. 
A veteran tech executive who had worked at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and was the first CEO of the Hulu streaming service, Kilar broke with industry norms in 2021 with a decision to release new movies simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.
That announcement blindsided the talent community, with Christopher Nolan telling one industry trade publication that he and other filmmakers ""went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.""

The decision, however, provided a flow of fresh content to the fledgling streaming service and helped accelerate its growth. HBO Max and the HBO television network now boast 73.8 million subscribers.
""We've elevated technology, product, and design to the highest levels in the company,"" Kilar wrote in his memo. ""We're operating as one team, proudly and successfully going direct to consumers across the globe. It has been deeply gratifying to lean into the future alongside each of you and to do so with conviction.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter criticised the Canadian government's proposed bank tax in prepared remarks to shareholders on Tuesday, calling them a ""knee-jerk reaction that sends the wrong message to the global investment community.""
Porter said the proposed tax on banks' profits would ultimately affect shareholders, including pensioners and retail investors.
Canada's third-largest lender emailed Porter's speech to media after a positive COVID-19 test kept him from attending the meeting. Chief Financial Officer Raj Viswanathan read an abridged version during the bank's first in-person shareholders' meeting since the pandemic.
The Canadian Liberal party's plan to raise corporate taxes on the country's most profitable banks and insurers, announced as a campaign pledge in September, became more likely after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed a surprise deal with the left-leaning opposition New Democratic Party last month.
Most banks have been critical of Trudeau's plan to raise additional taxes.
Porter also criticized Canada's lagging private sector investments in research and development, which ""are where they were 20 years ago,"" and productivity challenges that existed even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and to warn that a shortage of workers poses a ""serious problem"" for the country's prosperity. 
""The key point here is that we need more investment, more innovation, and more skilled labour if we are going to overcome sluggish growth,"" Porter added.
He proposed the creation of a federal commission to help address these issues.

Scotiabank's board chair and CFO said at the meeting that Porter had tested positive for COVID-19, explaining his absence from the event. 
""The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and, as a result Brian is fully isolating,"" Viswanathan said at the event. ""Thankfully he has been triple vaccinated and we expect a full and quick recovery.""

""It's unacceptable and what I really don't understand is that you could want this and that people think this is okay,"" Sigrid Kaag said in an interview with Dutch broadcaster RTL after the publication of the airline's annual report.
This showed that Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith would receive several million euros in pay, benefits and annual and long-term bonuses in 2021, although the bonuses will be deferred.
A spokesperson for Air France said that Smith's fixed pay has been unchanged since before the pandemic and noted that he will not receive any bonuses he has been awarded until Air France has repaid most of the bailout money it received during the pandemic.
Kaag said the Dutch state, which bought a 14.3% stake in Air France-KLM in 2019 in order to exercise more influence over it, would vote against Smith's pay at the annual meeting in May.
The Dutch government agreed a 3.4 billion euro bailout package of loans and loan guarantees for Air France's Dutch subsidiary KLM in 2020, as part of a wider bailout for Air France.
Smith agreed to give up his bonus and a quarter of his salary in 2020 after an outcry over his pay in the Netherlands. 
Air France's annual report showed that Smith was awarded base pay of 900,000 euros in 2021, benefits of 287,000 euros, an annual bonus of 1.1 million euros and a long term bonus of 1 million euros. 

However, the bonuses will be deferred, under a decision by the European Commission, until Air France-KLM has repaid 75% of its bailout money.

Economy Minister Nadia Calvino acknowledged a shift towards online banking which accelerated during the pandemic had left part of the population more exposed to financial exclusion.
""(Financial services) is the area with the highest number of complaints from citizens, and one that has a very high degree of litigation,"" Calvino told a media briefing.
The new authority, whose creation is set out in a draft bill, will bring together functions previously performed by the Bank of Spain, supervisor CNMV and the Directorate General for Insurance and Pension Funds.
It will take on those bodies' responsibilities in the regulation of financial entities, investment companies, payment companies, and so-called fintechs or providers of cryptoassets.
In Spain, codes of good practice have had mixed success in the past, as in the case of mortgage contracts, where lenders were given room to directly renegotiate terms with clients. Mortgage complaints still account for the lion's share of those filed with the Bank of Spain. 
The independent financial customer ombudsman authority will fall under the umbrella of the Economy Ministry and will be free of charge for financial customers. It will be financed through a fee estimated at 250 euros ($273), levied on the financial firm involved, for each accepted complaint.

No timetable has yet been set for the progress of the draft bill or the creation of the new authority.

Investing.com --  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 4% Tuesday as reports came in that two large buyers have declined options to purchase more of its Covid-19 vaccines, a sign of a waning pandemic bringing down demand.
The African Union and Covax, the World Health Organization-backed group, decided not to obtain more of the vaccine as developing nations struggle to turn supplies into inoculations, Bloomberg reported.
Less than two months ago, the company had forecast higher vaccine sales for the second half of the year, pinning its estimates on Covid-19 becoming a flu-like endemic illness that would lead people to take shots on a regular basis.
While the African Union agreed to purchase 50 million doses for delivery in the first quarter, the body of 55 member states opted not to acquire another 60 million doses in the second quarter, according to the wire agency.
Covax turned down two purchase options - one for 166 million doses in the third quarter and a second for 166 million doses in the fourth.
Moderna said it has signed deals for $21 billion in 2022 vaccine sales, up from $19 billion announced in February."

Companies also announced fewer plans for future stock buybacks, the strategists said, with announcements as a percentage of market value coming in 50% below the pre-Covid five-year average. 
The trend is a stark reversal from the fourth quarter, when oil and gas producers drove a surge in buybacks, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, although that was before energy prices hit their highest in over a decade. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has driven commodity prices to historic highs, threatening to crimp corporate profit margins. 
BofA strategists also said they saw a greater case for dividends to outpace stock repurchases in 2022 “amid political risks to buybacks, a rising cost of debt (fewer levered buybacks) and elevated valuations versus rising demand for dividend income.”

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday said it is opening a review to ensure all defective batteries produced by LG Energy Solution have been recalled by automakers.
The auto safety agency noted Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler-parent Stellantis, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hyundai Motor have issued recalls since 2020 due to internal failures in high-voltage vehicle batteries that pose fire risks.
NHTSA said the equipment query covers 138,324 vehicles and will communicate with LG ""and other companies that might have purchased the same or similar equipment from LG, notify them of this defect in any vehicles they manufactured, and to ensure thorough safety recalls are conducted where appropriate.""
An LG Energy Solution spokesperson in a statement said the company understands the request by NHTSA is a follow-up procedure, adding, ""LG Energy Solution will fully cooperate with the inquiry."" 
Among recalls cited by the agency were GM's recalls of its Chevrolet Bolt EV that prompted it to halt sales and production of new models in August.
In October, LG Chem Ltd, which owns LG Energy Solution, said it would take a charge of 620 billion won ($510 million) in its third-quarter results in connection with the GM Bolt recall.
NHTSA noted in February that Stellantis recalled 16,741 2017-2018 Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicles after the automaker said hybrid battery packs produced by LG were involved in 12 reports of vehicle fires.

The automaker said it ""has not yet determined whether the battery packs were defective or the root cause of the fires.""
NHTSA also cited a March 16 Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) recall of 351 ID4 vehicles from the 2021 model year over batteries that may contain insufficient soldering points and potentially unreliable connections inside the high voltage battery. VW said vehicles may break down while driving, potentially leading to a crash.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – First Solar stock (NASDAQ:FSLR) traded 3.6% lower Tuesday after BofA Securities downgraded it to ‘underperform’ and cut the target to $65.50, around 23% lower than its current level of $81.51.
Analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith was earlier ‘neutral’ on the stock with a target of $76.5.
According to StreetInsider, the analyst believes that too much “good” news is priced into the shares, making them “susceptible to significant derating”.
The U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating alleged circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties by solar manufacturers in Asia. While one would expect any punitive measure by the Department to be a tailwind for the company, the analyst believes the policy has consistently failed to drive pricing power.
“We highlight still rising aluminum costs, and pass through on elevated bunkers as yet to materialize on freight in particular,” the analyst wrote in a client note.
The company last month disappointed with its fourth-quarter numbers.
October-December net sales rose 50% to $0.9 billion but were still short of estimates. Full-year sales were $2.9 billion, and the company is now projecting that to fall to at least $2.6 billion in the current year. Sales could be even lower at $2.4 billion, according to the company’s guidance.
The company closed December with a contracted backlog of 26.2 GW.
The company issued a wide range for its 2022 projected operating income, implying a significant fall to $55 million-$155 million in 2022 from $587 million. The company blamed this on production start-up expenses and underutilization of losses related to factory upgrades.
The company is setting up new factories in India and Ohio."

The analyst said that in a year in which Coinbase's adjusted EBITDA losses could be $500M, he questions the thinking behind chasing NFTs, ""especially as the NFT hype seems to wane.""
“Our analysis of internet searches shows interest in NFTs has dramatically declined from its highs earlier this year,” Dolev wrote.
He estimates that the company could spend approximately $300 million on building the NFT platform. The price target was slashed based on “lower-than-expected 1Q volumes and medium-term pressure."""

An Amazon Logistics spokesperson, however, said the strike action was limited and had ""no impact on the daily operation of the sites"".
Morgane Boulard, a representative for the CFDT union at Amazon Logistics, told Reuters that 1,200 staffers had joined the walkout since it started on Monday.
At stake is a dispute over an overall annual pay rise. Amazon has offered a 3% rise, while unions say a 5% increase is a minimum. 
Boulard said a group representing several unions had agreed that it would not hold talks on any offer below 5%. 

Five unions - Sud, CFDT, CGT, CAT, CFE-CGC, have called for the strike. Unions and management are due to meet again on April 14, Boulard added.
""Within the framework of annual salary negotiations, we proposed wage increases that were above the average (increase) of the Transport and Logistics branch as well as other advantages, and these issues are still being discussed,"" Amazon France said in a statement.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>",Explainer-Can Russia make payments on its sovereign debt?,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has blocked the Russian government from paying owners of its sovereign debt from reserves held at U.S. banks, raising the spectre of default unless Russia can find other sources of cash or a workaround within 30 days.
Russia has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far, despite unprecedented Western sanctions imposed after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But the task just became a lot tougher as Washington tries to up the pressure.
WHAT DID THE U.S. TREASURY SAY? 
Russia was due to pay $552.4 million on a maturing bond on Monday as well as an $84 million coupon payment on Monday on a 2042 sovereign bond.
The U.S. Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use foreign currency reserves held by its central bank at U.S. financial institutions to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a ""case-by-case basis.""
But, as of Monday, the U.S. Treasury said it would ""not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at U.S. financial institutions."" 
""Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" a spokesperson added. 
Roughly half of the $640 billion in Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves has been frozen by the United States and its allies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""
WHAT HAS CHANGED? 
The U.S. Treasury said the size of the payment due on Monday - the largest due on sovereign debt since the Feb. 24 invasion - had presented ""the right opportunity to force Russia into more difficult decisions.""
However, there was no suggestion U.S. banks might be banned from acting as correspondent banks - or processing any Russian debt payments. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been processing the recent debt coupon payments as a correspondent bank.
Russia may already have been using funds from the half of its reserves that have not been frozen by sanctions, and it could still turn to those resources to avoid default. 
It also still receives billions of dollars from exporting crude and gas. Analysing tanker traffic data, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates Russia's March oil export earnings will total $12.3 billion - up sharply on March 2021.
Moscow said on Monday it expected higher oil prices will boost its April revenue from energy sales by 798.4 billion roubles ($9.6 billion). 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?
The bonds have 30 day grace periods, meaning Russia still has time to pay before default is triggered. 
Russia's willingness to pay means - so far - it has swerved its first default of any kind since a 1998 financial crisis, and its first on international market debt since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
Russia has also been working on managing its external liabilities - last week it bought back about three-quarters of a $2 billion bond payment by paying in roubles just before it matured on Monday. The move was targeted at local rather than international owners though reduced its dollar liabilities. 
But there is another deadline looming: transactions by U.S. persons and entities with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund in relation to debt payments are only allowed under a temporary general licence 9A issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

That licence is due to expire on May 25 and the U.S. Treasury has not commented on whether it will be extended. 
Russia has more payments due on May 27, and has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis, roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.

Tereos, the world's second-largest sugar producer in volume and with large operations in Brazil, has been reshuffling its top management and reviewing its strategy since 2020 when a long-running internal feud led to the ousting of its chairman and CEO.
De Mot, a 58-year old Belgian, was previously interim manager in charge of transformation at airport services group Swissport. He also held board member and executive positions in the maintenance services, minerals production and packaging industries.
It is the first time that Tereos has appointed a non-French to lead the cooperative, the group's spokeswoman said. De Mot will start on April 7.

""His industrial experience and expertise in transformation are assets that will enable Tereos to deploy a progress plan at its various production sites and thus accelerate its return to sustainable profitability,"" Tereos said in a statement.
Gwenael Elies, the current chief financial officer who had served as acting CEO since de Raynal's departure, was appointed head of finance, information systems, legal, tax and human resources, Tereos said.

The higher price target reflects higher 2023 EPS estimates by 6%, although still below the consensus. Higher EPS comes on lower opex estimates, despite the fact that Walmsley also slashed revenue estimates for FB on the back of the Russia/Ukraine war and management comments.
""We think Street ests will move down in preview season, but we view this as largely expected by investors. We believe Instagram Newsfeed changes and improving Reels content/algo can drive better engagement that we expect to monetize later in 2022 and in 2023,"" the analyst said in a client note.
On what may send FB shares higher in the context of the Q1 earnings report, Walmsley mentions any improvement in engagement data and/or commentary to this effect.
While the timing is unclear, we think a ramp in Reels monetization, easing comps, and improvements in targeting/measurement can drive the multiple back towards its 3-year average of a ~9% premium to the S&P 500, or 22x P/E (vs 16.8x on our GAAP 2023 est), the analyst added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their Easter getaways disrupted or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand as pandemic restrictions are eased in Europe.
High rates of COVID-19 in Britain have caused staff absences for airlines and airports that were already struggling to recruit after workers deserted the industry during the pandemic. 
Low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) was one of the worst affected, saying it cancelled around 60 UK flights on Tuesday and expected to pull a similar number in the coming days. It cancelled more than 200 at the weekend and another 62 on Monday. 
Paul Charles, head of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said it could take at least two or three months to get through a nasty cocktail of staff shortages, COVID illness and a backlog in approving security passes for airport and airline workers. 
""It's ironic that the very desire to get people booking again, post-pandemic, is causing more difficult transport issues than those created by COVID itself,"" he said.
EasyJet said it was rostering additional standby crew, but it had cancelled some flights on routes where it runs frequent services so passengers had options to rebook.
British Airways (BA) cancelled 662 flights in the week to Sunday, aviation analytics firm Cirium said, though that includes long-haul flights suspended due to sanctions and restrictions, such as on Russia and COVID-affected parts of Asia respectively. BA declined to provide a figure for cancellations.
The carrier was also hit by another IT failure on Wednesday. The number of flights cancelled due to staff sickness in recent days was in the single digits, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
But delays in government-required checks for new staff were hampering the ramp up of flights into summer, he said, and it had already trimmed its planned increase in services by about 20 flights a day until the end of May.
ON THE GROUND
Staff shortages are a problem on the ground as well as in the air.
Queues at Manchester Airport, Britain's third busiest after London's Heathrow and Gatwick, snaked out of one terminal on Tuesday, and passengers complained of hours waiting at the baggage carousel.
The airport has apologised for the disruption.
""As we continue to recover from the pandemic and passenger numbers grow, security queues may be longer than usual at times,"" it said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Britain's Airport Operators Association said its members were increasing staff as quickly as possible.
But a combination of a tight labour market, delays in the security checks for new and returning staff as well as COVID-related absences could put some airports under strain. 
""This may mean longer queues at peak travel times,"" it said. 
Dublin Airport warned passengers that lengthy queues were likely for weeks as it rebuilds its operation and recruits and trains new security staff. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier whose passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels last month, has called on the Irish government to use the army to deal with the delays, fearing the impact on the key Easter holiday period.

Germany's biggest airport operator Fraport also warned passengers of Easter delays.
The group, which runs facilities in nine countries and the main airport in Frankfurt, aims to hire 1,000 worker this year and recruited about 300 in January-March, a spokesperson said.

Peabody, the biggest U.S. coal producer, jumped as much as 7.1% before the start of regular trading in New York. Arch, the second-biggest miner climbed as much as 6.3%, while Consol Energy Inc. gained as much as 8.6% as prices spiked in Europe.
Russia supplied about 18% of global coal exports in 2020, with Europe as the largest buyer. The prospect of restrictions on Russian coal has already upended international energy markets, driving prices to record highs, though in recent weeks they have erased some of those gains. 
However, it may be hard for U.S. suppliers to take advantage of surging international prices, said Ernie Thrasher, chief executive officer of Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC., the biggest U.S. exporter. Miners have already sold most of their output under long-term contracts and have few spare tons to deliver to Europe. Increasing production will be difficult because the long-term prospects for the dirtiest fossil fuel are grim, and producers have had little incentive to invest in new capacity. 
Those issues have been exacerbated by tight labor markets, while supply-chain bottlenecks would make it difficult to deliver additional tons to export terminals, Thrasher said. 
“I don’t see any ability for the industry to expand production,” he said. “It’s like looking at a sweet dessert that you just can’t reach.”
Prices in the U.S. have also been surging, surpassing $100 a ton last week for the first time in 13 years.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, struggling for direction as both the U.S. and Europe ratcheted up the sanctions pressure on Russia. 
On Monday, the U.S. Treasury had confirmed that it will stop Russia from servicing its foreign debt with dollars held in the U.S. banking system, forcing it to draw down reserves at the central bank instead. Earlier Tuesday in Europe, EU leaders proposed their first sanctions on Russian energy, albeit on coal, rather than on the oil and gas exports that bring Russia most of its export earnings. Both measures are relatively modest, incremental steps that reflect still-high levels of reluctance in Europe to accept economic pain as a necessary measure to end the war, even after evidence emerged at the weekend of atrocities committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian civilians.
By 9:45 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126 points, or 0.4% at 35,048 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was up by less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.4%, losing some of the sheen it gained on Monday thanks to Elon Musk's announcement of a stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Twitter stock continued to gain in early dealings, rising 6.4% after the social media giant offered Musk a board seat. 
However, the mood darkened after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard indicated that the Fed may start reducing its balance sheet at its next meeting in May, while Kansas City Fed President Esther George warned that the central bank may have to deliberately slow the economy in order to bring inflation down to a sustainable level. 
Among early movers, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock stood out after the cruise operator said it had had the strongest week for bookings in its entire history. The message also lifted the stock of other cruise operators, who can apparently look forward to a summer of pent-up demand being released after two years of devastation at the hands of Covid-19.
Carnival stock rose 8.5% to its highest in nearly two months, while Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock rose 5.6% and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) stock rose 3.6%.
Leisure-related services in general have appeared to be benefiting from strong tailwinds in recent days, with employment data signaling a strong hiring trend to cope with resurgent demand. That picture was further fleshed out on Tuesday as the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing PMI broke a sequence of three straight drops, rising to 58.3. The employment subindex rose to 54.0 from 48.5, while the prices subindex rose to equal its all-time high of 83.8, a reminder of the inflationary pressures bubbling almost everywhere in the economy at present.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.8% after it flagged what may be the most profitable quarter in its history, the result of oil and gas prices that have skyrocketed as the world economy has reopened in the wake of the pandemic and as sanctions against Russia have forced western nations to chase non-Russian supplies on the open market."

Sono said on Tuesday it would produce its first vehicles in Finland with supplier Valmet Automotive, rather than in Sweden as originally envisaged. 
The company had said in 2019 its production partner would be National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), the Swedish electric vehicle unit of Evergrande Group, but a binding agreement was not signed.
NEVS was in talks with venture capital firms late last year to find new owners as its Chinese parent struggled under more than $300 billion of debt.
Sono, founded in 2016 in Munich, is developing a fully-electric vehicle with solar cells integrated into the body, boosting the car's range by an average of 112 kilometres per week beyond the 305-kilometre range of its battery.
Valmet Automotive, whose largest shareholders include China's battery cell manufacturer CATL, also produces cars for Mercedes-Benz and makes battery modules at two plants in Finland, with a third opening in Germany this year.
Sono, which began trading on the NASDAQ in November to try to attract early-stage investors after finding itself on the brink of insolvency, is currently working to validate its mass production plans with vehicles being built in Germany.
It expects to produce a low four-digit volume of cars in its first year, with a view to ramping up to 43,000 a year, it said.
The net price of Sono's vehicle, currently 23,950 euros ($26,271), will rise to 25,126 euros once the company hits 18,500 reservations from the around 17,000 registered so far, it said, citing rising manufacturing costs.

The company aims to keep costs down by offering just one model, relying on third-party production and using off-the-shelf components from suppliers including Vitesco and Hella GmbH, it said in a November regulatory filing.

In the company's first major product launch since Barry McCarthy took charge as chief executive, Peloton said Guide is available for purchase in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia beginning Tuesday.
The Guide, which is available to existing all access members at no cost, has a TV-connected camera that displays workouts and helps users track their movements and is different from the Peloton's other products such as bikes and treads that focus on cardio exercises.
Peloton, a pandemic winner, unveiled the 'Peloton Guide' last year and had fixed a starting price of $495.

The company replaced co-founder John Foley with former tech executive McCarthy in February, amid investor pressure over sagging sales.
Under McCarthy, the company intends to explore various pricing models in select U.S. markets, as it hoped to attract more customers and return to profitability.

Smith estimates that Bitcoin miners made a slightly higher profit in March compared to February as the cryptocurrency's price surge outstripped global hash rate growth.
On the other hand, overall bitcoin mining profitability measured by daily block reward revenue per EH/s is down 46% from the record high it touched in November as a result of a significant jump in global hash rate and a drop in Bitcoin price.
Several publicly-traded miners are generating record revenues as a result of their own hash rate growth outshining the broader market, Smith said.
The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency has recovered in March, averaging $41,800 during the month, 3% higher than in February.
Bitcoins' 7-day rolling average price as of March 31 is almost in line with the price at the start of the year, though it remains down roughly 32% from its November peak. The cryptocurrency's realized daily annualized volatility plunged to 62% in March from 80% in February.
Smith noted the surge in the network hash rate in March as more mining equipment is deployed around the world. The analyst explained that a growing network hash rate bodes well for network security, however, it weighs on miner profitability as it makes the process of solving a block more difficult.
""We estimate the average network hashrate increased 1.6% to 201.0EH/s in March. We note the monthly average network hashrate has increased 47% and 16% over the past six and three months, respectively. The rate of increases seems to be abating in recent weeks, which makes sense given rising miner hardware costs and fairly stagnant bitcoin prices,"" Smith said.
The best-performing mining stock in march was Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), surging 23%, while Stronghold Digital was the worst performer, down 54%."

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock gained 5% in premarket Tuesday after the cruise operator reported its highest booking week in its history.
The company said the March 28-April 3 week showed a double-digit increase from the previous record seven-day booking total.
The surge in bookings reflects the strength in so-called “revenge travel” as people look to break free and travel after two years of the pandemic.
The company said 22 of its 23 ships are back in guest operations across all its year-round U.S. homeports. Its final ship, Carnival Splendor, will return to service from Seattle on May 2, the company said.
Its newest ship, Carnival Celebration, will join the fleet at PortMiami in November.
According to the company, by 2022-end, Carnival will have more capacity sailing than it had in 2019. In 2023, Carnival will put into service another new Excel-class ship, Carnival Jubilee from Galveston.
With the restart of cruising in Australia now set, Carnival is finalizing plans for its return there and will be announcing those details soon.
Gains in the Carnival stock also boosted shares of Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL)."

The world's richest person in the past months has said he is a free speech absolutist, while being vocal against Web3, a term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralized and whose commercial backbone is the non-fungible token (NFT).
Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Musk, though active proponents of cryptocurrencies, share skepticism around the metaverse, NFTs and Web3, what some deem to be the evolution of the internet.
From ridiculing Twitter's new CEO to calling NFT profile pictures ""annoying"", here's a list of Musk's tweets and comments on Twitter, Web3, NFTs and free speech.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 09:12AM ET</span>",French markets wake up to risk of Le Pen presidency,"By Julien Ponthus and Sudip Kar-Gupta
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -French stocks and bonds fell on Tuesday as markets started to acknowledge the risk of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's presidential elections against incumbent Emmanuel Macron.
France's benchmark CAC-40 equity index was down 1.3% by 1215 GMT, underperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index which was flat.
French government borrowing costs also surged, with yields on 10-year debt up 10 basis points.
The spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds -- essentially the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt -- rose to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the COVID-19 market crash of 2020.
Le Pen, whose presidential campaign has gained momentum in recent days, on Monday captured 48.5% of voter intentions in an opinion poll of a likely runoff against Macron, the highest score she has ever notched.
The Harris Interactive poll for business magazine Challenges said a Macron victory - which pollsters had considered almost a foregone conclusion - was now within the margin of error. 
""Markets woke up on Le Pen,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
French banks Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) took the biggest hits with losses of 4-6%, far more than the 1.3% fall on a broader European banking index.
One trader said the selloff was particularly notable in stocks seen vulnerable to a Le Pen election. 
""Look at Vinci and Eiffage, their underperformance is a casualty of Le Pen risk"", the trader said, pointing to the far-right leader's plans to nationalise French highway operators.
Shares in the two infrastructure groups fell around 5% on the day.
The turmoil rekindles memories of the 2017 election when fears of a far-left or far-right win sent French government borrowing costs soaring and pushed stocks sharply lower. 
Many investors see Le Pen's platform, which aims to keep the legal retirement age at 62 years, as generous in terms of public spending. She is also viewed as less business-friendly than Macron. 
""Le Pen would likely be seen by markets as less reliable on public spending and economic competitiveness, and an unenthusiastic motor and/or unreliable partner for Germany and NATO at a crucial moment for Europe and the West,"" NatWest economist Giovanni Zanni told clients last week. 
FRENCH DEBT
Zanni reckons a surprise win for Le Pen could deliver a 50 basis points hit to French 10-year spreads over Germany -- essentially the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt. That would take the spread to a similar level as Spain which has a lower credit rating.
In the run up to the 2017 election, spreads had blown out to nearly 80 bps. 
Francois Raynaud, multi-asset fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, said selling French debt -- known as OATs - versus the German Bund through 10-year futures was a good hedge against a surprise election result. 
""By default, it seems judicious to us to take up protection by being underweight in terms of French weightings versus other indexes, or via the OAT futures,"" Raynaud told Reuters on Monday, before the latest sell-off.
Many investors remain unfazed -- Grace Peters, head of EMEA investment strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank, still favours French stocks, especially luxury and energy which are less vulnerable to the domestic economy.
""A Le Pen victory is the wild card out there which could be disruptive. But the base case is still for Mr Macron,"" Peters said.
Others are scanning markets for risks. 

The euro fell a quarter percent against the safe-haven Swiss franc on Tuesday to a one-month low but Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, sees the euro's risk premium as likely to rise in coming weeks.
""Might financial markets also be showing signs of complacency ahead of the polls? We think that is a significant risk,"" he said.

However, the rising geopolitical risks and deteriorating fundamentals mean that investors should focus on the Low Risk/High Quality end of the Growth spectrum of stocks, Montagu said in a client note sent today.
Among companies that are high Growth or good Value, those that are relatively Low Risk have outperformed in March. This effect is seen in both US and European equities, but stronger for Value than Growth. This shows investors have been more selective with Value exposure in March, Montagu wrote.
Citi expects IT and Health Care to benefit the most due to negative yields and defensive characteristics, respectively.
Some growth stocks that meet Citi's criteria (Low Risk/High Quality Growth) are: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI), etc.

Revenue growth in March was 8% to push the Q1 growth rate to 7%. Although this growth rate is low, the analyst is encouraged that it increased in March after 9 straight months of deceleration.
The acceleration should continue going forward as comps begin to get much easier in April. While the App Store remains the largest component of services revenue, it has become less important to the overall business as evidenced by Dec-21 results. App Store revenue growth last quarter was ~13%, but growth for the overall services business came in at an impressive 24% (worth noting AAPL has called out Advertising as the top contributor to their services growth for 2 quarters in a row now), Daryanani said in a client note.
The current growth rate is much lower than the 17% consensus, although the analyst warns that the growth rate is likely to remain in the single digits.
Comps get easier starting in April, so we expect a return to double-digit growth at that time. The entertainment category remains a standout in terms of growth, likely due to the proliferation of streaming services. China and Japan remain the main drivers of the decel as both countries lap periods of strong growth, the analyst added.

Instead of the usual percentage increase, drug and chemical makers agreed to pay workers 1,400 euros each ($1,534), with companies below a certain profitability threshold paying only 1,000 euro per worker, the employers group and trade union IG BCE (NYSE:BCE) said in separate statements.
Wage talks for the 580,000 employees are due to resume in October, they added.
""The ramifications of this war will pose big challenges for our industry for years to come. It's all the more important that the social partners remain unified,"" said employers' association president Kai Beckmann, who is a Merck KGaA executive board member.
Germany, which relies on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and 25% of oil needs, has supported Western sanctions against Russia but has balked at the prospect of a near-term energy delivery cuts.
Germany will likely face a steep recession, with the energy intensive chemical industry exposed in particular, if sanctions were extended to Russian gas and oil.
Workers' purchasing power is already taking a hit from 7.6% inflation in March, the highest level in Germany in more than 40 years, as prices of natural gas and oil products soared.
The wage talks were the first due to conclude in an industrial sector in Germany after the invasion of Ukraine.

Go-Ahead, which runs more than 6,000 buses in England and Britain's largest passenger rail contract, said it plans to turn around underperforming businesses and grow in existing markets, which include Norway, Germany, Singapore and Ireland.
Its shares were up 6.8% to 900 pence at 1010 GMT after it said it plans to explore acquisitions and is looking at new urban mass transit services such as metro and light rail.
""Transport is at a tipping point as we recover from the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Christian Schreyer, who was appointed in November, said in a statement.
Go-Ahead plans to pay at least 50 pence per share in dividend for the year ending July 2, and said it would start distributing between 50% and 75% of its underlying earnings per share as payouts to shareholders from the current fiscal year.
The group suspended dividends in March 2020 after its operations were hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Go-Ahead's new strategy comes after it was fined 23.5 million pounds ($31 million) last month by Britain's transport department for overcharging by the operator's London and Southeastern railway franchise.
Schreyer said he was confident about the group's future.
""Go-Ahead's core strength is in commuter transport and we see opportunities to grow by encouraging people to leave their cars at home, by winning new contracts and through carefully selected acquisitions,"" he said.
Go-Ahead is also targeting annual operating profit of at least 150 million pounds and an increase in revenue to around four billion pounds in the medium-term, up by around 30% from 2021 after excluding recently discontinued operations.

Peel Hunt analysts said Go-Ahead could achieve the targets without new international contracts.

According to a GM release, the venture will particularly target the compact crossover segment, the largest in the world with annual volumes of more than 13 million vehicles.
“Our plans include a new all-electric product for North America positioned at a price point lower than the upcoming Chevrolet Equinox EV, building on the 2 million units of EV capacity the company plans to install by the end of 2025,” said Doug Parks, GM's Executive Vice President, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, in a press release.
The new EVs are expected to go on sale in 2027, starting with North America.

MILAN (Reuters) -The chances of the U.S. fund KKR pushing ahead with a firm bid for  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) faded, with the two sides deadlocked on Tuesday over access to the company's books.
KKR has told TIM it cannot confirm its 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) bid unless Italy's biggest telecoms group provides access to its data under a due diligence process, according to two sources with knowledge of a KKR letter to TIM's board.
TIM, which is pushing ahead with its own standalone plan, wants to give the fund access only once a formal bid is made.
KKR said in its letter it remained interested in buying TIM but would not confirm a bid without a due diligence as the war in Ukraine had changed market conditions, the sources said. TIM has cut its outlook and suffered a series of credit rating downgrades.
The letter said KKR remained available to assess deals that would create value for TIM and all its shareholders, the sources added. 
""Whilst at present we are not able to reconfirm our proposed offer, we remain at your disposal to either complete due diligence or explore any other transaction in the interest of shareholders and the country of Italy"", KKR said in comments seen by Reuters.
TIM shares slipped in Milan to just 0.31 euros, a long way short of the 0.505 euro price at which KKR's non-binding approach was pitched last November.
""The odds of the deal seem now very low,"" analysts at Banca Akros said in a note.
RESHAPING TIM
TIM boss Pietro Labriola is pressing ahead with a strategy to revamp the company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its services business in an attempt to unlock what the debt-laden group calls its untapped value.
As part of this, TIM has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber.
Such a deal, advocated by the government, would entail a role for infrastructure and private equity funds, including KKR, sources have previously said.
Separately, European private equity fund CVC has approached TIM about potentially taking a stake in an enterprise services business that could be spun out of the group.TIM's board is expected to discuss KKR's letter and the proposal from CVC on Thursday.

The portfolio comprises small and medium-size business loans secured by real estate.
In 2020, an entity affiliated with funds managed by Fortress Investment Group bought the portfolio from Alpha Bank, one of Greece's four biggest lenders, with a gross book value of about 1.1 billion euros. Fortress assigned transitional servicing to Greek loan servicing company Cepal.
DoValue will assume the servicing of about 50% of the initial portfolio comprising small business non-performing loans secured by real estate assets in Greece.
Greek banks have been cleaning up their balance sheets from NPLs via outright sales and securitisations in an effort to reach single-digit ratios to bring them close to euro zone averages.
Last October, doValue agreed a deal with National Bank, one of Greece's largest lenders by assets, to service a 5.7 billion euro bad loan portfolio. 

Verona-based doValue was set up in 2015 when UniCredit spun off its debt-servicing arm in a deal with Fortress Investment Group, the U.S. fund that was later bought by SoftBank.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks have begun quietly trying to persuade the European Union to tone down proposals to toughen scrutiny of non-EU lenders to ensure the planned measures don't also curb companies' access to international finance. 
Surprise EU proposals to 'clarify' when banks based outside the bloc can serve customers in the 27-country union with or without a local branch were tucked away in a draft reform of bank capital rules last October.
The proposals have put banks from Switzerland, Britain, Japan, the United States and elsewhere on the alert as many foreign lenders currently offer wholesale services in the EU directly from abroad without having to set up a costly branch there.
Bankers fear that political fallout from Brexit is prompting Brussels to build up autonomy in EU banking while making it harder for companies to shop around globally for services.
""The proposals represent a major change to the existing regimes regulating cross-border business into the EU, rather than a clarification of existing treatment,"" the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a lobby group representing Europe's wholesale capital markets, said in a note to members.
""The proposals would have a significant adverse impact on the ability of EU financial institutions, corporates, governmental entities and individuals to access international markets and cross-border services,"" AFME said.
Under national laws in some EU states which predate the single market, foreign banks can offer wholesale investment banking services such as advice on floats or mergers without the need for a local branch.
There are no figures available on this largely opaque activity.
Many foreign banks have operations in the EU but fear they would no longer be able to draw on expertise they have outside the bloc when needed. Those without an EU branch already may not have enough ad hoc business in the bloc to justify a branch, bankers say.
""This came completely out of the blue, though we thought something like that would happen because of Brexit,"" a senior official at a global bank said.
""Now that it's there, it's a wild card and it's very hard to predict what will happen.""
EU states and the European Parliament have the final say on the proposals with deliberations ongoing.
European banks, with more influence inside the bloc than their UK or U.S. counterparts, are putting together a submission to the EU. 
The banks say an EU branch should be a requirement for core banking, such as deposit taking and lending, in all cases. This would end the discretion some EU states have exercised, an official familiar with the planned submission said.
Investment services, however, should be governed by the bloc's ""MiFID"" securities rules, which have provisions to exempt a branch requirement for specified activities, the official said. Under the proposal as written, some of these activities could require a branch, the official said.
""We want to strike a balance between the objectives of the European Commission in terms of control, but without unnecessarily limiting too much the access of European companies to global services,"" the official added.
Bankers also want a cost/benefit analysis on the proposals from EU banking and securities watchdogs the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.
WHO CALLS THE SHOTS?
A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU body which drafted the proposals, said its intention was to clarify where a branch is required when offering banking services such as deposit taking.
They also clarify how this is separate from providing investment banking services under national laws in EU states, the spokesperson said.
""The proposed clarification will ensure that there is a level playing field for all banks operating in the EU, and that our supervisors have at their disposal the necessary tools to protect the financial stability of the European Union and its member states,"" the spokesperson added.
The European banks are treading carefully to avoid turning up the political heat from several factors which already make the outcome unpredictable, though few expect the status quo to remain.
EU finance ministers on Tuesday formally agreed to increase ""strategic autonomy"" in EU capital markets, partly to cut reliance on London-based financial services.
Bankers say they also don't want to be caught in the power battle between EU states who want to retain some say over banking on their national turf, and their regulator, the European Central Bank, which wants more visibility on foreign banking activity.
The proposals have also opened up debate over whether and who should decide if a foreign bank branch in the EU should become a subsidiary, adding further costs.

The ECB is also assessing whether new Brexit hubs opened by international banks in the bloc have sufficient staff and activity to justify their licences.
""The whole debate is about how much to tighten and who will call the shots,"" a banking industry official said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock traded 0.3% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company suggested its first quarter profit could be its highest since 2014.
Provisional numbers from the company for its quarter ended March 31 indicate operating profits from oil and gas could touch $9.3 billion when the company declares its numbers on April 29.
The boom in profits comes on the back of record-high oil and gas prices which have continued to make new peaks, most recently pushed higher by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Booming economies, harsh winters, and a stubborn OPEC+ that has been slow to raise output have otherwise kept the prices up.
International crude futures touched a 14-year high of almost $140 a barrel during the quarter.
The estimates suggest total earnings for the quarter of about $9.8 billion at the mid-point of Exxon's estimates, Reuters quoted Scotiabank global equity research as saying.
Impairments to  Exxon Mobil 's Russian operations could hurt the final results. The company last month said it would exit Russia, joining rivals and other companies following the invasion of Ukraine.
It holds a 30% stake in the Sakhalin-I offshore oil asset in Russia’s Far East and has $4 billion in assets at risk. It faces a 1-2% hit to production and revenue from the move.
Operating profits in refining could touch $1.8 billion, $300 million higher than the fourth quarter figure while the chemicals business could erode as much to $1 billion.

Under the latest extension terms, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s Optum unit, which offers healthcare data analytics services, will pay a $650 million fee to Change if the deal is not completed due to the court's decision, which is expected after a two-week trial scheduled to begin on Aug. 1.
UnitedHealth announced its $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare in January 2021, saying that it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.
The companies had originally planned to close the deal in the second half of 2021, but UnitedHealth extended the closing date to April 5. 
In its complaint, the U.S. Justice Department has said the deal will give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs, as both UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims.
Change Healthcare also said it would pay a special cash dividend of $2 per share to its shareholders at the time of closing.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 07:55AM ET</span>",HDFC Bank's $40 billion deal may face regulatory hurdles due to insurance ops - analysts,"By Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's largest private lender HDFC Bank's $40 billion acquisition of its biggest shareholder could face regulatory hurdles due to the stake it would give the bank in the insurance sector, analysts said. 
Sources told Reuters last year that the Reserve Bank of India, which acts as regulator for the financial industry, wants banks to limit ownership stakes in insurance companies.
HDFC Bank's acquisition of HDFC Ltd, announced on Monday, will create an entity with a combined balance sheet worth $237 billion and will include the target's insurance and other financial subsidiaries.
HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO are among the leading life and general insurance companies in the private sector, and analysts say the RBI is unlikely to be comfortable with the size of the insurance operations the deal will give the bank. 
HDFC Bank's management said on Monday that they have asked the regulator for clarity on complying with its rules, but analysts believe it may not be easy to come by.
""Considering there are lot of subsidiaries that need to be merged, there could be some regulatory overhang, particularly in the insurance business where the central bank is not very comfortable with banks increasing their stake,"" said an analyst at a domestic brokerage house.
HDFC Bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. The RBI also did not respond to a request for comment. 
One way of folding the subsidiaries into HDFC Bank could be to create a holding company structure, but that could have a negative impact on the balance sheet in the short term, analysts said. 
""If a holding company structure is enforced then the equation changes. Cost goes up as stamp duties and taxes will go up,"" Macquarie said in a note on Tuesday.
In the short term, return on equity (RoE), a key financial metric, will also go down as a result of meeting certain regulatory requirements, the Macquarie note said. 
As a shadow bank - a finance company outside the scope of traditional banking regulation - HDFC Ltd has a higher cost of funds compared to the bank. 
Post merger, the entity may therefore in the short term also see a higher cost of funds, which could affect its margin, said a portfolio manager at a retail brokerage firm.
""Due to this and other ambiguities regarding the deal and the performance, the stock may not see a big valuation re-rating immediately,"" he added.

HDFC Bank shares fell as much as nearly 3% on Tuesday, while HDFC Ltd slipped more than 2%. Both stocks had surged around 10% on Monday.
If it clears the hurdles to a deal, HDFC Bank will shrink the gap in size with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India, and pull further away from peers such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.

PARIS (Reuters) -French food group Danone said on Tuesday that ""all options are on the table"" regarding its business in Russia and that there was no decision at this stage to exit the country.
This was after a source close to the matter said Danone was looking at possible ways of withdrawing from Russia, as the West prepared new sanctions on Moscow after dead civilians were found lining the streets of a Ukrainian town seized from Russian invaders. 
The source had added no decision had yet been taken.
""The position of Danone regarding its business in Russia has not changed. All options are on the table and the group is monitoring the situation in close cooperation with the French government,"" a group spokesperson said.
A source had said earlier that Danone was ""reviewing a possible withdrawal from Russia,"" adding the company wanted to avoid losing assets or exposing local staff to trouble as well as avoid cutting the local population from food supply if it pulled out.
The company earned about 5% of its revenues in Russia in 2021 and less than 1% in Ukraine.

(Reuters) - DP Eurasia, which runs the Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) brand in Turkey and Russia, said it plans to stay in Russia, but could not give an outlook for the full year because of uncertainties linked to the war in Ukraine and inflation.
As many international companies limit their exposure to Russia following the launch of what it describes as a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24, DP Eurasia said last month it would limit further investment in the country.
However, CEO Aslan Saranga told Reuters on Tuesday the company planned to continue to operate in Russia and that it had a responsibility to stakeholders.
""We have franchisees over there, half of the stores, even if you want to close these stores, we cannot,"" he said.
The company said it could not give an outlook for 2022, citing uncertainties over the impact of the Ukraine conflict and high inflation in Turkey.
DP Eurasia, the largest pizza delivery company in Turkey and the third largest in Russia, has 188 stores in Russia and Saranga said it had not seen any major change in consumer demand since the start of the war in Ukraine.
It has about 3,000 employees in the country, compared to about 10,000 in Turkey, Saranga said.
The company's full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 58.5% to 208.4 million Turkish lira ($14.19 million), driven by a strong performance in Turkey and recovery in Russia.
It returned to a positive like-for-like growth rate of 9.6%, helping it to improve adjusted EBITDA by 907% in Russia.
Russia is its second-biggest market, representing 26% of its system sales, which comprise sales both from its own and franchised stores.
DP Eurasia, which also operates in Azerbaijan and Georgia, announced the launch of a new coffee shop and product brand, COFFY and has opened 11 stores in Turkey.

Saranga said the company tested the format during the pandemic and added the coffee is 30%-40% cheaper than its competition.
""The launch of a new coffee shop brand, COFFY, in Turkey is an exciting development and allows DPEU to leverage its existing infrastructure,"" Liberum analysts wrote in a note.

The Ariya, Nissan's second EV-only model after the Leaf hatchback, will now go on sale on May 12 in Japan. The company had most recently flagged a late-March launch.
The Ariya was originally slated for a mid-2021 launch but was delayed by COVID-related chip shortages. Sales in Europe are due to start this summer and the United States in the autumn, Nissan has said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, with investors taking a cautious stance ahead of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, the start of the new earnings season and the continuing war in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 90 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, ending up 1.9%, helped by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock gaining nearly 30% after billionaire Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in the social media giant.
Investors are focusing this week on Wednesday’s release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting. Expectations are growing that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May, after hiking by 25 basis points in March, especially after a jobs report that showed an unemployment rate falling to a new two-year low of 3.6%.
Ahead of the minutes, Tuesday sees the release of ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI data for March, at 10:00 AM EST (1400 GMT), which is expected to show increased momentum in March. Speeches from Fed policymakers Neel Kashkari, Lael Brainard and John Williams will also be closely studied.
The first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week, with companies having to cope with the ramifications of the Ukraine conflict, in addition to soaring commodity prices and supply chain constraints.
The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for the first quarter of 2022 is 4.7%, according to data from FactSet, which would mark the lowest earnings growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Twitter will remain in focus after Musk posted a poll asking users of the social media platform if they wanted an edit button, just hours after taking his hefty stake in the company.
Investors will also continue to keep an eye on the latest developments in Ukraine, with reports suggesting the European Commission is set to propose that Russian coal is part of a new round of sanctions following mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian troops on Ukrainian civilians.
Oil prices traded higher Tuesday on the prospect of these additional sanctions on Russia, adding to the strong gains seen in the previous session.
Additionally, the industry body American Petroleum Institute reports its weekly inventory data later in the session, after recording a drop of 3 million barrels last week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $104.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $108.82. Both contracts settled more than 3% higher on Monday.

The investment comes shortly after Musk tweeted that he is considering building a new social media platform. The billionaire also published a poll on Twitter, questioning the social media company's ability to adhere to free speech principles.
Yesterday, Musk asked Twitter users if they want to have an edit button on the platform, with over 1.2 million users voting in just three hours. More than 75% responded they want an edit button, a feature that Twitter has been working on for some time.
The poll was followed by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweet in which he urged users to vote carefully.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, also known to be a big Musk admirer, expects this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter.
""We will be following Musk's comments/future regulatory filings closely to see if Musk ultimately pursues further conversations with the Twitter board and/or goes to an active stake and above the key 10% threshold. For Tesla purposes, we view this move as Musk just further building out his tentacles,"" Ives said in a client note.

""Don't bet against Musk, but we wonder about the rationale behind his investment,"" Thill said in a client note.
Thill reiterates that investors are still focused on Twitter making major progress on 2023 revenue and daily user targets. Moreover, Jefferies believes the Twitter stock is expensive as it trades at over 100% premium compared to Meta Platforms (FB).
On why Musk decided to invest in Twitter, Thill believes he may be motivated to change Twitter's moderation policies.
BofA analyst Justin Post expects that Musk's investment will drive significant retail investor interest in, and activity for, the stock. Along these lines, the analyst also sees a greater risk to short sellers due to potentially higher retail interest/activity.
Moreover, Post is positive on Twitter shares as Musk may end up in the boardroom.
""We think Street doesn't expect an outright acquisition, but does see an increased potential for positive change at Twitter. The type of form used (13G) often indicates the investor isn't seeking to acquire control, or to influence who controls it.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 06:31AM ET</span>",Factbox-How U.S. banks are dipping their toes in the crypto water,"By Hannah Lang
(Reuters) - Last week, a top U.S. banking regulator warned of growing risks as banks start to capitalize on the popularity of cryptocurrencies to offer related services to clients.
Here is how some of the biggest banks operating in the United States have gotten involved in crypto: 
CUSTODY SERVICES
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) announced in February 2021 that it would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin for asset management clients, one of the first announcements of its kind for a major Wall Street bank. The launch is expected later this year. 
Clients will be able to store bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, in BNY Mellon crypto wallets, which will be created in partnership with crypto infrastructure company Fireblocks. 
U.S. Bancorp went live in October with bitcoin custody services. Bitcoin company NYDIG is acting as a sub-custodian for the bank. The services are geared toward institutional investment managers with private funds.
 State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) in March said it intends to offer cryptocurrency custody services in partnership with crypto infrastructure platform Copper.co, although it cautioned that the offering was subject to regulatory approval. 
Meanwhile,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) quietly revealed plans to develop a service to hold and trade cryptocurrencies for institutional investors in a 2020 report published by the World Economic Forum, adding it had already completed a proof of concept. 
Also in 2020, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) completed a proof of concept with crypto wallet provider Curv to develop a secure method to transfer tokenized securities. It said the development was a step toward creating an integrated custody solution for both traditional and digital assets. 
Deutsche Bank and BNPP did not provide an update on these projects when contacted by Reuters. 
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
A slew of big banks began offering wealth management clients exposure to crypto in 2021, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) leading the pack. CNBC reported in March that Morgan Stanley was enabling access to three bitcoin funds for clients with at least $2 million in assets held at the bank. 
In July, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) allowed its financial advisers to accept buy and sell orders from its wealth management clients for five cryptocurrency products, according to Business Insider.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co also began offering its wealthy clients cryptocurrency exposure in the summer of 2021, as did State Street.
JP Morgan and Wells Fargo both registered private bitcoin funds in partnership with NYDIG in August. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s wealth management unit created a digital assets group in June to facilitate investments in cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and central bank digital currencies, according to media reports. 
In March of this year, regulatory documents revealed that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is offering wealthy clients access to an ethereum fund through crypto company Galaxy Digital. 
TRADING
In March 2021, Goldman rebooted its cryptocurrency trading desk after mothballing it in 2019. That team, which sits within the bank’s Global Markets division, deals bitcoin futures and nondeliverable forwards, a derivative that allows the bank's clients to take a view on bitcoin's future price. 
In March of this year, Goldman Sachs went a step further and became the first major U.S. bank to carry out an over-the-counter crypto trade in partnership with Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused asset manager. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in July 2021 green-lit trading bitcoin futures for certain clients through a partnership with CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME), according to a report https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/16/bank-of-america-approves-bitcoin-futures-trading-for-some-clients-sources from CoinDesk. Bank of America declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was ""currently considering strategies related to cryptocurrency and other digital assets.""
Citigroup said last August the bank was considering offering bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients, although media reports said the bank was awaiting regulatory approval. Citi had no immediate comment. IFR reported in December that Citi had recently cleared its first bitcoin futures trade through CME Group.
PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) is also waiting for the OK from regulators to allow its customers to trade crypto. 
RESEARCH COVERAGE
Banks are also plowing money into research.
Bank of America kicked off digital assets research coverage for clients in October.

Morgan Stanley stood up a new crypto research division in September, in what the bank said was a recognition of the “growing significance of cryptocurrencies ... in global markets.”
Citigroup in November said it was looking to create this year 100 new roles focused on digital assets, including blockchain and digital currencies, at its institutional division.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 06:30AM ET</span>","High commodity prices, comparative calm keeping investors interested in Latam M&A","By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Latin American bankers expect investors to overlook political worries in the region this year and keep investing in local companies, buoyed by strong commodities prices and a comfortable distance from geopolitical risks in eastern Europe.
The volume of mergers and acquisitions in the region fell 30% in the first quarter from a year ago, while share offerings fell 69%, with rising interest rates and volatile markets hurting on both fronts, bankers and lawyers said.
""Volatile markets impacted valuations and delayed deals,"" said Felipe Bittencourt, head of advisory at Vinci Partners. He said he expects lower M&A and equity issues volume in the region this year, as higher interest rates raise the required rates of return for capital invested in companies.
However, several deal advisors said the opportunity for returns far from the war roiling Ukraine and its neighbors had kept investors engaged in Latin American markets. Bankers see a growing flow of deals among healthcare, energy and tech companies, including fintechs. 
""Despite recent problems in Europe and our upcoming elections, corporate and investor sentiment remain positive. We should have more deals,"" said Brazil-based Luiz Muniz, partner and head of Latin America at Rothschild & Co.
He pointed out a healthcare deal is again topping the regional tables: hospital chain SA Rede D'Or Sao Luiz SA agreed in February to acquire insurer Sul America SA for 13 billion reais ($2.81 billion).
Another highlight of first-quarter dealmaking was the restructuring of airline Aeromexico, in which Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) became the largest shareholder alongside Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). 
Bankers are hoping presidential elections in Brazil, the region's largest economy, will not throw off momentum, as leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, now leading the polls, has tapped centrist running mate Geraldo Alckmin, signaling a coalition with moderate economic policies. 
The drop in new equity issues last quarter tracked a global retreat, as interest rates rose in the United States and Latin American countries. 
Analysts see ongoing headwinds for initial public offerings (IPOs), but an easier rebound for follow-on offerings, which dominated first-quarter issuances. Energy and commodities companies such as power holding Equatorial Energia SA and food processor BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) were among the larger issues.
""Clients expect higher discounts in share offerings as investors are more cautious,"" said Pedro Juliano, head of investment banking in Brazil at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) 
Even an October election approaching in Brazil, investors expect the government to keep pushing to privatize power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, in a deal close to $15 billion.

949,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 06:20AM ET</span>",Nio in Talks to Share its Battery-Swap Technology with Rivals - Report,"Nio (NYSE:NIO) is negotiating with multiple carmakers about licensing its battery swap technology, which represents one of the key strengths of the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer's strategy to increase its market share in Europe, the FT reports.
The Shanghai-based automaker is holding talks with both local and overseas automotive companies to expand its network of battery charging stations, said Hui Zhang, Vice President of Nio Europe.
The company expects to increase the number of its charging stations from 800 to 5,000 by the middle of the decade. Nio hopes the battery swap technology will help it gain a strong position in Europe, one of the most competitive electric vehicle markets.
The company expects to build 1,000 battery swap stations outside China by 2025, primarily in Europe and the U.S., a market that Nio wants to target after Europe.
""We want to be a well-established player in the premium segment [in Europe] by 2025,"" Zhang said.
Nios's plan involves licensing its battery-swapping solution to other carmakers in an effort to expand the use of this technology which the company believes will address concerns related to the limited number of battery chargers and the time needed to charge a car.
To address these worries, Nio developed a battery swap system that involves unscrewing the bottom of the electric vehicle and replacing the battery through a hatch on the floor of the charging station.
The battery swap process takes just a couple of minutes, significantly faster than even the quickest electric car chargers that take about an hour to power up an empty battery.
The Chinese carmaker went public in 2018 and has sold 180,000 vehicles in China. While dozens of other Chinese carmakers have developed their own battery swap technologies, only Nio has commercialized the product until now.
Nio stock price is up 1.5% in pre-open Tuesday."
950,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 06:15AM ET</span>",Q1 Buybacks Were the Lowest in 5 Years - BofA,"Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategist Jill Carey Hall analyzed the bank's client flows to note a major slowdown in buybacks by corporate clients.
Buybacks were at the lowest weekly level in the past 12 months, and down YoY for the first time in over a year.
While the $ amount of buybacks in 1Q was above other 1Qs post-crisis, as a % of S&P 500 market cap, 1Q buybacks were the lowest in five years. Meanwhile, 1Q S&P 500 buyback announcements (as a % of mkt. cap)  ""while similar to 1Q21 levels"" were 50% below the pre-COVID 5-year avg, Carey Hall said in a client note.
The combination of strong supply (IPOs) and less demand (buybacks) suggests a reversal of a multi-decade bullish trend for US equities (shrinkage).
As a result, Carey Hall says dividends may dominate buybacks in 2022 amid several risks - politics, valuations, rising demand for dividends - to the latter.
Last week, BofA's clients were selling US equities ($3.4 billion) with clients selling both stocks and ETFs. Once again, hedge funds were leading the way, followed by institutional clients. On the other hand, retail clients were buying stocks once again.
""While retail flows have decelerated, the group remains net buyers. Retail flows have been positive all but one week (3/14) YTD. Our retail client flows have been a positive 'not contrary' indicator of subsequent near-term S&P 500 returns, and actually a slightly better signal than HF flows,"" Carey Hall added.
On a sector basis, clients sold stocks in six of the 11 sectors, led by Consumer Discretionary and Tech. Conversely, Real Estate, Materials, Energy, and Industrials saw inflows.
""Sales of Consumer Discretionary stocks have accelerated in recent weeks and last week were the largest ever in our data history since 2008. We have been cautious on labor-intensive Consumer Discretionary stocks as wages have continued to rise and the sector currently ranks worst in our tactical S&P 500 sector ranks and has been deteriorating in rank in our small-cap sector ranks,"" the strategist concluded.

Family-owned Boehringer said in a statement on Tuesday that full-year operating income came in at 4.7 billion euros ($5.16 billion), up from 4.6 billion a year earlier.
The Jardiance group of products, managed in a partnership with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), had 3.9 billion euros in sales, up 25.5%. The diabetes treatment is increasingly used to cut the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients and also for the treatment of heart failure.
Sales of pulmonary fibrosis drug Ofev rose 21.2% to 2.5 billion euros.
Growth in animal health products, such as antiparasitics for dogs and cats, was fuelled by more people acquiring a new pet during the pandemic, but Boehringer said it expects to ""see a normalization of the market growth trend"" in 2022. 

For 2022, Boehringer predicted slightly lower group operating income on higher spending on research and development, while revenues are expected to increase slightly.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Macellum Advisors GP LLC on Monday urged Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) Inc to be more open about its sales process, urging the retailer to give bidders and shareholders a fuller financial picture of itself.
The firm, in a letter to Kohl's board, asked the company to say when it plans to accept final bids and explain how much access potential buyers have to management and data to shape their offers. It also asked Kohl's to pre-release first-quarter financial results before next month's annual meeting. 
    Macellum, which has 5.4% stake in the retailer, is pushing to take control of Kohl's board and wants the company to sell itself, arguing that a new ""capital-intensive"" three-year standalone strategy is hurting the share price.
Kohl's said its board is ""thoughtfully and thoroughly evaluating proposals to realize full and fair shareholder value and weighing those against the value-creation potential of a compelling strategic plan."" The company said it will not let Macellum drive ""process decisions.""
Kohl's share price, which traded at $60.54 on Monday, has climbed recently because investors are holding out for a sale, Macellum said. But the investment firm also accused the retailer's board of ""putting its thumb on the scale to keep Kohl's mired in operational mediocrity"" and said directors squandered their credibility with shareholders through a secretive and confusing sales process.
""A number of sizable shareholders have informed us that they are extremely frustrated with the Board's poorly communicated process,"" the letter said.
Kohl's last month said it had contact with more than 20 parties and had signed confidentiality agreements with some. 
At least three interested parties, including luxury department store operator Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Company, private equity firm Sycamore Partners and a group that includes Acacia Research Corp, a holding company for business controlled by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, have made bids for Kohl's, which is valued at $7.8 billion, sources said. Some have offered to pay as much as $70 a share, the sources said. 

Several bidders expressed concerns about the speed of the sale process and their ability to access information for diligence purposes, the sources added. 
    Representatives for the bidders declined to comment.

Lower capacity and increased passenger demand are already driving fares higher for those booking flights from June onwards, O'Leary told the Irish Independent newspaper, citing ""very strong"" forward bookings .
""What we're seeing at the moment is prices are slightly lower than they were in 2019, pre-COVID, through March, April and May. They're somewhere between 5% and 10% higher at the moment through June, July, August and September,"" O'Leary said.
""I think fares will be up this year in the peak summer months by between 5% and 10%.""
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, on Monday reported that its passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time last month.
O'Leary, who told the newspaper he had no intention of retiring after nearly 30 years in charge, said it would be too optimistic to say that COVID-19 is over for the airline industry but he does not expect any ""COVID scares"" this summer. 

""Travel is recovering strongly. I think people are fed up. We have been locked up at home for the last two years on Zoom calls. They want to go travel again. Families want to go on holidays again,"" he said.
""We see that very strongly this Easter and also this summer. The forward bookings are very strong, but I think there will still be some disruptions.""

""Investor concerns about stagflation have recently intensified, driven by persistently high inflation prints and expectations that the Ukraine war and the attendant supply-side shock to oil and other commodities will increase inflation pressure and also reduce growth,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report.

On Tuesday, the World Bank said it expected 2022 growth in the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region, which includes China, to expand 5.0%, lower than its 5.4% forecast in October.
Taiwan stocks saw the largest outflows in the region last month, with net sales of $9.59 billion, the biggest since March 2020. Last month, world's largest contract chip maker TSMC flagged that consumer electronics demand is showing signs of slowing due to geopolitical uncertainties and COVID-19-related lockdowns in China.[L2N2VE1C2] Indian equities faced a sixth straight month of outflows worth $4.29 billion, while foreigners sold South Korean $3.64 billion worth equities.

Sales of branded grocery products fell by 5.1% in the four weeks to March 26, while sales of own-label, or private-label, products created for chain stores were down 1.9%, the market research company said.
The share of sales for own-label products rose from 52.4% to 53.2% compared to a year ago, it said.
""As we leave behind the pandemic, it's clear that shoppers are re-evaluating what they spend,"" said Mike Watkins, NielsenIQ UK head of retailer and business insight. 
""Whilst some of the changes in grocery spend will be due to consumers simply having a different basket mix compared with last year, our data also shows that consumers are now increasingly shopping for private-label products as part of their coping strategy.""
Sales of private-label products in the ambient or packaged grocery category increased by 3.3%; a significant change in a category where brands dominate, with 61% share of total sales, it said.
UK inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and is heading for 9% later this year, according to the government's budget watchdog, which predicted living standards in 2022 would fall by the most since at least the 1950s.
Overall grocery spending fell 4.1% year-on-year in the period, the steepest decline so far recorded in 2022, NielsenIQ said on Tuesday.

However, the period was the final comparison against extensive lockdown measures, indicating a potential return to growth post Easter and into the spring. 
The strongest performing retailers were M&S, with sales up 9.4%, and German discounters Lidl and Aldi, up 8.6% and 5.6% respectively. The three were the only retailers to gain market share, it said.

Some 131,507 current and former workers are involved in the shareholder scheme, according to the company's 2021 annual report released last week. The company is private and wholly owned by its employees, it said. 
The filing, published on Saturday, does not break down the dividend distribution.
It comes as U.S. sanctions continue to weigh heavily on Huawei's business, with full-year revenue tumbling 29% last year to 636.8 billion yuan. 
Net profit jumped by a record 76% to 113.7 billion yuan, but that was mainly due to the sale of its budget-brand smartphone unit Honor and server businesses under U.S. pressure.
The United States imposed a series of trade restrictions on Huawei throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns, which Huawei denies.

The restrictions impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses.
Guo Ping, Huawei's current rotating chairman, said last week that the company still hopes to find a solution to sustain its smartphone division and will ramp up investment in research seeking microchip ""breakthroughs"" after losing access to certain advanced technologies because of U.S. sanctions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some well-timed trades in the options on  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), in the days before Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's top boss Elon Musk revealed a large stake in the social media company, are raising eyebrows among options analysts.
On Monday, Musk revealed a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the biggest shareholder in the company, and triggering a 26% rise in Twitter's shares to over $49.
The news follows a flurry of bullish trading in Twitter's options in recent days, including in call options betting on Twitter shares rising above $43 by April 29, or up more than 10%, which traded in noticeably large numbers. 
""It certainly seems someone was aware of Musk building a stake, which is information that would likely be readily available across trading desks due to the significant size of the position,"" said Joe Kunkle, founder of options analytics firm OptionsHawk.com in Philadelphia.
The trades stood out since they were betting on Twitter to advance sharply within a relatively short time frame, Kunkle said.
For example, someone bought 3,900 of the April $43 calls for about $530,400, just minutes before the end of the trading session on Thursday. In all, 21,706 of these contracts changed hands on Thursday, overnight making them the fourth-largest block of open contracts on Twitter, according to Trade Alert data.
The contracts would also capture any share price moves following Twitter's earnings results, expected on April 28. 
With Twitter's share price jumping on Monday, the trades stood to make big gains. For example, the April 29 $43 calls, which traded for an average price of $1.26 on Thursday, changed hands at an average price of $6.92 on Monday, a gain of more than 400%, according to a Reuters analysis of the trades.
Bullish options on Twitter have drawn unusually heavy activity ever since Musk tweeted on March 25 that he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform, while questioning Twitter's commitment to free speech, Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS, said.
""I find it interesting that the calls were bought in a big hurry, late in the day ahead of the end of the quarter. If I was a regulator, I would be looking into these trades,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
""It's not a smoking gun, but it deserves scrutiny,"" he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scans for unusual trades ahead of news announcements and has used such data to bring insider trading probes in the past, public filings show.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the trading in Twitter's options. Twitter and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the trading activity.

TUCSON, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. self-driving truck companies have a golden opportunity in the form of a nationwide driver shortage, but their robot drivers still are not ready and neither are their biggest potential customers.
The uncertainties surrounding autonomous trucking come at a critical time for the U.S. trucking industry, which faces a record shortage of 80,000 drivers as demand for online shopping and rapid delivery times is straining supply chains.
Private investors, who have so far poured nearly $9 billion into U.S. AV trucking companies according to data from Pitchbook, are hoping that self-driving trucks eventually catch on. Among the companies developing the technology are TuSimple Holdings Inc, Aurora Innovation Inc, Embark Technology Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo.
But large logistics companies, who represent the tech startups' coveted future customers, are in no rush to sign big contracts. They continue to test the technology of multiple providers in limited partnerships.
""Everybody is at a point where they're hedging their bets,"" said Eric Fuller, the Chief Executive of US Xpress Enterprises (NYSE:USX) Inc, a carrier and trucking brokerage that manages 6,000 of its own tractors. 
The company has announced partnerships with TuSimple and Aurora. Fuller, who also sits on TuSimple's advisory board, said US Xpress was working with all the other AV companies, but had yet to announce more partnerships.
The companies say they have developed technology that can safely pilot a 33,000 pound (15,000 kg) truck down a busy highway and are pushing toward commercial launches.
They provide the sensors and software, and some have partnered with truck manufacturers to incorporate their technology at the assembly line, but all rely on large logistics companies to pay for their offering. 
The U.S. Southwest, primarily Texas and Arizona, where weather and regulations are favorable, has emerged as the testing ground for heavy-duty autonomous vehicle (AV) companies.
Large logistics groups such as DHL,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and  Ryder System Inc  (NYSE:R) have launched pilot programs with several autonomous trucking companies. 
But logistics giants also say they are still in the early stages of exploring the technology and are waiting to see which startups have the team, capital and network to survive and prove self-driving to be feasible on a large scale.
'SHAKING THINGS OUT'
While much attention has been focused on self-driving taxis, industry experts increasingly bet on driverless trucks to be the first autonomous vehicles to generate meaningful revenue due to the less complex driving environment in which they operate.
Making a meaningful dent in the U.S. market of 2.3 million trucks will take time, however, and industry experts project no more than a few hundred-thousand autonomous trucks over the next decade.
Logistics companies hope robo-trucks will one day take over monotonous long-haul tours, but not replace existing jobs. 
Human drivers will prefer to spend more time on shorter, complex routes near their homes - routes that are still too difficult for self-driving technology.
Pitchbook analysts expect the global AV trucking market to balloon from around $530 million in 2023 to $167 billion in 2035.
""There's still opportunity for more players. We're not at a point where we're shaking things out,"" Jim Monkmeyer, president for transportation at DHL Supply Chain, said during a February visit to TuSimple's testing facility in Tucson, Arizona.
DHL Supply Chain, which operates some 1,500 trucks and manages around $3 billion of annual North American freight spend, has so far partnered with TuSimple and Embark and put in reservations for future trucks with both companies. Those orders are slated to be fulfilled in 2024.
Monkmeyer said DHL had contracted with multiple providers to reduce its risks, but added that placing truck reservations early was crucial in order to be among the first to explore the new technology.
Monkmeyer and his logistics colleagues say self-driving trucks offer the potential to increase freight capacity and reduce cost, with robots, unlike humans, not subject to a mandatory 11-hour daily driving limit.
LOWER COSTS
But the economics pan out only once the driver is out of the cabin.
So far, only TuSimple has removed its safety drivers in a handful of night-time trial runs along an 80-mile (130 km) stretch of highway between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona.
The company is planning to present per-mile cost calculations in the next few months, Cheng Lu, TuSimple's former CEO, said in late February, just days before the company replaced him in a surprise move. 
""Your cost has to either be lower than what today's costs are, or there is a clear line of sight to be lower,"" said Lu, who now serves as an adviser to the new CEO.
Drivers account for more than 40% of per-mile costs, according to data by the American Transportation Research Institute.

Graphic on current per-mile trucking costs: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ulCdyo
Autonomous driving could halve driver costs, with the companies planning to charge between 35 and 45 cents in per-mile subscription fees, according to two industry experts.
But the companies, three of them publicly listed, are far from generating meaningful revenue, let alone profit. Embark recorded a 2021 net loss of $124 million, TuSimple had a loss of $411 million and Aurora lost $755 million. 
For the logistics partners, access to sufficient capital is crucial when determining whom to partner with, DHL's Monkmeyer and US Xpress' Fuller said.
TuSimple said it ended 2021 with some $1.3 billion left in cash, Aurora with $1.6 billion.
But the companies also confront other real-world hurdles as they try to release their technology on a larger scale.
Ryder, which operates nearly 240,000 trucks and around 800 U.S. maintenance locations, has partnered with TuSimple, Waymo and Embark to explore how self-driving trucks would fit into its network.
The logistics company wants to understand how to service the host of lidar, radar and camera sensors and whether trucks operating around the clock require different maintenance schedules.

In the long run, the tech companies also had to tackle more challenging driving conditions, such as snow, said Ryder's head of new product development, Karen Jones.
""I can't just run an autonomous business in the Southwest and Southeast, you have to figure out how to get to the Northeast,"" she said.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 11:35PM ET</span>","Musk takes 9% stake in Twitter to become top shareholder, starts poll on edit button","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk on Monday disclosed a 9.2% stake in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), worth nearly $3 billion, making him the micro-blogging site's largest shareholder and triggering a rise of more than 27% in the company's shares.
Musk's move, revealed in a regulatory filing, comes on the heels of his tweet that he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform, while questioning Twitter's commitment to free speech.
He also started a poll asking Twitter users if they want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media platform has been working. It was followed by Chief Executive Parag Agrawal urging users to ""vote carefully"". 
In less than three hours of starting the poll, more than 1.2 million users voted, with over 75% of them backing an edit option. 
Last week, in another poll, Musk had asked if Twitter alogrithm should be open source. More than 82% of the users said yes, while former CEO Jack Dorsey said, ""the choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone.""
A prolific Twitter user, Musk has over 80 million followers since joining the site in 2009 and has used the platform to make several announcements, including teasing a go-private deal for Tesla that landed him in hot water with regulators. 
Of late, however, the world's richest person has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a Twitter poll asking users if they believed the platform adheres to the principle of free speech, to which over 70% voted ""no.""
In December, Musk put out a meme that compared CEO Agrawal with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and showed Jack Dorsey as a close associate who was later on executed. 
Twitter's latest quarterly results and lower-than-expected user additions have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters to end long-running stagnation.
""It does send a message to Twitter ... having a meaningful stake in the company will keep them on their toes, because that passive stake could very quickly become an active stake,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC.
Musk - who, according to Forbes, has a net worth of about $300 billion - has been reducing his stake in Tesla since November, when he said he would offload 10% of his holding in the electric-car maker. He has already sold $16.4 billion worth of shares since then.
A regulatory filing on Monday showed that Musk owns 73.5 million Twitter shares, which are held by the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, of which he is the sole trustee. Vanguard is Twitter's second-biggest shareholder, with an 8.79% stake, according to Refinitiv data.
Twitter shares rose 27.1% on Monday to close at $49.97. The stock, which had fallen 38% in the past 12 months through Friday's close, on Monday added as much as $8.38 billion to its market capitalization, which now stands at $39.3 billion. 
BUYOUT? 
""Musk's actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all-out buyout should not be ruled out,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a client note.
The stake in Twitter is more likely to result in positive outcomes for shareholders than negative ones, said Ryan Jacob, chief executive officer of Jacob Asset Management, who said Twitter is one of the fund's largest holdings.
""If (Musk) decides to take an active position and Twitter goes private, it will probably be at a higher price than it is now,"" he said. ""If it gets other companies interested (in acquiring Twitter), it'll probably be at a higher price than right now.""
Musk has previously made early-stage investments in companies, including online payment processor Stripe Inc and artificial intelligence firm Vicarious.
He is also the founder and chief executive officer of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm the Boring Company. 
Twitter was the target of activist investor Elliott Management Corp in 2020, when the hedge fund argued the social networking company's then-boss and co-founder, Jack Dorsey, was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running what was then called  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). 

Dorsey, who owns a stake of more than 2% in Twitter, stepped down as CEO and chairman in November last year, handing the reins to company veteran Parag Agrawal. 
Meanwhile, Musk and Dorsey have found some common ground in dismissing the so-called Web3, a vague term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralized.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms briefly restricted hashtags related to civilian deaths in northern Ukraine, where bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces, a company spokesman confirmed on Monday.
The killings in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have drawn pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West.
Meta spokesman Andy Stone said automated systems that scan for violent imagery on Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, were responsible for blocking hashtags including #bucha and #buchamassacre.
""This happened automatically because of the graphic content people posted using these hashtags. When we were made aware of the issue yesterday, we acted quickly to unblock the hashtags,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Facebook and Instagram permit the posting of graphic and violent content when it is shared to raise awareness of possible human rights abuses, but deletes the content if it is extremely explicit or celebrates suffering.
The social media company also adds warning labels to some graphic posts that users must click through before they can see the images.
Human rights groups have critized Meta's approach to removing violent content during conflicts, saying its practice of purging the data from its servers after 90 days results in the deletion of critical evidence of war crimes.

Stone said Meta was ""exploring ways to preserve this type and other types of content when we remove it,"" specifically in relation to the war in Ukraine.
Russia has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 08:26PM ET</span>",Brazilian government's pick for Petrobras CEO withdraws,"By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Gabriel Araujo
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Energy consultant Adriano Pires has backed out of the Brazilian government's nomination for him to take the helm at Petrobras, the country's Mines and Energy Ministry said on Monday, in the latest blow to succession plans at the state-run oil company.
""It was clear to me that I could not reconcile my consulting work with the exercise of Petrobras' command,"" Pires wrote in a letter published by the ministry on its website. 
Pires' decision to turn down the chief executive job came a day after soccer magnate Rodolfo Landim declined a nomination to chair the board of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known.
Pires had been tapped by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to take over as the top executive of Petrobras on March 28, following disagreements between the far-right leader and current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna over the company's fuel pricing policy.
The government will now need to find suitable replacements for the two top spots at Petrobras just days before the company's April 13 annual shareholders' meeting.
Pires' decision to back out from the CEO job was reported earlier on Monday by Brazil's O Globo newspaper. Preferred shares in Petrobras fell 1% after the O Globo article was published, but later recouped their losses.
Pires' nomination had been facing internal compliance-related hurdles at Petrobras, as his consultancy, Rio de Janeiro-based CBIE, advises companies that do business with Petrobras, two sources with knowledge of the matter had previously told Reuters.
An internal compliance committee had also recommended against Landim's becoming the next chairman on conflict-of-interest grounds, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private internal deliberations.
Reached for comment, Landim said that he decided to withdraw from the board nomination in order to dedicate all his energy to Flamengo, the Rio de Janeiro soccer club he leads.

In a note to clients, analysts at Brazil's Itau BBA maintained their ""outperform"" rating on Petrobras shares given what they described as strong fundamentals, but said uncertainty at the top would create negative noise.
""This uncertainty regarding the nominees to the chairman and CEO positions, arising so soon before the company's next general shareholders' meeting, will likely trigger some volatility in the stock this week,"" the analysts wrote.

The news fueled concern about the retailer's approach to organized labor, days after employees at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, voted to form Amazon's first union in the United States. 
The Athena Coalition, a labor and activist group that is critical of Amazon, posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ""This needs to stop.""
Amazon said it had no plans to screen many of the words highlighted by The Intercept, which cited company documents and a person familiar with a November 2021 executive meeting on the project. The idea was to foster community and encourage high-performers while preventing ""the dark side of social media,"" The Intercept reported. An automatic word filter could block employee messages mentioning slurs, swear words and terms like ""slave labor,"" ""robots,"" and ""pay raise.""
In a statement, Amazon said, ""Our teams are always thinking about new ways to help employees engage with each other. This particular program has not been approved yet and may change significantly or even never launch at all.""

It added: ""The only kinds of words that may be screened are ones that are offensive or harassing, which is intended to protect our team.""

968,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive - Investors warn European companies over climate accounting,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Thirty-four investors managing more than $7 trillion in assets have warned 17 of Europe's largest companies, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), that they could challenge board directors over their accounting of climate risks.
The move is the latest push by investors to pressure companies and their auditors, charging them with not moving fast enough to adapt to the world's transition to a low-carbon economy or being clear enough about the potential impacts.
In letters sent between December and February and seen by Reuters, the investors told the companies their accounts did not reflect the fallout from climate change on their assets and liabilities. For example, some assets may depreciate faster in value while demand for certain products may fall. 
The need for faster action to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate its worst extremes was reiterated by U.N. climate scientists in a landmark report on Monday.
""Investors cannot understand the true value of a company without knowing the embedded climate risks,"" Natasha Landell-Mills, partner and head of stewardship at investment manager Sarasin & Partners, one of the signatories to the letters, said in an interview. 
Others to sign include the fund arm of HSBC, French public pension scheme ERAFP, and BMO Global Asset Management EMEA, part of U.S. asset manager Columbia Threadneedle.
Investors have tried to press the companies on the issue before. In 2020, through the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, they laid out a series of steps boards needed to take to align their accounts with the Paris Agreement on climate, including changing key accounting assumptions.
The investors found that most companies failed to adequately respond, prompting the latest string of letters warning boards they faced opposition at their upcoming annual general meeting.
""From next voting season you should increasingly expect to see investors vote against Audit Committee directors’ reappointment, where high-risk companies fail to meet the expectations,"" the letters said. 
Shareholder votes could also be cast against companies' decision to retain their auditors or a request to approve their financial statements, Landell-Mills said.
AUDITORS ALSO CONTACTED
Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), Arcelor Mittal, BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Equinor, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Saint-Gobain, Shell (LON:RDSa),  Renault  (PA:RENA), CRH (NYSE:CRH), ThyssenKrupp and TotalEnergies also received letters.
The letters were copied to the companies' lead audit partners. Separately, the investors also contacted the largest accountants in Britain, the United States and France over the issue.
Landell-Mills said votes would be influenced by the latest annual reports, and that Sarasin had decided to vote against the financial statement and auditor at Rio Tinto's AGM, and abstain on whether to reelect the Audit Committee's chair. 
She added she was pleased to see Shell include a 'sensitivity analysis' in the notes to its accounts, released after the letter had been sent, that showed impairments could hit $27-$33 billion based on average prices from four 1.5-2C climate change scenarios. Landell-Mills said she still wanted to know what a pure 1.5C scenario would mean for impairments.
Air Liquide and Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) both said they were liaising with the IIGCC, a European membership body for investors collaborating on climate change, and that climate risks were factored into their accounts. Anglo American said it was engaging with IIGCC.
Mercedes Benz, formerly Daimler, said it was in ""constant and constructive"" dialogue with the investors and would update its sustainability strategy on April 11. Equinor referred to its energy transition plan as being on a Paris-aligned pathway.
Enel said it would not comment on talks with shareholders. Glencore declined to comment on the letter, but its 2021 annual report contains a sensitivity analysis. 
ThyssenKrupp shared a letter sent in reply to IIGCC member Rathbones Investment Management in which it said it understood investors' need for more detailed information and was ""currently examining how we may implement your inquiry"".
The rest of the companies did not respond to requests for comment.

While many companies have pledged to get to net-zero emissions and are under growing pressure from regulators to disclose their efforts, the majority have yet to align their business practices, including their accounts, with the goal, the investors say.
""We can’t rely on 'business as usual' accounting assumptions as the energy transition unfolds. Along with our commitment to be a net zero investor, ensuring company accounts are aligned to a 1.5°C degree future is a crucial first step,"" said Matt Crossman, stewardship director at Rathbones.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>","Analysis - Most banks narrow UK gender pay gaps, UBS, Deutsche Bank go into reverse","By Iain Withers and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Major British financial companies collectively narrowed their gender pay gaps last year, but some went into reverse gear, including UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), a Reuters analysis found. 
Companies in Britain with more than 250 employees have been required to publish the difference between the pay and bonuses of their male and female employees since 2017. They had an April 4 deadline this year for disclosures up to April 2021.
Several financial companies this year also published voluntary ethnicity pay data - some, including UBS,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and M&G, for the first time. Where the companies further broke down the data by ethnic group, Black staff suffered the biggest pay discrepancies.
The gender pay exercise has cast a poor light on the country's financial services, which are critical to the British economy but also one of its most unequal sectors.
Reuters collated pay gap data from 21 major financial institutions. It showed an average mean gender pay gap of 32.1% - slightly more than 1% narrower than the previous year's average.
Despite the improvement, the gap is much wider than the average for all UK employers, which stood at 14.9% in the year to April 2020. 
""Given how important the sector is to the UK, it would be far better if financial services were leading rather than lagging,"" said Ann Francke, CEO of the Chartered Management Institute.
Pay gaps at some of the British arms of large global investment banks remain stubbornly large, which the institutions blame on men being over-represented at senior levels.
Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International once again accounted for the industry's widest gender pay gap among the firms surveyed, with men working for the bank in Britain on average getting 51.3% more in pay per hour than women. 
This was down marginally on 51.8% the previous year.
""I assure you that while progress may at times seem slow, our diversity and inclusion agenda remains front and centre,"" Richard Gnodde, CEO of the unit, told staff in a memo on Monday.
Deutsche Bank and UBS both lost ground, with their gaps widening by around 1% respectively to 33.4% and 29%.
Deutsche Bank said it was targeting having at least 35% of senior roles held by women by 2025, while UBS said progress would not be linear, but it expected to meet its goals over the medium to long term.
Insurer Admiral was the only financial firm surveyed by Reuters to have a pay gap below the UK average, at 14.4%, although this widened from 12.8% prior.
The analysis also included  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), PGMS (a Phoenix unit), abrdn, Schroder Investment Management, St James's Place, Legal & General and Prudential. 
ETHNICITY PAY GAPS
Several of those surveyed also voluntarily disclosed ethnicity pay gap figures for the year to April 2021, reflecting an increased focus on racial inequality in the industry in recent years. 
Four companies - UBS, NatWest, Lloyds and M&G - showed ethnic minority staff were paid less on average than white colleagues.
Aviva showed the reverse, while HSBC and Barclays' data showed close to parity.
However, both HSBC and Barclays provided a further breakdown that showed Black employees on average earned significantly less than other ethnic groups.
Barclays said the bank's Black employees had a 19.2% gap, while HSBC said the gap was 22.9%. 
Both Barclays and HSBC said the figures reflected under-representation of Black staff at senior levels and that they had adopted policies to try to address this.

The government has come under pressure from equality campaigners to make ethnicity pay gap reporting mandatory for companies.
""Mandating gender reporting took us from thirty to thousands of employers paying attention to inequality - people of colour deserve the same focus,"" said Jemima Olchawski, chief executive of women's rights group the Fawcett Society.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:05PM ET</span>",Samsung Elec likely to report highest Q1 profit since 2018 on chips,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd is likely to post its highest first-quarter profit since 2018, analysts' estimates showed, driven by brisk profits on memory chips as solid demand helped to keep prices firmer than expected.
Operating profit for the world's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker likely hit 13.3 trillion won ($10.9 billion) in the quarter ended in March, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 13 analysts, which is weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate. That would be up 41% from 9.38 trillion won a year earlier and the highest profit for its comparatively sluggish first quarter since 2018. 
The South Korean tech giant will announce preliminary results on Thursday. 
Samsung (KS:005930)'s Q1 chip profit is likely to reach 7.6 trillion won, more than double the previous year's 3.37 trillion won, according to an average forecast of six analysts. 
Its chip business contributes about half of the tech giant's profits.
Chip prices held up better than expected in the first quarter, analysts said, despite pulling back after a surge over the past year when clients built up stocks to guard against supply chain bottlenecks. They noted that strong demand and cautious investment spending had given a boost to the sector.
""Solid chip demand from data centres, chipmakers' conservative investment to defend against falling prices, and high-end product sales have limited the decline in memory chip prices,"" said Doh Hyun-woo, analyst at NH Investment & Securities.
Samsung's mobile business profit is estimated at 4.04 trillion won according to an average forecast of six analysts, slightly down from the previous year's 4.39 trillion won but above its mobile profits during the same period in 2017-2020. 
Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S22 smartphone in February, which likely sold about 8 million units during the first quarter according to Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities. 
Samsung has the largest share of Russia's smartphone market at about 30 percent, but Roh said a halt in shipments there would have little effect since Russia and Ukraine account for only an estimated 2% of Samsung's total, and this would be offset by sales to other regions.
Samsung said in March that shipments to Russia had stopped after the invasion of Ukraine, although services such as Samsung Pay continue to be offered in Russia according to social media messages. Samsung shares have fallen about 12% year-to-date, hurt by worries over the impact of the Ukraine crisis on global tech device demand and concerns about low production yields at its cutting-edge contract chip manufacturing operation.

Samsung's co-CEO last month addressed shareholder concerns about its manufacturing processes for chips with 5-nanometre or narrower circuitry, saying they were gradually improving.

The bulk of the pay package comprises a long-term performance award for Baszucki, which was valued at $232.2 million. 
Baszucki, who will not get any other direct compensation through 2027, will receive the award in parts over the years only if Roblox shares achieve certain milestones, the filing added.
The so-called ""Long-Term Performance Award"" is a pay method followed by some companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as a way to retain top executives by tying their earnings to company performance. The plan has faced criticism, as it has led to payouts worth billions to founders.

Roblox, which made it's market debut in March last year, posted an 83% rise in revenue, but a wider-than-expected 25 cents per share loss in the fourth quarter in February.
Roblox shares closed trading at around $50 on Monday, about 28% lower than the closing price on March 10, 2021, their first day of trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Monday urged jurors to convict a former senior Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker for helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, while the defense accused the government's star witness of lying. 
In her closing argument in Brooklyn federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said the defendant Roger Ng received more than $35 million in kickbacks from the ""brazen"" bribery and money laundering scheme, and must be held accountable.
Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo countered that his client, who had been Goldman's former top investment banker for Malaysia, was falsely implicated by his former boss Tim Leissner, the star witness.
""He never stopped lying ever, and he didn't stop lying in this courtroom,"" Agnifilo said, referring to Leissner.
Closing arguments are expected to end on Tuesday, followed by the judge instructing jurors on the law and the start of deliberations.
The nearly two-month trial stemmed from one of the biggest financial scandals in history.
Prosecutors have said Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through three bond sales, but that $4.5 billion was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a fine of nearly $3 billion and its Malaysian unit agreed to plead guilty. The scheme's suspected mastermind, Malaysian financier Jho Low, remains at large.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to launder money and violating an anti-corruption law, and will likely be the only person tried in the United States over 1MDB.
Prosecutors said Ng helped Leissner embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
""The harm to the people of Malaysia is immeasurable,"" Smith told jurors. ""It is deeply unfair to everyone else who plays by the rules.""
Leissner, 52, pleaded guilty in 2018 to similar charges as Ng.
Agnifilo focused his closing argument on Leissner's credibility, after Leissner admitted during testimony that he ""lied a lot.""
While the defense acknowledged that Ng introduced Leissner to Low, Agnifilo said his client played no further role, and Leissner lied to get a lighter sentence.
""Roger is basically the fall guy for this whole thing,"" Agnifilo said.
Smith acknowledged that Leissner was seeking leniency by testifying, but said other testimony backed up his story.
""What he told you about the crimes he committed with the defendant and others is backed up by and consistent with other evidence,"" Smith said. ""You already know the defendant is guilty from the other evidence.""
Ng has acknowledged receiving $35 million from Leissner, but jurors will need to sort out what the money was for.
Leissner said that money represented kickbacks from 1MDB, and that he agreed with Ng to tell banks processing the transfers a ""cover story"" that it came from a legitimate business venture between their wives.
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, testified for the defense that she invested $6 million in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's then-wife, Judy Chan.

She said the $35 million was her return on that investment.
Low was indicted in 2018 alongside Ng. Malaysian authorities say Low is in China, which Beijing denies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp will pause billions of dollars of stock buybacks to invest more in employees and stores, longtime former chief executive Howard Schultz said on Monday on his return to lead the global coffee chain for a third time.
Schultz disclosed the plan in a letter to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) workers, customers and shareholders at a time when the company faces growing unionization of its U.S. workforce.
Shares closed more than 3% lower. Analysts predicted the suspension to knock 2 to 3% off earnings in fiscal 2023.
Starbucks spent nearly $12 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2020 combined to buy back its own shares. In October it said it would spend $20 billion over three years on stock repurchases and dividends.
Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks locations have voted in recent months to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. locations have petitioned a federal labor board for union elections since August, when the union drive went public.
Starbucks announced last month that Schultz would take over as interim CEO, following the retirement of Kevin Johnson. Shares of the coffee chain shot up about 5% on March 16, the day of the announcement.
By suspending share buybacks, Schultz is signaling he wants to make bold moves and shift the company's cash flow to invest in growth and employees while trying to fend off unions, said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer of Tigress Financial Partners, which holds Starbucks stock in its clients' accounts.
""You have to take the opportunity to invest money where it will get the best return on multiple levels both as a direct investment and to show what the company's current focus is,"" Feinseth said. 
Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987. During his previous four decades as chief executive and chairman, it grew from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 markets worldwide, according to a news release.

Schultz wrote in the letter that he will travel in coming weeks to meet with employees.
""I am returning to the company to work with all of you to design that next Starbucks — an evolution of our company deep with purpose, where we each have agency and where we work together to create a positive impact in the world,"" he wrote.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said its first-quarter results could top a seven-year quarterly record, with operating profits from pumping oil and gas alone of up to $9.3 billion. 
A snapshot of the largest U.S. oil company's quarter ended March 31 showed operating profits from oil and gas, its biggest unit, could jump by as much as $2.7 billion over the prior quarter's $6.6 billion. 
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) does not hedge, or lock in oil sales, and results generally match changes in energy prices. Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed up oil by 45% last quarter over the final period of 2021, to an average of $114 per barrel, the highest in seven years.
The estimates suggest total earnings for the quarter of about $9.8 billion at the mid-point of Exxon's estimates, according to Scotiabank global equity research. 
Exxon shares, which have jumped 36% year to date, rose slightly on Monday to $83.16. Official results are expected to be released on April 29, according to a securities filing. 
The outlook implies adjusted earnings around $2.29 per share, Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng said in a note. The total would guarantee Exxon its highest quarterly profit since at least 2014. 
The blockbuster oil and gas profits offer a preview of what lies ahead for other firms' oil earnings. Such results could strengthen calls by U.S. and European Union lawmakers for windfall profit taxes on energy companies.
RUSSIA WRITEDOWN? 
Final results could be dampened by impairments to Exxon's Russian operations. The company last month said it would phase out of Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The oil company has $4 billion in assets at risk to potential seizure and faces a 1% to 2% hit to production and revenue from the move.
""Depending on the terms of its exit from Sakhalin, the company may be required to impair its investment in the project up to the full book value,"" it said in a filing.

High oil and gas prices accelerated after Russia's invasion and sanctions were imposed on its oil, coal and LNG. Global oil prices hit a 14-year high in the first quarter and have since cooled as the U.S. announced a release of emergency stocks and China began a lockdown. 
Operating profits in refining could be up to $300 million higher than the $1.5 billion earned in its fourth quarter, while its chemicals business could decrease by as much as $300 million compared with the previous quarter's $1.3 billion profit.

The investment bank is at the center of an investigation into whether Wall Street banks told favored clients about pending sales, known as block trades, that they were hired to carry out quietly, the report said on Monday. 
Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.
Disruptive Technology alleges that Morgan Stanley leaked information ahead of the fund's sale of more than $300 million of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc's shares in February 2021, resulting in millions in damage, the report added. 

A spokesperson for FINRA declined to comment on the report, while Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Disruptive Technology could not be reached immediately for comment.
Reuters and other media outlets reported in February that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was probing whether financial executives broke the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares.

Veteran investor Botha will continue to lead the company's U.S. and Europe business as managing partner, Sequoia said. The Silicon Valley stalwart has been expanding in Europe recently and opened an office in London last year.
Sequoia's local managing partners will remain in charge of the firm's other regional divisions, Sequoia said, with Neil Shen set to continue to lead Sequoia's business in China. Shen has been a vocal supporter of investment in enterprise tech startups in China.
U.S.-China political issues have cooled some business between the countries.
But the Chinese arm of Sequoia, whose portfolio includes TikTok owner ByteDance and online fashion startup Shein, is seeking more than $8 billion across four new funds, according to a report published by The Information last month.
Botha succeeds Doug Leone, who will continue to represent Sequoia on the boards of portfolio companies and remain a general partner in its existing funds.
Botha, who spearheaded Sequoia's investments in Meta Platforms' Instagram, biotech firm 23andME and software firm  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB), joined Sequoia in 2003 and was appointed to his current role as steward in 2017.
Sequoia has established itself as one of the world's top venture capital firms since its founding by Don Valentine in 1972. 
Leone took over from Valentine as senior steward in 1997 alongside venture capitalist Michael Moritz. Moritz dropped his administrative duties in 2012, when Leone became the firm's sole leader.
""We are proud to be the only venture capital partnership to have successfully navigated multiple leadership transitions over five decades,"" Leone said in the firm's announcement on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TracFone Wireless agreed to a $13.4 million settlement to resolve false claims allegations in connection with the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) low-income subsidy program, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday. 
The department said TracFone, a  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) unit, violated the False Claims Act by signing up more than 175,000 ineligible customers in connection with the FCC's Lifeline Program, the Justice Department said in a statement.
The Justice Department said sales agents in Florida learned TracFone's computer software contained a glitch allowing ineligible persons to enroll in Lifeline. After TracFone eventually discovered the software glitch in August 2015, it repaid more than $10.9 million to Lifeline, an amount credited as part of the settlement.
Verizon spokesman Rich Young said Monday ""TracFone reported these activities to the government years ago and we're pleased to now bring this matter to a close."" He said Verizon ""is focused on bringing all of TracFone's customers, including those enrolled in Lifeline, best in class products and services.""
FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement the settlement should ""serve as a warning to others that we will do everything we can to ensure strict compliance with the rules of the road.
Under the settlement, TracFone agreed to enter a ""comprehensive, three-year compliance agreement.""
Verizon said in September 2020 it would buy pre-paid mobile phones provider TracFone, then a unit of Mexican telecom company  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), in a cash and stock deal worth up to $6.9 billion. The deal closed in late 2021 after Verizon agreed to conditions including agreeing to participate in Lifeline for at least seven years and offering existing TracFone Lifeline rate plans for at least three years.
TracFone is one of the largest providers of telecommunications services under the government subsidy program known as Lifeline with around 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states.
TracFone serves about 21 million customers. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. Lifeline in total provides about 5.8 million Americans with free or discounted broadband and voice services as of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan could lose about $1 billion on its Russia exposure, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Monday, detailing the extent of the bank's potential losses from the conflict in Ukraine for the first time.
In his keenly watched annual letter to shareholders, the chairman and chief executive of the biggest U.S. bank by assets also urged the United States to increase its military presence in Europe and reiterated a call for it to develop a plan to ensure energy security for itself and its allies.
Dimon did not provide a time frame for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s potential Russia losses but said the bank was concerned about the secondary impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on companies and countries. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation.""
Global banks have detailed their exposure to Russia in recent weeks but Dimon is the most high-profile world business leader yet to comment on the broader impact of the conflict. 
""America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" he wrote. (For five key takeaways from Dimon's letter, click on)
Dimon may continue as chairman when he eventually relinquishes his role as chief executive, the bank said Monday.
The disclosure, in a report to shareholders ahead of JPMorgan's annual meeting in May, said the bank had found that most major shareholders want Dimon to remain chairman.
The board also said that it was inclined as a ""general policy"" to separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive after Dimon is gone. Many shareholders have a general preference to separate the posts, it said.
Dimon has made something of a joke of perpetually saying he will resign in five years. In 2019, he said the five-year clock had actually begun.
In his letter to shareholders, Dimon addressed the relationship between the United States and China and said the United States should revamp its supply chain to restrict its scope to suppliers within the United States or to only include ""completely friendly allies"". He urged the United States to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.
Commenting on the macroeconomic environment, Dimon said the number of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes ""could be significantly higher than the market expects."" He also detailed the bank's rising expenses, in part due to technology investments and acquisition costs.
The letter is Dimon's 17th as CEO https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2021/ar-ceo-letters.htm. While Dimon is not the only CEO of a top U.S. bank to write such letters, his have become must-reads among Wall Street's elite and policymakers for the view they provide into his political and economic ideas.
'FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET'
This year's letter comes as the Russia-Ukraine war and high inflation are hurting the economy, and as Dimon faces new skepticism from investors over expenses. 
Some question his plans to increase spending on the bank's information technology and campaigns to take market share in businesses and geographies where JPMorgan currently trails competitors, such as in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
JPMorgan decided earlier this year to hold its first investor day since the pandemic began to address doubts about its spending plans. The meeting will be held on May 23.
Dimon has spent more than a decade building what he calls the bank's ""fortress balance sheet,"" and he said it is now robust enough that JPMorgan could withstand losses of $10 billion or more and ""still be in very good shape."" 
While Dimon wrote that he is not worried about the bank's exposure to Russia, he said the war in Ukraine will slow the global economy and will impact geopolitics for decades.
""We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against Russia,"" he said.
On acquisitions, Dimon said that the bank will be reducing stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules ""and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our company.""

JPMorgan has been on a buying spree, spending nearly $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months. Dimon said that will increase ""incremental investment expenses"" by roughly $700 million this year. 
Investments in technology will add $2 billion to expenses this year, Dimon said.

Investing.com -- Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) closed 1.3% lower Monday after Citi analyst Ralph Giacobbe downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.
The analyst pointed to several reasons for the downgrade. 
""We are downgrading DGX to Neutral due primarily to concerns around the margin outlook in 2022 and 2023 on the heels of higher internal investments, heightened labor pressures, and potential for reimbursement cuts as the COVID PHE (Public Health Emergency) gradually rolls off along with concurrent volume declines,"" Giacobbe said in a note to clients. 
He added that the firm ""believe it will take more than a year for the internal investments in Advanced Diagnostics and the buildout of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform to increase base business sales meaningfully as DGX transitions to a COVID-endemic world.""
Giacobbe set a price target of $175, up from $140 on the shares, which closed Monday's session at $134.54."

Investing.com – The Dow started the week on the front foot Monday, as a Twitter-inspired rally in tech overshadowed concerns about a recession ahead amid bets on the Federal Reserve stepping up the pace of monetary policy tightening.      
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.30%, The S&P 500 added 0.8%, and, the Nasdaq rallied 1.9%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) jumped 27% after Tesla CEO Elon Musk became the social media giant’s largest shareholder, taking a 9.2% stake in the company.
Musk, a vocal critic of Twitter, isn’t expected to be a passive shareholder and will likely look to build on his stake to influence change at the social media giant.
“We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,” Wedbush said in a note.
Other social media stocks including Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) were up sharply.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, gained 5% after the electric automaker delivered a record 310,000 vehicles during the first quarter, just shy of Wall Street's estimates of 312,000.
Big tech started the week on the front foot. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 1% despite negative commentary from Loop Capital forecasting the tech giant to slash iPhone production for 2022 to a range of 245 million and 250 million.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were up more than 1%.
A key part of the yield curve, the 10-year Treasury yield over 2-year Treasury yield, remained inverted on Monday, keeping fears that a recession may be brewing front and center.
The bid in tech helped offset losses in consumer staples and health care, with Dow heavyweights including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ending the day in the red. 
Financials were dragged lower by falling banks stocks as a flattening yield curve limits their margins on lending.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was less than 1% higher after chief executive Jamie Dimon said the bank could face a potential $1 billion write-down from its assets in Russia.
On the Ukraine-Russia war front, peace talks between the two nations resumed Monday despite the U.S. and its allies eyeing fresh sanctions on Russia after reports of mass civilian deaths in Bucha, Ukraine.
Energy stocks struggled to turn positive despite rising oil prices rallied as expectations of fresh sanction against Russia stoked fears of tighter supplies.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) was flat after forecasting a rise in quarterly operating profit in the first quarter, underpinned by rising oil and gas prices.

(Reuters) -West Virginia's attorney general on Monday urged a judge to hold Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) liable for causing a ""tsunami"" of opioid addiction in the state.
The addiction crisis has affected the state's police forces, hospitals, foster care system and jails, with effects that will linger for more than a generation, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said during opening statements in Kanawha County Circuit Court.
""This epidemic has impacted virtually all of West Virginia,"" Morrisey said. ""Our lawsuit speaks for all West Virginians who have suffered due to the defendants' unlawful, callous and destructive conduct.""
West Virginia has accused the drug manufacturers of creating a ""public nuisance"" by deceiving prescribers about the risks of opioid painkillers and said their marketing efforts caused opioids to become a common treatment for chronic pain in West Virginia, leading to an increase in substance abuse and overdose deaths.
The companies have denied the allegations in their opening statements, which Reuters viewed via Courtroom View Network.
Teva's attorney, Harvey Bartle, said that the company's marketing of opioids did not lead to any ""medically unnecessary"" prescriptions in West Virginia.
The state has been hard hit by the epidemic, with a per capita opioid mortality rate over three times the national average in 2020, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
J&J and the three largest U.S. drug distributors - AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) - have reached nationwide settlements worth $26 billion to resolve state and local government opioid claims. West Virginia was one of five states that did not sign on to the J&J portion of that settlement. 
Drugmaker Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc, which was a co-defendant in the case, reached a $26 million settlement with West Virginia on March 30. 

More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies over the crisis. There have been a wave of recent settlements over companies' responsibility for the opioid epidemic. 
Last month, Rhode Island and Florida struck settlements to resolve opioid litigation on the eve of trials. Rhode Island reached a deal valued at $107 million with Teva and Allergan and Florida settled with Teva, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Allergan and Endo for a combined $878 million.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -Hasbro Inc on Monday added two directors to its board and said it will keep its Wizards of the Coast unit, rejecting calls from an activist investor to spin off the profitable unit and refresh the toy maker's board with its director nominees.
Elizabeth Hamren and Blake Jorgensen, executives with experience in gaming, technology, operations, and capital allocation joined the board as independent directors this month expanding the board's size to 13 members, the company said.
Hamren is chief operating officer at voice, video and text communication service Discord Inc and has experience working on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox products, while Jorgensen previously served as chief financial officer at video game company Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Board chairman Rich Stoddart called Hamren and Jorgensen ""proven, experienced leaders"" who will add ""tremendous incremental value and critical thinking.""
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) shares were up slightly at $84.58 on Monday.
Its announcement comes one week after Hasbro turned down a settlement offer from Alta Fox Capital Management LLC to add one of its nominees to the board and pick a second member on its own. 
On March 27, Hasbro Chief Executive Chris Cocks told Alta Fox founder Connor Haley that the company was open to considering alternative settlement proposals from the hedge fund but was ""willing to nominate only the most qualified director candidates,"" according to a regulatory filing.
Alta Fox also pushed Hasbro to consider spinning off Wizards of the Coast to boost its lagging share price, something the company said on Monday it will not do.
A spinoff ""is unlikely to create value, is contrary to Hasbro's strategy, and would negatively impact the benefits Wizards realizes today from Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint on a consolidated basis,"" Stoddart wrote in a letter.
The unit, which publishes Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, saw its revenue grow 42% in 2021.
Cocks used to head the Wizards unit and wrote in a separate letter on Monday ""the fundamental game plan we used at Wizards will be the roadmap we follow for the rest of Hasbro.""
The company, valued at $11.7 billion, will focus on ""fewer, bigger strategic priorities and scale, driving sustainable, profitable growth across bets with billion-dollar plus revenue potential,"" he added.
Alta Fox, which owns a 2.5% stake in Hasbro, nominated five directors to the company's board earlier this year. The company said it interviewed the two nominees the hedge fund made available to be interviewed. 
The hedge fund earlier said it supported Cocks but that he should be surrounded by a ""meaningfully refreshed board."" 

Alta Fox on Monday called Hasbro's move ""defensive"" and ""reactionary"" and signaled it will press on with a board fight.
""The Board's desire to continue operating Hasbro like a family business is a flashing red light for change and an obvious indicator that shareholder-appointed directors are needed at the Company,"" it said.

Investing.com – Stocks jumped on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk’s move to become Twitter’s biggest shareholder lifted shares of the social media company along with the rest of tech.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares were up nearly 30%. Musk, who has been investigated by regulators for his own use of the platform, took a 9.2% stake and could take a more active role there.
But investors were also focused on events this week, especially the arrival of the minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. Already expectations are building that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May, especially after a jobs report that showed the lowest unemployment in decades.
Still, the Biden administration is battling inflation and high energy prices, probably not helped that the price of oil rose above $100 a barrel again on Monday.
President Joe Biden has a lot to accomplish this week before Congress leaves for a two-week Easter holiday, including the confirmation of his nominee to the Supreme Court, the confirmations of his nominees to the Fed (including Chair Jerome Powell for a second term), and the passage of funding for Covid-19 programs.
It is otherwise a light week for data and earnings, but first quarter reports will start rolling out in waves later this month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Services index
ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI data for March will be released Tuesday at 10:00 AM EST (1400GMT). Analysts are expecting increased momentum in March, with forecasts of 58.4. February's ISM non-manufacturing PMI was 56.5.
2. Crude inventories
The American Petroleum Institute reports U.S. crude oil inventory levels on Tuesday at 4:30 PM ET. The expectation is for a draw of 3.016 million barrels. Last week the industry group reported API Weekly crude oil stock fell 3.000 million barrels. The API report always comes before the next morning’s release of the government’s own assessment.
3. Fed speakers
There are three Fed speakers tomorrow, following the latest U.S. jobs data last week. Neel Kashkari, Lael Brainard, and John Williams are speaking at 10:00 AM ET, 10:05 AM ET, and 2:00 PM ET, respectively.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Two promising drugs for COVID-19 fail to deliver
Two drugs that looked like promising treatments for COVID-19 in preliminary studies - remdesivir for hospitalized patients and camostat for patients who are not seriously ill - failed to show a benefit in those groups in randomized controlled trials, researchers reported in two separate papers.
In five European countries, researchers studied 843 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 2020 and January 2021 and who needed oxygen or machines to help with breathing. Two week after patients had received either Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD)' antiviral remdesivir - sold as Veklury - plus standard of care or standard of care alone for up to 10 days, there was no difference between the groups in signs of improvement, investigators reported on Thursday.
In Japan between November 2020 and March 2021, researchers randomly assigned 155 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 to receive the pancreatitis drug camostat mesylate from Ono Pharmaceutical Co or a placebo for up to 14 days. Camostat blocks an enzyme that helps some versions of the coronavirus infect cells - including the variants circulating at the time of the study - but did not help patients get rid of the virus in their airways any faster than placebo, the Japanese researchers reported on Saturday. They said the results ""highlight... the necessity of conducting well-designed studies to confirm whether preclinical findings translate into meaningful clinical efficacy."" Both studies were posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
COVID-19 vaccines in first trimester of pregnancy appear safe
COVID-19 vaccination during the first trimester of pregnancy does not increase the risk for congenital defects in the fetus, preliminary data suggest.
Researchers at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago studied 1,149 women who received at least one dose of a vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer/BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) between 30 days before conception and 14 weeks into gestation, which is when the fetus is most vulnerable to developing birth defects due to medications taken by the mother. Compared to 2,007 pregnant women who either remained unvaccinated or were vaccinated later, women vaccinated shortly before or early in pregnancy were not at higher risk for having an abnormality in the fetus detected by their doctors on an ultrasound exam, according to a report published on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
The authors acknowledge that examining a fetus with ultrasonography is not as reliable as examining an infant, and because many of the women they studied are still pregnant, real proof of vaccination safety in the first trimester requires larger studies of newborns. 
SARS-CoV-2 infects eye cells in test tubes
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can infect the vision-processing cells of the eye and reproduce there, lab experiments suggest.
Researchers used human cells in test tubes to grow a miniaturized, simplified version of the retina - the nerve tissue at the back of the eye that receives images and sends them as electric signals to the brain. When the researchers exposed these ""organoids"" to SARS-CoV-2, the virus infected a variety of retinal nerve cells that perform different functions. Furthermore, the virus could make copies of itself in those cells, the researchers reported in the journal Stem Cell Reports. In the infected organoids, genes that increase levels of inflammatory proteins associated with retinal damage were more active, the researchers also found. They also found that younger retinal cells were more vulnerable to the virus, possibly because younger cells have more of the protein on their surfaces that the virus uses as a gateway for entry.

Antibodies that block those gateways and make it harder for the virus to infect cells appeared to protect the retinal organoids, further experiments showed. The findings suggest that the persistent syndrome known as long COVID may also include retinal problems, researchers said.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 03:15PM ET</span>",New York set to ban natural gas in new buildings -environmental groups,"(Reuters) -New York Governor Kathy Hochul will soon release a budget that likely will include a plan to make New York the first state to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in new construction, according to Food & Water Watch and other environmental groups.
Officials at the governor's office said Hochul was working with the legislature to finalize the budget, but could not say when they would reach an agreement.
In her State of the State address in January, Hochul committed to ""zero on-site greenhouse gas emissions for new construction no later than 2027.""
A decision by the state would follow similar gas bans in New York City in December and dozens of smaller U.S. cities in recent years as they seek to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy.
In the near-term, the new laws will do little to reduce New York's carbon emissions, as numerous older buildings will not be affected and new structures would use electricity generated by burning fossil fuels anyway.
Longer-term, however, carbon emissions should drop because the state's Climate Act of 2019 requires all power generation to come from clean sources by 2040, including 70% from renewable energy by 2030.
The gas industry has warned that giving up on gas would boost consumer costs because electric heat is much more expensive.

With the economy recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, New York's gas use rose to around 3.44 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2021 from about 3.39 bcfd in 2020 when lockdowns depressed demand. That compares with a record high of 3.63 bcfd in 2018, according to federal energy data going back to 1997.
Gas use by New York's residential and commercial consumers slid for a third year in a row in 2021 to around 1.97 bcfd, the lowest since 2016, while consumption increased for industrial customers to 0.24 bcfd and power generators to 1.23 bcfd.

The lender said that its aim was to provide ""more transparency"" and further clarity regarding its minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC), to better allocate the cost of the eligible debt issuances to the business units.
The change in the group's financial reporting will have a negative impact of 766 million euros ($841 million) on the country units' net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit and wholesale funding costs.
This will, however, be offset by transferring a positive contribution in the same amount in the corporate centre, the lender said.
Other financial costs, primarily the cost of funding the excess capital held by the business unit above of group's core tier-1 ratio had been reassigned accordingly to the units.
In addition, the corporate and investment banking branches of Santander in Europe and other business lines have been integrated into the Spain unit to reflect how the business will be managed and supervised.
Regulators try to ensure that banks' liability structures provide sufficient TLAC or funds and eligible liabilities to absorb losses and facilitate the recapitalisation of the bank in accordance with European Union regulations.

The European Banking Authority has developed TLAC and MREL reporting and disclosure requirements to guide banking institutions as they comply with their disclosure and reporting obligations, and to make that information available to authorities and investors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Valentino SpA said on Monday it has settled litigation with the landlord of its former American flagship on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, which the Italian fashion company abandoned because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a statement, Valentino said its amicable settlement with the landlord 693 Fifth Owner LLC calls for the 16-year lease, for space located two blocks south of Trump Tower, to be terminated.
Additional terms were not disclosed. Lawyers for the landlord did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Valentino had sought in June 2020 to end the lease nine years early, saying the pandemic made it impossible to run the store ""consistent with the luxury, prestigious, high-quality reputation"" of its neighborhood.
After a New York state trial judge dismissed that lawsuit, the landlord sued Valentino for $207.1 million, mainly to recover unpaid rent and to repair store damage.
Last month, a New York state appeals court agreed that the pandemic did not excuse Valentino from its lease obligations, ""even if its ability to provide a luxury experience was rendered more difficult, because the leased premises were not destroyed.""

The pandemic depressed sales for Manhattan retailers, as many office workers and tourists stayed home.
Average asking rents in the fourth quarter of 2021 fell 13.5% from a year earlier, though leasing activity rose 24.1% from the prior quarter, according to the commercial real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

The aircraft lessor, which had signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase new MAX jets in February, said the order will bring its MAX backlog to 130. 
U.S. carriers said last month travel demand had roared back after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant and would remain strong.

""The 737 MAX family enables airlines to optimize their fleets across a broad range of missions while reducing fuel use and carbon emissions by at least 20% compared to the airplanes they replace,"" Air Lease said. 
The company's order comprises 737-8 and 737-9 jets and will help it meet the demand for more fuel-efficient jets, Air Lease said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Nio ADRs (NYSE:NIO) traded 8% higher Monday after UBS analyst Paul Gong upgraded it to ‘buy’ with a target of $32, still 34% higher after the surge.
The analyst had a target of $46 for the ADRs with a ‘neutral’ rating, according to StreetInsider.
Nio began delivering its ET7 mid/large sedan late last month and should launch the ET5 medium sedan in September and the mid/large ES7 SUV in late 2022.
“These products offer stronger powertrains, a better digital experience and more advanced autonomous driving than its four-year-old platform,” Gong wrote in his note.
The analyst expects ET5 to become a major volume model, with more than 10,000 unit sales likely per month, as it has a similar powertrain and intelligence specifications as ET7 but is cheaper by RMB 100,000 ($15,723).
A recent survey by UBS showed that Nio’s brand recognition is on the up. Nio’s consumer mindshare is now better than BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, according to Gong.
Nio sold 9,985 vehicles in March, up about 38%. The company said it plans to unveil the NIO ES8, ES6, and EC6 SUVs in May."

The manufacturer sold 159,328 vehicles in the U.S., a 26% decline from a year ago as most automakers continue to feel the pain of shortages of raw materials and semiconductors.
Uncertainty arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war and record-high oil prices are also weighing on consumer sentiment.
Ford is preparing to roll out an electric version of its F-150, which had nearly 200,000 non-binding reservations from potential buyers. The F-Series line is the top-selling vehicle in U.S. and the company’s most profitable product. The company said it has a high number of F-Series trucks in transit to dealers. It booked a record 50,000 orders for its F-Series in March.
“While the global semiconductor chip shortage continues to create challenges, we saw improvement in March sales, as in-transit inventory improved 74% over February,” Andrew Frick, vice president of sales, distribution and trucks, said in a statement.

The number of A350s grounded by the airline in the dispute over exposed and damaged lightning protection has reached 23, bringing the value of compensation sought by the carrier to slightly over $1 billion, they said.
Neither company had any immediate comment.
The two sides have wrangled for more than a year over accelerated surface damage that the airline says raises questions over the safety of the planes, with Qatar's regulator grounding jets as the problem appears.
Airbus, backed by its own regulator, has denied any safety problems and responded to Qatar's refusal to take any more A350s until the problem is resolved by revoking deals for undelivered A350s, one by one, and axing a separate contract for A321neos.

Qatar will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend a temporary order freezing the decision to cancel the A321neo order pending a final hearing on the A350 case, expected later this year.
Bloomberg News reported earlier that Airbus planned to delay a planned increase in A350 production because of the combined impact of the Ukraine war and the Qatar dispute.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>","With capital markets jittery, private equity pounces to finance tech buyouts","By Krystal Hu, Chibuike Oguh and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -When buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC was seeking lenders to finance its acquisition of business software company  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) Inc last month, it skipped banks and went directly to private equity lenders including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc.
Within eight days, Thoma Bravo secured a $2.6 billion loan based partly on annual recurring revenue, one of the largest of its kind, and announced the $10.7 billion buyout.
The Anaplan deal was the latest example of what capital market insiders see as the growing clout of private equity firms' lending arms in financing leveraged buyouts, particularly of technology companies.
Banks and junk bond investors have grown jittery about surging inflation and geopolitical tensions since Russia invaded Ukraine. This has allowed private equity firms to step in to finance deals involving tech companies whose businesses have grown with the rise of remote work and online commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Buyout firms, such as Blackstone, Apollo, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Inc, have diversified their business in the last few years beyond the acquisition of companies into becoming corporate lenders.
Loans the private equity firms offer are more expensive than bank debt, so they were generally used mostly by small companies that did not generate enough cash flow to win the support of banks.
Now, tech buyouts are prime targets for these leveraged loans because tech companies often have strong revenue growth but little cash flow as they spend on expansion plans. Private equity firms are not hindered by regulations that limit bank lending to companies that post little or no profit.
Also, banks have also grown more conservative about underwriting junk-rated debt in the current market turbulence. Private equity firms do not need to underwrite the debt because they hold on to it, either in private credit funds or listed vehicles called business development companies. Rising interest rates make these loans more lucrative for them.
""We are seeing sponsors dual-tracking debt processes for new deals. They are not only speaking with investment banks, but also with direct lenders,"" said Sonali Jindal, a debt finance partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.
Comprehensive data on non-bank loans are hard to come by, because many of these deals are not announced. Direct Lending Deals, a data provider, says there were 25 leveraged buyouts in 2021 financed with so-called unitranche debt of more than $1 billion from non-bank lenders, more than six times as many such deals, which numbered only four a year earlier.
Thoma Bravo financed 16 out of its 19 buyouts in 2021 by turning to private equity lenders, many of which were offered based on how much recurring revenue the companies generated rather than how much cash flow they had.
Erwin Mock, Thoma Bravo's head of capital markets, said non-bank lenders give it the option to add more debt to the companies it buys and often close on a deal quicker than the banks.
""The private debt market gives us the flexibility to do recurring revenue loan deals, which the syndicated market currently cannot provide that option,"" Mock said.
Some private equity firms are also providing loans that go beyond leveraged buyouts. For example, Apollo last month upsized its commitment on the biggest ever loan extended by a private equity firm; a $5.1 billion loan to SoftBank Group Corp, backed by technology assets in the Japanese conglomerate's Vision Fund 2.
NOT CONSTRAINED
Private equity firms provide the debt using money that institutions invest with them, rather than relying on a depositor base as commercial banks do. They say this insulates the wider financial system from their potential losses if some deals go sour.
""We are not constrained by anything other than the risk when we are making these private loans,"" said Brad Marshall, head of North America private credit at Blackstone, whereas banks are constrained by ""what the rating agencies are going to say, and how banks think about using their balance sheet.""
Some bankers say they are worried they are losing market share in the junk debt market. Others are more sanguine, pointing out that the private equity firms are providing loans that banks would not have been allowed to extend in the first place. They also say that many of these loans get refinanced with cheaper bank debt once the borrowing companies start building cash flow.

Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), said the direct lending deals are allowing some private equity firms to saddle companies with debt to a level that banks would not have allowed.
""While that may to a degree increase risk, they may view that as a positive,"" said Feldgoise.

Exxon’s announcement that first-quarter results may have reached almost $11 billion augurs booming profits across the oil industry as trade sanctions, shipping disruptions and surging demand strain supply lines. 
The windfall doesn’t come without risks, however. Political leaders are under pressure to alleviate sky-high energy prices and the specter of shortages, and some already have accused oil drillers of gouging and profiteering. 
U.S. President Joe Biden last week pleaded with the industry to reinvest profits in new wells to help plug the supply gap from shunned Russian crude. At the same time, he warned of punishing financial penalties for companies slow-walking projects involving federally owned oil prospects.   
Exxon said Monday that first-quarter results may have been as much as $2 billion higher than earnings during the final three months of 2021, when the company raked in $8.8 billion, according to a filing. 
Surging oil prices were the main driver, with natural gas and fatter refining margins also contributing. International crude futures touched a 14-year high of almost $140 a barrel during the quarter. 
Separately, Exxon formally approved the $10 billion Yellowtail development off the coast of Guyana after receiving government and regulatory approvals. The project is the fourth and largest in an area known as the Stabroek Block, and is expected to pump about 250,000 barrels a day starting in 2025.
Exxon also disclosed that exiting the Sakhalin-1 oil development in Russia’s Far East may trigger a writedown of as much as $4 billion. The company recently pledged to quit Russia due to international sanctions and what the company’s Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods described as the nation’s “needless destruction” in Ukraine.

(Reuters) -The two Southern tech entrepreneurs had the two qualities that Donald Trump’s Truth Social startup needed: tech-industry expertise and a politically conservative worldview aligned with the former president, a rare combination in the liberal-leaning industry centered in San Francisco.
Josh Adams and Billy Boozer - the company’s chiefs of technology and product development - joined the venture last year and quickly became central players in its bid to build a social-media empire, backed by Trump’s powerful brand, to counter what many conservatives deride as “cancel culture” censorship from the left.
Less than a year later, both have resigned their senior posts at a critical juncture for the company’s smartphone-app release plans, according to two sources familiar with the venture.
The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’s iPhone app on Feb. 20. Weeks later, many users remain on a waiting list, unable to access the platform. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) Chief Executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, said publicly that the company aimed to make the app fully operational within the United States by the end of March.
The company has an app for iPhones but no app for Android phones, which comprise more than 40% of the U.S. market, though the company has advertised seeking an engineer to build one.
Boozer declined to comment and Adams did not respond to a request. Representatives for TMTG and Trump did not respond to requests for comment.
This account is based on Reuters interviews with eight people with knowledge of Truth Social’s activities, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
Truth Social is part of a growing sector of tech firms catering to conservatives and marketing themselves as free-speech champions. The platform promised to give Trump unfettered communication with the American public more than a year after he was kicked off Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube for allegedly inciting or glorifying violence during the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol.
The exit of two executives critical to the app-launch efforts could imperil the company’s progress as it tries to prove it can compete with mainstream platforms such as Twitter, said two people familiar with the company. Like Twitter, Trump’s platform offers users the chance to connect and share their thoughts.
“If Josh has left… all bets are off,” one of those sources said of tech chief Adams, calling him the “brains” behind Truth Social’s technology.
Another source familiar with the venture said that Boozer also had a major leadership role as product chief, running management across technology infrastructure, design and development teams.
Reuters could not determine the specific circumstances behind the executives’ resignations, or whether they have been replaced or their duties reassigned. It also remains unclear whether Adams and Boozer still work on the venture in a different capacity after quitting their executive posts.
Their resignations came before their key roles in the closely watched company were even publicly known outside of Truth Social’s secretive culture.
Adams and Boozer worked at a level just below Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky, both former castmates on “The Apprentice,” Trump’s hit reality TV show, according to a source familiar with the venture.
Moss and Litinsky have been the “senior, day-to-day leadership” running the company since it started last summer, the source said. The two men had pitched Trump on the social-media venture in January of 2021, according to a person familiar with the company’s founding.
Reuters could not determine the specific job titles or responsibilities of Moss and Litinsky, neither of whom responded to requests for comment. TMTG has released little information about its executive leadership team outside of CEO Nunes, who joined in December.
Another open question is how TMTG is funding its current growth. The company is planning to go public through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC). The deal is under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is likely months away from being finalized. 
DWAC disclosed in a regulatory filing last December that the SEC was probing the deal. The SEC has not addressed the nature of the inquiry and did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
Investors have pledged $1 billion to TMTG but they won’t hand over that money until the DWAC deal closes.
DWAC shares fell 13% after market opening Monday on a day when Twitter saw its shares surge 25% after an investment by Telsa Chief Executive Elon Musk. 
Trump’s level of involvement with his namesake company and the Truth Social platform also remains unclear. The former president so far has written only one post - or “truth” - on the platform, writing on Feb. 14: “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!”
Downloads of the Truth Social app have declined precipitously, from 866,000 installations the week of its launch to 60,000 the week of March 14, according to estimates from data analytics firm Sensor Tower. The firm estimates the Truth Social app has been downloaded 1.2 million times in all, trailing far behind rival conservative apps Parler and Gettr at 11.3 million and 6.8 million installations, respectively.
TARGETING BIG TECH
When they joined the company last year, Adams and Boozer embraced the vision for a social-media company with an “anti-cancel culture” mission, according to one of the sources familiar with the venture. The executives believed deeply in creating an “open platform, where as long as you don’t say anything that is criminal,” the person said, “you can be entitled to your own opinion.”
Reuters could not determine the exact date the two executives joined the firm, but they were working on the Truth Social app by the fall, according to two sources familiar with the venture.
As the company sought engineers that had both the requisite skills and compatible politics, Adams and Boozer fit the bill, another person familiar with the company said. To gauge whether potential recruits were a good fit, hiring managers explored candidates’ political ideology, in at least one case by scanning their social media profiles and listening to their appearances on podcasts, that person said.
The company’s political bent limited its hiring pool. At least one candidate rebuffed a recruitment overture, saying he couldn’t stomach working for Trump, the person familiar with the company said. Others who rejected the company's outreach said they were concerned about job security and feared the company and its employees might be prime targets for hackers, according to two people with knowledge of the firm's recruiting efforts.
Adams joined Trump’s company after building a career as a software developer from his native Alabama. He co-founded Daring Bit Assembly, a product and software development consultancy whose clients have included the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and e-commerce startup Shipt, according to Daring Bit Assembly’s website. 
Adams is a “constitutionalist” who believes in strict interpretation of the authors’ original intent for the foundational U.S. document, said one of the people familiar with company operations. In May 2021, Adams filed a lawsuit in federal court in Alabama against the state’s governor, a Republican, and its health officer, alleging that the state’s mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic violated the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions. The case was dismissed in June 2021.
Boozer, also a political conservative who previously lived in Alabama, had collaborated frequently with Adams before joining Truth Social, according to the source. With Adams in place to steer the back-end infrastructure of the app, Boozer brought a strong command of the front-end technology that touches users, according to that source.
The pair kept a low profile despite holding high-ranking positions at the closely watched venture.

Neither Adams nor Boozer disclosed their work at Truth Social on their LinkedIn profiles, which list numerous other jobs and ventures from their past. The company did not publicly announce their hiring.
Adams’ and Boozer’s roles were listed in a November investor presentation as the TMTG technology team’s chief technology officer and chief product officer - but without their last names. When Truth Social launched, they posted frequently on the platform, but again presenting themselves to the public only as “Josh A.” and “Billy B.”

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 11:16AM ET</span>",Kyrgyzstan and Canada's Centerra end Kumtor gold mine dispute,"By Clara Denina and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan will take full control of the Kumtor gold mine (KGC), its biggest industrial enterprise, under an out-of-court settlement with Canada-based Centerra Gold after a series of legal disputes over the past year.
Kyrgyzstan will give up its 26% stake in Centerra, having seized KGC from the Canadian miner in May 2021. The seizure led to a spate of litigation before a decision to refer the matter to arbitration.
The central Asian country had accused Centerra of various transgressions including environmental damage and corruption.
Centerra denied all wrongdoing. 
""Through this agreement, we have been able to ensure a full and irrevocable handover of our greatest national treasure, the Kumtor gold mine, to Kyrgyzstan,"" President Sadyr Japarov said in a televised announcement.
As part of the agreement, state-owned gold miner Kyrgyzaltyn will own Kumtor and will retain the income it earned from the mine since it was seized. 
In exchange, Kyrgyzaltyn will give up its ownership of shares in Centerra, which will also make a cash payment totalling $86 million, partly to repay an outstanding loan to KGC and to preserve and protect the country's natural resources.
The shares will be cancelled. The deal means Centerra completely exits activities in Kyrgyzstan. 
Centerra and Kyrgyzstan, which have a long history of disputes over how to share profits from the 550,000-ounce a year mine, have also agreed to end all legal proceedings against each other with no admissions of liability.
""Throughout this dispute, we have maintained that this is not about nationalisation ... It was about the specific issues with the management of (the) Kumtor mine. We have always said that Kyrgyzstan is open for business,"" Japarov said.
Toronto-listed shares in Centerra, which lost 34% of their value in 2021, have rebounded by 29% so far this year on expectations that the dispute would be resolved outside international courts, and on rising gold prices.
The Kumtor mine is expected to produce at least $5 billion from the 160-200 tonnes (564,000-700,000 ounces) of gold expected to be mined in the next 10 years, the president said, citing experts. 
The agreement will allow Centerra to focus on its core operations, the company's president and chief executive Scott Perry said in a statement. Centerra owns assets in Canada and Turkey. 

The deal is subject to conditions including Centerra shareholder approvals and the abandonment of the various lawsuits.

During the quarter that ended on March 31, Exxon's operating profits from its oil and gas business could rise by $1.9-$2.7 billion over the previous quarter of $6.6 billion, according to the snapshot showing the company's Q1 earnings.
The war in Ukraine drove oil prices by as much as 25% in the previous quarter to an average of $114 per barrel, the highest mark in seven years.
Exxon does not hedge nor lock-in oil sales, which ultimately leads to its results matching energy price changes.
The snapshot of Exxon's profit indicates that other energy companies could see similar profits from oil prices, which could ultimately urge U.S. and European Union lawmakers to impose windfall taxes on oil and gas companies.
Still, the final quarterly profit results could be affected by Exxon's decision to phase out of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The move could result in a seizure of Exxon's $4 billion in assets and a 1-2% production and revenue blow.
Depending on the terms of its exit from Sakhalin, the company may be required to impair its investment in the project, it said in a filing.
Exxon's operating profit from its refining business could rise up by $300 million, while the company's chemicals unit could see a $300 million decline from the previous quarter.
Analysts expected Exxon to report earnings per share of $2.12 in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv, which represents a more than 200% year-over-year growth.
Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta said that the update suggests EPS will likely arrive in line with the estimate. Exxon is set to report official results on April 29, according to a securities filing.
""We revise our 1Q2022 EPS estimate from $2.31 to $2.21. We remain constructive on XOM heading into the quarter and view earnings as set to inflect further in 2Q-4Q as commodity prices continue to improve. We see 26% total return to XOM on our 12-month $101 price target,"" Mehta said in a client note.
Exxon stock is down 0.4% today.

Investing.com -- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported its first-quarter delivery numbers on the weekend, and its shares are edging higher in early Monday trading.
At the time of writing, Tesla stock is up 1%.
The company produced over 305,000 vehicles in Q1 and delivered more than 310,000 vehicles. The company said this was despite supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.
However, the number missed Wall Street consensus estimates of around 315,000.
Following the data release, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he is ""firmly Overweight"" Tesla shares. The analyst said in a note that Street estimates likely didn't capture the full impact of the Covid-19 related lockdown in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the delivery number beat Piper's 294,000 expectation.
Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner said in his note that the delivery numbers were ""solid"" but missed his estimate of 320,000, which is likely due to the Shanghai lockdown. However, he added that Tesla is on track to achieving 1.5 million units in 2022. Commenting on the supply chain challenges, Rosner said the company ""weathers it considerably better than the rest of the autos industry.""
BofA analyst John Murphy maintained a Neutral rating and a $1,100 price target on Tesla shares following the delivery report, which beat his 294,567 estimate. The analyst wrote in a note that while Tesla has a first-mover advantage, it remains unclear whether it will be dominant in the longer term. However, the analyst believes the company's ""relatively high stock price is justified"" if it can keep funding its growth with ""almost no-cost capital driving capacity expansion."""

“Customers can continue to access the Prime Video and IMDb TV apps on their Roku devices,” Roku said in a release posted on its website.
Major apps such as Prime Video and YouTube being built into devices such as Roku televisions and streaming media players are a major selling point for the hardware.
The company had in early December struck a multi-year pact with YouTube, ending several months of discord between the two.
Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its channel store after the agreement for that app expired. YouTube, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, threatened to pull its main app from Roku, when the deal for the service was to end.
Roku and its subsidiaries together operate a streaming platform in two segments, Platform and Player. The company generates revenue from advertising, OS licensing, distribution fees, hardware and subscription sales.
Public fights over distribution agreements and splitting ad revenue have become common in the broadcast and streaming video fields.

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.
The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.
Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.
In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Gores Guggenheim Inc this year.
The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

The partnership includes purchasing up to 65,000 electric vehicles over five years. The SPAC that is merging with Polestar -  Gores Guggenheim  Inc (NASDAQ:GGPI) - is gaining 7% in pre-open trade following the news.
""We are excited to partner with Polestar and look forward to introducing their premium EV products into our retail and rideshare fleets,"" said Stephen Scherr, Hertz CEO. ""Today's partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint.""
Polestar has pushed global EV growth, reportedly tripling volumes in 2021. The company anticipates more than doubling volumes again this year. Polestar expects volumes to reach 290,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2025.
""Polestar is committed to accelerating the move to electric mobility with a fascinating and innovative product portfolio,"" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ""We are delighted that Hertz has chosen Polestar as a strategic partner on their road to electrification. The partnership with a global pioneer like Hertz will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements. For many of them it may be the first time they have driven an EV, and it will be a Polestar.""
Polestar is not the first electric vehicles to catch the rental company's interest. On October 25,2021, Hertz placed an order for 100,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. Mark Fields, Hertz's interim chief executive officer at the time, said Tesla was the only company that could produce EVs at scale. This first step in the company's plan to electrify its fleet was followed up by the recent addition of the Tesla Model Y to the Hertz list of available fleet vehicles.
Hertz and Polestar did not share the financial terms of the planned rental-car purchase. The Tesla deal was reportedly worth $4.2 billion. The starting sticker price of the Polestar 2 sedan is $45,900, meaning the deal could generate almost $3 billion of revenue if Hertz pays at or close to that price.
Hertz's Tesla partnership fueled a more than 40% spike in the car renters' shares in late October.
Polestar previously announced its intention to list on Nasdaq New York in a proposed business combination with Gores Guggenheim, Inc. That deal is expected to close in 2Q 2022.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, still supported by Friday's robust employment report, but with an element of caution in the air after reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine and extended Covid-19 lockdowns in China raised the prospect of stiffer sanctions and a bigger, longer drag on the world economy.
By 9:40 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 185 points, or 0.5% at 34,633 points. The S&P 500 was down less than 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%. 
The Nasdaq was supported by a surge in Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stock price, after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk disclosed a stake of 9.2% in the social media company. Musk has criticized Twitter in the past for suppressing free speech, and while his initial stake-building was described as 'passive', analysts speculated that he will push new CEO Parag Agarwal to loosen its content moderation policy. Musk is an active user of Twitter himself, but was forced to pay $40 million to settle SEC charges that he used the social media to mislead investors in 2018. 
Twitter stock rose 23% to a four-month high, while Tesla stock fell 0.5% after the electric vehicle maker was forced to extend the shutdown of its Shanghai plant for a second week due to mass Covid-19 testing. Tesla reported a new record quarter for deliveries over the weekend despite what Musk called ""exceptional"" difficulties. 
Musk makes his move at a time when one aspiring challenger to Twitter is having difficulties.  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), the SPAC which merged with former President Donald Trump's new social media venture Truth Social, fell 8.9% after a report saying that two key executives had left the company. Truth Social, which aimed to give a platform to conservative voices, has struggled to gain traction, failing to meet self-imposed deadlines for the launch of an app for the Android operating system. The ex-president, meanwhile, appears reluctant to develop a presence on the network until it has proved itself viable, Reuters reported at the weekend. 
Elsewhere, fresh economic data reinforced impressions that consumer spending is reverting to its pre-pandemic pattern. Spending on durable goods excluding the defense sector fell by 2.6% in February, after a 2.7% fall in January. Data last week showed that spending on consumer services was buoyant, while the hospitality sector added more jobs than any other in March. 
Elsewhere, Chinese ADRs advanced broadly after the country published new draft rules at the weekend that would allow foreign regulators greater access to data previously kept off-limits. The news reduces the risk of the Securities and Exchanges Commission delisting the likes of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) or  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD). Alibaba ADRs gained 3.4% while Pinduoduo ADRs gained 8.8% and Baidu 5.8%.
In other news, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock fell 5.1% after chairman Howard Schulz paused the coffee chain's buyback program as he returned to the CEO's seat. is facing revenue pressure from the closure of many Chinese outlets due to lockdowns, as well as rising cost pressures from labor and other inputs in its home market.

(Reuters) - Ted Baker is open to selling itself at the right price after seeing a flurry of takeover interest, the British fashion retailer said on Monday in the wake of a robust rebound from the pandemic.
Ted Baker launched a formal sale process after private equity firm Sycamore improved its takeover proposal and another third party showed interest in bidding for the company, sending its shares surging as much as 11% to 142.6 pence.
Takeover interest in British companies, ranging from defence groups to supermarkets, is at its highest in years, as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Brexit have slashed valuations.
""The Board has decided to conduct an orderly process to establish whether there is a bidder prepared to offer a value that the Board considers attractive relative to the standalone prospects of Ted Baker as a listed company,"" it said in a statement https:// The company, which has 560 stores and concessions, is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under chief executive Rachel Osborne and has seen demand return from pandemic lows.  Last week, it rejected a second proposal from New York-based Sycamore that valued it at 253.8 million pounds ($332.86 million), saying it undervalued the group.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Stock of  Digital World Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC), the SPAC bringing former President Donald Trump's social media platform public, plunged 14% in premarket trading Monday after the company was rocked by the exit of two key tech executives.
In less than a year of their joining, Josh Adams and Billy Boozer – DWAC’s chiefs of technology and product development, respectively – have quit. The two were considered central figures in the former President’s attempts to offer an alternative to Twitter and other social media platforms that many conservatives accuse of being pro-Left and indulging in ‘cancel culture’ censorship.
The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’s iPhone app on February 20. A recent Bloomberg report said downloads of the app had declined 95% since its launch.
According to the report, which cited research from Apptopia, downloads are now at 8,000 per day from the initial 170,000, while daily active users over the last week were 513,000.
Much was expected from Truth Social given it marked Trump’s return to social media, while he stays banned by both Meta Platforms-owned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The fall in DWAC comes even as Twitter shares soared 26%.
The surge in Twitter shares followed disclosures that billionaire and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has built a 9.2% stake in the micro blogging site. Musk himself has earlier accused Twitter of not adhering to principles of free speech.

First, the company announced it has stopped manufacturing combustion engine vehicles as of March and will now focus on producing all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
""In the future, BYD will focus on pure electric and plug-in hybrids in the automobile sector,"" BYD said in a statement filed to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday.
China's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker will not entirely stop producing gasoline engines as it plans to use smaller variations of the engine in its plug-in hybrid vehicles. The decision comes after the Chinese government committed to increasing green energy consumption and reducing carbon emissions.
BYD is one of the six global automakers including Volvo, GM, Mercedes, Ford, and Jaguar Land Rover that pledged to completely stop making engine vehicles by 2040.
Secondly, BYD reported 104,878 sales of its new energy vehicles (NEV) in March, marking a significant jump from 24,218 in the year-ago period and its record number of monthly sales.
March sales included 53,664 pure EV and 50,674 plug-in hybrid cars as well as 540 commercial NEV cars.
Moreover, the company added that it will continue providing services and spare part supplies to existing customers who bought combustion engine vehicles.

More than 40% of insurers plan to increase their investments in private equity in the next 12 months to boost returns, according to the survey of 328 executives overseeing more than $13 trillion in insurance assets.
""Against a complex macroeconomic and geo-political environment, demand for yield remains high, and we expect to see insurers continue to build positions in private asset classes as well as inflation hedges,"" said Michael Siegel, Global Head of insurance asset management. 
Middle market corporate loans, infrastructure debt, real estate equity, infrastructure equity and United States investment grade private placements were other favored asset class for insurers seeking to increase investment returns, the survey said.
The survey found that insurers now see rising inflation and tighter monetary policy as the largest threats to their portfolios.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy by causing a surge in energy and food prices that spells more pain for consumers and businesses and major central banks have raised rates to tame inflation, even in the face of growth risks.
Globally, 92% of investors said they now consider environmental, social and governance factors throughout the investment process, nearly a three-fold increase from 2017.

European insurers represent the only group that plans to increase their green or impact bonds allocation as their top priority this year, the report said. 
The report also showed that 11% of American insurers said they are invested in or are considering investing in cryptocurrencies.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock traded 3% lower in premarket Monday after the company suspended its share buyback program, soon after former long-time CEO Howard Shultz returned to the role, albeit on an interim basis.
The company had in October announced a three-year $20 billion share buyback and dividend program.
""Starting immediately, we are suspending our share repurchasing program,"" Schultz said in an open letter today.
""This decision will allow us to invest more into our people and our stores, the only way to create long-term value for all stakeholders.""
The company hopes to find a new CEO by fall.
Senator Bernie Sanders slammed the company after the announcement.
""If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends...it can afford a unionized workforce,"" Reuters quoted Sanders as saying.
The decision to drop the buyback plan comes amidst a series of challenges facing the company.
While the company now faces unions at several of its locations, it’s also facing surging costs on the business side. The coffee-brewer in February warned its annual earnings per share will fall 4%-6% compared to its previous estimate of no more than 4%. The cut in guidance followed after first quarter results fell short of estimates.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is buying its biggest shareholder in a $40 billion deal, the country's biggest ever, creating a financial services titan to better tap rising demand for credit.
HDFC Bank's deal with housing finance firm HDFC Ltd, which owns about 21% of the lender, will build on its 68 million customers and expand its home loan portfolio significantly while also opening up the scope for larger loans.
It will also help HDFC Bank shrink the gap with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India while boosting competition in the home loan space as people step up purchases with pandemic woes receding.
The deal will be beneficial for both companies but particularly HDFC Ltd, said Asutosh Mishra, research analyst at Ashika Stock Broking.
""(HDFC Ltd) was competing with the likes of State Bank of India in a competitive home loan market, leading to pressure on margins due to disadvantages to its cost of funds,"" he said.
Following a 2018 crisis in the non-banking finance sector that shook India's financial system, the central bank issued guidelines in November allowing well-run large shadow lenders to be converted into banks.
HDFC Bank shares closed 10% higher on Monday, giving the firm a market value of 9.18 trillion rupees ($121.66 billion), while HDFC Ltd surged 9.3% to a valuation of 4.85 trillion rupees.
HDFC Ltd shareholders will receive 42 shares of the bank for 25 shares held, giving them ownership of 41% of HDFC Bank, which will become a full-fledged public company as the housing finance company's stake in the lender will be cancelled in the deal.
Foreign ownership will account for 65-67% of the merged company, giving foreign investors scope to buy up to a further 8%, something that had also helped lift the share price, said Siddharth Purohit, fund manager at InvesQ Investment Advisors.
""The value of HDFC Ltd is $60 billion. If you strip off the portion of their holding in us, it comes to $40 billion and that's the value of the deal,"" HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, who will head the combined company, told reporters at a press conference.
That would mark the largest banking sector M&A globally since April 2007, according to Refinitiv data.
BIGGER BALANCE SHEET
HDFC Bank is currently a largely retail-focused operation but the $237 billion balance sheet of the combined company will allow it to underwrite larger ticket loans, including those for infrastructure.
The merger, which is expected to complete in the second or third quarter of the financial year starting in April 2023, would expand HDFC Bank's loan book by 40% and the combined company's market value will rise to about $160 billion at current prices, Jefferies said in a note.
HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh said HDFC Bank has written to the central bank asking for additional time to meet certain regulatory requirements such as revised Cash Reserve Ratio and Statutory Liquidity Ratio norms following the merger.
The lender has also sought clarity on whether certain subsidiaries would have to be divested where there is an overlap in the businesses of the two companies. 

J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Citi were among financial advisers to HDFC Bank for the deal, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Kotak Securities and Jefferies were among advisers to HDFC Ltd.

Greensill's supply chain finance firm collapsed last year, leading to the failure of $10 billion in supply-chain finance funds run by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
Greensill administrators Grant Thornton declined to comment on Monday.
Credit Suisse said in a statement that the insurance policies were valid, and that it would also ""vigorously defend"" its position to preserve the rights of the supply chain finance funds and their investors. 
Supply chain finance aims to lower financing costs by allowing suppliers to receive early payment of their invoices.
Credit Suisse bought debt that was issued by Greensill and backed by loans the supply chain finance firm made to companies. 
To manage its risk, Greensill took out credit insurance with a subsidiary of Insurance Australia Group (IAG (LON:ICAG)). Tokio Marine took on the policies in 2019 when it bought the unit.
Tokio Marine carried out investigations in 2020 into Greensill-related policies written at its Australian subsidiary BCC Trade Credit, it said in a statement.
""While these investigations remain ongoing, Tokio Marine has found that since at least September 2018, matters material to the underwriting of the policies were fraudulently misrepresented to BCC by Greensill,"" Tokio Marine said. 
""There was also a fraudulent failure to disclose material matters to BCC prior to the purported inception of numerous policies, renewals and endorsements,"" the statement said.
Tokio Marine had told counterparties to the insurance on Monday that their policies were void and said it would ""vigorously defend"" any legal claims against it.
Credit Suisse is seeking compensation from insurance to restore assets to the investors in the supply chain finance funds.

It said earlier on Monday that litigation related to Greensill supply chain finance funds could take around five years and warned that some investors would not be able to recover their money.
The bank joined creditors of Greensill Capital by filing lawsuits in Australia seeking compensation from IAG, court filings showed last month.

AMD said the deal value does not include working capital and other adjustments.
Pensando, which was founded in 2017 by a group of four ex-Cisco Systems Inc engineers, counts Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud unit Azure as its customers.
The startup makes a fully programmable processor and a software platform, which helps enterprise clients and data center customers to function more like cloud computing data centers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services.
In cloud computing, customers can order as much computing power as needed in different parts of the world with a few mouse clicks. The software takes care of the mechanics of shuffling the data to the right physical machines.
The lucrative data center chip business is rife with competition, with AMD rivals  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp  Only last month, Nvidia had released a new chip to speed up artificial intelligence functions in data centers. 
The deal, which would enable AMD to add Pensando's platform to its line of processors and graphics chips, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Pensando's Chief Executive Officer Prem Jain and the entire team will join AMD's Data Center Solutions Group.

Investors were watching developments around what Russia calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24, as well as risks of new western sanctions against Moscow on top of unprecedented penalties already imposed.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that a new round of sanctions targeting Russia was needed.
""Developments around Ukraine after the weekend again increase the degree of confrontation with the western countries,"" Rosbank analysts said in a note.
At 1152 GMT, the rouble was 0.8% stronger against the dollar at 83.25, reversing earlier losses but still weaker than its strongest level since Feb. 23 of 80.3325 hit on Friday.
To the euro, the rouble was up 1.8% to trade at 91.33, moving further away from an all-time low of nearly 132.42 it reached in Moscow trade on March 10.
""Russia and Ukraine talks are set to continue this week. Despite a threat of fresh sanctions, we expect the rouble to remain stable and trade at around current levels amid capital control measures,"" Alfa Bank said in a note. 
In recent weeks, the rouble got a boost from capital controls as well as from President Vladimir Putin's demand that European consumers of Russian natural gas pay for it in roubles.
But Europe vowed to stay united against Moscow's demand, as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased.
The rouble was expected to stay within a range of 80-90 to the dollar in the next two weeks, Promsvyazbank analysts said in a note.
The market was also scrutinising Russia's ability to continue servicing its foreign debt. On Monday, Russia is due to pay $552 million on maturing 2022 Eurobond and $84 million in a coupon payout on 2042 Eurobond.
In the stock market, jittery trading continued, but nearly all blue chips were in the black after the market reopened last week following a near month-long hiatus.
The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 1.4% to 1,047.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 0.3% at 2,769.2 points after hitting its highest level since Feb. 22 of 2,835.46.

Finam brokerage said in a note it expected the MOEX index to keep on climbing towards a target of around 3,080 points.

Availability is expected to begin in Spring 2022 in Europe and late 2022 in North America and Australia.
For Hertz, the partnership is part of the company's ongoing commitment to lead in electrification, shared mobility and a digital-first customer experience. The partnership with Polestar builds on Hertz's announcement last October to offer its customers the largest EV rental fleet in North America and one of the largest in the world. In addition to making the fleet available to its business and leisure customers, Hertz is extending EVs to rideshare drivers as a way to further accelerate electrification.
""We are excited to partner with Polestar and look forward to introducing their premium EV products into our retail and rideshare fleets,"" said Stephen Scherr, Hertz CEO. ""Today's partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint.""
Polestar is one of the drivers of global EV growth, helping to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility as consumer interest in the environmental and convenience benefits of electrification increases. Polestar reported that it nearly tripled volumes in 2021 and anticipates more than doubling volumes again this year. Polestar expects volumes to reach 290,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2025. Polestar previously announced its intention to list on Nasdaq New York in a proposed business combination with Gores Guggenheim, Inc. (Nasdaq: GGPI, GGPIW, and GGPIU), which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.
""Polestar is committed to accelerating the move to electric mobility with a fascinating and innovative product portfolio,"" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ""We are delighted that Hertz has chosen Polestar as a strategic partner on their road to electrification. The partnership with a global pioneer like Hertz will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements. For many of them it may be the first time they have driven an EV, and it will be a Polestar.""
Hertz will initially order Polestar 2, an award-winning EV which established Polestar's position as a premium EV manufacturer with its first volume model. Polestar 2 brings avant-garde Scandinavian design and leading in-car technology. Polestar 2 includes the world's first infotainment system powered by Android Automotive OS with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) built-in for the premium EV segment, in a driver-oriented, dynamic driving package.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has warned that the combination of Russia's war in Ukraine and China's ongoing property crash could see the worst wave of corporate defaults since the global financial crisis.
A new report from the bank's analysts on Monday estimated the EM-wide default rate would now reach 8.5%, more than double the 3.9% they expected at the start of the year before the war in Ukraine.
The volume of riskier 'high-yield' EM corporate international market bonds now trading at distressed levels had jumped to $166 billion, the highest since 2009 when the global financial crisis raised the default rate to 10.5%. 
Eastern Europe is predicted to see a record 21.1% default rate due to what are expected to be 98.8% and 27.3% respective rates in Ukraine and Russia where firms are now in difficulty due to the war or the West's unprecedented sanctions.
Ukraine corporates have provided frequent updates to investors since the start of the invasion and all have painted a similar picture of their operations: exports are disrupted, revenue generation and collections are decimated. 
China property sector woes, meanwhile, saw Asia's default rate forecast lifted to 10% from 7%.
There are expected to be $32 billion worth of defaults by 29 struggling Chinese developers this year. That would be an eyewatering 31% default rate for the sector and when added to the $49 billion worth of defaults from 26 firms last year, would mean half of China's high yield property bonds will have defaulted.
""Together with a 30% default rate recorded last year, we could potentially see more than half of the sector being decimated,"" JPMorgan analysts said, explaining how ""surprises"" such as hidden debt and developers unexpectedly defaulting on their entire bond stocks had ""blindsided"" investors. 
""While the government has gradually loosened its housing policies, some weaker developers have already gone beyond their tipping point,"" they added.

Notably, however, excluding those idiosyncratic situations, the rest of the EM high yield corporate space is expected to see only a modest 1.1% default rate this year. 
Latin America's forecast remains sub-3% and the Middle East & Africa's sub-1%, which compares to 0.75% and 1.50% in the United States' and Europe's respective high yield markets.

1045,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",Shopify’s 50% Slump Proves That It’s No Amazon,"(Bloomberg) -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. has been called “Amazon Junior.” Those shoes are proving too big to fill.
Both companies are seen as bellwethers for the e-commerce sector and they are index heavyweights, too: Shopify is 3.1% of Canada’s benchmark stock index and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). is 3.7% of the S&P 500. 
Unfortunately for Shopify investors, that’s where the similarities end. 
Shopify provides the software and other services that allow small businesses to sell on their own websites, an increasingly competitive business that skeptics say is becoming commoditized. Amazon is not only a mammoth online retailer in its own right and offers a marketplace for smaller businesses, but it also operates a fabulously profitable cloud-computing business.
That helps explain why Shopify has been routed this year along with many other high-multiple software stocks -- falling 50%, erasing about $85 billion in market value. Amazon is down less than 2%.
“They are two different businesses,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer and founder of research firm New Constructs. “Even with the recent stock price decline, shares remain priced for Shopify to be bigger than Amazon. Shopify remains significantly overvalued.” Trainer has one of two sell ratings on it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Both stocks received a huge lift when the pandemic hit in 2020 and consumers turned en masse to online shopping. But Shopify has given back most of those gains as investors take a closer look at the fundamentals. 
The company’s growth, while still impressive, is slowing. In its last earnings report, Ottawa-based Shopify warned that sales growth will be lower in the first quarter of this year. For the year, analysts expect sales to increase 31%, down from 57% last year.  
Without a true cash-cow business like Amazon Web Services, Shopify’s profitability is modest and its valuation is sky high. The company’s enterprise value, which includes net debt, is more than 140 times estimated earnings, compared with less than 19 for Amazon. 
That’s not uncommon for a young company that’s growing, of course. But therein lies the problem for the stock: Software providers with rich valuations are one of the market’s most out-of-favor groups. It’s a combination of a retreat from high-valuation stocks because of rising interest rates, skittishness about companies that aren’t very profitable, and slowing growth rates after the pandemic pulled forward demand for some tech services.

Despite the brutal selloff, some Shopify bulls are undaunted. 
“If you can look past the next couple of years, you see that there is still good secular growth at an expensive price,” said Jordan Stuart, client portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). “A lot of portfolio managers are looking at large cap indexes, saying I have that exposure, what else do I want to own? I’ve got to own something different and Shopify is going to provide that opportunity.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Tech investors have been treated to a wild ride over the first three-plus months of the year. The Nasdaq 100 Index has closed higher or lower by at least 1% on 73% of trading days in 2022, which would be the highest percentage in two decades if the trend were to continue for the remainder of the year.

Is this 2000? Or 2006 or even 2019? Financial markets in the last two weeks have had analysts reaching for the history books to explain a vigorous stock market rally and rising short-dated government bond yields.
And while some of the analyses can get lost in the blizzard of impressive milestones notched up by commodities and bonds in the first quarter of 2022, one thing is clear: this has the classic indicators of a late cycle economic expansion.
A period when economic growth is strong but slowing and inflation is high forcing policymakers to squeeze the monetary spigots means only one thing: time to load up on quality names.
Despite the 11% rise in world stocks in the last two weeks, utilities and healthcare names have outperformed the wider index. Even in credit markets where a high yield bond market rally has dominated headlines, the top gainers are defensive telecoms and utility names, according to BofA. 
That trend shows no signs of slowing in the early days of April. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields hit their highest levels in three years at 2.4950%, pushing the dollar higher while an index of Asian stocks paused after recent gains.
A strong monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday and hawkish comments by U.S. policymakers has prompted traders to price in a 73% probability of a 50 basis points rate hike in May. The last time the Fed hiked rates by that quantum was in the tech-mania days of May 2000.

Leonardo said in March its free cash flow would more than double this year compared with 2021.
Profumo said he expected NATO countries to ramp up military spending to reach 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) over time.
The fact that the European Union has a coordinated plan on how to spend money for defence is even more important than an expected increase in NATO members' spending, he added. 
Italy will only hit the NATO goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2028, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week, confirming it will miss an original target of 2024 after opposition from within his ruling coalition.
The government currently earmarks around 1.4% of economic output for military spending and would have had to increase its defence budget by 12 billion euros over the next two years to reach a goal established by members of the Atlantic alliance in 2014.
On Monday Leonardo presented its cyber security training centre for security professionals who work in the defence sector, in the public administrations, critical infrastructures and businesses. 
""The war (in Ukraine) has increased cyber threats and has also made them more evident,"" said Leonardo's head of the cyber security division Tommaso Profeta, speaking about Italy.

The government last month ordered public authorities to replace Russia-based Kaspersky Lab antivirus software to prevent any disruption of services due to the ongoing Ukrainian conflict.
""Leonardo is ready to integrate its cyber security services and products with the ones of international groups as a way to offer a guarantee to Italian institutions and businesses,"" Profeta said.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock surged by over 26% in premarket trading Monday after a regulatory filing revealed Elon Musk owns a 9.2% stake in the social media platform, potentially making the maverick CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) the largest shareholder in the social media platform.
Twitter has an equity base of almost 799 million shares.
Musk is a prolific Twitter user, tweeting several times a day, using the platform to make announcements, talk about Bitcoin and other cryptos, take feedback on just about anything, and attend to complaints by customers of the electric vehicle maker.
His penchant to tweet and make stock-price-sensitive announcements have also landed him in the crosshairs of the regulators more than once.
He has more than 80.1 million followers on the microblogging site.
Lately, Musk has been critical of Twitter for failing to adhere to free speech.
In a March 25 tweet, he posted a poll and asked his voters to say ‘yes/no’ if they believed Twitter rigorously adheres to the principle of free speech?
At the same time, Musk and Twitter's billionaire co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey have shared some camaraderie on the platform while dismissing the so-called Web3, a term for a decentralized version of the internet that is still evolving."
1050,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",Elon Musk Now the Single Biggest Shareholder of Twitter,"Earlier today, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, disclosed a 9.2% ""passive"" stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) via a 13G filing with the SEC.
Musk acquired 73,486,938 shares of TWTR stock, which, according to Reuters ownership data, makes him the single largest shareholder of the social network.
A former No.1, The Vanguard Group, owns 70.38M shares according to the latest filing, followed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management with 64.72M shares.
By comparison, Twitter's current CEO Agrawal Parag owns just over 500k shares of the company's stock, while co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey's stake is less than 2%.
The share acquisition comes as Elon Musk, one of Twitter's most prominent users with over 80M followers, voiced criticism over the social network's censorship practices, going as far as to tweet ""Is a new platform needed?""
Shares of Twitter are gaining close to 30% in heavy pre-market trading."

The proposed revision signals Beijing's latest effort to settle the audit dispute with the U.S. which could result in the delisting of 270 Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges in 2024.
As a result, shares of US-listed Chinese companies soared in pre-open Monday.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is up roughly 5%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are trading 8.5% and 5.7% higher, respectively.
The new proposal removes requirements that on-site inspection of offshore listings be carried out primarily by Chinese regulators. The move could significantly help in resolving the audit dispute after U.S. regulators demanded complete access to audit working papers of Chinese companies that are listed overseas.
The proposal is expected to support ""cross-border regulatory cooperation, including joint inspections, which will help safeguard the interest of global investors,"" said the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Chinese and U.S. regulators met several times, with both sides showing determination in resolving the dispute, the CSRC added.
The move primarily indicates China's desire to ensure its companies remain listed in the U.S., however, the U.S. regulators have dismissed the rumors of an imminent audit deal with China.
Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) named 11 U.S. listed Chinese companies that could be delisted, including Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Yum (NYSE:YUM), among others.
The revised confidentiality rules underscore that Chinese companies are responsible for information security in offshore listings, minimizing the chances of confidential information making way to auditors working papers, said the Chinese regulator.
The draft rules now include procedural requirements, which require Chinese companies to provide a written explanation when sharing sensitive information with intermediaries including underwriters and auditors. However, the CSRC expects these occasions to happen very rarely.
The commission also said the draft rules will provide clear guidelines to help companies protect state secrets and hence ensure orderly securities issuance and listings.

""Starting immediately, we are suspending our share repurchasing program,"" Schultz said in an open letter published on Monday.
""This decision will allow us to invest more into our people and our stores, the only way to create long-term value for all stakeholders.""
Schultz's return marks his third spell as Starbucks CEO as the world's largest coffeehouse chain continues the search for its permanent Chief Executive. The company said it will find a new CEO by the fall.
However, the past several months have been challenging for Starbucks after multiple stores unionized against the company for the first time ever since its founding in 1971.
The move comes just a few weeks after Starbucks brought back its share buyback program, saying it plans to return $20 billion to its shareholders over the following three fiscal years.
Some think the decision to suspend the program was made to support Starbucks management, while others, including Bernie Sanders, slammed the company after the announcement.
""If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends ... it can afford a unionized workforce, said Sanders.
The unionization wave at Starbucks emerged in December 2021 in New York after two workers voted to unionize as Starbucks Workers United.
The union is yet to present official requirements to the company's management, though one of the workers said he hopes it will secure a $25 minimum wage for baristas, in addition to company-provided benefits such as mental health care plans.
The wave spread quickly after that and now more than 100 Starbucks locations across the U.S. have joined the union.
Starbucks stock is down 1% in pre-open Monday.

1053,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:23AM ET</span>",3 Analysts Discuss Tesla's Q1 Delivery Figures,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported Q1 electric vehicle deliveries of 310,048, up 68% from the year-ago period and slightly above the previous quarter. The number also beat Wall Street consensus estimates of 308,836, as per Refinitiv.
On the other hand, the production of electric vehicles (EVs) was down compared to the previous quarter due to supply chain issues and a halt at the company's plant in China.
The number of produced EVs from January to March was 305,407, slightly down from 305,840 in the earlier quarter.
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a tweet. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""
The report showed that Tesla has stayed resilient amid global supply chain issues and the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic, but also thanks to its new Shanghai plant. Still, the carmaker has been forced to suspend production at the Shanghai factory due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in China.
The company reported 295,324 sales of its Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility cars, in addition to 14,724 deliveries of Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch reflected positively on the delivery report. The analyst is bullish on Tesla shares.
Given its Shanghai facility under COVID-19 lockdown last week, costing the company as much as 2K vehicles per day, we expect most investors will give TSLA a pass on deliveries coming in a bit light for the quarter. We note deliveries continue to outpace production pointing to very strong demand, especially when considering the significant price increases TSLA has taken. We expect investors to be focused on ramp progress in Austin and Berlin, notably on 4680 battery yields, along with stability of gross margins and any updates on recurring revenue ramp for insurance and FSD when TSLA reports later this month, Rusch said in a client note.
On the other hand, JPMorgan ) analyst Ryan Brinkman raised the price target on Tesla to $335.00 per share from $325.00 to reflect raised Q1 EPS estimates. Brinkman raised the Q1 EPS forecast to $2.10, up from $1.94 but lower than the consensus of $2.25.
The new price target implies a downside of nearly 70%.
Brinkman expects Tesla to deliver 1.263 million (up from the prior forecast of 1.246) EV units in 2022, which is much lower than Tesla's own expectations of 1.446 million. The Visible Alpha consensus stands at 1.45 million.
We expect Tesla to be largely successful in passing along higher prices near-term, given its waitlist, with positive implications for revenue, neutral implications for profit dollars, and negative implications for profit margin, although the longer-term impact is less clear, Brinkman said.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney argues that Tesla executed well amidst ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.
We continue to believe the Austin and Berlin ramps will be a key factor to monitor for production, deliveries, and auto gross margins in 2022, especially given the introduction of new product/manufacturing technologies and ongoing supply-chain related challenges.
Delaney also lowered the 2022 deliveries estimate to 1.50 mn from 1.51 mn to reflect the Q1 results and additional shutdown days in Shanghai in Q2.
Tesla stock price is up 1.2% in pre-open Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union said on Monday it has widened access for U.S. exchanges and clearing houses to investors in the bloc, a move which contrasts with Brussels' intention to shut off clearing houses in London in 2025.
The EU's executive European Commission said a number of exchanges in the United States which trade derivatives and are supervised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can now be used by investors from the EU.
It also broadened EU market access for U.S. clearing houses, also known as central counterparties or CCPs, to allow EU investors to clear U.S. products like mortgage-backed securities.
""These decisions are in the interest of the EU - we want our capital markets to be better integrated with other international markets,"" EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness said in a statement.
""We look forward to continued good cooperation between the EU institutions and agencies and the US Securities and Exchange Commission,"" McGuinness said.
The bloc's securities watchdog ESMA will proceed with the technical work needed to implement the decisions.

McGuinness has said that clearing houses in Britain, which has left the EU, won't be allowed to continue serving customers in the bloc after June 2025 under the same ""equivalence"" system that she granted to U.S. clearers and exchanges on Monday.
Brussels has said it wants to end the bloc's heavy reliance on derivatives clearers in London.

The largest EV maker in the world was hoping to restart production as it expected a return of its employees to the factory from a lockdown enforced by Shanghai authorities to curb the spread of coronavirus cases.
But the company will not go ahead with the plan to resume production on Monday, citing no particular reason, as per Reuters.
Tesla first suspended production at the Shanghai plant on March 28 after the city's authorities imposed a two-stage lockdown in the area east of the Huangpu River.
The production halt was initially planned to last four days, but Tesla was forced to extend the suspension for Friday and Saturday as well after Shanghai extended restrictions in the area where the plant is located.
This is one of the longest production halts since the Shanghai factory was opened in late 2019. The plant, which manufactures vehicles for the China market and represents a key export hub for Tesla, produces 6,000 Model 3 and 10,000 Model Y cars per week.
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions and China zero-COVID policy,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a tweet on Saturday.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney believes the Shanghai production resumption will be a key factor for 2Q deliveries, given that the factory makes roughly 2K vehicles per day per CPCA data.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely flat Monday, with investors talking a cautious stance ahead of the release of key minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting while monitoring developments in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 25 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.4%.
The main Wall Street indices posted healthy gains on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 140 points of 0.4% higher, while both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%.
The economic highlight of the new week will be Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, which will likely give investors an update on how officials view the monetary policy outlook following the central bank’s decision to lift interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point.
With inflation running at a four-decade high, and Friday’s official month jobs report showing continued strong growth in the labor market, the Fed is widely expected to hike by half a percentage point at its next meeting on May 4.
Expectations of hefty rate hikes by the Fed resulted in a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverting on Friday, with the 2-year U.S. Treasury note yielding more than the 10-year note, a phenomenon that has predicted recessions in the past.
Investors will also continue to keep an eye on the latest developments in Ukraine, after reports over the weekend pointed to evidence of atrocities committed by Russian troops against civilians in the town of Bucha, something Moscow has denied.
Finance ministers from the Eurozone are meeting to discuss fresh sanctions on Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron indicated earlier Monday that the bloc should extend measures to cover Russian oil and coal, although he left out natural gas as that would run into political difficulties in Germany, which depends heavily on Russian gas.
In the corporate sector, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is likely to be in the spotlight after CEO Jamie Dimon warned Monday that the bank could lose about $1 billion on its Russia exposure.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will also be in focus after a regulatory filing showed that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in the social media company.
Oil prices stabilized after last week’s weakness after a number of major consuming nations, led by the U.S., announced plans to release crude from their strategic reserves in an attempt to cool soaring prices.
The U.S. announced, late last week, plans to release one million barrels a day for six months, starting in May, while members of the International Energy Agency also agreed to release more oil.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $99.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $104.31. The two benchmarks both recorded weekly losses of around 13% last week.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 06:31AM ET</span>","Workday to build Dublin campus to house 1,000 more workers","DUBLIN (Reuters) - Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) Inc will add 1,000 jobs at its European headquarters in Dublin over the next two years and construct a 51,000 square metre campus in the capital to accommodate the expansion, the U.S. software company said on Monday.
Workday specialises in cloud-based applications for finance and human resources, and the jobs will be across product development, engineering and data science, sales, and customer services.
The new jobs are in addition to the 1,700 already employed in Dublin, where it has had a presence since 2008. 
Ireland's economy is hugely reliant on multinational firms, which employ around one in nine workers in the country, particularly big technology and drugs companies attracted in part by its low corporate tax rate.
In December, the country's foreign direct investment agency IDA Ireland said the number of people employed by multinationals had hit an all-time high of 275,000 in 2021, up 10% on its pre-pandemic level.

The plans to construct a new headquarters near the grounds of Technological University Dublin makes Workday the latest technology company to establish a campus-style site in the city, after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google bought or leased large spaces in recent years.
""Today's announcement of 1,000 new jobs by Workday is a very significant endorsement of Ireland as a place to do business and in our reputation as a leading tech hub in Europe,"" Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said in a statement.

1065,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 06:18AM ET</span>","Dimon Calls for More Sanctions on Russia, Expresses Pity for Fed","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called for ratcheting up sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine and said the Federal Reserve may ultimately raise interest rates more than the market expects.
The U.S. should increase sanctions “in whatever way national security experts recommend to maximize the right outcomes,” Dimon wrote Monday in his annual letter to shareholders. The war and the resulting sanctions “will slow the global economy -- and it could easily get worse.”
The geopolitical upheaval, unleashing an energy crisis that’s exacerbating already surging inflation, has put the central bank in a precarious spot. Rates will rise substantially, and the current tightening cycle “is in no way traditional,” Dimon said.
While the government and the Fed did the right thing by injecting massive liquidity into the financial system in its initial response to the pandemic, in hindsight the monetary support coupled with fiscal stimulus “was probably too much and lasted too long,” he said. 
“I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow,” Dimon wrote. “If the Fed gets it just right, we can have years of growth, and inflation will eventually start to recede. In any event, this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets.”
Challenges Abound
Dimon, 66, took over JPMorgan at the end of 2005 and has risen to become the nation’s most prominent and vocal banker, often serving as a spokesperson for the industry. His latest annual letter runs 44 pages, shorter than last year’s 65, and describes “challenges at every turn” -- a marked shift in tone from 2021, when he predicted an economic boom that could endure for years.
The U.S. needs to be prepared for a long war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes, Dimon said, adding that while JPMorgan’s direct exposure to Russia is limited, the firm could still lose about $1 billion over time. The biggest U.S. bank, with $3.74 trillion of assets at year-end, is also concerned about the secondary impacts of the sanctions and Russia’s response, he wrote.
Dimon called for a restructuring of trade and supply chains, where national security could be threatened. Higher energy prices highlight the “urgent global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably,” he wrote.
While long-term clean energy solutions are important, the U.S. should increase energy production and get more liquefied natural gas to Europe “immediately,” he said, noting that these objectives aren’t mutually exclusive.
Bond Payments
JPMorgan and its Wall Street peers have been on the front lines when it comes to enforcing sanctions, as the U.S. and its allies seek to inflict significant financial pain on Russia in response to its invasion. Russia’s continuing sovereign and corporate bond payments have thrust a rare spotlight on the back-office mechanisms that help process trillions of dollars of daily transactions.
“Managing this has been an enormous undertaking,” Dimon wrote. “It is completely different from navigating a financial crisis or a severe recession. This entails sanctioning individuals, including their ownership of assets and companies; reducing exposures across multiple products and services; analyzing and stopping billions of dollars of payments as directed by governments; and many other actions.”
Dimon said his firm is “following both the letter of the law and the spirit of all the American and allied sanctions.” Last month, JPMorgan and rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). faced criticism from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, after Bloomberg reported that the two banks had been purchasing beaten-down Russian corporate bonds.

The JPMorgan CEO devoted a section of his letter to the firm’s investments and acquisitions. “We hope a few examples will give you comfort in our decision-making process,” he told shareholders.
The bank faced investor pushback earlier this year after executives said they expect expenses to surge 8.6% in 2022. JPMorgan has spent almost $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months and expects most of them to produce positive returns “within a few years,” he wrote.
The economic relationship between the U.S. and China is “critical” to both sides, and trade between them will remain after trade partnerships have been altered, according to Dimon. 
China has a “huge interest in making this work,” he said, citing that nation’s $3.6 trillion trade relationship with the West in 2021 as compared to its $150 billion trade relationship with Russia in the same year. 
He also said the U.S. should rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“We need to look at trade as only one part of strategic economic partnerships -- and that’s exactly what TPP did,” he wrote. “There is a lot at stake, but there is no reason why serious, comprehensive, honest negotiations can’t lead to good outcomes.”

1066,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 05:54AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Says ‘Bear Market Rally’ Is Now Over,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent rebound in equity markets will prove short-lived, one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears said on Monday, advising investors to seek refuge in bonds as economic growth slows. 
“The bear market rally is over,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “That leaves us more constructive on bonds than stocks over the near term as growth concerns take center stage – hence our doubling down on a defensive bias.”
Wilson’s thesis is that the economy is heading for a sharp slowdown, due to a “payback in demand from last year’s fiscal stimulus, demand destruction from high prices, food and energy price spikes from the war that serve as a tax, and inventory builds that have now caught up to demand.” This less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop will become increasingly harder for investors to ignore, as it eats away at corporate profits. 
Despite concerns that the war raging in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions targeting one of the bedrocks of global commodity supply will exacerbate record inflationary pressures, U.S. and European equities rebounded last month, paring their quarterly losses. Wilson and his team had advised investors to sell the rally, arguing that it lacks legs.
The bearish view contrasts sharply with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s team, which has been persistently calling for more upside to equities, saying growth concerns are overblown.
“Geopolitics remains a wild card, but we do not see equities fundamental risk-reward to be as bearish as it is currently fashionable to portray,” JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. While Morgan Stanley’s Wilson doubled down on his recommendation for defensive stocks, Matejka and his colleagues said traditional defensives “should not have legs to a bounce beyond the geopolitical dislocation,” advising an underweight position. 
At the start of the year, Wilson had the lowest year-end target for the S&P 500 index out of all the equity strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. He had similarly bearish views in 2021, which he later acknowledged were “wrong,” amid a brisk rally that pushed the main U.S. benchmark to successive records.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 04:40AM ET</span>","Ryanair narrows full-year loss forecast, traffic tops pre-pandemic levels","By Graham (NYSE:GHM) Fahy
DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland's Ryanair narrowed the range for its forecast annual loss on Monday as passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time ahead of the key Easter holiday period. 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it now expects a net loss between 350 million euros and 400 million euros ($386 million to $441 million) for the year to March 31, 2022. 
It had previously guided the market to a loss of between 250 million euros and 450 million euros with Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last week pointing to the middle of the range and telling Reuters the airline was well placed for the coming year depending on traffic recovery and fares.
Ryanair said it had flown 11.2 million people last month compared to just 0.5 million during lockdown a year ago and 10.9 million in March 2019, the first time it had carried more passengers in a given month than in the corresponding pre-pandemic period.
That included the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine which caused the cancellation of 2,000 flights and the ongoing suspension of activity in Ukraine, where it is one of the largest foreign operators.
While full-year traffic topped 97 million passengers, up from 27.5 million in the previous 12 months, it was still well below a pre-pandemic peak of 149 million.
Ahead of the what O'Leary has called the ""critical"" Easter holiday period, Ryanair's load factor - a measure of how well an airline is filling available seats - nudged up to 87% in March, in line with a forecast made by the CEO in January of almost 90% by April.
The airline also said it had increased its fuel hedging to 80% cover for 2023, with around 65% locked-in at $630 per metric tonne through jet swaps - a hedging tool - and 15% caps at $775.
Ryanair had previously hedged 80% of its needs for the first half of 2023 and 70% for the second half.
Almost 10% of its fuel requirements for the first half of its 2024 financial year are hedged at $760 per metric tonne, it added.
The expected annual loss would be an improvement on the 815 million euro ($989 million) after-tax loss recorded in 2021.

Low cost rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) said on Monday it cancelled some flights to and from Britain after a new COVID-19 surge left it short of staff.

Credit Suisse racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.73 billion) loss last year when it was hit by the implosion of investment fund Archegos and the collapse of $10 billion in SCFFs linked to insolvent British financier Greensill.
""It is expected that litigation will be necessary to enforce claims against individual debtors and the insurance companies, which may take around five years,"" the Swiss bank said on Monday in a document on its website answering questions from pension fund adviser Ethos.
It said its asset management had taken all necessary steps to collect the outstanding amounts since March 2021, but in some cases refinancing or sales of assets were not yet possible. 
""It can be assumed that investors in the Virtuoso Fund and the High Income Fund will suffer a loss,"" it said, adding the percentage of the potential loss could not be estimated at this stage.
Credit Suisse also gave details of a $140 million loan its investment banking granted to Greensill in November 2020 ahead of a possible private placement of shares in Greensill or an initial public offering that did not happen in the end.
It said the loan did not affect the SCFFs as it was granted by Credit Suisse's investment banking division. 
Shareholder representative Ethos Foundation had asked for more information about the Greensill affair as well as the so-called ""Suisse Secrets"" dirty money scandal in February that raised questions about accounts held at the bank between the 1940s and the 2010s.

Credit Suisse said it had not identified any new concerns related to the latter affair and its actions ""were in line with applicable processes and requirements at the relevant time"".

ExxonMobil said last month it would exit its Russian oil and gas operations, which it had valued at more than $4 billion, and halt new investment due to sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.
The decision would see Exxon pull out of managing large oil and gas production facilities on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, and put the fate of a proposed multi-billion dollar LNG facility there in doubt.
Exxon had planned to build the Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) (LNG) project with annual capacity of more than 6 million tonnes as part of Sakhalin-1 consortium led by Russian energy giant Rosneft.
""The project, which the Americans - Exxon - had announced at the port of De Kastri with the pipe from Sakhalin, it is frozen until further notice from them,"" Interfax quoted the Khabarovsk region's governor Mikhail Degtyaryov as saying.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely lower Monday, helped by a positive tone from Asia but talk of more sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine weighed.
By 3:25 AM ET (0725 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6%, while U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
Some European Union governments are now thinking of new sanctions on Moscow after Ukrainian and European officials accused Russian forces of atrocities in the town of Bucha, denied by Russia's defense ministry.
Germany's defense minister said on Sunday that the European Union must discuss banning imports of Russian gas, a step that would have severe economic ramifications on European growth given the reliance of a number of Eurozone countries, and Germany, in particular, on Moscow for energy supplies.
This talk has tended to overshadow a strong performance from equity markets in Asia, and Chinese technology stocks in Hong Kong, in particular, earlier Monday after Beijing announced plans to remove a key hurdle, preventing full U.S. access to audits of Chinese firms listed there.
These changes may reduce the risk of Chinese firms losing their Wall Street listings, the potential of which has weighed heavily on the sector.
Back in Europe, European producer price data for February are due later in the session and are expected to show a hefty annual rise of 27%, further illustrating the pressures the European Central Bank is under to act after data last week showed Eurozone consumer inflation hitting a fresh record high of 7.5% in March.
The ECB is set to publish the minutes of its March meeting on Thursday, and these will be studied carefully ahead of its upcoming meeting on April 14.
In corporate news,  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock rose 0.8% after the Swiss drugmaker said it was integrating its pharmaceuticals and oncology units into an innovative medicines business to simplify its structure, targeting savings of at least $1 billion by 2024. 
Rival drugmaker Roche (SIX:RO) stock rose 1.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review to its drug to treat COVID in hospitalized adults.
Oil prices traded higher Monday, recouping some of last week’s hefty losses as a number of major consuming nations, led by the U.S., announced plans to release crude from their strategic reserves in an attempt to cool soaring prices.
The U.S. announced, late last week, plans to release one million barrels a day for six months, starting in May, while members of the International Energy Agency also agreed to release more oil.
By 2:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $100.30 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $105.47. The two benchmarks both recorded weekly losses of around 13% last week.

Germany's defense minister said on Sunday that the European Union must discuss banning imports of Russian gas, a step that these European countries have so far avoided given their reliance on Moscow for energy supplies.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 01:41AM ET</span>",Digicel says PNG tax could impact Australian buyout of Pacific mobile networks,"By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Digicel Group said it is considering legal options after Papua New Guinea (PNG) imposed a tax of almost $100 million that the telco said could affect its planned A$2.1 billion ($1.57 billion) sale of the Pacific's biggest mobile network to Australia's Telstra (OTC:TLSYY).
Telstra Corp Ltd said last October it would buy the Pacific operations of Jamaica-headquartered Digicel in a deal largely funded by the Australian government and seen by observers as a way to block China's rising influence in the region. The operations include 2.5 million mobile phone subscribers across PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa and Nauru. 
Digicel's Irish founder, Denis O'Brien, met with PNG Prime Minister James Marape last week to try to resolve the matter, Digicel said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.
""In parallel with these discussions, Digicel is also considering its legal options in the event that this discriminatory tax is not removed,"" Digicel said.
Its statement said a ""new arbitrary, company-specific tax"" was introduced on March 25, which was ""perplexing not just for Digicel, but also for the Papua New Guinea economy given the reputational and credit rating implications of this sudden, bizarre and unprecedented tax"".
The act imposes a one-time tax liability on Digicel of 350 million kina ($96.43 million) with a further penalty of 50 million kina for non-payment, the statement said.
""This matter requires urgent resolution given its implications for the sale of Digicel's Pacific operations to Telstra but also given the knock-on consequences for all foreign direct investment exiting Papua New Guinea,"" Digicel said.
The statement said the prime minister in the meeting assured Digicel the tax would not proceed and that ""Digicel is now engaged in discussions with the Papua New Guinea Government and other relevant stakeholders.""
Marape's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Papua New Guinea treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey told parliament last month it would impose a ""fair tax"" on Digicel Pacific as part of national budget repair measures, in recognition of the company's high historic level of profitability. The tax was half the rate of an ongoing levy on the company proposed last year, he said.
An official in Ling-Stuckey's office told Reuters on Monday there had been no announced change in this position, although ""they have been deliberating over the past week on the tax"".
Telstra has not changed its business plan for the deal since the new tax was announced. A Telstra spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the PNG tax was a matter for the current owner of Digicel Pacific. In response to Reuters' questions it said it was still awaiting PNG regulatory approvals for the deal.
""The acquisition of Digicel Pacific by Telstra in partnership with the Australian government has not yet received all of its regulatory approvals and has not (been) completed yet,"" it said.
The ongoing levy on Digicel Pacific, flagged by the government last November, would be dropped if the sale to Telstra went ahead, Ling-Stuckey told parliament in March. Telstra had agreed to invest in infrastructure including 115 mobile towers in Papua New Guinea, and other taxes worth more annually, he said.
“Telstra is committed to investing to improve connectivity in the areas that Digicel Pacific operates in, including remote areas of PNG,"" Telstra said in a statement.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 01:27AM ET</span>","Carmakers dream of clean, green, mean electric machines","By Nick Carey and Barbara Lewis
WASHINGTON, England (Reuters) - An electric car is a clean car, right? If only it were so simple.
From motor magnets with toxic histories to batteries made using copious fossil-fuel power, many challenges face carmakers seeking to purge dirtier materials from their supply chains to satisfy regulators and investors.
These obstacles represent opportunities for a growing group of companies in the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem that bet they can capitalise on that demand.
They include Advanced Electric Machines (AEM) in northern England, which is working with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) luxury brand Bentley and others in the auto industry to develop recyclable electric motors free of rare earth metals, which are often produced using polluting chemicals.
""Our customers need ways to ditch internal combustion engines that are cost-effective and sustainable without putting tons of this nasty rare earth stuff into their cars,"" CEO James Widmer said.
The increasing scrutiny of supply chains comes as the European Union, which announced draft laws last year to enforce net-zero emissions targets, considers charging for excess carbon on imports, as well as legislation requiring ethical sourcing and a recycling plan for EV batteries.
Globally, the prospect looms of national carbon taxes that could cost lagging automakers dearly, while investors and financiers increasingly favour companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.
""The focus on ESG has become more intense,"" said Moshiel Biton, CEO of Israeli battery technology company Addionics, which makes three-dimensional electrodes that Biton says are more efficient, making cleaner but less energy-dense battery chemistries commercially viable.
""But it's nothing compared to what's coming.""
Yet it remains to be seen how many of the companies looking to tap the market for cleaning up electric cars will succeed in a rapidly evolving EV technology arena; what's cutting edge today could be obsolete tomorrow.
Given fierce competition, any projects not advanced enough at the right time will risk missing their chance, according to MacMurray Whale, environmental sustainability strategist at Cormark Securities in Toronto.
""You won't be able to attract the investor interest because there's a lot of them and they're all trying to argue they're the best,"" he said.
'ROAD MAP TO NET ZERO'
The demand is real, though, from carmakers who face a daunting task to navigate the challenges of making everything from steel to aluminium using cleaner processes, to finding less environmentally damaging battery chemistries.
""We only source new business with suppliers with a road map to net zero,"" said Andy Palmer, an electric vehicle pioneer who is CEO of  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Mobility, a British-based EV maker owned by Indian commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland.
Switch buys credits to offset the carbon used to make metal components and factors in that cost when assessing new parts, he added.
Squeezing carbon out of the supply chain is a ""vital part"" of BMW's carbon-reduction strategy, sustainability vice president Thomas Becker said.
The German carmaker has negotiated with all its battery suppliers and many of its steel and aluminium suppliers that their materials are made using renewable energy, Becker told a conference in London in March.
The problem with EVs is they are so carbon intensive to make, they have to drive thousands of miles before they do less harm to the environment than a gas-guzzling saloon.
BMW has measured the CO2 footprint throughout its supply chain. If it took no action, its footprint per vehicle would be 18 tonnes of CO2 in 2030, versus 12 tonnes per vehicle in 2019, according to the carmaker. But its carbon reduction plans should cut that number to nine tonnes by 2030, it says.
The need for greener EVs has sent some carmakers back to the drawing board.
Pennsylvania-based engineering company Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), which develops modelling software for various industries, has seen surging demand from carmakers seeking to simulate cars and components with greener or lighter materials, such as aluminium instead of steel, said Pepi Maksimovic, director of application engineering.
""There's an intensification of the effort to address these issues in terms of ... bringing better cleaner, greener, meaner technology to the market faster, earlier,"" she added.
'CARBON TAX IS COMING'
Previous corporate sustainability efforts have often been derided as vague and as ""greenwashing"".
Costa Caldis, chief operating officer of supply chain tracing company SAFE, said carmakers were moving in the right direction, but not fast enough.
""Stakeholders are demanding supply chain visibility and not just statements.""
Douglas Johnson-Poensgen, CEO of Circulor, which maps supply chains for the likes of BMW and Volvo, said financing from investors was increasingly tied to ESG targets.
""Everybody recognises they need to know where they're sourcing things from and what they're inheriting from their supply chain.""
Makram Azar, CEO of London-based investment group Full Circle Capital, said companies in the auto sector that ""tick all the right ESG boxes"" should find raising capital easier.
""Big asset managers who have allocated huge sums of money to invest in ESG compliant companies have found there aren't enough of them,"" said Azar.
More carbon levies could help to change that.
Full Circle has invested in Britishvolt, a British startup that's building an EV battery plant that will run only using renewable energy.
Peter Rolton, Britishvolt's executive chairman, said national governments would need alternatives to fuel taxes that raise vast sums, and taxing carbon would help to squeeze it out of supply chains.
""Carbon taxation is an inevitable part of a 2050 net-zero vision,"" he added. ""You can see that one coming.""
MINING IN MADAGASCAR
AEM, based in Washington, a city with roots in northeast England's industrial history, has developed a recyclable motor for EVs using electrical steel and aluminium instead of copper and magnets, thus removing rare earth metals. CEO Widmer said AEM's motors would be cheaper than conventional ones and in carmakers' tests have been up to 15% more efficient.
As well as the environmental considerations, many carmakers and suppliers want to reduce reliance on China, which controls 90% of global rare earths metals supply.
China's dominance extends to graphite, crucial for anodes for EV batteries, which is typically produced using electricity from coal.
Canadian-listed mine developer NextSource plans to start commercial production of graphite in Madagascar from 2023 to capitalise on demand from companies looking to diversify supplies.
Executive vice president Brent Nykoliation said contracts with carmakers should be lucrative and long as they seek to lock in supplies tailor-made to their requirements.

""The conversation has changed dramatically in the last 12 months,"" Nykoliation said, referring to carmakers' engagement with mineral production.

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 12:00AM ET</span>",Chinese Tech Stocks Rise as U.S. Delisting Concerns Ease,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese technology stocks advanced as Beijing sought to remove a key sticking point in its audit dispute with the U.S., easing investor concerns over shares getting kicked off from American exchanges.
The Hang Seng Tech Index climbed as much as 2.9% in early Monday trading, led by Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc., XPeng Inc. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., which all have shares also listed in the U.S.  
China is planning to modify a rule that restricts offshore-listed firms from sharing sensitive financial data with foreign regulators, Beijing said on Saturday. The changes may pave the way for U.S. authorities to gain full access to auditing reports of Chinese firms listed there, helping resolve a key bilateral dispute that had unnerved investors. 
Read: China Removes Key Hurdle to Allow U.S. Full Access to Audits
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index of Chinese firms jumped on Friday as Bloomberg reported of China’s considerations. Financial markets in the mainland are closed due to a public holiday on Monday. 
“The modification will partially address concerns of delisting risks if the cross-border regulatory cooperation could go smoothly as laid out per the rule,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a report on Monday.
Read: China’s Rule Change to Help Ease Delisting Risks: Street Wrap  
However, some analysts caution that more definitive action is needed from Chinese authorities to fully resolve the tension with U.S. regulators over delisting risks. They add that certain companies like state-owned enterprises and tech firms with more sensitive data may be barred from U.S. listings ultimately.
The Hang Seng Tech Index is down near 60% since its February 2021 peak, driven by Beijing’s regulatory crackdown and uncertainties over the fate of Chinese tech giants trading in the U.S. 
That’s even after the gauge has recovered more than 30% from a record low in mid-March after Beijing vowed to keep capital markets stable and make regulatory changes more predictable.  
“In order to negate investors’ fears totally on the aspect of ADR delisting, we need to see or have some form of concrete actions finalized from China rather than pipelines framework that are still in the midst of drafting,” said Kelvin Wong, analyst at CMC Markets.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning, but U.S. equity futures and Treasuries fell as the Fed could tighten its monetary policy further and Russia faces more sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.04% by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.23%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.44%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.85%.
Chinese markets were closed for a holiday, with a COVID-19 lockdown in the city of Shanghai continuing and a new subtype of the Omicron variant reportedly detected in the country.
However, Chinese technology shares could get a boost after the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Saturday removed a key hurdle preventing full U.S. access to audits.
In Europe, some European Union governments are mulling new sanctions on Russia following reports that its troops executed unarmed civilians in Ukrainian towns.
Investors are awaiting the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due on Wednesday. The minutes could provide important clues on the central bank’s asset tapering plans, as well as help calculate the probability of a half percentage-point interest rate increase in May.
“It would not be surprising to see yields rise further from here and it is very hard to know where they will land,” Evergreen Consultants founder and director Angela Ashton said in a note.

A stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday also bolstered the case for the Fed’s tighter monetary policy. Non-farm payrolls rose by 431,000, while the unemployment rate was 3.6%, in March. Separate data also showed that the Institute of Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for March was 57.1, while the manufacturing PMI was 58.8.
New York Fed President John Williams on Saturday said a “sequence of steps” could get interest rates back to more normal levels. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview published Sunday that rising inflation and a tight labor market strengthen the case for a half-point hike in May 2022.
Other Fed policymakers will speak throughout the week, starting with Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker follows on Wednesday, while St. Louis Fed’s James Bullard, Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans will speak at separate events on Thursday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's southern Andhra Pradesh has cancelled bids made for two separate tenders by India's Adani Enterprises to supply imported coal as the prices quoted were too high, two state government officials told Reuters.
It is the first time in recent years that a major government tender for imported coal has been cancelled over high prices. Details on the cancellation have not been previously reported.
India has asked utilities to step up coal imports to address a domestic shortfall. However, expensive imports could add to the financial woes of state government-owned, debt-laden power distributors, which have overdue payments of nearly $15 billion to power generators.
Adani, India's largest coal trader, offered to supply last month 500,000 tonnes of South African coal at 40,000 rupees ($526.50) per tonne and another 750,000 tonnes at 17,480 rupees ($230.08) in January, the officials said.
Benchmark South African coal prices started rising in January to hit a monthly high of $176.50 per tonne in the wake of an export ban by Indonesia, extending the rise to a record $441.65 per tonne in March due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Both tenders were cancelled because the prices quoted were too high, the officials said. Adani was the only bidder for the 500,000 tonnes tender, while Agarwal Coal, which had also bid for the 750,000 tonnes tender, had quoted a higher price than Adani, they said.
Adani and Agarwal Coal did not immediately respond to emails and calls seeking comment on Sunday.
India has cut supplies to the non-power sector as it faced two of its worst power shortages in recent years in October and March, despite record production by state-run near-monopoly Coal India Ltd.
One of the officials, B Sreedhar, managing director at Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corp Ltd, said the current power shortage was not as bad as the one in October, but said the state was living a ""hand-to-mouth existence"". 
""We have not been able to build up stocks. Even though coal is available locally because of more mining, transportation is an issue,"" Sreedhar told Reuters.
Andhra Pradesh, which faced an electricity deficit of 7% during the last three days of March, floated a tender this week ""for urgent procurement"" of 100,000 tonnes of imported coal, the officials said. 
Indian state government-owned utilities could import at least 2.6 million tonnes in the coming months to address summer power demand, equalling total buying in the last 24 months, other state government officials said.
The western Maharashtra state has floated a tender to procure 2 million tonnes of coal, while southern Tamil Nadu state could float tenders to procure 480,000 tonnes, senior officials there said.

Federal government-run NTPC Ltd floated a tender last month to import 1.25 million tonnes of coal.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada on Monday will announce its support for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s multi-billion-dollar investment in two plants, including one that will produce electric commercial vehicles (EVs), a government source said. 
Both the federal government and Ontario's provincial government will invest in the two GM plants in Ingersoll and Oshawa, said the source, who provided no further details and was not authorized to speak on the record.
Scott Bell, GM's Vice President Global Chevrolet, Canada's federal Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Ontario Premier Doug Ford will make an announcement about ""an important investment in the future of Canada's automotive manufacturing sector"" at 11 a.m. EST (3 p.m. GMT) on Monday, according to a statement.
The announcement will take place at a GM vehicle test track in Oshawa, the company said. GM declined to comment further.
GM said early last year it would invest C$1 billion ($799 million) to convert its CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, to produce its BrightDrop EV600 commercial delivery vans.
Toward the end of last year, GM reopened its Oshawa plant - after it had been shuttered for two years - to produce the Chevrolet Silverado pickup.
Canada is trying to safeguard the future of its manufacturing heartland in Ontario as the world seeks to cut emissions by investing in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain.
Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, including GM. 
Last month GM and South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) Chemical said they would build a $400 million facility to produce battery materials in Canada as the carmaker ramps up plans to produce mainly electric vehicles (EVs) in the future.

Reuters reported earlier on Sunday that the U.S. automaker aimed to resume production on Monday, citing two sources, as it expected to see its first batch of workers released from a lockdown the city imposed to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases.
However, Monday production plans have now been cancelled, according to the notice, which did not elaborate on the reasons or say when the company expected activity to resume. 
Production at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Shanghai factory, which produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub, has been halted since March 28 after the government launched a two-stage lockdown that started in areas east of the city's Huangpu River where the plant is located. 
Tesla had originally hoped to only halt operations for four days, but cancelled production plans for Friday and Saturday after the authorities extended tight movement restrictions in the eastern half of the city. Virtually all of Shanghai is currently under lockdown. 
The current stoppage marks one of the longest suspensions since the factory started production in late 2019. Tesla manufactures 6,000 Model 3 and 10,000 Model Y cars per week at its Shanghai factory, one of the sources said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions and China zero-COVID policy,"" its chief executive officer Elon Musk said in a tweet on Saturday.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 07:50AM ET</span>","Telecom Italia, CDP start network talks as KKR bid falters","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber. 
The move comes as TIM boss Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to revamp Italy's biggest phone company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its service business.
The start of talks, announced by the company on Saturday, is yet another sign that TIM plans to chart a different course to a non-binding approach for all of its business made by U.S. fund KKR in November.
TIM kept KKR waiting for four months before agreeing in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock what the group calls its ""untapped value"".
A source familiar with the matter said KKR will say in a letter on Monday that it will not pursue a formal bid unless TIM grants it the due diligence the fund has been requesting for months, which has become more crucial as the market situation changes due to the Ukraine conflict. 
TIM, which asked KKR to say whether the terms of its 10.8 billion euro approach were still valid, has said the review can only be confirmatory in nature, meaning it would have to be preceded by a formal offer.
TIM's board is expected to discuss KKR's letter and a separate proposal from private equity firm CVC for a stake in its enterprise service business on April 7. 
SINGLE GRID
Rome has been keen to merge TIM's fixed assets with those of Open Fiber to avoid costly duplication of investment needed to upgrade the national network, but a deal has proven elusive due to antitrust issues.
TIM said it is aiming to agree with CDP by April 30 a memorandum of understanding to define the objectives, structure and main evaluation criteria for the integration project.

Open Fiber is 60% owned by CDP, which in turn also owns 10% of TIM. Under the tie-up plan, state-owned CDP would get control of the merged network, sources have said, which could ease antitrust issues as TIM would no longer hold a majority. 
Sources have said TIM might later agree a compromise with KKR by involving the fund in its plans for the Open Fiber tie-up. KKR already owns a 37.5% stake in TIM's last-mile network.

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 made a safe emergency landing in Denver at around 11:35 a.m. on Thursday ""after the crew declared an emergency due to a cracked windshield,"" the Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson said in a statement.
A Delta spokesperson said in a statement that there had been a ""maintenance issue mid-flight"" but did not elaborate.
""Out of an abundance of caution, the flight crew diverted into Denver and the plane landed routinely. Our team worked quickly to accommodate customers on a new plane, and we sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience to their travel plans,"" the Delta spokesperson said.
A person who said he was a passenger on the flight posted a photo of the windshield to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which showed the glass shattered into tiny fragments but still held in place.
There were 198 people on the plane, according to KUTV, which said the passengers changed planes in Denver and resumed their journey to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.
Passenger Rachel Wright told the TV station that someone came on the loudspeaker about 90 minutes into the flight to say the windshield had shattered and they would be landing in Denver in 10 minutes.

(Reuters) -The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Friday it was assisting Chinese investigators with the download of the cockpit voice recorder in Washington from an China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet as it sent a team of investigators to China.
The U.S. safety board told Reuters it was helping the Civil Aviation Administration of China ""with the download of the cockpit voice recorder from China Eastern Flight 5735 in our lab in Washington.""
China's decision to send a key piece of evidence to Washington for assistance shows the urgency of the investigation at a time when two nations have been at odds at other issues.
The plane crashed into a mountainside in southern China on March 21 killing all 132 on board and was mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. Recovery crews on Sunday found the second black box - the flight data recorder - in the wreckage.
The cockpit voice recorder will likely provide investigators with details of communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board the Boeing plane.
Earlier Friday, the NTSB said a team of three investigators had left for China to assist in the crash probe. The NTSB said ""investigators will limit interactions with those outside of investigation similar to safety protocols at Beijing Olympics, which will allow them to begin work immediately without a quarantine.""
The team includes the U.S. accredited representative Sathya Silva, who is an NTSB senior aviation accident investigator. 
An NTSB spokesman said the U.S. team was traveling on a commercial flight. It was not clear if the team will travel to the crash site in China and for how the long team will be in China but it could be several weeks.
The NTSB also said a small team from Boeing is also traveling China to assist in the investigation. 
CAAC News, a publication under the Chinese aviation regulator, said on Saturday that the NTSB group of seven investigators and technical advisers had arrived in China.
Under an international agreement, the NTSB has the right to participate since the plane was designed and built in the United States.
On Thursday, Chinese state media said the cause of the crash must be determined as soon as possible, following a meeting of China's highest decision-making body helmed by President Xi Jinping.

Information about the crash must be released in an open, timely and transparent manner, state media said in a report on the meeting of the seven-person Standing Committee of the Communist Party's politburo, China's top leadership.
A nationwide safety inspection should also be launched to prevent as much as possible the occurrence of safety accidents, state media said. If accidents do happen due to negligence, not only will the personnel in charge be punished, the relevant top officials will also be investigated, state media said.

According to a document seen by Reuters and dated March 31, deputy prosecutor Lucas Furtado at the TCU said Pires's work as consultant for multinational oil companies ""strongly indicates the existence of a possible conflict of interest"" if he becomes Petrobras CEO.
Pires, the founder of consulting firm Centro Brasileiro de Infraestrutura (CBIE), was tapped this week to replace Joaquim Silva e Luna as head of Petrobras after President Jair Bolsonaro criticized the company's fuel price policy.
Energy industry analysts hailed the appointment, and Petrobras shares rose the following day. Pires is known as an advocate of privatizing Petrobras and has supported the company's policy of making domestic fuel prices reflect international price movements. 
But Furtado challenged the appointment.
""For over 20 years, he has been providing services to the main oil, gas and energy multinationals,"" the document said.

The appointment must still be approved by a shareholders meeting. The next one is scheduled for April 13.
Pires declined to comment on the TCU investigation.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Saturday reported record electric vehicle deliveries for the first quarter, largely meeting analysts' estimates, but production fell from the previous quarter as supply chain disruptions and a China plant suspension weighed. 
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""
Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, and up 68% from a year earlier. Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308,836 cars, according to Refinitiv data.
Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles from January to March, down from 305,840 the previous quarter.
Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth.
But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease.
The deliveries were ""better than feared given supply chain issues,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a report. 
Tesla said it sold a total of 295,324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles, while it delivered 14,724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.
PRICE HIKE
Skyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars, but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales, analysts said. 
Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-raises-prices-some-china-made-vehicles-2022-03-15 after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-tesla-spacex-facing-significant-inflation-pressure-2022-03-14
""Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said, adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth.
Toyota and GM, Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier. 
Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year, as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year. 

Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide, Germany, in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin, Texas, were to begin in the near future.
The company's stock soared after Tesla this week revealed plans to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split. Tesla shares have risen about 3% so far this year, while GM and Ford shares have declined.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2022 06:55AM ET</span>",China plans to remove hurdle to Sino-U.S. audit cooperation,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China on Saturday proposed revising confidentiality rules involving offshore listings, removing a legal hurdle to Sino-U.S. cooperation on audit oversight while putting the onus on Chinese companies to protect state secretes.
The draft rules, announced by China's securities watchdog, mark Beijing's latest attempt to resolve a long-running audit dispute with Washington that could lead to roughly 270 Chinese companies being forced to delist from U.S. exchanges in 2024.
Saturday's proposal scraps requirements that on-site inspection of overseas-listed Chinese companies be conducted mainly by Chinese regulators.
That could open the door to inspections by U.S. regulators, who demand complete access to such firms' audit working papers, which are stored in China. 
The changes will facilitate ""cross-border regulatory cooperation, including joint inspections, which will help safeguard interest of global investors,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement on its website.
China is stepping up efforts to ensure Chinese firms remain listed in New York. 
The commission said on Thursday that Chinese and U.S. regulators had held multiple rounds of meetings and both sides had a willingness to solve their audit dispute. 
But U.S. securities and audit regulators have pushed back on speculation of an imminent audit deal with China. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) identified 11 U.S.-traded Chinese companies, including Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Yum China, that face delisting risks. 
STATE SECRETS 
The draft rules make clear that Chinese companies are responsible for information security in overseas listings, reducing the chance that confidential information unnecessarily enters auditors' working papers, CSRC said.
""Procedural requirements"" are added to the rules, demanding Chinese companies provide written explanation when they provide ""sensitive information"" to intermediaries, such as underwriters and auditors, although such situations should be ""very rare"", based on experience, according to the watchdog.
CSRC said the rules will offer clear guidance on how to protect state secrets, leading to ""orderly"" securities issuance and listing activities by Chinese companies.
The current confidentiality rules, which were published in 2009 by the CSRC, the state secrets bureau and the archives bureau, are outdated, CSRC added.

Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures.
In mid-March, Vice Premier Liu He said talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators over offshore listing issues had made progress and both sides were working on specific cooperation plans.

Evergrande has resumed work at 734 developments in all of China as of March 27, including 424 projects recovering to normal construction levels, according to a post on Saturday on the official WeChat of the developer's Pearl River Delta business unit. The post did not give a figure for Evergrande's total number of developments.
Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer, with over $300 billion in liabilities. It is struggling to repay bondholders, banks, suppliers, and deliver homes to buyers, epitomising a bloated industry suffering from the Chinese government's deleveraging campaign.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, will act as the company's top leader and head Huawei's board of directors for six months when it is her turn. The announcement did not specify when her term would begin.
The rotating chairmen are Eric Xu and Ken Hu. Meng is also deputy chairwoman and will remain CFO, according to the company's website. 
""The company is optimizing and refining its internal governance structure to make sure the company is built to last,"" a Huawei spokesperson said. ""The supervisory board is responsible for the company's survival, development and long-term prospects.""
Meng, whose English name is Sabrina, played a central role in the company's tussle with the United States, having been detained in Canada in 2018 over alleged attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.

The United States then imposed a series of trade restrictions on the company throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns. This impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 08:51PM ET</span>",'Robust' corporate cash may buoy stocks after rocky quarter,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. stock market ends a rocky first quarter, investors are looking at what could support equities in the coming months - with high cash levels at companies one potential boost as executives deploy resources for share buybacks, dividends or deals.
The S&P 500 posted its first quarterly loss since the beginning of the pandemic, although it rebounded in March, reducing the benchmark index's year-to-date decline to about 5% from as much as 12.5% at the quarter's low point.
The outlook for stocks is still threatened by rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, as well as by spiking inflation and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine. The ability of companies to deploy cash could help soothe investors about some of that unease.
“While cash levels are off the highs from last year, they are still well above the pandemic levels and remain supportive for buybacks, dividends and M&A, which are all shareholder friendly activities,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.
Company plans to deploy their cash could become more clear in the coming weeks as they report first-quarter results, which are expected to show a 6.4% increase in S&P 500 company profits, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Cash levels have risen as companies were cautious spenders during the pandemic, while corporate cash flow margins have been expanding in the past decade, strategists said.
Since peaking at just over $2 trillion in early 2021, cash on S&P 500 company balance sheets has dipped to about $1.9 trillion, according to Truist. But that remains well above $1.5 trillion, where it stood at the end of 2019 before the pandemic. 
“Cash levels, whether it’s cash on balance sheets or even the ability of companies to tap capital markets if necessary, remain very robust,” said Patrick Palfrey, a senior equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
In a recent report titled ""The bull case for stocks,"" Credit Suisse strategists said they ""would expect both buybacks and dividends to increase over the next 12-24 months, a boost to EPS and share prices."" 
S&P 500 company share buybacks came in at $881.7 billion in 2021, a record amount and up nearly 70% from 2020, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The amount of announced buybacks this year has been tracking ahead of last year, according to TrimTabs, with $298.9 billion announced as of March 29, compared to $269.8 billion at that point a year ago.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) projects that corporations will be the largest source of equity demand in 2022. The bank this month raised its 2022 S&P 500 forecast for buybacks to $1 trillion.
""High cash balances and solid EPS growth will support robust corporate demand this year,"" Goldman said in a recent report.
Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, said he doubted buybacks would be ""big enough to either prevent a bear market or further fuel big gains in the stock market.""
""However, it’s a nice steady tailwind to share prices if in fact share buybacks continue to be on pace for a record,"" Arone said. ""It certainly helps, it’s a positive.”
U.S. President Joe Biden's 2023 budget plan, announced on Monday, took aim at buybacks, seeking to discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stocks in order to benefit executives.
U.S. mergers and acquisitions totaled $2.5 trillion last year, the largest full-year period since records began in 1980, according to Refinitiv Deals Intelligence.
So far U.S. M&A has slowed versus last year, with activity down 20% to $516.8 billion from the same period a year ago, according to Deals Intelligence. Investors will be eager to see whether companies pick up the pace.
When it comes to use of cash, “M&A and buybacks are more volatile and they both signal a certain element of corporate executive confidence,"" Arone said. ""Both are coming off record highs, so if that trend continues that should be a good sign for the markets.”
Some market watchers were wary of overstating the impact that large cash positions could have on the market. 
For example, concerns about economic growth were set off anew this week when a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted, which has historically been a reliable signal of a looming recession. Indeed, that signal could make companies more cautious about deploying cash, some have said.

While having more cash on hand could help more companies survive an economic slowdown, it might not significantly stem stock declines, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""More companies might make it through the next downturn but that doesn’t mean you couldn’t have a big pullback in stocks during the next downturn,"" Samana said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Government bond yields resumed their upward climb on Friday as a key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted once more on signs of persistent inflation, while falling oil prices ended the week with their sharpest weekly drop in two years.
U.S. data released on Friday showed employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, continuing a strong run of hiring that has left key aspects of the American labor market ""little different"" from where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic.
With U.S. economic growth so robust and inflation running at three times the Federal Reserve's 2% target, investors are widely expecting a drum roll of interest rate rises this year.
Treasury yields, which retreated earlier in the week as portfolio adjustments boosted demand for bonds, spiked again on Friday, causing a closely watched part of the yield curve to invert for the third time this week.
An inversion of the yield curve, when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated ones, is seen as a harbinger of a recession in the next one or two years.
""Today's solid growth of payrolls checked the box for the Fed in its drive toward fighting inflation,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income. ""Consequently, the Fed looks clearly undeterred in reaching at least policy neutrality and probably will do at least one and maybe two 50-basis-point rate hikes by the June ... meeting, which could even include an inter-meeting hike.""
Bets that aggressive monetary tightening could be in the cards did not drag equity markets lower on Friday.
U.S. stocks finished higher after a choppy session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 added 0.34% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.29%.

Inflation in Europe is also running at record levels, with euro zone inflation hitting 7.5% in March, data showed on Friday, another all-time high with months left before it is set to peak, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to act to contain prices even as growth slows sharply.
In response, the German 10-year government bond yield, a benchmark for the euro zone, rose 2.8 bps to 0.58%, after jumping 39 bps in March, its biggest monthly rise since 2009. [GVD/EUR]

Two-year Treasury yields jumped to 2.4503% from 2.284%, surpassing benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which also rose to 2.3767% from 2.325%. [US/]
""Given its impressive track record in predicting U.S. recessions - it's been almost 50 years since the last false positive - it would seem foolish to doubt that bearish recession speculation,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 08:22PM ET</span>",New York warehouse workers vote to form first U.S. union at Amazon,"By Doyinsola Oladipo and Nivedita Balu
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Workers at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in New York City voted to form the first union at the second-largest U.S. private employer, a victory that adds to recent grassroots successes by labor activists pushing into new industries.
Employees at the online retailer's fulfillment center in the borough of Staten Island, known as JFK8, secured a majority by voting 2,654 to 2,131 in support of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), or about 55% in favor, according to a count released on Friday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
The vote represented a victory for U.S. organized labor and a milestone for labor advocates, who for years have considered Amazon's labor practices a threat to workers. Union organizer Christian Smalls, dressed all in Amazon Labor Union red, raised a hand in victory after the win, while ALU members popped champagne in celebration. 
""We're disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
The company added that it is evaluating options including filing objections based on what it called inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB. A spokesperson for the NLRB noted that it is an independent federal agency and said its actions have been consistent with its congressional mandate.
Shares of Amazon closed at $3,271.20, up less than 1% on the day.
Assuming the vote clears any objections and the union is certified by the NLRB as representing employees, union negotiators would still have to bargain with Amazon in order to deliver on expectations of better compensation and working conditions.
Geebah Sando, a package sorter who voted for the union after working more than two years at JFK8, said he was thrilled. 
""With the union together, we are united,"" Sando said, adding that the labor group could help workers advocate for better pay, break and vacation time.
Many doubted Smalls when he announced plans to unionize JFK8 last year, but he set up a tent outside the warehouse while supporters in the building touted how a union could demand higher wages, safer conditions and job security.
Amazon was founded in 1994 as a small virtual bookstore by now-billionaire Jeff Bezos. The company in mid-2021 said it had just under a million U.S. employees, and it now has a market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the No. 1 U.S. private employer, has nearly 1.6 million U.S. employees, and is not unionized.
Dan Cornfield, a labor expert and professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University, called the vote a ""momentous victory for working people who are doing homegrown union organizing."" Cornfield said he expects the win to accelerate the already rapidly growing labor activism across the U.S. retail sector.
""It's almost like a David and Goliath type of victory,"" Cornfield said. ""There's already a wave (of activism) occurring, and this will encourage more of that.""
'A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE'
U.S. President Joe Biden was glad to see Amazon workers' voices were heard, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Biden believes that ""every worker in every state should have a free and fair choice to join a union"" and that Amazon workers on Staten Island ""made their choice to organize a grassroots union, bargain for better jobs and a better life.""
Other recent labor drives are picking up momentum. Nine U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores have voted to organize, with more than 150 more seeking elections. 
At an Amazon facility in Alabama, by contrast, a majority of workers rejected unionization, though the outcome was not final.
The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result, the NLRB said. The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionizing.

Amazon workers responded to more in-person outreach by labor activists as the pandemic subsided. A second company warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote on whether to unionize starting on April 25.
The number of employees eligible to participate in the Staten Island vote was 8,325, the NLRB said.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 08:06PM ET</span>","Factbox-Recent U.S. union wins at Amazon, Starbucks and more","By Hilary Russ
(Reuters) -The COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortage, Black Lives Matter movement and other social and economic forces have contributed to an uptick in high-profile union organizing across the United States including a victory on Friday at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in New York City.
Among U.S. wage and salary workers last year, 10.3% were in a union - half of the 1983 percentage - and union membership in the private sector including Amazon and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) was just 6.1% last year. There were 149 union elections in January and February of this year, compared to 103 in the same two months last year. 
Here is a look at some notable recent union victories.
AMAZON
Workers at an Amazon.com facility in New York City's Staten Island on Friday voted in favor of forming a union, making it the online retailer's first U.S. facility to organize.
The victory by a new, independent union at the No. 2 U.S. private employer adds to recent successes by labor activists pushing into new industries. Not all labor drives are successful, including the preliminary result of a ballot count at Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama. 
STARBUCKS
Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks locations have voted in recent months to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. The cafes include five in Buffalo, New York; two in Mesa, Arizona; one each in Seattle and Knoxville, Tennessee; and a Starbucks Reserve Roastery in New York City.
At least 170 others had petitioned for elections as of Friday. Ballot counts are scheduled for more than a dozen other cafes in the next couple weeks.
Starbucks beat back the union in one Buffalo store.
NEW YORK TIMES
About 600 designers, software engineers, data analysts and other tech employees at the New York Times voted in March to join the NewsGuild of New York, which has won a number of other elections in the past two years.
The March results created the largest union of tech workers in the United States with bargaining rights. The NewsGuild also represents Reuters' U.S. journalists.
GOOGLE FIBER
Contractors for the high-speed internet provider Google Fiber, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, in Kansas City, Missouri voted last week to unionize. While only 10 workers are involved, it was the first group of Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) with bargaining rights.
AWU said it has 800 members since launching just over a year ago, but those members do not have the right to collectively bargain.
CANNABIS INDUSTRY
In June, the United Food and Commercial Workers reached agreements with cannabis lab Sonoma Lab Works and cannabis manufacturer CannaCraft Manufacturing to unionize their workers in California.
As the number of cannabis growers and dispensaries have grown, so too have union drives in the industry. UFCW said it is now the largest cannabis workers union in the United States with more than 10,000 members.

SILICON VALLEY
In 2020, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter's employees voted to join a union, the first big tech company to do so. Workers at location data startup Mapbox in August lost their bid to form a union.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 08:06PM ET</span>",Analysis-Big victory at Amazon gives unions promise - but no end to challenges,"By Jeffrey Dastin, Danielle Kaye and Julia Love
(Reuters) - A vote by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers to organize their warehouse in New York surprised and inspired long-time labor backers, for whom a new reality is settling in: It can be done, though it won't be easy.
News on Friday of the first-ever U.S. union coming to the nation's second-largest private employer ricocheted among labor groups as they began to see a path ahead to enlist workers and end decades of contraction in their ranks.
Amazon now seems a more manageable target for them, though still a challenging one. Some 55% of votes cast at the Staten Island facility were for the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a new group headed by the online retailer's former employee Christian Smalls. 
The company said it may file objections, and if and when the ALU's victory is finalized, it still must win a contract.
That can be as hard as winning an election, said Gregory DeFreitas, a professor of labor economics at Hofstra University.
Amazon spent more than $4 million on labor consultants in 2021 to try to sway workers, according to a government filing. 
""Amazon just has sort of tremendous resources with which to fight unions and tremendous determination to do whatever is necessary in order to remain union-free,"" said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who studies anti-union actions.
Duplicating the success at Amazon could be difficult. Local knowledge and warehouse experience helped the ALU's leadership, who at times distanced their work from that of national labor groups.
""The leaders workers know and trust - that's what wins,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, who advised some unions on organizing Amazon. Flickinger said he expects union efforts to focus on more warehouses and Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores, adding that unions would need to replenish depleted bank accounts to organize.
The New York win builds on several recent ones at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops. It also helps create a view that the labor movement is changing. The ALU brought innovative organizing tactics to bear, building momentum through social media, said Joshua Freeman, a history professor at the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. 
The ALU raised money through a GoFundMe account. 
At the same time, traditional unions are reaching out to help ALU leader Smalls. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is offering ""whatever support we can,"" said its president, Mary Kay Henry.
'SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE'
The invigorated purpose was palpable among union leaders on Friday.
The Teamsters, a dogged opponent of Amazon for years that had yet to unionize one of its U.S. sites, is continuing to bring their fight ""on the shop floor, at the bargaining table and on the streets,"" General President Sean O'Brien said after the ALU's victory.
People shouted and jumped for joy at the national offices of the SEIU.
""This will spread like wildfire,"" Henry said in an interview. ""It's a huge source of inspiration to workers that are battling the five major corporations in the airline industry, the workers that are battling Starbucks.""
Though not yet final, a losing union vote at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama caused some to fret that the ALU's victory could happen only in a labor-friendly state like New York. Not so, said Logan, the labor professor.

The next battle will be in Staten Island this month at a second Amazon site, but some of the company's grocery workers are organizing in Seattle, as are employees or contractors elsewhere.
""All of a sudden, it doesn't seem so futile to try and form a union at Amazon anymore,"" said Logan, adding, ""If you can win at Amazon, you can win anywhere.""

The additions https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2022-07284.pdf to the Commerce Department's entity list follow several similar actions taken by the United States to weaken the Russian military since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Friday's action aims to ""degrade Russian and Belarusian defense, aerospace, maritime, and other strategic sectors in response to Russia's brutal assault on the sovereignty of Ukraine,"" the Commerce Department said.
The White House has argued the controls would help prevent technology and software reaching military sectors in Russia and Belarus. 
""These parties are being effectively cut off from the inputs necessary to sustain Putin's war,"" said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in a statement. 
The controls rely on a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a license from the United States before shipping to Russia.

The measures also instruct the Commerce Department to deny almost all of those license requests.
In total, the Commerce Department has added 260 entities to the entity list in response to the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation.""

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 06:51PM ET</span>",U.S. auto sales slide in Q1; Toyota outsells GM,"By Aishwarya Nair
(Reuters) - U.S. automakers on Friday reported a slump in first-quarter domestic sales, as the entire industry was slammed by chip shortages and disruptions to supply chains. 
 Toyota , which in 2021 upstaged GM as the top-selling automaker in the United States, outsold the company in the first quarter on increased demand for its Lexus hybrid and electric vehicles. 
South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors and Japan's Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp all posted a drop in overall U.S. quarterly auto sales. Hyundai said electrified vehicle retail sales surged 241% in the January-March period from a year earlier. 
""If gas prices remain high, that's going to continue to push consumers toward green technology,"" said Randy Parker, Hyundai's senior vice president for U.S. sales. 
""Skyrocketing gas prices were top of mind for consumers in March, but the lack of inventory is what ultimately depressed new vehicle sales in the first quarter,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. 
She said inventory issues will persist well into the rest of the year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine would add to supply chain challenges. 
Jack Hollis, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) North America, said he does not expect a major, long-term shift in the U.S. vehicle market – where about three-quarters of new vehicles sold are trucks and SUVs. 
Sales of some large SUVs and trucks held up. GM reported sales of its largest and most expensive SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade, rose during the quarter from a year ago.
Detroit-based GM said quarterly sales fell 20.1% to 512,846 vehicles and its shares fell 1.8%. 
GM said improved semiconductor supplies helped production in the quarter, but it expects inventory to remain relatively low throughout the year due to high demand. Automakers are encouraged by the strong U.S. job market. 

The company's chief economist said in a statement that ""ordinarily, a U.S. economy this strong would translate into light-vehicle sales in the 17-million range.” 
U.S. new-vehicle sales in March finished at 1.25 million, with an annual sales rate of 13.33 million, according to Wards Intelligence.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank employees began an indefinite strike for a wage increase on Friday, threatening the stability of the wildly popular Pix instant payment system and the publication of data releases.
With Brazilian inflation reaching double digits, public sector strikes have become more common in recent months, disrupting the government's day-to-day operations and causing headaches for President Jair Bolsonaro as he seeks re-election in October.
The strike is taking place while central bank head Roberto Campos Neto is in Miami on a pre-scheduled vacation. 
Brazil's central bank employees voted on Monday for an indefinite strike starting on April 1, citing unanswered wage increase demands.
In a statement, Fabio Faiad, president of the workers' union SINAL, said he expected 60%-70% of workers to adhere to the strike.
The central bank said on Friday that its Focus Survey of economists will not be published on the expected date next week, nor will data on foreign exchange flows and Brazilian savings accounts. It did not say when publication will resume. 
In his statement on Friday, Faiad also bemoaned the timing of Campos Neto's vacation.
""Sadly, during such an important moment, the president of the central bank went on vacation to Miami, which does not help at all for us to find a solution to this crisis,"" Faiad said.
Campos Neto, who has been on vacation since Thursday, met virtually with workers' representatives on Tuesday, but Faiad said the meeting was ""a fiasco,"" with no proposals.
The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The central bank's Pix payment system has been a huge success in Brazil, and has won international plaudits. The system is ​​free of charge for individuals and allows instant payments and transfers. 
Just 15 months after its launch, it has been used by 114 million individuals in Brazil - 67% of the adult population - moving 6.7 trillion reais ($1.36 trillion) and recently surpassing the level of credit and debit cards.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday to start a new quarter after the release of the much anticipated monthly official jobs report.
At 4:55 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all closing down more than 1.5%. 
The three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020, with the Dow and S&P 500 declining 4.6% and 4.9% and the Nasdaq dropping more than 9%, as a hawkish Federal Reserve and soaring consumer prices raised fears of a sharp economic slowdown.
The nonfarm payrolls release for March said employers added 431,000 jobs, less than expected, amid further signs of an improvement in the labor market, providing the Federal Reserve with more leeway to be more aggressive with its tightening cycle.
Analysts expected an increase of 490,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.7%, suggesting the central bank can continue attempting to combat inflation without the fear of hurting the economy too severely. 
In the corporate sector, the auto giants Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be in the spotlight after both companies decided to halt production at their Michigan factories.
Ford will suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage, while GM is halting production at its Lansing Grand River Assembly, where it makes the Cadillac CT4, the Cadillac CT5, and the Chevrolet Camaro.
Meme favorite stock GameStop (NYSE:GME) will also be in focus after the video game retailer announced plans late Thursday to implement a stock split.  
Oil prices stabilized after the previous session’s sharp losses on the news that the U.S. plans to release one million barrels a day for six months from its emergency reserves, starting in May. This would be the largest release ever from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
International Energy Agency member countries are set to meet later Friday to discuss joining in, following on from the 60 million barrels they delivered at the start of March.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 kicked off the second quarter with a win Friday, shrugging off a fresh warning from the bond market of a looming recession as softer job gains in March aren't expected to knock the Federal Reserve off its path to aggressively tightening monetary policy. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.34%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.40%, or 139 points, the Nasdaq added 0.29%, and the US Small Cap 2000 jumped 1%.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 431,000 in February, below consensus expectations for 490,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.6%.
The job gains for February were revised higher to 750,000 from 678,000, erasing concerns about the weakness seen in the prior month, and pointing to a labor market that is “showing strong momentum heading into Q2,” Jefferies said in a note.
Wage growth, which is expected to pick-up pace amid a tight labor market, was in-line with forecasts at 0.4%.
“With a solid jobs report and the Fed’s preferred inflation metric pushing to 6.4% as of March, there is little reason why the market should not expect a 50bps hike at the next May FOMC meeting,” Stifel said in a note.
As the bets of aggressive Fed action continue to be priced into markets, fears are growing that the Fed may slow growth by too much and tip the economy into recession.
The yield curve inverted again to deliver yet another warning sign that a recession could be on the horizon.  The yield on the 2-year Treasury bond (2.428%) jumped above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (2.360%).
Bank stocks struggled to cut losses as an inverting yield curve depresses their margins on lending, and limits growth.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) were the biggest decliners in the sector.   
Tech was once again in the crosshairs as semiconductor stocks struggle to catch a break on Wall Street. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell more than 3% after JPMorgan ditched the chipmaker from its Analyst Focus list.
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) erased gains to trade 1% lower after the video game retailer said it would seek shareholder backing at its next shareholder meeting to split its stock.
Stocks suffered their worst quarter in two years in first quarter, as a downbeat January and February offset gains in March. But the recent melt-up in stocks will likely continue. “[T]his current equity weakness is a brief pause before extending the rally that began around March 16th,” Janney Montgomery Scott said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose modestly to kick off the second quarter on Friday, as the monthly jobs report indicated a strong labor market and is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to maintain its hawkish policy stance.
The Labor Department's employment report showed a rapid hiring pace by employers while wages continued to climb, although not enough to keep pace with inflation.
U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March, which was shy of the 490,000 estimate but still showed strong job gains. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, a new two-year low while average hourly earnings rose 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. 
Nonfarm payrolls https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanbdwmpa/nfpr.png
The report heightened expectations that the central bank is likely to become more aggressive in raising interest rates as it seeks to curb inflation as it unwinds its easy monetary policy.
""Job gains were broad, more people are going back to the office,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
""If other data between now and the next Fed meeting stay this rosy, the Fed will likely feel comfortable hiking by 50 basis points and announcing an aggressive rundown of its balance sheet.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139.92 points, or 0.4%, to 34,818.27, the S&P 500 gained 15.45 points, or 0.34%, to 4,545.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.98 points, or 0.29%, to 14,261.50.
The defensive real estate, utilities and consumer staples were the best performing sectors on the day, with each rising more than 1%. 
For the week, the Dow slipped 0.1%, the S&P edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.7%. 
Expectations for a 50-basis point interest rate hike at the central bank's May meeting stand at 73.3%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html. At its March meeting, the Fed raised rates by 25 basis 25 basis points, its first hike since 2018, and a host of central bank policymakers have indicated they are prepared for bigger rate hikes.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said on Friday he does not see a big risk in using ""some"" half-point rate hikes to bring borrowing costs to neutral sooner as long as the objective was not to raise rates much faster and push them higher.
Other data on Friday showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in March, although it remained firmly in expansion territory, as tight supply chains continued to put upward pressure on input prices.
In the wake of the payrolls report, U.S. Treasury yields jumped and a closely watched part of the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes, seen by many as a reliable indicator of a recession, inverted for the third time this week. 
The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter on Thursday with its biggest quarterly decline since the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. was reaching full swing on concerns about rising prices, fueled further by the war in Ukraine, and the Fed's response could slow economic growth. However, stocks rebounded somewhat in March, as the benchmark index gained 3.6%. 
April tends to be a strong month for stocks, with its last monthly decline in 2012. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), notes that April has the best performance on average of all months since 1950.
Video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), part of the ""meme stock"" trading frenzy last year, gave up early gains and ended down 0.95% after announcing a plan to seek shareholder approval for a stock split.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dipped 0.17% after J.P. Morgan removed the stock from its analyst ""focus list"" along with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which slumped 3.81%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.45 billion shares, compared with the 13.78 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) gained 3.8% Friday after Piper Sandler provided positive comments regarding the company's total addressable market. 
Analyst Thomas Champion is said to have uncovered country-level monthly active user data that gives him a greater conviction in their above-consensus daily active user forecasts.
Champion explained that MAU data from SNAP Ads Manager delivers a more granular estimate of users in each country, and it showed that India and the U.S. seem to be the most important markets. However, there are also growth opportunities in Mexico, Japan, Italy, Brazil, and Spain.
""Japan (2% penetration), Italy (12%), Brazil (9%), and Mexico (31%) look compelling. We estimate ~500MM+ addressable MAUs ex-India across the top 15 countries by GDP,"" the analyst said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut losses on Friday, even as a softer March jobs report failed to curb expectations for more aggressive Federal Reserve at upcoming meetings that many fear could spark a recession.
The S&P 500 rose 0.37%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.48%, or 165 points, the Nasdaq added 0.28%.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 431,000 in February, below consensus expectations for 490,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.6%.
The job gains for February were revised higher to 750,000 from 678,000, erasing concerns about the weakness seen in the prior month, and pointing to a labor market that is “showing strong momentum heading into Q2,” Jefferies said in a note.
The unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.7%, while wage growth, which is expected to pick-up pace amid a tight labor market, was in-line with forecasts at 0.4%.
“With a solid jobs report and the Fed’s preferred inflation metric pushing to 6.4% as of March, there is little reason why the market should not expect a 50bps hike at the next May FOMC meeting,” Stifel said in a note.
As the bets of aggressive Fed action continues to be priced into markets, fears are growing that the Fed may slow growth by too much and tip the economy into recession.
The yield curve inverted again to deliver yet another warning sign that a recession could be on the horizon.  The yield on the 2-year Treasury bond (2.428%) jumped above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (2.360%).
Bank stocks struggled to cut losses as an inverting yield curve depresses their margins on lending, and limits growth.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) were the biggest decliners in the sector.   
Tech was once again in the crosshairs as semiconductor stocks struggle to catch a break on Wall Street. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell more than 3% after JPMorgan ditched the chipmaker from its Analyst Focus list.
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) erased gains to trade 1% lower after the video game retailer said it would seek shareholder backing at its next shareholder meeting to split its stock.
The sluggish start to the month for stocks followed a two-week rally that moved the broader market  into “moderately overbought territory on a short-term basis,” Janney Montgomery Scott said.  But the climb higher is likely to resume.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company. 
The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.
The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer's radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France's OVHcloud and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft's cloud practices.
""The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,"" the questionnaire said.
Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft's licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.
They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft's operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.
Companies also were asked about the differences in license fees and commercial terms between the licensing deals with cloud service providers and another programme in which they package and indirectly resell Microsoft's cloud services together with their own.
Another focus was potential technical limitations on cloud storage services available on companies' cloud infrastructure.
""We're continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers,"" Microsoft said in an emailed statement.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager earlier this week said she has no concerns yet about cloud computing and cited the competition from Europe's Gaia-X initiative.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 03:26PM ET</span>",Europe signals unity against Russian gas payment demands,"By Marwa Rashad
LONDON (Reuters) -Europe vowed to stay united against Russia's demand that they pay for its gas in roubles, as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased on Friday.
European capitals have been bracing for a disruption to gas imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Some buyers and governments were working on ways to potentially pay for gas in roubles as Moscow in recent days has raised the spectre of cutting gas supply if its payment terms are not met.
With weeks left before bills are due, governments in Europe, which relies on Russia for more than a third of its gas, are talking to energy companies about Russia's demand. 
However, the European Commission said on Friday that those with contracts requiring payment in euros or dollars should stick to that.
""Agreed contracts must be respected. 97% of the relevant contracts explicitly stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Companies with such contracts should not accede to Russian demands,"" a European Commission spokesperson said.
""The EU will respond in a united manner to this latest attempt by Russia to circumvent our sanctions,"" the spokesperson said.
The Kremlin said on Friday it would not immediately turn off the taps to Europe as payments on deliveries due after April 1 come in the second half of this month and May. 
That message, and signs Europe would take a pragmatic approach, were a relief for markets. Gas prices, which had risen on fears of disruption, fell.
""If things remained like this, all in all not a lot would change,"" Italy's Ecology Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani told state broadcaster RAI.
On Thursday, Moscow decreed that foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open rouble accounts in state-run Gazprombank from Friday or else risk being cut off.
Analysts said the rouble payment plan, which cements Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s position at the heart of Russian gas trading, was more about shielding the oil and gas company from future sanctions than depriving Europe of fuel.
Gazprombank has been spared from the harsh sanctions imposed on other Russian banks so European gas buyers could open an account with it and let the lender buy roubles on their behalf. It would have to remain unsanctioned for trade to continue.
Although energy exports are Putin's most powerful lever against sweeping Western sanctions, his room for manoeuvre is also limited because Moscow does not have alternative markets for its gas, which is piped to Europe.
""If Putin turns off the gas, it might only be for a relatively short period of time. He needs our money and cannot reroute all the natural gas,"" one European gas trader said.
Germany meanwhile said it was examining Putin's decree. An economy ministry spokesperson said private contracts were valid and that the country, which depends on Russia for 40% of its gas needs, was paying in euros.
Berlin has already activated an emergency plan that could lead to gas rationing if supplies drop too low.
Gazprom said on Friday it was exiting its business in Germany, although it was not immediately clear how this would affect the supply of Russian gas into Europe's largest economy.
PRICE PRESSURE
Putin's decision to enforce rouble payments has boosted the Russian currency, which fell to historic lows at the start of the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". The rouble has since recovered much lost ground.
European buyers are still prepared to buy gas under existing contracts while they seek clarity on Putin's demand, while Gazprom said on Friday it had started to notify clients of a requested switch of end-payment currency to roubles.
Austria's OMV and Gazprom have had initial contact regarding paying for gas in roubles as demanded by Moscow, a spokesperson for OMV said on Friday, adding that the company is now waiting for written information.
Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), which has a take-or-pay contract with Gazprom running until 2030, said it had received a demand from Gazprom Export to pay for gas supplies in roubles.
""We have no intention of paying in roubles. We are in close dialogue with other energy companies and the authorities regarding a common European response to Gazprom Export,"" it said in a statement.
Poland's dominant gas company PGNiG said it had been formally notified by Gazprom about changes to payment terms for gas supplies.
German utilities Uniper, RWE and VNG all declined to comment. Italian energy group Edison, which has a contract with Gazprom for 1 bcm of gas per year which expires at the end of this year, also did not comment.
Italy's Eni said it had received a communication from Gazprom over switching its gas payment currency to roubles, and was analysing the matter.
European gas prices have climbed as a result of uncertainty over Putin's plan, with rises of 7%-10% since his order, coming close to previous peaks.

Relief that the taps would not be turned off any time soon prompted prices to turn negative. 
At 1715 GMT, the benchmark front-month contract for May delivery in the Dutch gas market was down 9.37 euros at 111. 45 euros per megawatt hour (MWh).

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mattel Inc top-selling toys like Mega Bloks will now be made in Mexico, as the U.S. toymaker becomes the latest company to move its supply chain closer to home.
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) announced in mid-March it had spent around a billion pesos, or $50 million, to expand a plant in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, which is now the company's largest plant, overtaking other hubs in China, Vietnam and Malaysia. 
The plant in Monterrey, close to the U.S. border, sprawls across 200,000 square meters (2.25 million square feet), employing close to 3,500 workers.
""Being able to have product close to your consumer and not having to transport it from Asia, that's going to be more profitable and more competitive when you take costs into account,"" Mattel's Latin America managing director, Gabriel Galvan, told Reuters. 
The expansion was first pitched in 2020, Galvan said. Mattel closed two factories in Asia in 2019 and more recently shuttered a plant in Canada and another in Mexico ahead of expansion of the mega-factory.
""This consolidation and plant expansion was in line with the company's transformation/turnaround strategy and a manufacturing footprint consolidation we called 'Capital Light,'"" spokeswoman Catherine Frymark told Reuters in an email, saying that the strategy was four years in the making.
Galvan said Mattel's move was just the latest instance of how worries about over-extended supply global chains are generating fresh interest in ""nearshoring"" from industries like textiles and even automaking - already a mainstay of Mexican manufacturing. 
Mexico's finance minister told local media recently that the demand for industry parks in northern Mexico was booming.

Mattel plans to double its investment in the plant over the next five years, Nuevo Leon state said in a press release. 
""It's a big opportunity (for Mattel),"" Galvan said, due to the plant's proximity to the company's Dallas-Fort Worth distribution center, its second-largest in the United States. ""We can be there in 24 hours, so for us it's really convenient.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine, hoping to tap fresh sources of money to fund its defence efforts, is looking at ways to extend a domestic bond issuance programme to international capital markets, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.
Kyiv launched a programme selling hryvnia-denominated bonds to raise money for its fight against Russia - dubbed ""war bonds"" - in late February. The government said it aimed to raise around $1.36 billion through its domestic programme.
The source said Ukraine's government now hoped to launch an international fixed income instrument - which would be most likely be denominated in U.S. dollars - in the months to come.
""Ukraine has been encouraged by the support that it has been receiving not only from official creditors but from the broader Ukrainian diaspora and international regulatory authorities,"" the person told Reuters.
""The idea is to extend its current programme of domestic bonds to an international audience,"" the source said, adding the government was hoping to raise as much as possibly, maybe ""hundreds of millions of dollars.""
It was not clear whether the bonds would be aimed at a retail audience -- including the country's large diaspora -- or institutional investors, or both.
Ukraine's finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Diaspora bonds have been successfully tapped by several developing countries, with Israel for instance having used them to raise tens of billions of dollars since 1951.

Diaspora funds bailed India out from a 1991 balance of payments crisis, raising $4.2 billion in 1998 to offset international sanctions imposed after nuclear tests.
Ukraine has seen contributions flow in since the Russian invasion started -- in cash as well as cryptocurrencies -- much of it from its large diaspora.

(Reuters) - Marine fuel sellers have stopped serving vessels flying the Russian flag at major European hubs including Spain and Malta in another blow to Moscow's exports, five industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Losing access to refuelling points in the Mediterranean Sea poses major logistical problems for Russian oil tankers going from Baltic ports to Asia and also creates safety concerns over potentially being stuck at sea with flammable cargoes, shipping sources say.
Russia is reeling from a wave of severe economic sanctions on its banks and oligarchs and foreign companies are cutting ties after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a special military operation. 
Multiple factors have prompted the halt in refuelling services, including what sources have described as ""self sanctioning"" where companies try to stay ahead of the next wave of measures by refusing to enter into contracts with Russian entities.
Payment problems due to banking restrictions have also added to complications with deals for marine fuel, which is typically priced and paid for in U.S. dollars.
One source said Russian-flagged ships couldn't secure marine fuel in Malta, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar or neighbouring Algeciras in Spain – all major bunkering, or refuelling, zones in the Mediterranean. 
""Several tankers had to take a longer journey in order to bunker in other countries after European ports refused to provide fuel,"" said another source who was familiar with one of the tanker's movements.
A government official in Malta said the country was not allowing any Russian-flagged ships to come to its ports. 
A transport ministry spokesperson with Spain's Merchant Marine said it was ""possible that certain providers are adopting these measures independently"".
A Gibraltar government spokesperson said port authorities would ""reject calling requests by all ships either owned or operated by anyone connected to the country, not even for bunkering, in accordance to UK rules"".
The spokesperson said that as in Britain, foreign ships with Russian cargoes would be not be affected.
'NOT DOING BUSINESS'
Russia's maritime sector is already grappling with the winding down of other services including ship certification by leading foreign providers - vital for accessing ports and securing insurance - shipping companies pulling out and ship engine makers suspending training on their equipment.
Shipping industry sources say given the complexities of the world's seaborne trade it was unclear how Russian companies would be able to operate with multiple services being withdrawn. 
Danish marine fuels supplier and ship owner Monjasa said it had suspended ""trading and supplies with Russian-flagged vessels, Russian registered companies and companies and individuals with ties or affiliation to Russian ownership"" with effect from Feb. 25, a day after Russia's invasion started.
Denmark's Bunker Holding said it had stopped all deliveries into Russian harbours since the start of March, adding that the group and subsidiaries including Dan-Bunkering had also ""ceased to enter into new obligations with Russian counterparties"".
""We are aware of the challenges this decision to stop trade with Russian counterparties imposes on clients and counterparties in the rest of the world, but with the terrible situation in Ukraine we need to act swiftly and decisively against Russia,"" Bunker Holding said in a statement.
Gibraltar bunker supplier Peninsula, which is active elsewhere in the Mediterranean and other locations, said in a LinkedIn post it was ""not doing business with Russian vessels, ports, companies – owned or majority owned - suppliers and financial institutions"". 

Earlier this month, Britain announced sanctions on Russia's biggest shipping company Sovcomflot.
While a ban on Russian vessels from EU ports is still under discussion, Russia's oil and products exporters have already faced problems concluding charters for ships and insurance, shipping sources say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration on Friday sharply boosted fuel economy standards for vehicles, reversing former President Donald Trump's rollback of U.S. regulations aimed at improving gas mileage and cutting tailpipe pollution.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it will boost fuel efficiency requirements by 8% for both the 2024 and 2025 model years and 10% in 2026. That was a slightly bigger increase than the proposal outlined in August.
The NHTSA rules are about the same as rules previously announced by the Environmental Protection Agency for a fleetwide real-world average of about 40 miles per gallon in 2026 compared with 32 mpg under the Trump rules. Some environmentalists along with electric vehicle makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian argued NHTSA should have adopted more aggressive requirements of 10% yearly requirements over the three-year period.
The new rules are expected to reduce consumer fuel costs by $192 billion for new vehicles sold by 2030. The administration is eager to make the case that regulations will prod automakers to build more efficient vehicles and save consumers money at a time of near record pump prices.
Automakers say they will need to spend tens of billions to comply with the rules. NHTSA estimates consumers could save $1,387 in fuel costs over the life of a vehicles but the rule will increase the average cost of a vehicle by almost that much.
The rule's total costs for automakers are pegged by NHTSA https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-04/Final-Rule-Preamble_CAFE-MY-2024-2026.pdf at more than $200 billion through 2029, will increase the average cost of a vehicle industry wide by $1,087, NHTSA said. The total cost for Detroit's Big Three automakers is estimated at more than $100 billion for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis.
The Trump administration in March 2020 rolled back fuel economy standards to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That was much less than the 5% annual increases required by his predecessor Barack Obama.
The EPA in December finalized its vehicle emissions requirements that are parallel to the NHTSA rules. The EPA said its rules will result in 3.1 billion tons of avoided CO2 emissions through 2050. Major automakers on Wednesday backed EPA's revisions over challenges brought by some states and some ethanol groups.
EPA and NHTSA plan to write and adopt another round of vehicle standards that will cover 2027 and beyond that analysts believe will be so aggressive that automakers must build electric vehicles to meet them.
John Bozzella, president of the trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said ""increased regulatory requirements for automakers will require supportive policies, as well as regulatory alignment with the EPA to ensure that standards can be attained.""
Legislation has stalled in Congress that would boost EV rebates to up to $12,500 per vehicle and provide generous tax incentives for automaker EV production and business purchases of EVs.

Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said NHTSA's ""rules only require automakers to reduce gas guzzling slightly more than they agreed to cut nine years ago.""
NHTSA on Sunday said it reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond. The decision was a victory for Tesla that could cost other automakers like Stellantis hundreds of millions of dollars or more.

LONDON (Reuters) -UPS said on Friday it was trying out a four-wheeled ""eQuad"" electric cargo bike for deliveries in densely packed urban areas, where bikes have better and easier access, to complement its push into electric vehicles. 
The package-delivery giant is trialing around 100 of the electric bikes, designed and built by British firm Fernhay, in seven European markets and will also launch trials in the United States and some Asian markets, Luke Wake, UPS vice president of fleet maintenance and engineering, told Reuters. 
UPS said it would also use four-wheeled electric bikes from other manufacturers for the trials, but did not disclose names.
As well as making public commitments to cut their carbon footprints, package-delivery companies are seeking new ways to cut the cost of last-mile deliveries given soaring e-commerce orders.
UPS' eQuad has an electric-assisted top speed of around 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) - if you pedal hard you can go faster - and can haul up to 200 kilograms (441 lb) of packages. Its electric battery has a range of around 40 miles (64 km), which Wake said would be more than adequate for urban routes.
The vehicle is only 36 inches (91 cm) wide, so can legally use bike lanes and enter pedestrian zones that UPS' vans and trucks cannot access. Under normal circumstances, drivers would have to get out of their vehicles, load packages on carts and haul them to customers.
UPS' Wake said the Atlanta-based company sees an opportunity to scale up the use of the bikes in megacities and complement its range of vans and trucks.
""There are more and more opportunities for zero-emission solutions like this that can alleviate inner-city congestion,"" Wake said while demonstrating the eQuad at a UPS package facility in London. ""It can also help our operations be more efficient at the same time.""

Rivals FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) unit DHL are also experimenting with electric cargo bikes as part of their own zero-emission vehicle plans.
UPS is working with electric van makers like UK startups Arrival and Tevva, plus U.S. truck maker Xos.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 01:11PM ET</span>","Analysis-In Russia-Europe gas standoff, both sides lose","By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe and Russia will both lose heavily if President Vladimir Putin follows through on his threat to cut gas supplies to countries he judges ""unfriendly"" unless they pay in roubles.
Even at the height of the Cold War, Moscow never cut gas to Europe, but on Thursday, Putin signed a decree ordering foreign buyers to pay in roubles instead of euros from April 1 or face going without Russian supplies.
European capitals rejected the ultimatum and on Friday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would not affect settlements until later this month.
Although the threat of shortages comes after the peak demand European winter season, Europe still has much to lose when its businesses and households are already reeling from record energy prices, while Moscow could be cutting off one of its main sources of revenue.
Russia exported around 155 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe last year, providing more than a third of its gas supply. 
Without it, Europe would have to buy more gas on the spot market where prices are already around 500% higher than last year.
Germany and Austria, both heavily reliant on Russian gas, have activated emergency plans, which include rationing if necessary, and other European countries have plans in place.
""Buyers' unwillingness to abide by (Putin's) order risks suspending supplies. Both buyers and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) will face losses as a result,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, analyst at Moscow-based brokerage Locko-Invest.
DASH FOR GAS
European countries will have to compete with Asia to attract additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar or the United States, and even among themselves for alternative pipeline supplies from places such as Norway and Algeria.
U.S. LNG exporters have already emerged as big winners of Europe's supply crisis, while Norway has also benefitted.
Greece said on Friday it could avoid gas supply problems if Russian flows are halted provided sufficient gas is available on the world market.
Last week, the United States said it will work to supply 15 bcm of LNG to the European Union this year but this would not fully replace what Russia sends to Europe via pipelines.
Apart from trying to get more in an already stretched global gas market, several European countries have also said they will have to use more coal, potentially extend the life of nuclear plants and increase renewables output.
""A disruption of Russian natural gas flows towards Europe remains a tail risk. Europe has more options for alternative supplies, and with demand seasonally low for the coming months, has no risk of running out of supplies this year,"" said Norbert Rücker at Swiss private bank Julius Baer.
But that risk would increase towards the winter months when gas demand usually rises.
Gas in European storage might be enough for spring and summer without demand curtailment, but Europe will risk entering next winter with only around 10% of gas in store by the end of October without some energy conservation measures, said Kateryna Filippenko, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
To attract more LNG from elsewhere, European wholesale gas prices would need to remain higher than the Asian benchmark LNG price. Rocketing gas prices are already hurting consumers and industries and governments have spent billions of euros on measures to try and shield them.
""We have to be aware that the companies who have signed long-term contracts with Gazprom do receive gas at significantly lower prices than we have to pay in the LNG market. So there will be impact on our energy prices,"" EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told EU lawmakers last month.
SELF SABOTAGE? 
Russia faces the loss of an important revenue stream for its domestic finances.
In the first nine months of 2021, the latest data available from Russian gas producer Gazprom show its revenue from sales to Europe, Turkey and China was 2.5 trillion roubles ($31 billion) from exporting 176 bcm of gas between January and September.
""For Russia, a decision to restrict supply would be like shooting itself in the foot,"" said analysts at SEB Research.
If the payment mechanism is designed to shore up the rouble, that could also be short-lived. Prior to the invasion, the Russian central bank required 80% of foreign currency from gas to be converted into roubles. Now it would all have to be switched into the Russian currency.
""The move will cut Russia off from a vital source of foreign exchange (FX) at a time when sanctions have already massively restricted the Russian Central Bank's access to its FX reserves,"" said analysts at Fitch Solutions.
European buyers have repeatedly said the move constitutes a breach of contract. Gazprom risks being involved in arbitration suits where it could be forced to pay large fines in the future. 
Another question is what Russia can do with the gas it usually supplies to Europe. The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, said last week that Moscow could redirect supplies to Asian markets among others.
However, there is no pipeline that allows Russia to send the gas supplied to Europe to Asia. A pipeline from Russia to China sends gas from other fields that do not supply Europe and there is no interconnector to re-route those flows.
Asian markets might also be reluctant to buy more.
""You make yourself impossible as a gas supplier to other countries. How likely is it, for example, that China or India would choose to rely on Russian gas if Russia so clearly shows that it does not hesitate to use the gas as a weapon,"" said SEB Research analysts. 
Instead, Russia might be forced to pump the gas into domestic storage sites that can hold around 72 bcm. Gazprom-owned storage sites in Europe could hold another 9 bcm.
Gazprom expects domestic gas demand to increase to 260 bcm by 2026 from 238 bcm in 2020 and has plans to expand storage.

But in the short term, if European gas were re-directed to existing storage, it would be full in three to four months and some gas production could then be shut down, damaging long-term growth, analysts said.

A team of analysts at Citi, led by Ronit Ghose, believes that companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) are attacking a $8-$13 billion total addressable market (TAM).
In a near 200 pages report on Metaverse, Ghose sees this space combining the physical and digital worlds in an immersive manner, with many use cases, including gaming, commerce, art, media, advertising, smart manufacturing, health care, virtual communities, and social collaboration (including for enterprise and education).
The number of potential users ranges from 1 to 5 billion, according to Citi, depending on which type of definition is used (narrow vs broad).
Ghose believes that Metaverse will most likely be based around smartphones with a small portion of all users using virtual reality (VR) devices.
For Metaverse to be adopted widely, the world will need much better internet speeds and higher access to 5G technology. Citi expects only a quarter of the global population to have access to 5G by 2025.
The lags, packet drops, and network unreliability witnessed in today's world makes the current state of the infrastructure unsuitable for building an envisioned Metaverse experience, it is said in the report.
Analysts also see different types of metaverses being developed e.g. US/International vs China, tech vs business, centralized vs decentralized, etc.
Among those sectors and companies that are likely to benefit the most from Metaverse, Ghose mentions consumer hardware manufacturers that will act as portals and potential gatekeepers.
Citi also sees a big role for cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).
""Money in the Metaverse could exist in different forms, i.e., in-game tokens, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and cryptocurrencies. Current payment rails are usually domestic for real time and expensive cross-border payments making them an imperfect fit for a borderless global Metaverse ecosystem. We expect decentralized finance (DeFi) and existing traditional financial systems to coexist.""

BBVA estimated the deal would hit its capital by 7 basis points and have a negative net impact of 200 million euros once the transaction is completed, which is expected at the end of the second quarter. 

The lender said the impact would be more than offset by the cumulative savings expected when this transaction is executed.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock traded 4% higher Friday after Citi analyst George Choi upgraded it to ‘buy’ with a target of $96.50, citing multiple reasons for his optimism.
The new target, $1.50 less than Choi’s previous one, is around 16% higher than the stock’s current level of $83.
According to StreetInsider, the analyst likes Wynn “for its 'increasing dedication to Premium Mass in Macau'."" Choi called the valuations “undemanding” at around 8.6 times EV/EBITDA multiple as per estimates for financial year 2023.
The brokerage also pointed to increasing clarity over regulations and licenses in Macau as reasons behind the bullish outlook, according to CNBC.
Earlier this month, authorities on the island decided to extend the licenses by six months, giving more time to a highly anticipated rebidding process in the world's biggest casino hub.
Authorities will start the rebidding process once the city's legislature has passed a revised law, Reuters quoted Hong Kong’s Economy and Finance Secretary Lei Wai Nong as saying.
Macau’s six operators including Wynn have to reapply to maintain operations in the former Portuguese colony.
Macau lies off Hong Kong and is part of China. Local authorities have earlier called for tighter supervision of casino operators and higher local ownership in gaming companies operating in the region.
China has been clamping down on high-stakes betting in Macau which takes place in convertible Hong Kong dollars. It is alleged the gambling trades enable illicit outflow of currency and money-laundering efforts.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) said on Friday it was quitting its business in Germany at a moment of crisis in the vital energy ties between the two countries in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The gas giant gave no details or explanation of its decision to terminate its participation in Gazprom Germania GMBH and all of its assets, which include subsidiaries in Britain, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.
Gazprom has been in the sights of European Union regulators for months over allegations, which it denied, that it was holding back gas that could have been released to lower soaring prices. Sources said this week that its offices in Germany had been raided by EU antitrust authorities.
""I think this means Gazprom is drawing a curtain on being an active participant in the European gas market. Essentially it is going home because it no longer feels welcome,"" said Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
""I think Gazprom understands it is going to face a hostile political and regulatory environment in Europe and therefore wants to consolidate and conduct all of its business in one place – St Petersburg, most likely with the political support of the Russian government.""
Yafimava said she did not expect any impact on Russian gas deliveries under long-term contracts. A market source in Germany with knowledge of the Russian gas business agreed with that assessment.
He said the main impact would be on gas storage as Astora, a subsidiary of Gazprom Germania, has facilities totalling 6 billion cubic metres of capacity in Germany and Austria.
It was unclear whether the German government would want to step in and mandate someone to run these, in order to achieve desired filling levels, and whether that could trigger legal opposition by Gazprom, the source said. Astora did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The move further complicates energy ties between Russia and Germany, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to impose rouble pricing for gas on buyers from what Moscow considers unfriendly countries.
Berlin rejects the change, as existing contracts are set in euros, and its economy minister said on Thursday it would not be ""blackmailed by Putin"".
Germany depends on Russian gas for about 40% of its needs but has joined Western sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine, including by halting the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany.

German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday that the German economy ministry was considering expropriating the Gazprom and Rosneft units in the country amid concerns about the security of energy supplies.
The Kremlin said on Friday that any such move would be a violation of international law.

(Reuters) -European shares rose on Friday as a rally in commodity-linked and bank stocks helped outweigh worries about economic growth and inflation, with Europe remaining on alert for a disruption to gas imports from Russia.
A Russian threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe unless buyers paid with roubles from Friday was averted for now, with Moscow saying it would not halt supplies until new payments are due later in April.
Worries about the fallout from the war, compounded by likely central bank tightening to control surging inflation, saw the pan-European STOXX 600 index mark its first quarterly loss in two years last quarter. 
The index on Friday rose 0.5% higher. Banks gained 1.2% on the day with Spanish lender Santander (MC:SAN) firming 2.6% after reiterating its 2022 profitability target.
""Markets have been range-bound for the last few weeks, and received a boost today after Putin only followed through on his rouble threats in theory, ending a week of concern for investors that Europe could see lower gas flows,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Miners and oil stocks led gains on the day and leaped 18% and 14% respectively last quarter amid surging commodity prices due to the Ukraine war.
In Ukraine, Ukrainian forces were moving into territory abandoned by withdrawing Russian troops in the north as peace talks resumed on Friday. But in the southeast, which Russia now says is the focus of its operation, the Red Cross said it had been barred from bringing aid to the besieged city of Mariupol.
""Ultimately, we're in a wait-and-see phase as we await developments in negotiations, clarity from central banks and the upcoming earnings season,"" Erlam said.
Adding to nervousness, data showed euro zone inflation surged to 7.5% in March, hitting another record high months before it is set to peak.
""It seems increasingly likely that the ECB will accelerate its plans to tighten - we now think it will begin raising rates as soon as July and the deposit rate will reach around 1.5% by end-2023,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.
Markets are pricing in 60 basis points of rate hikes by the end of 2022.
Technology stocks were among the worst performers last quarter on inflation worries, down 17%, and slipped another 0.3% on Friday. 

In France, volatility could also stem from presidential elections due this month, though analysts do not expect much of an impact as President Emmanuel Macron is widely expected to be re-elected. 
Among individual stocks, French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) fell 9.5% on narrowing its full-year organic revenue growth forecast.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Toronto-based Brazil Potash Corp has laid out for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro this week its plans to reduce his country's dependence on fertilizer imports disrupted by the Ukraine war by opening a potash mine in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The company's owner, investment banker Stan Bharti, met with Bolsonaro on Monday to discuss the $2.5 billion project that has been held up since 2017 due to a suspended environmental permit pending consultations with the indigenous Mura people.
Bolsonaro told Bharti his government was committed to ""unlocking"" fertilizer projects such as the potash mine that are strategic for Brazil, said former Senator Cidinho Santos, who attended the meeting, in an Instagram post on Wednesday.
The decision to allow the mine at Autazes, 75 miles (120 kms) southeast of the state capital Manaus, is not entirely up to Bolsonaro. The project depends on a ruling by Federal Judge Jaiza Fraxe, who is monitoring talks with the Mura people to make sure they have a fair say.
As potash prices tripled last year and war has threatened supplies from Russia and Eastern Europe, pressure to open the potash mine has grown from Brazil's farm sector, which relies on imports for 85% of its fertilizer, needed to raise crop yields.
Brazil, the world's largest producer of soybeans, depends on potash imports from China, Canada and Morocco, but mostly Russia and Belarus for nearly half of the supplies in the country. Those exports have been crimped severely by sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Potassio do Brasil, a subsidiary of Brazil Potash, which is wholly-owned by Bharti's Forbes & Manhattan bank, said it would take three years to get the mine operating, with an output of 2.44 million tonnes per year once permits are obtained.
""As soon as the environmental license is restored, we will apply to Amazon environmental protection agency IPAAM for an installation license and start work,"" Chief Executive Adriano Espeschit said in an emailed statement. ""We hope to be producing in Autazes at the start of 2026."" 
Espeschit said the company recognizes the Mura's right to be consulted under the International Labor Organization (ILO) convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples, and meetings have begun after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Judge Fraxe's office did not reply to a request for comment on the meetings. Claudio Mura, head of a local indigenous council, declined to speak by phone on how talks were going.
Prosecutor Fernando Soave, who first called for the license suspension in 2016 because the Mura had not been consulted, said there was no agreement at a meeting with the tribe on Tuesday to decide which controversial points to include in talks.
""The pre-consultation meetings have not yet started,"" Soave told Reuters.
His office said exploratory drilling for potash deposits by the company began in the region in 2009 without consulting the Mura people, who claim the area as ancestral lands, though their claim has not been recognized by the Brazilian government.

Brazil Potash said the entrance to the planned mine will not be on indigenous land, which the Mura dispute, and that the environmental impact of mining potash deposits 800 meters (2,625 ft) below ground will be negligible.
The prosecutor's office has warned of the project's significant social and cultural impact on the Mura people. Consultations are expected to take time as they involve 44 Mura villages.

Kering confirmed the outlines of the settlement, without giving the cost, saying it would have no impact on the group's results in 2022 or on its recurring tax rate in future years.
""In the spring of 2019, given the rapid changes in its business environment, its strong international growth and some uncertainties of Italian legislation, Bottega Veneta proactively made contact with the Italian Revenue Agency to discuss its tax position"", Kering said in a statement adding this agreement was ""the result of those discussions"". 
Earlier on Friday the Milan prosecutor referred in a press release to a tax investigation led by Milan tax police into a Swiss company, part of an international luxury goods group, which allegedly operated in Italy to produce and distribute an Italian brand, without specifically naming the company. 
Revenue at the Italian leather goods house were booked through Kering's Swiss-based subsidiary Luxury Goods International and Italian prosecutors and tax authorities argued that the tax should therefore have been paid in Italy, not Switzerland, the sources said.
Luxury Goods International paid 186.8 million euros to settle the tax case, covering the fiscal years 2012 to 2019.
Separately, Milan prosecutors' criminal investigation for tax evasion is still ongoing, the sources said. 
Three years ago, Kering reached an agreement with the Italian tax authorities, paying a record 1.25 billion euros to settle a similar dispute centred on its fashion brand Gucci.
Milan prosecutors in the past have probed U.S. tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.

In previous cases, once the agreement between the companies and the Italian tax agency was signed, prosecutors closed the criminal investigation with either a dismissal or a settlement.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-More than a chairperson - founder's daughter takes Zara helm,"By Corina Pons
MADRID (Reuters) - The daughter of  Inditex  (MC:ITX)'s billionaire founder takes the helm of his Zara fashion empire on Friday with a more hands-on role than originally expected by outsiders, though a much lower salary than her veteran predecessor.
Marta Ortega, Amancio Ortega's youngest child, will not only be non-executive chairperson, as announced in November, but will also manage the firm's communication strategy and its internal audit body, the company said in an annual report on remuneration of directors sent to Spain's stock market regulator last month.
The 38-year-old will also remain involved in managing fashion merchandise at Zara, the business that generates 70% of Inditex's revenues, the company said. 
    In return, Marta Ortega will receive an annual salary of one million euros ($1.1 million), the document showed - 100,000 euros for overseeing the board and 900,000 euros for her work as non-executive president.
Along with new CEO Oscar Garcia, Marta Ortega replaces veteran executive president Pablo Isla, who oversaw an eight-fold increase in Inditex's share price that saw its market value surge to almost 93 billion euros at its highest point. 
He leaves with a golden handshake and a promise not to work for a competitor for two years. Inditex paid Isla 12.4 million euros in his last year with the company, more than double what he received in 2020 as the executive president, the company report shows, adding that 9.9 million euros was paid in cash. 
    Inditex said it determined Marta Ortega's salary based on ""her knowledge of the retail business in the fashion sector and of the Inditex Group.""
Though her role is not directly comparable to Isla's, Marta Ortega will still have an extensive overview of the company.
""Even if Ortega will not be in charge of the day-to-day finances, she will be at the forefront of the evaluation units that allow her to make sure things are going well,"" said Santiago Alvarez de Mon, a professor of leadership at the IESE business school in Madrid.
The transition comes as the world's largest fast fashion retailer by sales, having largely weathered the COVID pandemic, faces the challenge of losing revenues from Russia, where it has mothballed operations following the invasion of Ukraine, and surging inflation that will likely force it to raise prices. 
Zara, and other group chains such as Stradivarius and Pull&Bear, must also deal with the rapid rise of Shein, the world's largest online-only fashion company selling cheap clothes to primarily younger customers.
In a letter to staff on her first day, Marta Ortega said she was fully committed to leading the company. ""I ask for your support and patience while I continue to learn from everyone every day,"" she added.
    JITTERS
News of Isla's departure, and his replacement by Marta Ortega and Oscar Garcia, initially sparked market jitters.
But investors were reassured a team of managers, who have been with the company for anything between 18 and 42 years, will support the new leaders. 
The transition is also being closely monitored by Ortega senior, who owns 59.2% of Inditex shares, sources familiar with the process said. 
Guido Stein, a Spanish author and professor on companies leadership at IESE, said it was reasonable Marta Ortega would be paid less than Isla. 
    ""She is just starting out in that position and her family receives much more from the company's profits,"" he said. 
Ortega senior, who retired in 2011 but remains on the board in return for an annual payment of 100,000 euros, was paid an annual salary of 600,000 euros when he headed the company and always worked alongside an executive partner.
The 86-year-old will receive 1.7 billion euros in dividends this year, sources familiar with the process said. 
    Isla told journalists at his last press conference in March that he had ""maximum confidence in the future of the company"" under the new leadership team. 
Royal Bank of Canada and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts told Reuters they did not expect much strategy change as an Ortega returns to the top of the company. 

    ""As a family member who has been closely involved with the business over the last few years, Marta Ortega will be significantly more involved than most non-executive chairpersons would be,"" Deutsche Bank's Adam Courcharne said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange suspended deliveries of some Russian produced metals into its approved warehouses in Britain on Friday, although there is none stored in them at present.
The exchange, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said in a statement that there was significant risk that someone receiving such metal from British warehouses would be hit with very high additional costs.
The British government placed 35% additional duties on imports of Russian copper, lead, primary aluminium and aluminium alloy on March 15. https:// Some LME members have called for bans on Russian metals in its system but the world's largest and oldest venue for tradingmetals has said it would not go beyond what British governmentsanctions against Russia dictate. Aluminium produced by Rusal and copper produced by Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) and JSC Uralelektromed could only be delivered into approved LME warehouses in Britain if it had been exported from Russia before March 25, the LME said. Rusal and Nornickel declined to comment.  The LME said its suspension also included lead and aluminium alloy made by Rusal and three other producers. ""Neither Nornickel nor Rusal send any of their metal to UK warehouses,"" an industry source said. 
Britain has two approved locations for LME warehouses, in Hull and Liverpool, but they have very little metal. None of the four metals being suspended are currently being stored in British LME warehouses, LME data shows. LME facilities in Liverpool, however, have 1,416 tonnes of nickel. Nickel is not suspended and is not on the British list for additional duties, even though Russia's Norilsk Nickel is one of the world's biggest producers.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 11:01AM ET</span>","Analysis-As foreign digital firms leave, Russia's domestic providers pounce","(Reuters) - Russian domestic tech companies, led by entities controlled or associated with state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), are pouncing on the blockade and exodus of foreign internet firms, sensing opportunities in Russia's growing digital isolation.
Russia has restricted access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms' flagships Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram since sending thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, as the country's long-simmering dispute with Big Tech escalates into a battle to control information flows. 
The digital exodus provoked by Western sanctions, and a clampdown by Russian media regulators, has opened the door to domestic players, with VK, which runs the country's most popular social media site VKontakte, leading the charge. On Thursday it published a step-by-step guide for businesses looking to migrate away from other platforms.
For years considered Russia's answer to Facebook, VKontakte has more than 50 million daily active users on average and reaches 80% of Russia's online monthly audience, the company said.
That dwarfs Facebook's 7.5 million users in Russia as of last year, according to estimates from researcher Insider Intelligence. 
More than 585,000 new business owners created their own communities on the platform in March, VKontakte said, from hair salons to clothes shops. 
VKontakte has set new records for user activity since Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, with an 11% jump in content volumes on its platform from Feb. 24 to March 24, according to monitor Brand Analytics.
The volume of Russian-language content published on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram dropped 5%, 16% and 30% respectively in that period, the monitor said. 
Vkontakte, which makes money through adverts, commission from app developers and user payments for subscriptions and one-off payments, contributed a little over a fifth of the company's 125.8 billion roubles ($1.5 billion) in revenue last year.
VK's other business lines include email provider mail.ru, gaming unit MY.Games and education technology assets. 
""The domestic market for interactive services now has a great chance to show its potential to its audience,"" Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications, told the Telesputnik media outlet in late March. ""Russian users don't just have an alternative, they have a choice.""
GAZPROM INFLUENCE
While there is no direct policy on replacing foreign social media, the government has promised income tax breaks and preferential loans for IT companies and employees can get their military service deferred. Politicians are also encouraging users to switch to domestic providers.
The government may also be playing an indirect role in the country's tech future through a complicated series of investments that involve Gazprom and its media division. 
A shareholder and management shake-up late last year saw Gazprom Media acquire a decent chunk of VK's voting rights in December, adding to a burgeoning media empire controlled by the state energy giant.
Its investments may soon pay off after a stumble. Trading of VK's London-listed shares was suspended in early March after they plunged to almost zero as Western investors abandoned Russian assets.
When trading in VK's depositary receipts resumed in Moscow on Wednesday after a more than month-long suspension, they leapt 72% in one session from record lows, which analysts linked to reduced foreign competition.
In late 2020, Gazprom Media acquired RuTube, a video-hosting platform that bears a striking resemblance to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, and whose weekly user numbers jumped 5.5 times in early March, TASS cited the company as saying. 
Those numbers could surge higher as YouTube is under pressure from Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor, and may soon suffer the same fate as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Despite being restricted, those sites can sometimes still be accessed using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), demand for which has skyrocketed in Russia. YouTube remains freely accessible. 
But critics say RuTube has a long way to go to rival Google's video product. 
RuTube's number of unique monthly users was 17.7 million at the end of December, Gazprom Media's Deputy CEO Alexander Moiseev said in February. That compares to YouTube's 89.5 million in Russia in January 2022, according to Mediascope. 
And while RuTube's video player works well, it lacks the algorithmic recommendations that have made YouTube so popular, Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department at digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, told Reuters.
""These services are no match for the quality and speed of services, above all American services, that users have become accustomed to,"" Darbinyan said. 
VKontakte said all its products underwent ""rigorous testing"" before release, and that it had launched 230 product updates to improve the user experience in the past year.
RuTube did not respond to a request for comment. 
NEWER FACES
Other domestic alternatives to popular foreign services have launched more recently. Gazprom Media unveiled Yappy in November, a rival to video-sharing platform TikTok, which has suspended live-streaming and new video uploads in Russia. 
Since its launch, around 3.2 million users in Russia have installed Yappy, compared to more than 10 million for TikTok, according to estimates up to March 27 from tracker Sensor Tower. 
Rossgram, an imitation of Instagram in name, design and colour scheme, was set to launch this week, but its founders only succeeded in publishing a video of a prototype hours after the scheduled launch time. 
Different developers said they were launching a black and white, melancholy alternative to the U.S. photo sharing platform, called 'Grustnogram', or 'Sadgram' in English. Others are building a Google Play store alternative.
Another service that Gorelkin and other government figures have promoted in recent weeks is messaging app Telegram, seemingly recovering from its chequered past with the Russian state, which tried unsuccessfully to block it in 2018.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov was also the brains behind VKontakte, but fled Russia in 2014 after allies of the Kremlin gained control of the platform. 
Telegram says its more than 500 million global users generate over 500 billion views in one-to-many channels every month. It allows sponsored messages of related content in public channels. Already hugely popular in Russia, the platform would benefit from any outflow of users from WhatsApp.

Used by around 67 million people in Russia last year, according to Insider Intelligence estimates, WhatsApp remains available for now.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:56AM ET</span>",Corporate debt issuance surges in March despite Q1 slump,"By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - Companies raced to bond markets last month, undeterred by the Ukraine war as they tried to lock in relatively cheap borrowing, though the March rush did not prevent first-quarter sales in the euro market from slumping to a four-year low.
Bond markets globally endured immense volatility in the January-March quarter, stoked by hawkish turns from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, as well as Russia's Feb. 23 invasion of Ukraine. That, coupled with lower funding needs, pushed bond issuance lower across all debt categories, with Refinitiv data showing it as the slowest first quarter in three years.
In the euro area, where debt markets froze for longer following the invasion, fundraising by investment-grade companies amounted to 93.6 billion euros, the worst first quarter since 2018, according to Refinitiv. 
But March turned out to be the busiest month since September 2020 for euro investment-grade sales with some 43.5 billion euros raised. 
The U.S. market enjoyed its highest monthly volume on record at any time except during the pandemic liquidity crunch in early 2020, with $130.6 billion of sales in March. First-quarter sales however dropped to a three-year low.

""None of the syndicates expected it to go quite as well, said Helene Jolly, head of EMEA investment-grade corporate syndicate at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), citing volatility, some bond outflows and inflationary pressures.
The March issuance pickup came as credit markets stabilised and risk premia, the additional yield companies pay on top of government bonds, have slipped below levels seen at the start of the invasion. 
Still, borrowing costs in the euro area have tripled for investment-grade companies this year, with the average yield on BofA's index at 1.50%. 
For issuers, ""it's that dynamic of saying: yes (borrowing costs) are higher... but on a historical basis it still looks good and anyone who has come this year has looked smart pretty much immediately in terms of what rates have done,"" Jolly said.
Some companies have been bringing forward their near-term funding plans, she added. 
For a related graphic on Euro IG corporate debt sales, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3J0ll67
But for companies with sub-investment grade credit ratings, the backdrop remains challenging. The euro area saw virtually no ""junk"" debt sales last month, while just $10.6 billion was raised by U.S. junk names.
Issuance slumped 70% compared to first-quarter 2021 in both markets, to the slowest since 2016 in the U.S. and 2019 in the euro area.
A positive sign for the European market waiting to reopen came in recent weeks as two companies carrying split ratings -investment-grade and high yield - managed to place bonds. 
However, a third such company, shopping center owner IGD, postponed a deal after it received less demand than the amount it originally sought to raise, according to a lead manager. 
Daniel Rudnicki Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), head of EMEA leveraged finance at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said based on client discussions, he expects the European high yield market to restart around Easter. 

""If the current market conditions don't worsen, we're going to go through a period of slow issuance that will show gradual progress."" 
Rudnicki Schlumberger said he expects most of the issuance to come from mergers and acquisitions financing, as the rise in borrowing costs and hefty issuance during the pandemic makes refinancing deals less likely.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) stock traded 4% lower Friday after Stifel downgraded it to ‘hold’ with a target of $15.
Analyst Scott Devitt earlier had a ‘buy’ on the stock with a target of $19, according to StreetInsider. The stock fell to a low of $12 in the session so far.
Devitt said the company faces numerous growth challenges that may limit share price appreciation relative to other e-commerce ideas even as he acknowledged its positive attributes: asset-light model, 20%+ margin potential, and a highly engaged user base.
According to the analyst, Apple’s privacy changes have dampened the effectiveness of the company’s marketing investments, resulting in slower user growth and higher marketing costs while Poshmark’s international expansion is yet to materialize.
Initial market launches have fallen short of the management’s expectations as well as the assumptions underpinning Stifel’s model, the analyst wrote.
With no clear catalysts and a modest growth outlook, Devitt said they favored other names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).
Poshmark reported its fourth-quarter numbers on March 22.
Net revenue grew 22% to top $84 million. Gross merchandise value, the value of all goods and services on an online platform, grew 27% to touch nearly $491 million.
In the current quarter, the company expects revenue to be $86 million-$88 million."

Several major Russian companies have listings abroad, which has always been a matter of prestige for them. But since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, Western bourses have halted trading of Russian securities.
Holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies that are traded abroad can convert them into shares on the Russian market, Reshetnikov said.
""When shares here (in Russia) are much more expensive, there is no sense in trading them there. That is why our Russian shares, Russian companies will be obliged to return here unless another government decision is made,"" Reshetnikov said.
U.S.-based bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has already offered clients who hold Russian equities on foreign bourses an option to withdraw from them and receive them in Moscow for a fee, according to a letter sent by the bank and seen by Reuters.
The offer, which is effective from March 30, covered depositary receipts in more than a dozen major Russian firms, including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), VTB and Novatek, according to the letter.
BNY said in the letter it would facilitate the swap only if holders attested they would remain the owners of the securities when they are transferred to Russia.
BNY Mellon declined to comment on the swap offer, which was first reported by the Financial Times on Thursday. 
The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in the depositary receipts -- which represent shares in a foreign company -- of Russian companies in early March after prices crashed to record lows.
In London, depositary receipts in Russia's largest lender Sberbank fell to almost zero days after Russian sent thousands of its troops to Ukraine.
In Moscow, Sberbank shares in Moscow rose 16% to 152 roubles ($1.85) per piece in the past seven trading days after Moscow Exchange gradually resumed trading following a nearly month-long hiatus.

The removal from the brokerage's ""Analyst Focus List"" comes as analysts warn that fresh coronavirus lockdowns in China and rising cost of goods due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand in 2022.

Apple is already planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
Qualcomm, meanwhile, will likely bear the brunt of weakness in the smartphone market for low- to mid-end Android handsets, Chatterjee said.
""There has been understandably a lot of noise around demand weakness across global tech, but we believe the macro weakness seeping through the sector will impact the consumer end-markets more materially,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan has dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co of using misleading labeling to exaggerate the amount of strawberries in its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts.
In a Thursday night decision, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter said reasonable shoppers would not expect strawberries to be the main ingredient in a ""pre-packaged, processed sugary treat called Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts.""
The judge said Kellogg's labeling described Pop-Tarts' flavor instead of the source of that flavor, and shoppers like plaintiff Kelvin Brown of Bronx, New York, could check the ingredient list to resolve any confusion.
Carter also rejected the idea that Pop-Tarts buyers missed out on the health benefits of strawberries.
""A reasonable consumer is unlikely to purchase a toaster pastry coated in frosting exclusively for the nutritional value of strawberries in its fruit filling,"" he wrote.
A lawyer for Brown had no immediate comment on Friday. Kellogg and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last month, a federal judge in Chicago dismissed a similar lawsuit over unfrosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts, saying Kellogg did not guarantee how many strawberries it would use.
The Battle Creek, Michigan-based company is also being sued over its Whole Grain Frosted Strawberry and Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts.
Lawsuits over false labeling are common, and many are unsuccessful.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's vow to cut customers off from its gas unless they start paying in roubles is more of a 'bluff' to ward off further sanctions than a genuine threat to stop supplying energy, according to European officials and analysts.
Gas was flowing to Europe normally on Friday, and some experts reckon the new arrangement may be broadly the same as the old process of paying, with only a slight boost for the embattled Russian currency. 
Below is an outline of why, for now at least, Putin's gas ultimatum is considered bluster.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Europe is heavily reliant on Russia for its energy needs, with around 40% of its gas coming from the country. So if Moscow turned off the taps it could trigger immediate shortages, factory closures and crippling energy costs.
Gas contracts are priced in euros or dollars but Putin said they should be paid in roubles.
Western countries called Putin's demand ""blackmail"" and refused. Now it seems they won't have to change much, although they may switch how they pay for their gas in order to put money more directly into Russia's pocket.
Under the decree signed by Putin, foreign gas buyers must open accounts in state-controlled Gazprombank from Friday and pay direct - rather than, say, a German buyer using a local bank to transfer the money. 
Gazprombank would then use that money to buy roubles, propping up the currency, a role typically done by the Russian central bank, which has been hobbled by the freezing of hundreds of billions of its reserves in response to war.
Putin's rouble demand baffled many European officials and experts and much remains unclear, making a final assessment difficult.
There will be a time lag before we know whether the new payment arrangement is workable because gas bills are paid weeks after delivery. That means any dispute - or gas cut -is some time off, if it happens at all.
There was no sign on Friday of immediate interruptions. Flows remained steady through two of the three main pipelines bringing Russian gas into Europe - Nord Stream 1 across the Baltic Sea, and into Slovakia over Ukraine.
Flows through the other main route, the Yamal-Europe pipeline over Belarus, had reversed direction, now bringing gas from Germany to Poland, but this is not uncommon.
IS IT A 'STORM IN A TEACUP?'
For now, it seems so. European officials and experts believe it is chiefly aimed at shielding Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) from future sanctions - if Gazprombank collects the money, Europe could not sanction it without cutting gas.
An Italian minister said that if Russia's decree to pay for gas in roubles stays as it is ""all in all, not a lot would change"".
""It amounts to a warning from Putin not to tighten financial sanctions further,"" said Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, a think tank.
It wouldn't be much of a boost for the rouble either. Prior to the invasion, the Russian central bank required most of the foreign currency from gas to be converted into roubles. Now all of it would have to be switched into the Russian currency.
""What sounded grandiose has turned into a storm in a teacup. By making it the main recipient of money for gas, it puts an extra shield against sanctions around Gazprombank,"" said Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
One European official said he believed Putin had demanded the switch to rouble payment to test who would go along with it. But noone did. 
""After the pushback, he is trying to find a system where he could claim that he had won, while in fact something close to the status quo is continuing,"" the official said.
WILL THE LIGHTS GO OUT?
Energy exports are Putin's most powerful lever as Russia tries to fight back against what it calls an ""economic war"". European officials and analysts are reluctant to say his threats to switch off supplies are truly empty.
Doing so would hurt Russia's Gazprom, as it would struggle to offload all European-bound gas to alternative buyers, said Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at the Moscow-based brokerage Locko-Invest.

Experts believe it is nonetheless symbolically important and it has rattled faith in Russia's reliability in Germany, which this week had to take the exceptional step of warning of potential rationing ahead.
One European Union official said that while he considered the threatened cutoff without payment in roubles to be a 'bluff' the full implications of Putin's demands were unclear and that a tougher stance could emerge in the coming days.

The buyback was planned before April 11, the company said in a statement, adding it hoped ""to provide more information about the evolution of our shareholder structure in the coming days"".
Business daily Les Echos and other French media reported that French shipping group CMA CGM was set to acquire Gefco.
CMA CGM declined to comment.
Gefco, which did not explain how it would finance the buyout, said running its business had become ""extremely difficult due to our shareholding structure"".
Western industrial players are seeking to cut their ties with partners in Russia, which has become increasingly isolated after invading neighbour Ukraine at the end of February. 
The British government, in its latest round of sanctions on March 24, cited state-owned RZD, along with some defence companies and the Wagner Group, known for employing mercenaries, for aiding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Gefco said the British sanctions, as well as EU and U.S. restrictions, should not impact Gefco as an independent company registered in France.
Founded in 1949, Gefco employs 11,500 staff in 47 countries and sells transport services to Stellantis, Ford,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Skoda and Toyota, as well as Nestle and Electrolux.
Until 2012, it was fully owned by France's PSA group, which last year merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis. 
Facing pressure to cut costs, PSA in 2012 sold a 75% stake in Gefco to RZD for 800 million euros ($884.00 million). 
Sources told Reuters last year RZD and Stellantis had put Gefco up for sale in a deal expected to be worth more than 2 billion euros. Neither owner commented.
Les Echos, citing sources, said the potential deal with CMA CGM would value Gefco at 450 million-500 million euros.

CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container shipping lines, has invested heavily in non-maritime logistics in recent years through a series of acquisitions.

MADRID (Reuters) -The chairman of Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) on Friday called for the European Union to define what kind of lending is considered consistent with a net zero energy policy, to help hasten moves to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas.
The EU, which was already targeting a shift towards green energy from fossil fuels, has said since Russia invaded Ukraine in February that it will cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year and end the use of Russian gas by 2027.
""Among other initiatives, financial institutions must be able to finance the energy transition, and to this end, the authorities must define as soon as possible what lending is deemed consistent with our net zero goals,"" Ana Botin told a shareholders meeting.
Botin said that though Santander's direct exposure to Russia was negligible at 80 million euros ($88.4 million), it expected some indirect impact from the Ukraine conflict stemming from higher inflation and lower economic growth. 
She said the bank's internal assessment assumed ""no further escalation and the war contained within Ukraine"".
Botin underlined the need to change global energy policies and accelerate investments in renewables, ""so we can help people to go green and businesses to make the necessary transition"".
She said that process would be ""more challenging"" for emerging economies, for small and mid-sized companies and vulnerable groups, and therefore asked for incentives.
In Spain, companies and families, especially SMEs and the most vulnerable would need protecting from the impact of the war, which has sent energy prices soaring. The Spanish government approved a 16 billion euro package on Tuesday to help companies and households.
Botin said European funds could be used to help support confidence and private investment, a key driver of growth and jobs.
On Thursday, the ECB said euro zone banks' direct exposure to Russia was relatively minor but sanctions could still reverberate through the financial system through volatility in energy and commodity prices.
Botin assured shareholders that the bank had taken necessary steps to comply with financial restrictions and EU, UK and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia, ""and will continue to observe these requisites as the situation develops"".
Santander's Chief Executive Officer, Jose Antonio Alvarez, said the bank was strengthening controls against potential operational threats, including cybersecurity and money laundering.
Spanish banks in general rank among the less exposed to Russian credit, with Spain's central bank estimating their credit risk at just above 700 million euros.

Alvarez said Santander expected the war to have an uneven impact on the group's regions, with Europe the most affected area. The impact in South America would be neutral or positive, he said, as raw material there would be exported at higher prices resulting in a currency appreciation.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:13AM ET</span>",Sanofi to float drug ingredients manufacturing business on May 6,"By Sarah Morland and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) -Sanofi plans to list its drug ingredients subsidiary EUROAPI on May 6, saying the business is set to grow and improve its profitability as a separate business. 
Having received approval from the French markets regulator, the listing on the Euronext Paris exchange is set to take place shortly after a May 3  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) shareholder vote on the listing, the French pharmaceutical giant said on Friday.
Sanofi shareholders will receive one EUROAPI share for 23 shares held in the parent company.
The company confirmed plans to conserve a 30% stake in the business after the listing while France will buy a 12% stake through public-sector bank EPIC Bpifrance for up to 150 million euros ($166 million). 
The flotation plan for the group with its Europe-based production network comes as the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's attack on Ukraine have heightened concerns in the EU over the region's dependency on critical pharma ingredient imports.
""You can read also through the participation of BPIFrance the interest in terms of regional sovereignty and development. It’s not just the interest of France. It is the interest of the whole of Europe,"" Sanofi finance chief Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in an analyst call.
L'Oreal, Sanofi's largest shareholder with a more than 9% stake, agreed to a one-year lock-up period after the listing, Sanofi added.
EUROAPI makes active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for medicines and draws on six production sites in Italy, Germany, Britain, France and Hungary.
Sanofi, which last year accounted for half EUROAPI's revenue, said in January that it expects the business to become the world's second-biggest API player with about 1 billion euros in revenue forecast for this year.
Sanofi CFO de Chatillon said that EUROAPI's estimated core profit margin this year of at least 14%, well below the 21% for EUROAPI's closest rival Siegfried AG of Switzerland, was a case in point why Sanofi was not the best owner.
""When you see the peer performance there is a margin for improvement that we truly believe is going to be delivered,"" said de Chatillon.
The new company's CEO said Karl Rotthier said, as an independent group, EUROAPI would win over more of Sanofi rivals as customers, expand in high-margin drug development services and advisory and cut more costs.

The bulk of EUROAPI's share capital, 58%, will be distributed to Sanofi shareholders through a dividend in kind, in addition to a previously proposed 3.33 euros per share cash payout.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:13AM ET</span>",A cash-strapped Venezuela leans on scrap exports to raise hard currency,"By Mayela Armas and Maria Ramirez
GUANTA/CARACAS (Reuters) - On the outskirts of the eastern Venezuelan port town of Guanta, hundreds of trucks line up everyday to unload tons of scrap metal, part of the government's attempt to turn waste into a source of foreign currency. 
The gathering and sale of scrap has been booming due to the financial needs of President Nicolas Maduro's administration, crippled by low oil production as a result of years of under-investment in the industry and obstacles to selling its most lucrative export due to U.S. sanctions.
""Venezuela is going to get lighter, because they're removing all the scrap,"" said Douglas Lugo, a truck driver on the outskirts of Guanta who used to work in the oil industry before he started to transport scrap material. His truck was weighed down with iron waste such as sheet metal, car parts and pieces of rusty doors. 
Under pressure from Washington's sanctions, Maduro's government has been exploring a range of revenue options. Although scrap was sold abroad in very low quantities previously, private companies stepped up efforts to export it starting in mid-2020.
In 2021, Maduro designated scrap as ""strategic"", clearing the way for any surplus to be exported, saying it was necessary to ""turn it into foreign currency ... to take advantage of every last resource that is out there"".
During eight years of economic chaos in Venezuela, state controls have increasingly slowed industries such as manufacturing and construction, while mismanagement and underinvestment have hurt the OPEC member's oil sector. 
State-owned and private companies saddled with outdated plants, equipment and machinery have found it increasingly tempting to sell them as scrap. While the state is behind some such activities, workers and others have also stolen equipment to sell at a profit, prosecutors say.
State-owned oil company PDVSA and other state companies have been among the sellers as new projects have stalled and machinery has aged, some 15 sources, including business people from various sectors, carriers, workers and government officials, told Reuters. 
The dismantling of equipment and its trade has not been confirmed by the authorities. The communication and production ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
Still, port records show that Venezuelan scrap is being exported to countries such as Turkey, India and Taiwan.
Although state-owned Corporation Ezequiel Zamora manages much of the scrap at Venezuela's ports, it has signed contracts or ""partnerships"" with private companies to export it, thus circumventing U.S. sanctions barring Venezuelan state companies from trading abroad, according to a document and two sources. 
The companies pay Zamora in foreign currency, in cash, then arrange to export the material, two sources interviewed told Reuters. Zamora did not respond to a request for comment. 
About 25 companies have been officially authorized to transport and sell scrap metal, according to another document seen by Reuters. 
For all of 2021, 45,500 tons of iron, steel and copper scrap worth US$55 million was exported from two of the country's main ports, according to figures from Import Genius, a consulting firm that gathers customs records, more than double the volume the previous year.
There are no numbers on the other ports. Bolipuertos, which manages the ports, did not respond to requests for comment.
Scrap metal sales ""have increased considerably during the months when the COVID-19 pandemic was most severe, when state revenues were low,"" local firm Ecoanalítica said in a report in February.
On the international market, depending on the type of material, the scrap which the local private companies buy for between US$80 and US$120 per ton can be sold for US$300 and US$700, two sources and two carriers told Reuters.
In northern Monagas, an oil zone in the east of the Andean nation, tanks and pipes are being dismantled, said a source in the oil sector and two workers who witnessed how these materials are cut up in warehouses. 
""Nothing is being restored today, everything is for sale,"" a source said on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. 
Equipment is being dismantled in other oil areas like Zulia and Anzoátegui, another industry source said. Neither source specified who within PDVSA is ordering such moves. 
But with the scrap metal trade booming, some such sales constitute outright theft, according to reports from the police and the public prosecutor's office.
Truckers who once worked for oil or coal companies told Reuters they have been increasingly drawn to haul scrap given that they can easily earn 10 times Venezuela's monthly minimum wage of $30.

""Everyone is working with scrap metal. Before you didn't see that (...),"" said Antonio Astudillo, who used to transport food from Brazil to various Venezuelan states, and since December has been working in the transport of scrap metal to Guanta. 
""You can make money to survive.""

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>","Rouble eases from over 5-week high, Russian stocks climb","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble touched a more than five-week high in early Moscow trade on Friday before settling in the 83-84 range to the dollar, and Russian stocks climbed, with investors eyeing events in Ukraine and an ongoing gas payments saga.
By 1319 GMT, the rouble was 0.2% weaker against the dollar at 83.37, earlier clipping 80.3325, its strongest mark since Feb. 23. It had gained 0.2% to trade at 92.31 versus the euro.
On the interbank market, the rouble was as strong as 75 against the dollar earlier this week and was hovering near 81 on Wednesday. The rouble was at 83.1 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform.
European governments and companies were working on Friday on a common approach to President Vladimir Putin's demand that they pay for Russian gas in roubles as the threat of an imminent halt in supplies eased.
Putin's move has boosted the rouble in the past two weeks.
The currency's lightning-fast recovery to levels last reached in the days before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine is partly down to a genuine improvement in Russia's finances, but also due to being artificially inflated by capital controls.
Other factors that have been working in the rouble's favour include a just-expired quarterly tax period that forces foreign companies to convert dollars and euros, and the finance ministry's offer to buy back FX bonds for Russian holders, said Konstantin Svyatny chief portfolio manager at Aton Brokerage. 
""Taking all this into account, it is likely that we have already seen some kind of local minimum for the (dollar rate against the) rouble,"" he said. 
EASING RESTRICTIONS
Russia's central bank said it was softening restrictions on foreign fund transfers for individuals for six months, permitting limited monthly transfers in foreign currency that may ease the strain on Russians who regularly send funds to relatives abroad.
The bank said the measures would not apply to people from countries that have supported sanctions against Moscow.
""This step looks like a signal that if the rouble strengthens further, we can expect further measures to reduce currency control restrictions,"" said Promsvyazbank analysts in a note. 
Russian stock indexes hit their highest since Feb. 22 before paring some gains.
The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 2.3% at 1,042.8 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 2.3% higher at 2,759.1 points. 

Shares in energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) were up around 3.7%. 
Russian companies whose depositary receipts are traded abroad will be obliged to return to Russia, unless other solutions arise, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on Friday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Carmakers in India reported a sharp rise in annual sales for the fiscal year 2022 on Friday, but warned of future risks from global supply chain disruptions.
Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest carmaker, said sales rose 13% in the fiscal year ended March 31 to 1.65 million units, growing for the first time in two years. But the company warned that ""the supply situation of electronic components continues to be unpredictable"".
This might have ""some impact"" on the production volume in the current fiscal year, Maruti said in a statement. Maruti, which sells one in every two cars in India, is majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp.
Automakers globally have been forced to make sharp production cuts over the past year as supply chain disruptions and booming demand for consumer electronics have led to an acute shortage of semiconductors. This has resulted in long wait times for car buyers. 
Now, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to worsen the problem as both countries supply raw materials used to manufacture semiconductors, Indian ratings agency ICRA said.
""The impact of the crisis in the form of higher fuel and commodity prices also poses a risk to (automobile) demand prospects, in case it materialises into a long drawn out war,"" ICRA said.

 Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), which is also India's largest electric carmaker, reported its highest ever annual sales of passenger vehicles, up 67% to 370,372 units from a year ago. Its electric car sales grew nearly four times to 19,000, the company said in a statement, despite ""two waves of Covid, semi-conductor crisis and steep increase in commodity prices"".
""Going forward, semi-conductor situation remains uncertain. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation closely,"" said Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 11% Friday after the company said it plans to seek shareholder approval for a stock split.
Some traders are betting that the stock split will boost the value of GameStop shares by attracting more meme-stock aficionados.
The gaming retailer will request at its upcoming annual meeting that shareholders approve a proposal to increase the number of Class A shares to 1 billion from 300 million, according to a filing. The move comes amidst a revival in interest among retail investors for so-called 'meme stocks' after a lull of a few months.
A stock split makes the shares more accessible to individual investors by lowering the price, without affecting the company's valuation.
The company said the split will “provide flexibility for future corporate needs.” It’s unclear when GameStop will release its definitive proxy statement. The company hasn’t announced when and where it will hold its annual meeting, though last year’s meeting took place in June.
Earlier this week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) disclosed its plans for its second split in less than two years which sent its market cap soaring by more than $80 billion in a single session.
GameStop is the original meme stock that the retail traders took fancy to during the pandemic as thousands of them, closeted at home during lockdowns, coordinated trades over social platforms like Reddit. It almost seemed like a battle between Reddit followers ‘WallStreetBets’ on one hand and the big institutional guys on the other. The stock rose 4,000% in 2021."

Businesses with great exposure to the consumer sector are likely to suffer more in the first half of this year, with the rest of the coverage to follow the same path later this year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, supported by a jobs report that showed the labor market still in rude health despite concerns about inflation and prospective higher interest rates. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 101 points, or 0.3% at 34,780 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, in a positive start to the second quarter. The first quarter of the year had been the worst for stocks since the start of the pandemic two years ago. 
Earlier, the Labor Department said the economy added another 431,000 jobs in the month through mid-March, and while that was a slowdown from last month and less than generally expected, the miss was more than compensated by an aggregate upward revision of 95,000 to the data from the previous two months. The jobless rate fell to 3.8%, its lowest since 2019, while measures of underemployment and labor force participation also picked up. The latter signaled that higher wages - which grew at 5.6% on the year through March, are tempting people back into the workforce, after they had left it during the age of lockdowns. 
The market gave up some of its gains after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI for March pointed to ongoing severe price pressures. The prices paid subindex rose to 87.1 from 75.6, hitting its highest since July last year when global supply chains were at their most stressed. 
The mood was improved by a Bloomberg report, citing anonymous sources, saying that Chinese authorities were willing to allow most of the Chinese companies with ADRs listed in the U.S. to provide all the information sought by U.S. regulators to defend those listings.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 6.7%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs rose 8.9% and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs rose 8.0%.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock also rose 5.8% after seeking approval for a stock split, a move that typically makes stocks more attractive to small-scale investors. Fellow meme stock BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), meanwhile, fell 12% after its disappointing quarterly report, in which its cybersecurity business failed to hit the ambitious targets set for it by the retail investor crowd.
Financial stocks, however, came under pressure again as expectations for higher short-term interest rates - which were reinforced by both the labor market and the ISM data - pushed up short-term bond yields, compressing the lending margins that provide commercial lenders with their main source of income. The so-called spread between two-year and 10-year bond yields has vanished to nothing, having been as wide as 127 basis points less than six months ago. Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock fell 1.7% to its lowest since November 2020, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 1.0% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 1.2%.
Elsewhere, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock fell 2.1% and General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock fell 1.0% as the issue of component shortages reared its ugly head again as the two Detroit giants said they will idle plants in Michigan temporarily."

Overall, French new car sales fell in the first quarter and recorded their tenth straight month of declines with an almost 20% drop in March, as the auto industry struggles to with supply chain issues including a global shortage of semiconductor chips.
Sales of fully electric and hybrid models accounted for nearly 40% of new car sales, versus 38.3% for conventional petrol models, according to industry data provided by the Plateforme automobile (PFA).
A spokesperson for the PFA said due to uncertainty over the war in Ukraine and shortages of some components, it was not possible to provide a forecast for French new car sales in 2022. 
Adding in diesel model sales' market share of 16.5% in the first quarter, pure combustion engine models are still in the majority. 
But this is a sea change in auto sales, as electrified vehicles were a niche market just three years ago. 
Encouraged by subsidies, looming bans on fossil-fuel models and high petrol prices, electrified models have become mainstream in a very short space of time.
The top-selling electric car in France in March was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s mass-market Model 3, followed by the Dacia Spring from  Renault  (PA:RENA) and the Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) 208 from Stellantis.

French car sales were down 17.3% in the first quarter. 
In 2020, the French car market fell off a cliff due to the coronavirus pandemic, but then rose slightly in 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is recalling 737,000 vehicles in the United States over a part that could develop an oil leak and a software error that could hinder braking, it said on Friday.
The automaker is recalling 345,451 of its 2020-2022 Ford Escape and 2021-2022 Ford Bronco Sport vehicles with 1.5L engines because the engine oil separator housing could crack and develop an oil leak that might cause an engine fire.
Ford said it had reports of at least eight fires that may be related to the issue but no related injuries or crashes. Dealers will inspect the oil separator for damage or oil leaks, and replace the oil separator and seals, as necessary.

Ford is also recalling 391,836 2021-2022 F-150, 2022 Ford Maverick, Expedition, Lincoln avigator, F-250, F-350, F-450 and F-550 vehicles because a towed trailer equipped with an electric or electric-over hydraulic brake system might not brake.
Dealers will update the integrated trailer brake control module software. Ford has 67 reports of improper function potentially related to the issue but no reports of crashes or injuries related to the recall.

This view is based on the expectations that US real rates will stay negative this year before potentially moving higher in 2023.
The strategist says equities faced so much bad news, but still, the MSCI AC World is 6% above its pre-conflict level while the S&P 500 is 9% in the green.
With cash and bonds offering negative real yields, investors are still inclined to buy the dips in global equities, despite deteriorating fundamentals. Citi economists expect US real yields to go positive in 2023, which may prove more challenging. Growth trades, such as US equities and the MSCI World IT sector, will likely stay expensive as real rates remain negative. They may be vulnerable to higher real rates next year.

(Reuters) - Russian steelmaker Evraz, whose biggest shareholder is sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich, on Friday scrapped plans to separate its coal assets, citing sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. 
The London-listed company said the sanctions made it ""technically impossible"" to execute the demerger it proposed early last year to concentrate on its core steel business.
The move comes after Evraz indefinitely suspended the demerger of the Russia-based assets, consolidated under Raspadskaya (RASP), last month as it sought more clarity on sanctions against Abramovich. 
Evraz has said Abramovich, who has a 28.64% stake in the company and owns English soccer club Chelsea, does not have effective control of Evraz, adding it believes the company is neither designated nor sanctioned.
Evraz, whose shares had lost more than 60% in value since the sanctions began when they were suspended from trading on March 10, has been thrown into turmoil by the sanctions - with only its CEO remaining on the board after a director exodus, and last month a bond payment was blocked.
The West has imposed broad economic and political sanctions on Russia, Russian firms, and prominent or wealthy Russians since Moscow launched what it calls ""a special military operation,"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich on March 10, freezing his assets and preventing him from travelling to the country.

Evraz said on Friday RASP would remain part of the company.
In March, index provider FTSE Russell said it would remove four Russia-focussed companies, including Evraz, from all FTSE's indexes, after many brokers refused to trade their shares.

Cybersecurity business, its biggest, was flat due to increased competition. Revenue in the segment, facing competition from much bigger rivals like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), was $122 million.
The sluggishness in the automobile industry, brought upon by shortage of parts and semiconductors, continues to weigh on the company. Demand for its QNX software has been under stress as automakers have curtailed production due to shortage of semiconductors and other parts.
The company had, in September, warned that a drop in automobile production will continue to adversely affect its numbers over the next two quarters.
The IoT unit partly helped offset the setbacks. IoT revenue was $52 million on higher margins.

The findings underscore the difficulty in preventing community infections as the Word Health Organization (WHO) warns of a rise in cases.
The research project, run by Open Orphan with Imperial College, London, showed that among the 18 participants that caught COVID-19, the severity of symptoms, or whether they developed symptoms at all, had nothing to do with the viral load in their airways.
The viral load, or tendency to shed the virus, was measured by two methods known as focus-forming assay (FFA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
""There was no correlation between the amount of viral shedding by qPCR or FFA and symptom score,"" the researchers said in paper published by scientific journal Nature Medicine.
The Imperial trial exposed 36 healthy young adults without a history of infection or vaccination to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of the virus and monitored them in a quarantined setting.

Since two volunteers were found to have had antibodies against the virus after all, they were excluded from the analysis. Slightly more than half of them contracted the virus.
No serious adverse events occurred, and the human challenge study model was shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy young adults, the research team had said earlier this year.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 09:09AM ET</span>",Canada Stocks Beat U.S. by Most in 13 Years and Have Room to Run,"(Bloomberg) -- The surge in oil prices has fueled a rally in Canadian stocks this year which strategists say still has room to run. 
The S&P/TSX Composite Index has gained 3.1%, outperforming the S&P 500 by more than 8 percentage points. That’s the widest outperformance in a quarter in 13 years. Energy and materials stocks have surged as the war in Ukraine sparked a rush to oil and to haven assets, propelling the natural resource-heavy TSX to fresh highs.  
The nation’s energy index jumped 27%, its strongest quarter in data going back to 1988, led by major corporates such as Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd. and Tourmaline Oil Corp, which have soared more than 40%. Large miners like Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) Ltd. and First Quantum Minerals (OTC:FQVLF) Ltd. have led materials stocks to a 20% gain, while banks have climbed on the prospect of fatter profits from higher interest rates. Those three groups represent about half of the index.
“This is the perfect environment for the TSX and the commodities sectors,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. “And it also doesn’t seem like it’s going to end any time soon. Some of these companies that have weathered the bad commodity environment are coming out on the other side and are really going to become incredibly profitable.” 
Investors have another reason to be bullish. Average earnings per share are expected to grow 33% this year for Canadian firms, compared with 20% for U.S. companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Energy producers are expected to drive the profit boom, with analysts forecasting that average EPS will soar 68%.
That’s making Canadian stocks look cheap: Companies on the S&P/TSX are trading below their five-year average valuation, at 13.9 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months. Companies on the S&P 500 are flying higher than their average at 19.4 times earnings.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s heavy tech stocks weighting pushed the index to its worst quarter since the pandemic shut down global economies.
“We’ve had a rotation into value,” said Ian de Verteuil, head of portfolio strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “And at any metric, the TSX looks cheaper than the S&P 500.”
While a decline in commodity prices could affect investor sentiment, what’s more important is how companies allocate their capital. 
“A decline in commodity prices would affect sentiment, but it’s not as if the TSX is pricing in $100 crude,” de Verteuil said. “These companies can make a lot of money at $80 per barrel. The thing that we will need to see -- and this is the most debatable part of it -- is whether the C-suites of these companies have found religion” on capital spending. During past commodity booms, Canadian energy companies used their cash flow to increase production. This time, there are signs they’re sticking with dividends and share buybacks, he said.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 08:52AM ET</span>","U.S. stocks, bonds flash diverging signals as volatile first quarter ends","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Which market has it right? 
With the first quarter of 2022 over, the U.S. stock and bond markets appear to be conveying drastically different assessments of the growth outlook, leaving investors to decide which view will prevail. 
The S&P 500 has come roaring back from a near-13% decline and finished the quarter off 4.9% after a rebound that has defied worries over tighter monetary policy and geopolitical instability stemming from the war in Ukraine. Many stock investors have even shrugged off a brief inversion of a closely watched section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve – a phenomenon that has predicted past recessions. 
Bond investors appear far more pessimistic on the economy, with the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA index on track for its worst start to the year ever on worries that the Fed will cause recession by aggressively tightening monetary policy in its bid to fight surging inflation. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury are up 81 basis points this quarter and stand near their highest level since May 2019. 
Illustrating the countervailing forces in markets, the CBOE Volatility Index - viewed as a gauge of fear in equity markets - stands not far from its lows of the year, with investors pinning the reversal in stocks on everything from quarter-end rebalancing to buying from retail investors. At the same time, the ICE BofAML MOVE index, which tracks Treasury yield volatility, remains elevated. 
""Rates markets are very consistent in telling a story where the Fed is going to do some damage to the economy, (while) risk markets have not really done a good job of pricing any significant damage to the growth outlook,"" said Edward Al Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle. ""One of these stories is wrong."" 
One source of contention among investors has been the yield curve, where rates for two-year Treasuries briefly rose above those for 10-year Treasuries earlier this week. 
Such an inversion is concerning because it has preceded six of the seven recessions since 1978, according to data from Truist Advisory Services. Some investors, however, have given a broad range of reasons why the signal’s predictive power may not apply this time, including the potentially distortive effects of the Fed’s massive COVID-19 stimulus on rates markets. 
In any case, recessions have followed past inversions with an average lag of 16 months, and the S&P 500 has averaged an 11% gain in the 12 months following inversions, Truist's data showed. 
Overall, the S&P 500 has lost an average of 8.8% during the four recessions since 1990, according to CFRA data. 
""We would take this (equity) rally as a sort of a gift,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. “If you weren't able to reduce your exposure to some of the speculative areas of the market before the correction, now is your time.” 
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, cautioned investors against over-interpreting the exuberance in stocks or the gloom in the bond market. Still, the firm has scaled back its outlook for global earnings growth and now sees a more modest upside for stocks with a year-end target of 4,700 on the S&P 500. The index closed at 4,530.41 on Thursday.
Others have pointed out that the gap between yields on the 3-month and 10-year Treasuries – another closely followed measure – is positive by approximately 180 basis points. 
That’s a sign there is still room for the Fed to shift gears before the market starts to price in a recession, said Gary Cloud, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. 
Though policymakers have said they could raise rates by as much as 50 basis points in a single meeting if warranted and investors are pricing in some 200 basis points of tightening this year, ""the Fed doesn't want to tighten so much that it causes a recession,"" Cloud said. [L2N2VW1SG]
Others, however, are skeptical the Fed will be able to engineer a soft landing. 

Tim Murray, a capital markets strategist in the multi-asset division at T. Rowe Price, is moving into commodities and defensive sectors of the stock market while increasing allocations to longer-duration Treasuries, assets he believes will thrive during a downturn. 
""Once the Fed starts hiking, there's a good chance that we will have a recession in the relatively near future,"" Murray said. ""I get a sense that investors are not worried enough about this.""

The plan comes as shares of GameStop and other so-called ""meme"" stocks including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings are seeing renewed interest from retail investors, who are piling into riskier assets emboldened by hopes of a resolution in Russia's conflict with Ukraine.
Shares of GameStop, which have nearly doubled in value in the past two weeks, rose another 15% to $192 on bets that a stock split, which makes shares of a company more affordable, would boost the value of the retailer by attracting more retail traders.
Stock splits are becoming more common as companies look to manage ""their stock price in what is considered an investor-friendly range"", said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently announced upcoming share splits.
""Are splits the new buyback? Probably not, but highlights an additional tool to push stock prices higher despite financial theory saying otherwise,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.
Silverblatt signaled there could be more stock splits in the offing, noting that there were still eight stocks in the S&P 500 priced over $1,000 and 15 between $500 and $1,000.

Shares of most of the companies that have either announced or split their stock so far were trading over $500 before the split.
Shares of AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond Inc, another retail darling, gained nearly 3% and 5%, respectively, in trading before the opening bell on Friday.

Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of Chinese companies were up across the board in premarket trading Friday after reports that the country may grant U.S. regulators full access to audit reports of its firms listed on American exchanges.
Chinese authorities had so far been reluctant to allow the access. Had that stand continued, many of those companies risked getting delisted from American exchanges.
The root of the case is in a 2020 U.S. law that mandates public companies to grant American authorities access to audit work papers. Firms face delisting in case of non-compliance for three straight years.
According to reports, Securities and Exchange Commission had prepared a list of companies that were refusing to provide access. This included Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and its video arm iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) (up 9% and 13%, respectively, in premarket), Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) (5%),  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) (6%),  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) (7%), ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) (5%) and  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU) (12%).

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of Chinese EV-makers traded sharply higher in premarket Friday after all of them reported robust sales in March.
Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) was the biggest gainer with its stock up 9%. Sales in March more than tripled from a year ago to 15,414 units. Monthly delivery of the P7 smart sports sedan exceeded 9,000 in March for the first time, reaching 9,183 units, the company said.
ADRs of rival Nio (NYSE:NIO) traded 6% higher after it sold 9,985 vehicles in March, up about 38%. The company said it plans to unveil the 2022 NIO ES8, ES6, and EC6 SUVs in May.
In the meantime, ES7, the company’s new mid-to-large five-seater will also make its debut, it said.
Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the third EV manufacturer from China listed on American exchanges, was also up 6%. It sold 11,034 units in March, over 125% higher than a year ago.
Strong sales by the Chinese companies come even as several cities in the country remain locked because of the pandemic, in line with the authorities’ zero-COVID policy. The numbers are noteworthy as most automakers in the world complain of parts shortages, particularly semiconductors."

The analyst believes Tesla is experiencing very strong demand for its products with indicators showing shipments had been tracking up modestly qoq and ahead of the Street.
However, the shutdown of the Shanghai plant for several days presents an incremental downside risk to Delaney's 315k delivery estimate. While the Street consensus is 309k, Delaney says Tesla could report numbers that end up being in line to modestly above the Street.
We estimate based on CPCA data that daily production from the Shanghai Gigafactory has recently been ~2K vehicles per day, although part of the production in the last week of the quarter would likely be for deliveries in 2Q. In addition, disruptions to Tesla's supply chain in China from lockdowns could also weigh on production. For example, Tesla supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) has also halted some production in Shanghai, Delaney said in a client note.
A team of analysts at Goldman Sachs, led by Delaney, also analyzed Tesla app downloads, which were up low single digits qoq and up significantly yoy, albeit with some geographic dispersion.
Delaney also previewed Tesla's Q1 earnings report with his full-year projection for 2022 sitting at 1.51 million deliveries - above the Street at 1.455 million - and the full-year EPS estimate of $11.20, again higher than the FactSet consensus at $10.86.
The analyst expects a more muted Q1 for EPS given rising input prices and factory start-up costs. Delaney also expects margins to go further up as a result of the raised prices and new factories.
We believe Tesla's ability to pass on higher pricing and navigate the supply chain will position it well this year, the analyst concluded.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong stock exchange suspended from trade on Friday the shares of Chinese developers such as Sunac China, Shimao Group and Kaisa Group, and about 30 other firms for a delay in declaring annual results.
Hong Kong-listed firms usually have three months after the end of the financial year to publish results, though regulators in 2020 allowed trade to continue if companies whose audits were affected by pandemic curbs issued preliminary results without agreement with auditors, or published management accounts.
""The exchange is committed to maintaining a fair, orderly and continuous market,"" the exchange operator, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), said in a statement.
It would monitor developments to ensure suspensions were as short as reasonably possible, it added.
Of the 32 firms suspended for missing the March 31 deadline, 14 had audits affected by pandemic curbs, the exchange said. That compared with 57 suspended in the corresponding period last year, when two were related to COVID-19. 
Late on Thursday, Shimao Group said its shares would be suspended from Friday as it was unable to publish unaudited 2021 results in time, because of the outbreak.
The pandemic had led to the lockdown of an office building at the firm's Shanghai headquarters and quarantine of some staff, with the date for curbs to be lifted still uncertain, Shimao added. 
On Monday, Sunac China had said trading in its shares would be halted for missing the HKEX deadline.
On Tuesday, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd, a unit of embattled developer China Evergrande Group, flagged a suspension for the same reason.
The firm would work with its auditor to publish results in about three months and seek to resume trading as soon as possible, it added. 

Other companies facing trading suspensions over the delay included Aoyuan Healthy Life Group, Fantasia Holdings and Kaisa Group.
In Shanghai, more Chinese companies are halting domestic listing plans, as the coronvirus outbreak hampers due diligence and information-gathering.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 06:42AM ET</span>",The chip challenge: Keeping Western semiconductors out of Russian weapons,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - When Silicon Valley chipmaker Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) learned that one of its chips was found in a Russian surveillance drone recovered in 2016, it set out to investigate how that came to be.
The chip, which costs less than $2, was shipped in 2009 to a distributor in Asia, which sold it to another broker in Asia, which later went out of business. 
“We couldn’t trace it any further,”  Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Chief Operations Officer Chris Koopmans said in a recent interview. 
Years later, it reappeared in the drone recovered in Lithuania. Marvell’s experience is one of a myriad of examples of how chipmakers lack ability to track where many of their lower-end products end up, executives and experts said. That could stymie the enforcement of new U.S. sanctions designed to halt the export of U.S. technology into Russia. 
While higher-end sophisticated chips that can build supercomputers are sold directly to companies, lower-cost commodity ones that might just control the power often go through several resellers before they end up in a gadget. 
The global chip industry is expected to ship 578 billion chips this year, 64% of them “commodity” chips, said TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson. 
While Russia accounted for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases before the sanctions, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, new Western sanctions underscore the threat in human terms.
“All those drones we've seen were not armed,” said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at the European Union- and Germany-funded Conflict Armament Research group, which found the chips in the drones. 
“Some of these drones that we have documented, like the Forpost, are now used in their armed version in the current conflict” in Ukraine, he said.
The report that prompted Marvell’s tracking work published late last year by the Conflict Armament Research also found chips in Russian drones from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI),  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and STMicroelectronics. 
Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics did not reply to Reuters for comment; NXP and Analog Devices said they comply with sanctions; Intel said it’s against its products being used for human rights violations; and Samsung (KS:005930) said it does not make chips for military purposes.
Military weapons such as drones, guided missiles, helicopters, fighter jets, vehicles and electronic warfare equipment all need chips and experts say they often use older chips that are well tested out. Now, under new U.S. sanctions even some of the most basic chips cannot be shipped to prohibited Russian entities. 
For the most sensitive chips, controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. company selling them can be held responsible if the chip ends up with an entity on the U.S. banned list, said Daniel Fisher-Owens, a specialist on chips and export control and at law firm Berliner Corcoran & Rowe.
    ‘LIKE THE DRUG BUSINESS’
    Figuring out where chips go is like tracking the flow of narcotics, experts say.
“It’s like the drug business,” said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There's cutouts. There's middlemen. There's money laundering … There's a black market distribution network.” 
The point of the Russian sanctions, Lewis said, isn’t to track every chip, but to disrupt their supply chain, which the intelligence community has been working on.
Finding a solution could take creative technical approaches.
""Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it,” and allows it to work, Eric Schmidt, the former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview, discussing high-end processors.
Marvell says it has a growing number of products supporting fingerprinting and tracing, and is working with industry partners and customers to advance this area. The Global Semiconductor Alliance has proposed its members work on building a “Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security” https://www.gsaglobal.org/iot/ties to tag and trace chips, said Tom Katsioulas, technology executive at the industry group.
That may be a lot harder to do for a $2 chip, without making it prohibitively expensive. The answer could be a matter of manufacturing process, regulation and, perhaps, will.

“Ironically, the technology to do this, all of the things that we've got in there, the blockchain, the IDs in the device, this has all been done before for other applications,” said Michael Ford an executive at Aegis Software who is working with the industry standards group IPC for better supply chain security. “All that is needed is that catalyst to make it happen.”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be that catalyst, he said.

(Reuters) -French catering and food services company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) lowered its annual revenue growth outlook on Friday citing the pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and the closure of COVID-19 testing centres it ran in the United Kingdom. 
The world's second-largest food catering services group behind Britain's Compass said it expected organic revenue growth to come in around the bottom of its previous forecast range of 15% to 18% for its 2022 financial year to Aug. 31.
Sodexo also said it had terminated its investments in Russia following the war in Ukraine and that contracts won last year and which should have started in the second half of 2022 would not materialise. 
The loss of revenue from the terminated contracts is estimated at 40 million euros ($44 million), Sodexo said.
Sodexo shares had slumped 8.5% to 67.56 euros by 0936 GMT. 
""Our business in Russia is small, but it was growing fast,"" Chief Financial Officer Marc Rolland told analysts on a call.
Sodexo, whose Russian activities represent less than 1% of its revenue, said last week it was ""closely monitoring the situation and examining various options"".
 Compass Group  (LON:CPG) said last week it had completed the disposal of its operations in Russia, after announcing earlier in March its decision to leave the Russian market permanently and to move away from all known Russian suppliers.
NEGOTIATIONS WITH FOOD SUPPLIERS
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, once known as the breadbasket of Europe, is also sending food and energy prices to record highs, clouding the outlook for the global economy as consumer finances come under pressure.
""We are very, very vigilant because the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine is causing a certain volatility in certain commodities, so it's something we are watching like a hawk,"" Rolland said in a call with reporters. 
Sodexo says it was negotiating and changing suppliers to deal with rising food prices.
""We are negotiating. We are changing suppliers,"" he said. ""The relationship with suppliers is built over a long period of time. It's not just we buy the cheapest now available on the market."" 
However, the company said it remained confident it could manage inflationary pressure on margins, with its business model allowing price rises to be passed on to clients progressively.
Sodexo also said contracts to operate COVID-19 testing centres in UK had ended on March 31, much earlier than expected. 

It posted half-year underlying operating profit of 538 million euros, ahead of analyst expectations for 530 million euros, and said it has seen a pick-up since the end of February.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) on Friday said it was on track to meet its 2022 profitability target and maintained its mid-term goals thanks to solid performance in the Americas and a recovery in Europe.
The lender reiterated its target of more than 13% for underlying return on tangible equity (ROTE) up from 12.73% in 2021 despite soaring energy prices felt predominantly in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Santander for 2022 also maintained its target of around 12% core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio, kept its dividend pay-out target at 40% and its cost-income ratio, a measure of efficiency, at 45% versus 46.2% at end-December.
Santander's diversification, especially in Latin America, has helped the bank cope with tough conditions for lenders in Europe since the financial crisis.
Its underlying profit in North America more than doubled in to a record 3.05 billion euros boosted by a more than a threefold increase in the United States, while in South America it rose by 24% to 3.33 billion euros. 
The two regions accounted for around 60% of the group's underlying profit in 2021, while Europe represented 28%. 
""In the first quarter of 2022, the commercial activity has remained strong with revenues in line with the last quarter and new lending returning to prepandemic levels, increasing by an estimated 8% year on year,"" Santander Chairman Ana Botin said in a statement ahead of the bank's general shareholders meeting.
Shares in Santander were up 2% to 3.16 euros at 0717 GMT, outpacing Spain's leading blue-chip index Ibex-35 which was up 0.4%.
Santander helped by lower loan loss provisions booked a net profit of 2.28 billion in the October to December quarter, up 4.6% from the third quarter. 
It reported a net profit of 8.12 billion euros in 2021 after losing 8.77 billion euros in 2020.
Santander does not have a presence in Russia or Ukraine, limiting its direct exposure to 80 million euros, though the conflict could have an indirect impact, especially through high energy prices for some of its customers.
Santander said that Botin would reassure shareholders that in the medium term, the bank aimed to achieve an underlying return on tangible equity and cost-to-income ratio of around 15% and 40%, respectively, and maintain a capital ratio of 12%.
The bank's shareholders on Friday are expected to approve a final cash dividend of 5.15 euro cents per share, on top of an already paid 4.85 euro cents per share.

With a shares buyback of 841 million euros and an additional buyback of 865 million euros being implemented, the capital distributed against 2021 results would be 3.4 billion euros.
Shareholders will also be asked to approve a reduction of the group's outstanding share capital of up to 10% by cancelling shares it may acquire, including under potential repurchase programmes in the future.

Investing.com – Sodexo (PA:EXHO) stock plummeted 9% in Paris trading Friday after the company said revenue growth in the ongoing year will be around the bottom of its previously forecast range of 15-18%.
The company blamed the coronavirus pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and closure of COVID-19 testing centers in the U.K. for its moderation.
Chief Executive Sophie Bellon said, “several mobilizations in Russia will not happen” due to the war. The conflict has also sent food prices soaring, creating another challenge for Sodexo.

“We are confident that we can manage the year end inflationary pressure on margins. Currencies should give us a nice tailwind...” Rolland said in a statement.
For the first half ended February 28, the group clocked revenue of 10.26 billion euros ($11.35 billion), more than 19% higher. Underlying operating profit was 538 million euros. The company said it has seen a pickup since the end of February after the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants had slowed recovery in the second quarter."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects took major steps toward launching this week as Russia's threats to cut energy supplies to Europe drives up demand and prices for the super-chilled fuel. 
Developers  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) and New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) Inc advanced agreements on separate projects, one of which could be producing LNG within 12 months. These plants typically requires long-term contracts for about 85% of output to kick off, and take years to complete.
But growing demand among customers, especially in Europe, was behind New Fortress Energy's decision to invest its own money to build a 2.8 million tonne per annum (MTPA) plant off the coast of Louisiana.
“There was already a significant supply demand imbalance for natural gas in the world,"" said Wes Edens, chief executive of New Fortress Energy. ""With the urgency for Europe to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, it is vitally important to fast track LNG production in the United States.” 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding foreign buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles from Friday or else have their supplies cut, a move European capitals rejected and which Germany said amounted to ""blackmail"".
Last week, the Biden administration said the U.S. will aim to supply European buyers this year with an additional 15 billion cubic meters (bcm) of LNG, and 50 bcm by 2030 to replace Russian gas imports as the West seeks to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
RISKS DIMINISHING
Last year, about a dozen LNG developers said they aimed to reach final investment decisions on their projects. But only Sempra's Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal in Baja California, Mexico, started construction in the last two years. 
Sempra on Thursday reached a preliminary agreement to supply France's TotalEnergies with gas from a second, Mexican project, Vista Pacifico LNG. TotalEnergies would acquire a 16.6% stake and take about one-third of the 4 MTPA plant's export production, under the deal.

LNG price forecasts are strong enough that the risks are worth taking if a plant can begin operation in the next couple of years, said Alex Munton, an LNG analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. 
""We continue to see a tremendous amount of interest in our LNG development projects,"" said Paty Ortega Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sempra.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 06:01AM ET</span>",Massive S&P options trade may have roiled U.S. stocks on Thursday,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Traders are pointing to a massive quarterly options trade on Thursday they said was from a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fund as one reason why the stock market took a nosedive late in the day, as options flows linked to the trade exacerbated market weakness.
The S&P 500 Index fell 1.2% in the last hour of trading on Thursday, marking the largest hourly drop for the index in more than three weeks. It finished the day down 1.56%, with some attributing part of the weakness to the large options trade that went down earlier in the day.
""I think that trade exacerbated volatility,"" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, noting that this was out of the ordinary since the quarterly hedging activity typically does not move markets much.
The way the trade is structured means when the market starts to fall, options dealers - typically big financial institutions who facilitate trading but seek to remain market neutral - would have been forced to sell an increasing number of stock futures, thereby aggravating the selloff, SpotGamma's Kochuba said.
Markets have had a rollercoaster quarter due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, volatile commodities prices and the U.S. Federal Reserve starting to hike interest rates. It was unclear what caused the initial late-afternoon market weakness on Thursday that triggered the cascade of stock futures selling.
The trade, which took place shortly before 11:00 am, was a large collar options trade, involving the sale of about 44,000 June calls and the purchase of an identical number of June put spreads, that would pay up if the S&P 500 were to decline more than 5% from its current level. A collar is an options hedging strategy involving a combination of puts and calls.
The trade also involved the sale of about 24,800 calls linked to the 4,300 level on the S&P 500, set to expire at the end of Thursday's session, as a way to guard against any sharp moves in the market during the trading session.
Traders pointed to the $19 billion JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund as being behind the moves. The fund, which holds a basket of S&P 500 stocks along with options on the benchmark index and resets hedges once a quarter. As the fund is so large, traders know and anticipate its patterns.
Kochuba said that based on past trading patterns and details of investment strategies laid out in the fund's prospectus, the trade was initiated by the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments, also said the trades had the hallmark of the JPMorgan fund's hedging program. 
Asked about the trades, Kristen Chambers, a spokesperson for JP Morgan Asset Management, confirmed that the fund has a scheduled quarterly hedging program but did not confirm the exact details of the trade.
Systematic traders, often hedge funds, take a rules-based approach in their investments and are often driven by fixed quarterly schedules rather than strong investment themes.
As such, other investors don't try to glean signals from their choices of options strike prices and expiration dates, as they would with a trade by a discretionary investor.

""This is a systematic trade that we see at the end of every quarter,"" Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, said.
Thursday's trade, worth about $20 billion in notional terms - based on the index level - replaces a similar position opened at the end of last quarter, according to Trade Alert data.

The transaction, which was announced in November, allows the Italian bank to complete its exit from Turkey's third-biggest lender, UniCredit said without disclosing financial terms of the deal.
The closing of the transaction is expected to improve UniCredit's CET1 capital ratio by mid to high single-digit percentage points in the second quarter of 2022, the bank said.
UniCredit had said in November that it expected its best-quality capital to gain a low to mid single-digit uplift, adding that it would receive 300 million euros ($332 million) from the sale.
Koc Holding and UniCredit agreed in 2019 to unwind the joint venture through which they jointly controlled Yapi with a near 82% overall stake. 

The move handed UniCredit a direct 31.9% stake, of which 12% was sold in February 2020.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Stocks of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) traded 1% and 0.6% higher, respectively, in Friday’s premarket, shrugging off decisions by the companies to halt production at their Michigan factories.
Ford will suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage.
GM is canceling production at its Lansing Grand River Assembly. The company said the production halt is not related to chips. It provided no other specifics. The plant makes Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5, and Chevrolet Camaro, GM said.
Chips shortage had forced Ford to halt output at its Kansas City Assembly Plant last month, forcing the company to warn vehicle volumes in the current quarter will decline.
According to a previous GM communication, Monday onward, the company will halt production for two weeks at its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana due to a shortage of semiconductor chips. The unit makes the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickup trucks, according to Reuters.
Shortage of parts, particularly semiconductor chips, has been the bane of most automakers for more than a year as capacities have competed to meet demand from end-users like makers of mobiles, laptops, cars, cameras, washing machines, among other gadgets.
The pandemic-induced lockdowns have played havoc with production schedules at factories in Asia, mostly China, Vietnam, and South East Asia. Shortage of labor and congested ports have all added to delays in deliveries."

Responses to the survey, conducted with 167 companies operating throughout China including 76 in manufacturing, found 82% of manufacturers reported slowed or reduced production due to a lack of employees, inability to obtain supplies, or government-ordered lockdowns.
More than half, or 54%, have cut 2022 revenue projections following the outbreak, though 38% said it was too early to estimate the impact. 
Some manufacturers in Shanghai, particularly in the automotive industry, have resorted to operating with a ""closed-loop"", wherein employees remain confined to the premises in order to keep production lines running, while outside suppliers are sealed off. [L2N2VW0U0[
Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that the such arrangements are acceptable for a few days but ""not sustainable"" long term.
""Even if your employees are within the factory bubble, your trucks have to come and go sending inputs and outputs, but that's not possible,"" said Zheng.
""I hope this is only a temporary, drastic measure to stop the spread.""
Shanghai has been battling its largest outbreak for nearly a month and this week most of the city of 26 million people was put under lockdown as cases continued to surge. 
Authorities have implemented the lockdown in two phases, first targeting the eastern part of the city, followed by the west.
AmCham said that only half of the respondents were satisfied with China's pandemic efforts, and 77% had expressed dissatisfaction with the length of quarantines. 

A growing number of local companies have also disclosed how the Shanghai lockdown is weighing on them, ranging from suspended operations and stagnant sales, to drying liquidity and delayed financial disclosures. Shanghai-based power transmission equipment maker Sieyuan Electric Co said the pandemic has disrupted operations, logistics and raw material supplies, impacting its first quarter and full-year performance. 
East Money Information Co said it was highly uncertain if its annual shareholder meeting can be held at its Shanghai headquarters on April 8, and is suggesting shareholders participate online. Shanghai Shizhong Intelligent Parking Corp said the lockdown has forced it to halt parking services, directly hitting performance.

Announced in December 2020, the alliance is ""a unique opportunity"" for Worldline to expand its merchant acquiring business outside of Europe, it said in a statement.
Merchant acquiring involves collecting card-based payments which have been accepted by retailers.
Worldline reported at the time that the enterprise value of the business amounted to 925 million Australian dollars ($691 million).
Headquartered in Melbourne, ANZ's commercial acquiring unit is the third largest payment acceptance and acquiring business in Australia, with a share of about 20% of transaction volumes processed.
The Australian market offers an attractive growth opportunity driven by the shift from cash to card, Worldline said, pointing to a high level of electronic payments adoption and consumer use of contactless cards and digital wallets.
Over the next five years, Worldline expects the joint-venture to generate additional annual revenue of around 180 million euros ($199 million) and an operating margin of about 20% before depreciation and amortisation at closing.

By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%.
European equities are trying to rebound Friday after the region’s stock markets suffered their biggest quarterly loss since the start of 2020, with the Russian-Ukrainian war and the associated surge in commodity prices raising concerns of a recession.
Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday, but previous talks have achieved very little and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Thursday of ""battles ahead"" in Donbas and the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow would continue supplying gas to Europe, easing fears that he would order a halt of supplies unless Western governments paid in rubles, something they have refused to do.
Russia supplies about a third of Europe's gas, so the removal of this would likely result in a full-blown energy crisis.

""We will hopefully be able to communicate our intention to enter into Formula One then,"" one of the sources said, with the second adding there was a ""good chance"" of a positive decision.
Volkswagen declined to comment. The news was first reported by Business Insider.
There has long been talk of Audi and Porsche forming partnerships with existing Formula One teams, their most likely method of entry into the highest class of international racing.
Audi and McLaren denied reports last year that a partnership between the two brands had already been formed.
Audi will offer around 500 million euros ($556.30 million) for McLaren, one source said, while Porsche intends to establish a long-term partnership with racing team Red Bull starting in several years' time.
Volkswagen has not previously been involved in Formula One but has worked with Red Bull, notably in the world rally championship.
McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown told Reuters the Formula One team was ""definitely not for sale"" and not looking for further equity partners.
McLaren use Mercedes engines but that could change when the sport introduces a new power unit in 2026. 
Brown said there had been some ""very preliminary"" conversations with VW in the past but nothing agreed.
""If they decide (to come in) then there's a conversation to be had but at this point we don't want to have any conversations until we know someone is committed to the sport,"" he added. 
A source told Reuters in November that Volkswagen's ultimate decision will rest on whether Formula One follows through on its plans to switch to synthetic fuels by 2026 and on McLaren's progress regarding electrification of its vehicles.
Volkswagen has invested the most of any global carmaker by far in electric vehicle production and batteries in an attempt to clean up its image from the Dieselgate emissions scandal and remain in line with governmental carbon reduction targets.
The decision comes as Volkswagen grapples with uncertainty over the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on its finances, which will also be discussed at next Thursday's meeting. 

Russia calls its actions a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it says are dangerous nationalists.

U.S. stocks bounced nearly 9% since mid-March, cutting their year-to-date losses to less than 5% by March 31 and bringing them to within striking distance of a record high struck in early January.
BoFA strategists said recession risks will ""jump"" in the coming months as a bull era of central bank excess, Wall Street inflation and globalization is ending, and a bear era of government intervention, social and political polarization, Main Street inflation & geopolitical isolationism is starting.

Portfolios should position for stagflation and dollar debasement, with the energy sector becoming a long-term buy and tech becoming a long-term sell, the U.S. investment bank said in a weekly note. Long-term U.S. yields are headed above 4% by 2024.
In terms of notable weekly flows, BoFA said bonds saw the first inflow in 12 weeks while emerging market equities saw the biggest inflow in seven weeks. The analysis was based on EPFR data.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers at a warehouse in New York City's Staten Island have so far voted 57% in favor of unionizing with a final tally due on Friday, a potential landmark victory for organized labor at the second-largest U.S. private employer.
But that win contrasted with 53% of Amazon workers in Alabama rejecting unionization, in a still-not final outcome. 
The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result, said the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which is overseeing the election. The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionizing.
If final results show either location voted for a union, it would be a historic first for the retailing giant in the United States and a milestone for labor advocates, who for years have considered Amazon's labor practices a threat to workers.
In fierce campaigns, Amazon has warned about unions in notices in bathroom stalls and held mandatory meetings telling workers that labor groups could force them to strike. It has raised pay and offered bigger signing bonuses in a labor shortage, appealing to staff who have worried organizing means perpetual strife.
At the same time, union drives have picked up momentum. Nine U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores have voted to organize, with more than 150 more seeking elections. Amazon workers responded to more in-person outreach by labor activists as the pandemic subsided, and a second company warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote on whether to unionize starting on April 25.
With nearly 2,700 ballots counted from workers at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, about 57% of votes were in favor of a union, according to a Reuters tally of the count overseen by the NLRB and streamed over Zoom. The count will resume on Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT).
Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee spearheading the New York union effort, said, ""To get to this point, it's already history."" His group is called the Amazon Labor Union.
A union win in New York ""would be a triumph for unconventional organizing campaigns,"" said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. Smalls' group made great use of social media during the campaign and diverged from a typical labor playbook, he said.
'CONTINUE TO FIGHT' 
For Bessemer, Alabama, the tally of roughly 1,900 valid ballots concluded on Thursday, but the outcome is far from certain. The NLRB said it will hold a hearing in the next few weeks to determine if any of the 416 challenged ballots should be opened and counted.
Eli Morrison, a 42-year-old Amazon worker who lives in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said he voted against unionizing and was pleased to see the union trailing. He said he appreciates the flexibility Amazon gives him to pick up extra shifts, a benefit he fears he would lose if workers unionized.
""I come in, I bust ass every day, I get stuff done,"" said Morrison, who previously held a union job at a grocery store. ""I wouldn’t get to do that if there was a union. It would be whoever’s been there the longest and whoever’s been there longest doesn’t mean that they’ve done the best.""
Jennifer Bates, an early backer of the Alabama union campaign, said, ""The election is not over until every ballot is counted that’s eligible, and we'll continue to fight.""
The labor group organizing the effort plans to file objections to Amazon's conduct around the election as well, said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).
Objections previously filed by the RWDSU led to a determination by the NLRB that Amazon had improperly interfered in the original contest in Bessemer, prompting the board to set aside the results and call for this year's re-run.
Amazon did not immediately comment on the RWDSU's plans to object or on the vote counts Thursday. The company has said it wants its employees' voices to be heard and that it is focused on continuing to make Amazon a great place to work.

Regarding communications with Amazon staff during the contests, the company has said it was important for workers to know what a union would mean for their day-to-day employment.
A simple majority of votes cast is needed to win. Neither the New York union nor labor board has said how many ballots were received in Staten Island.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's COVID-19 curbs are disrupting the supply of fertiliser to the country's northeastern bread basket just a month away from spring planting, threatening this year's corn and soybean crops if not resolved soon.
Farmers typically have fertiliser prepared in early April before applying to fields later in the month during planting. But China's worst outbreak of COVID since the pandemic began two years ago have triggered strict controls on movement of people and goods, sharply slowing deliveries.
Fertiliser producers, dealers, analysts and associations said rules requiring truck drivers to take COVID tests every 24 hours, a need to obtain special passes to deliver goods and factory suspensions due to local COVID cases are all contributing to tight supplies. 
""Production of nitrogen fertiliser and fertiliser preparation for spring planting has been greatly affected,"" the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association said this week.
Jilin, China's second-largest corn-growing province, is among the hardest hit after the local government banned movement of people across the provincial border, and within, from Mar. 14 as COVID cases hit thousands daily.
""Fertiliser supply here couldn't be tighter,"" said a Jilin-based dealer surnamed Yan, who is short more than 2,000 tonnes of the critical crop nutrient for his customers.
The bottleneck comes on top of record fertiliser prices, driven up by strong global demand, high energy costs and sanctions on major producers Russia and Belarus.
Despite efforts by Beijing to cool prices, China's wholesale fertiliser index (CFCI) is 40% higher than a year ago.
That had discouraged many dealers from building stocks in recent months, catching them short in their busiest sales period.
Yao, a dealer in Liaoning, said he's short about a third of his needs.
The transport curbs are especially problematic for the northeast, which does not have enough local fertiliser production and relies on deliveries from other provinces.
The northeast's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces and Inner Mongolia region produce more than 40% of China's corn and half its soybeans. 
Prices of cornand soybeans are hovering at record highs. 
Top fertiliser producer Sinofert Holdings still had about 80,000-100,000 tonnes of product waiting to be shipped, executive director Ma Yue told reporters on an earnings call last week, even after getting about 1,000 ""green passes"" for trucks.
The special passes to deliver critical goods take time to process and must be renewed daily. It has also become increasingly difficult to find drivers willing to work under the restrictions, dealers said. 

The challenges come even as Beijing repeatedly calls for all-out efforts to guarantee successful harvests amid global food security concerns.
Fertiliser had reached 68.8% of Jilin's farming households by Wednesday, despite the challenges, government paper the Jilin Daily reported, adding that the supply of farm materials was ""orderly and stable"".

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia deal volume tumbled in the first quarter and dealmakers do not expect a near-term rebound as the Russia-Ukraine war, higher interest rates and economic uncertainty hurt business sentiment.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and equity capital market activity declined sharply in the region over January-March, according to Refinitiv data, with Chinese stocks among the biggest losers in Asia.
M&A involving companies in Asia Pacific and Japan fell to $233 billion in the quarter, down 25% from a year earlier and nearly halving from the final quarter of 2021, the data shows.
This follows record high global M&A deals in 2021 amid easy availability of cheap financing and sky-high valuations as U.S. stocks saw their best three-year run in more than two decades. 
""Deal flow in M&A is fundamentally driven by the confidence boards have around the outlook for businesses and the macro developments in the world,"" said Rohit Chatterji, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s co-head of M&A, Asia-Pacific.
The Russia-Ukraine crisis, soaring commodity prices, inflation as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty over the rate hike path adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve are stalling deals, analysts and bankers said.
""The buyers are saying 'let's revisit whether the pricing we had in mind is still valid in markets like these' and the sellers are like 'do we really want to sell unless we get the prices we want,'"" said Chatterji.
Australia's Macquarie Asset Management and British Columbia Investment Management Corp's deal to buy a 60% stake in  National Grid  (LON:NG)'s British gas transmission and metering business for an enterprise value of about $12.7 billion was the biggest transaction involving Asia Pacific firms this year.
And Sweden-based buyout fund EQT (NYSE:EQT)'s move to snap up Baring Private Equity Asia in a deal worth $7.5 billion was the second-biggest deal, the data showed.
""The longer deals stay dislocated, the more financial sponsors may get the opportunity to come into deals,"" Chatterji said.
Dealmakers said stability in equity markets would be a prerequisite for a revival in deals but they expect little improvement in the short term.
HONG KONG IPOS NOSEDIVE
Equity capital market activity in Asia, including Japan, fell 54% to $56.5 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, and slumped 64% from the final quarter of 2021, Refinitiv data showed.
Initial public offering activity fell 35% on the year, with Hong Kong suffering the biggest drop - from a value of $11.05 billion in the first quarter of 2021 to just $837 million.
The city slid from being the world's No.2 IPO market behind the Nasdaq to eighth this quarter from a year earlier.
South Korea's $11 billion listing of battery maker LG Energy Solution in January made Seoul the world's top listing venue in the first quarter.
Some bankers said China could see an improvement.
""A lot of the world economies still depend on China. If it is in a relatively non-tightening mode versus the U.S., which is in a 5 to 7 times rate hike cycle, this is where we think it could be beneficial for China,"" said Selina Cheung, UBS's co-head of equity capital markets for Asia.

""I would think that if relative monetary easing impacts how corporate earnings do in the first half, we should see good data start to come out in August. If and when that happens, I think there's a shot at the market reopening and investors having renewed confidence,"" she said.
Investors are also watching the effect of rising COVID cases in China as Shanghai, its most populous city and home to some 26 million people, entered the third day of a lockdown on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Investors sent Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shares sharply higher on Friday as they bet the Japanese conglomerate could become the target of a bidding war after Bain Capital sounded out shareholders about a possible buyout.
The stock jumped 6.7% in morning Tokyo trade on expectations that global private equity firms could be lining up to take the embattled company private.
Its top shareholder, Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, said in a filing on Thursday that it had agreed to sell its 9.9% stake to Bain if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer.
Bain has sounded out multiple other Toshiba shareholders about teaming up as it prepares to make a buyout offer, sources told Reuters. Effissimo is the only shareholder to publicly pledge to tender its stocks to Bain.
Other global private equity firms are also interested in taking Toshiba private, different sources said. The agreement between Bain and Effissimo would not deter them from making buyout offers, they said.
The drama over the fate of 146-year-old Toshiba follows its November announcement that it planned to split into three companies in an attempt to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of financial and governance scandals. 
During a five-month review leading to that plan, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers. It cited various reasons including possible conflicts with Japan's national security law and potential opposition from antitrust regulators. 
One global private equity firm sounded out Toshiba management about a potential buyout in January, saying that it could make a proposal if the company is interested, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks were private.
Japanese industry minister Koichi Hagiuda said on Friday Toshiba owns national security technologies such as nuclear power and semiconductors and that it is important to ensure such businesses are kept and grow.
""We'll closely monitor the situation from this perspective,"" Hagiuda told a regular news conference.

Toshiba said in a statement on Friday that it had not engaged in any discussions with Bain or Effissimo on their agreement.
Bain said late on Thursday that nothing had been decided about a tender offer and that there were many issues that needed to be resolved to launch a bid to take Toshiba private.

An inversion of the two-year, 10-year part of the curve is viewed by many as a signal a recession is likely to follow in one to two years.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks mixed on Friday morning, attempting to turn a new leaf after their worst quarter since the COVID-19 bear market. Investors continue to weigh the risks from tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy and the war in Ukraine.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.34% by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.41%. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for March was 48.1, with National Bureau of Statistics data from the day before showing that the manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.76%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.43%, with data showing the Tankan Large Manufacturers Index at 14, and the Tankan Large Non-Manufacturers Index at 9, for the first quarter of 2022.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.55%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.16%, with March’s Australian Industry Group manufacturing index at 55.7 and the manufacturing PMI at 57.7.
China’s worst COVID-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic prompted the city of Shanghai to extend a lockdown and a retreat in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks is also dampening sentiment.
The U.S.' plan to release around a million barrels a day from the strategic petroleum reserve is also keeping oil prices down. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has disrupted commodity supplies, ramping up prices for fuel and food. Russia will aim to keep supplying gas to European customers even as it demands they shift to payment in Russian rubles.
Ukraine and Russia will resume peace talks on Friday. The Russian government is also staying on top of its debt obligations so far, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. processing a nearly $447 million payment for dollar debt due in 2030 on Thursday. The next payment deadline is April 4.
U.S. Treasuries fell, with the curve between two-year and 10-year yields remaining close to inverting. Combined with the Fed’s hawkish approach, concerns about an economic downturn are increasing.
Investors are still weighing the impact of the war in Ukraine, Russia's isolation, and the Fed’s tighter monetary policy on market volatility and further losses for stocks and bonds within the year. Raw materials are the only key asset class that has recorded major gains in 2022 to date.
Downgraded growth outlooks in the U.S., Europe, and China are “something to watch very carefully,” Columbia Threadneedle Investments head of multi-asset strategy Anwiti Bahuguna told Bloomberg. “There are very few places to hide these days in the multi-asset space,” though commodities are a good spot because of inflation and geopolitics, she added.
Thursday’s U.S. data also showed that February’s personal consumption expenditures price index grew 6.4% year-on-year, the most since 1982, and grew 0.6% month-on-month. The latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day."

1220,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 09:27PM ET</span>",At Least 33 Hong Kong Firms Halted After Earnings Deadline,"(Bloomberg) -- Trading in at least 33 Hong Kong-listed stocks was halted on Friday after a number of firms missed a deadline to report annual results, adding uncertainty to a market grappling with a bleak economic outlook and regulatory headwinds.
Embattled Chinese developers, including Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd., were among the stocks to be suspended from Friday. China Aoyuan Group Ltd. said publishing unaudited results at this stage could “potentially be misleading to the shareholders and potential investors.” This year’s number compares with more than 50 for 2021 and at least nine for 2020.
The barrage of trading halts comes at a bad time for the city’s equity market. China’s repeated vows to stabilize markets have failed to restore investors’ confidence, keeping the Hang Seng Index down 6% this year. Regulatory risks still hang heavy and lockdowns in China are weighing on the earnings outlook. 
This earnings season had been expected to be the worst in a decade for Chinese developers beset by a credit crunch, and failure for the firms to come clean on time - as well as a slew of auditor resignations - will only worsen sentiment. Uncertainties over financial transparency may also bring further credit rating downgrades. 
“It is an open secret that auditors adopt very strict requirements for Chinese developers’ audit work this year due to the sector’s liquidity issues and default problems,” said Raymond Cheng, head of China/Hong Kong research at CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd. Still, the earnings delays “could hurt improving market sentiment from supportive policy.” 
Trading suspensions in Hong Kong can take place due to various reasons. In terms of earnings, a company’s shares will be halted if it doesn’t release audited results three months after the fiscal year ends, according to exchange rules. However, due to Covid-related delays, firms have been allowed to submit unaudited figures by March 31 and file the audited version by April 30 to avoid suspension. 
At least 138 firms had previously said they would postpone the release of their audited 2021 results past the March 31 deadline. The exchange had 2,570 listed companies as of end-March.  
Credit Downgrades 
Audit problems were a “key driver” for recent downgrades of Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Ronshine China Holdings Ltd., Fitch Ratings Inc. said this week.   
Potential credit rating cuts following the earnings delays are likely to trigger requests for early debt payments, and “add to their default risks,” said Dean Xiao, flow credit high yield desk analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd.
A prolonged trading halt increases the risk of wild stock moves upon resumption. Among last year’s cases, China Huarong Asset Management Co., which was halted for nine months, sank 50% when trading resumed. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. surged 82% after a seven-month halt.  
Companies could also be booted from MSCI Inc.’s stock indexes within three trading days if their suspensions last for more than 50 consecutive days, according to the index compiler. Such a decision could impact hundreds of billion dollars of passive funds that track related MSCI benchmarks. Huarong was removed from the gauges in June last year.

Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's fees and payment rules for app makers were anti-competitive. It appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
""Apple's process for review and approval of apps available on the App Store enhances safety and security, and provides those apps greater legitimacy in the eyes of users,"" Roblox said in a legal filing on Thursday. 
Roblox had played a prominent role in the original trial last year. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing key revelations from the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games, in which the ""Fortnite"" maker had argued that Apple had given a free pass to Roblox, whose app lets people pick from a selection of games to play.
An Apple senior director described Roblox's offering as ""experiences"". Soon after, Roblox changed descriptions on its website to ""experiences"" from ""games"" and called itself a metaverse company. 

Apple has said its rules promote several benefits for consumers, including increased security and privacy. Two former Central Intelligence Agency directors and 21 other former U.S. national security officials advanced that argument in Apple's support on Thursday. 
The appeal hearing is expected next year.

(Reuters) -Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Thursday signed into law a minimum pay standard for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers, making Washington the first U.S. state to implement earnings standards for ride-hail companies.
Drivers across the Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) state will earn a minimum of $1.17 per mile and 34 cents per minute with a minimum pay of $3.00 per trip.
Under the new law, drivers will also have access to paid sick time, family medical leave and long-term care programs, and be eligible for workers' compensation, a U.S. government-mandated program that provides benefits to workers who become injured or ill on the job. Drivers will also be able to appeal should they be removed from the apps. 
In Seattle, which passed its own ride-hail pay standard in September 2020, drivers will continue to earn minimum rates of $1.38 per mile and 59 cents per minute at a minimum of $5.17 per trip. 
The law, which has been supported by Uber and Lyft, takes away local regulatory power, banning cities and counties from implementing additional requirements for companies. 
The law also states that ride-hail drivers are not employees, a contentious issue between some labor groups and gig economy companies including Uber and Lyft. The gig companies, whose workers operate as independent contractors, oppose any reclassification while some labor groups argue drivers should be employees with access to greater benefits.
""This new law decisively gives drivers what they want - to stay independent while gaining historic new benefits and protections,"" Uber's head of public policy in the Western U.S., Ramona Prieto, said in a statement. She said Uber hoped the law could be replicated in other cities, states and countries.
""Drivers achieved this win because labor organizations, legislators, and app-based companies listened to them, and then worked together to drive a historic bill that works for them,"" Lyft's head of government relations, Jen Hensley, said in a statement.

The new Washington law was supported by the Teamsters union Local 117, which was also behind the push for the Seattle pay standard.
Before this law, in the United States only Seattle and New York City had implemented minimum pay standards for ride-hail drivers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stocks dropped on Thursday with U.S. shares sinking over 1.5%, as concerns about a recession and the Russian-Ukranian war spurred selling, while oil prices plunged over $6 as Washington launched a record release from its emergency oil reserves.
The declines pushed U.S. and European stocks into their biggest quarterly loss since the start of 2020, when the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic sent the global economy into a tailspin.
Quarter-end portfolio rebalancing boosted demand for bonds and held down yields, though a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve hovered near inversion, after inverting briefly on Tuesday. Many view an inverted yield curve, in which short-term Treasuries yield more than longer-term debt, as a harbinger of a recession. [US/]
""An inverted Treasury yield curve is one signal that future U.S. equity returns will be disappointing,"" said Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research.
""Can we escape the fate of low or negative returns in 2022 if 10-year Treasury yields drop below two-years? Possibly, but not if geopolitical risks and their effect on oil prices continue or grow.""
A spurt of selling late in the day drove the S&P 500 down 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also skidded 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Europe's STOXX 600 had closed down 0.94%.
Thursday's stock market gloom was emblematic of how tough March has been for equities. Even after a rally in the past week when investors celebrated signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, the S&P 500 is still down 5% in the first three months, its worst quarterly performance in 2 years.
Europe's STOXX 600 fared worse, losing 6.5% in the first quarter, also its biggest quarterly drop since the start of 2020.
The MSCI World Equity index, which dropped 1.3% on Thursday, also had its worst quarter in two years, tumbling 5.7%.
""Risk assets remain vulnerable,"" analysts at Australia's ANZ Bank said. ""As the U.S. earnings season gets under way from around 11 April, many analysts are expecting a wave of earnings downgrades.""
GROWTH CONCERNS 
After a relief rally earlier in the week, optimism about a settlement between Russia and Ukraine has petered out as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said no quick resolution is expected and the country is preparing for new Russian attacks.
In Europe, inflation data showed record-high price rises in France in March and a 7% year-on-year rise in Italy, following elevated readings from Germany and Spain a day earlier.
Surging price pressures in many major economies have sealed expectations that central banks will raise interest rates. Investors worry that aggressive tightening in the United States and other countries will bring on recessions.
While European government bond yields were down on the day, the German 10-year yield was set for its biggest monthly rise since 2009.
In keeping with the recent surge in yields, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen by the most in a year this quarter, despite retreating to 2.343% on Thursday.
Oil prices nursed deep losses following news that the United States is releasing up to 180 million barrels from its strategic petroleum reserve, part of a move to lower fuel prices.
U.S. crude fell 5.4% to $107.29 per barrel and Brent was at $100.74, down 6.6% on the day.
Oil prices had surged since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and the United States and allies responded with hefty sanctions on Russia, the second-largest exporter of crude.
The euro was down 0.82% at $1.1066, having been boosted earlier in the week by hopes for peace in Ukraine.
The dollar was little changed against the yen, at 121.675. The yen has stabilised after Monday when it fell to its lowest since 2015 on news the Bank of Japan will buy an unlimited amount of 10-year government bonds for four days this week to keep yields low. 
Rising U.S. yields have lifted Japanese yields even though inflation in Japan is below the central bank's target. 

Gold rose 0.2% to $1,937.45 an ounce, notching its biggest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2020.
In keeping with softer investor risk appetites, Bitcoin fell 2.8% to $45,771.20.

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will each halt production next week at a Michigan plant due to parts shortages, the two companies said separately on Thursday.
No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford said it would suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage. 
GM said that because of a temporary part shortage it would cancel production next week at Lansing Grand River assembly, where it builds the Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5 and Chevrolet Camaro. GM said the production halt was not related to chips but provided no other specifics.
The auto industry is grappling with a global chip shortage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing companies to cut production, although high car prices have partially offset the financial impact.
Ford warned last month that the chip shortage would lead to a decline in vehicle volumes in the current quarter. Last month, Ford halted production at its Kansas city assembly plant that makes F-150 pickup vehicles for a week due to the chip shortage.

Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said that production at its other North American plants will continue as normal.
GM last week said it would halt production for two weeks at an assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that builds the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickup trucks, beginning April 4, over the semiconductor chip shortage.

The move comes after retail investor interest in so-called 'meme stocks' flared up in the last two weeks, leading to a doubling in GameStop's share price to $166.58. A stock split makes shares more affordable for individual investors by lowering the price, without affecting the company's valuation.
Some investors are betting that the stock split will boost the value of GameStop by attracting more meme-stock enthusiasts. The firm's shares jumped 19% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company announced the move. 
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have recently announced upcoming share splits. 
On Monday, Tesla Inc's market capitalisation jumped by more than $80 billion after the electric car maker said it would seek investor approval to once again increase the number of its shares to enable a future stock split, without saying when that split might occur.
This month's stock market recovery, driven by hopes of a resolution in Russia's conflict with Ukraine, has boosted the investors' risk appetite, making conditions for meme-stock rallies more favorable.
Meme stocks are heavily shorted shares that are snapped up by retail investors on social media platforms such as Reddit with the aim of squeezing out hedge funds betting against them. The trend took Wall Street by storm in January 2021 and slowly fizzled over the course of the year.
GameStop plans to increase its number of outstanding Class A common shares to 1 billion from 300 million, it said in a filing. The company will also ask shareholders to vote on a incentive plan ""to support future compensatory equity issuances"", it added. (https:// The date and location of the company's annual shareholders meeting have not yet been announced. Billionaire Ryan Cohen, who is the chairman of GameStop's board, disclosed earlier this month that his investment company purchased 100,000 shares of the game retailer. The purchase took Cohen's total ownership of GameStop to 11.9%. Cohen's effort to turn GameStop around after he joined the company last year by investing in its stores and e-commerce business and bringing in new talent have yet to produce major results.  
The company earlier this month reported a net loss of $147.5 million for the three months ending January, the first holiday-season loss in its history. The retailer has been trying to win back gamers who now turn to online streaming or other outlets. GameStop's cash balance may erode ""relatively quickly"" unless the company becomes profitable soon, Wedbush analysts warned earlier this month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oreo cookie maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) said its plant in Trostyanets, a town in eastern Ukraine, has suffered ""significant damage"" because of military action due to the war.
The company added that to the best of its knowledge, no employees were injured in the attack. The Oreo plant - one of at least two Mondelez factories in Ukraine, according to Mondelez employees - was closed as soon as the war began, Mondelez said in an emailed statement. Russia invaded Ukraine over a month ago in what it calls a ""special operation"". 
The United States assessed this week that Ukrainian forces have taken back Trostyanets from Russia.
Mondelez, which makes Milka chocolate and other locally-branded biscuits in Europe, said telecommunications outages in the Trostyanets area have made it challenging to reach all of its employees. The company is also working with Ukrainian authorities to resupply water and power to the area and is donating wheat and sugar to local non-governmental organizations.
It is too soon to tell what the next steps will be for the plant, Mondelez said.

Facing pressure to leave Russia in March, the Chicago-based snack manufacturer said it would scale back ""non-essential activities"" there while helping maintain food supply. CEO Dirk Van de Put condemned the aggression and called for an end to the war in a memo on the company's website.
The company has faced criticism for continuing to operate in Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The high cost of insulin to treat diabetes would be drastically reduced under legislation the U.S. House of Representatives passed on Thursday, in a rare example of drug price reform gaining traction in Congress.
By a vote of 232-193, with few Republicans supporting the measure, the House approved the bill that would cap patients' out-of-pocket costs at $35 a month for their insulin.
Currently, monthly supplies of the life-sustaining medicine average around $375 and can go as high as $1,000, causing some people to skip needed doses.
""No one should have to ration their insulin to help reduce costs and risk their health and in some cases actually cost them their lives,"" said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, who chairs a committee that oversees health policy, during House debate.
The legislation would still have to be considered by the Senate, which is crafting a much broader bill.
The Democratic-led effort, if successful, could have far wider ramifications for lowering prescription drug costs - a goal supported by Americans in the run-up to the Nov. 8 congressional elections, according to public opinion polls.
""It is for us a step in the direction of the secretary (of Health and Human Services) being able to negotiate drug prices beyond insulin,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday.
Three companies,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), have long dominated the U.S. insulin market. The trio own some 90% of the market for insulin, which was invented in the 1920s but continues to rise in cost to consumers.
More than 34 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most have type 2, which typically does not require insulin to control blood sugar but can. Nearly 1.9 million Americans with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day. 

Medicare, the U.S. government health insurance program for those age 65 and older and the disabled, could have saved more than $16.7 billion from 2011 to 2017 on insulin purchases had it been allowed to negotiate discounts with drug companies, according to a congressional report released last December.
Republican Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers dismissed the legislation as a ""government drug-pricing scheme; part of a socialized medicine approach that would lead to fewer cures"" while raising health insurance premiums.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a long-running antitrust lawsuit accusing 10 of the world's largest banks of pursuing two interrelated conspiracies to suppress competition in the now $23.2 trillion market for U.S. Treasury securities.
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said the 18 plaintiffs — including pension and retirement funds, banks and companies that traded in Treasuries — failed to address shortcomings he found one year ago when dismissing an earlier version of their proposed class action.
The defendants include Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), NatWest Group and UBS, as well as trading platform operator Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW).
Traders accused the banks of colluding from 2007 to 2015 to use chat rooms to swap confidential customer orders and coordinate strategies in a so-called ""auction conspiracy.""
They also accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley of having since 2013 exploited their market power by boycotting electronic trading platforms that offered ""anonymous"" trading and better prices.
But in a 74-page decision, Gardephe said newly introduced evidence of chat excerpts, statistical analyses of the banks' trading, and alleged pressure to boycott disfavored platforms was not enough to establish illegal collusion.
Unlike a year ago, the judge said he will not let the plaintiffs amend their complaint again.
""There is no reason to believe that further amendment would be productive,"" Gardephe wrote.
Dan Brockett, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email: ""We are reviewing the opinion and will look at and consider all options on behalf of the class.""
The litigation began in July 2015, following news reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing whether banks had manipulated Treasury markets.

Earlier probes into manipulation of foreign currencies and the now-abandoned Libor interest rate benchmark resulted in billions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties for banks worldwide.

While the company currently has no intention to raise prices for the Fisker Ocean in 2022 or 2023, it cannot guarantee unchanged prices for vehicle orders received after the 40,000-reservation number or for vehicles produced after 2024, given the current rate of inflation and global market pressures in logistics and commodity costs."

The department, however, did not drop charges against five other defendants. Judge Philip Brimmer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado ordered Jonathan Kanter, the head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, to appear before him and explain why the case should be retried.
The government dropped charges against Timothy Mulrenin, who worked at Tyson foods at the time; William Kantola, who was in sales at Koch Foods Inc, Jimmie Little, a former salesman at Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), Gary Brian Roberts, who was at Tyson as a sales executive at the time, and Rickie Blake, who was at George's Inc.
This was done ""in an effort to streamline the case and conserve the resources of the court, the parties, and the public,"" the department said in a court filing. 
The remaining five defendants are two former Pilgrim's Pride chief executives and one salesman, as well as two Claxton Poultry Farms executives.
The court documents allege industry executives conspired to fix chicken prices from 2012 through 2019.

Tyson in 2020 said it was cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation under a corporate leniency program that could protect the company from criminal prosecution. 
Also in 2020, U.S. poultry company Pilgrim's Pride Corp agreed to pay a $110.5 million fine after striking a plea deal with the Justice Department over price-fixing charges on chicken products. Pilgrim's Pride is mostly owned by Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY)..

The options trade was arranged days before  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it would buy the ""Call of Duty"" maker for $95 a share, and it generated an unrealized profit of about $59 million, the report said, citing unnamed sources.
Kotick and the trader, Alexander von Furstenberg, met the week before von Furstenberg, along with media moguls Barry Diller and David Geffen, bought options to purchase Activision shares at $40 each on Jan. 14, according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/36L1OJx)
""Mr. Kotick had a social brunch with his friends at a popular restaurant. He, of course, didn't share any information with them regarding a possible transaction with Microsoft,"" a spokesperson for Kotick told Reuters. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are both separately conducting insider-trading investigations, the WSJ report said.
A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. An SEC spokesperson also declined to comment, saying the agency ""does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation"".
Diller previously told WSJ that none of the traders had material non-public information about the deal, the report said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed down on Thursday, with investors digesting a sharp drop in oil prices and studying the release of key inflation and employment data on the last trading day of the month and quarter.
At 4:40 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 550 points, or 1.6%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.5%.
The main Wall Street indices weakened Wednesday, weighed by dashed hopes of a major breakthrough in Ukraine/Russia peace talks, with both the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad-based S&P 500 ending four-day winning streaks.
March has been a positive month for the major averages, however, as far as the year to date is concerned, the Dow and S&P 500 are both down and had their worst quarter in two years.
Oil prices slumped Thursday following reports that the U.S. will conduct a massive release of crude from emergency reserves in order to tackle the sharp rise in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Biden administration announced the total release from the country’s strategic petroleum reserve of as much as 180 million barrels over the course of several months.
This news has overshadowed a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which stuck to an existing deal of increasing oil production by around 400,000 barrels per day through May.
By 4:42 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.5% lower at $100 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 5.6% to $105. 
Thursday also saw the release of weekly jobless claims following on from Wednesday’s strong private jobs data, and ahead of Friday’s official report on employment for March. Last week, 202,000 people filed initial claims, slightly higher than the 197,000 expected.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,936/oz.

Investing.com – Stocks continued their slide on Thursday even as oil prices dropped after President Joe Biden announced the release of 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Biden is battling prices of gasoline at the pump, knowing American voters are feeing the pinch of rising prices for fuel and household goods. 
On Friday, the government releases the much-anticipated jobs report for March, which should show signs of an improvement in the labor market even as core inflation released on Thursday showed prices rose across the economy.
Even with lower oil prices, there’s no guarantee gasoline prices will come down at the pump in any meaningful way. OPEC and its allies have decided to stick with their gradual production goals at least through May.
Still, investors may be happy to put the first quarter in the rear view mirror. Stocks notched the worst quarter since 2020, as tech and other big companies dropped on rising inflation. Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine added a dose of uncertainty.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobs, jobs jobs
It is the start of April tomorrow, and nonfarm payrolls for March are to be released at 8:30 AM EST. Analysts are expecting a figure of 490,000,  below the previous 654,000, but revisions will also be in focus.
2. Unemployment rate

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 04:25PM ET</span>",Wall Street falls as S&P suffers biggest quarterly drop in two years,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped to close out the first quarter on Thursday with its biggest quarterly decline in two years as concerns persisted about the continuing conflict in Ukraine and its inflationary effect on prices and the Federal Reserve's response. 
While optimism about a possible peace deal between Ukraine and Russia helped lift stocks earlier in the week, hopes quickly evaporated and Russia's President Vladimir Putin threatened on Thursday to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in rubles as Ukraine prepared for more attacks.
The United States imposed new Russia-related sanctions, and U.S. President Joe Biden launched the largest release ever from the country's emergency oil reserve and challenged oil companies to drill more in a bid to lower gasoline prices that have soared during the war in Ukraine.
Stock prices have been sensitive to any signs of progress toward a peace pact between Russia and Ukraine. Already-high U.S. inflation has intensified with surging commodity prices such as oil and metals since the war began.
As prices increase, the Fed becomes increasingly likely to become more aggressive in raising interest rates to combat inflation, potentially curbing economic growth. 
Data on Thursday showed consumer prices barely rose in February as pricing pressures intensified, while personal consumption expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rose by 0.4%, in line with expectations.
""The PCE number came out today, which is the Fed’s preferred number, and although that was right on target, it was higher than it was last month, and the sense is it is going to continue to go higher, therefore you are seeing some weakness,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida. 
""That only solidifies (Fed Chair) Jay Powell and the Fed’s position to be more aggressive so there are going to be multiple 50 basis point hikes.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 550.46 points, or 1.56%, to 34,678.35, the S&P 500 lost 72.04 points, or 1.57%, to 4,530.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 221.76 points, or 1.54%, to 14,220.52.
While the S&P did suffer the worst quarter since the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in the United States in 2020, stocks have rebounded somewhat in March. 
For the quarter, the S&P 500 fell 4.9%, the Dow lost 4.6% and the Nasdaq declined 9.1%, but for the month the S&P 500 rose 3.6%, the Dow gained 2.3% and the Nasdaq advanced 3.4%. 
Investors will look toward Friday's jobs report for more confirmation of labor market strength and insight into the possible path of monetary policy by the U.S. central bank. 
All of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with financials and communication services among the weakest during the session. 
Energy, easily the best performing sector so far this year with a gain of about 38%, slipped as oil prices dropped on Biden's announcement while OPEC+ stuck to its existing output deal. The sector secured its biggest quarterly climb on record with the advance. 
Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) tumbled 5.67% after the company kept its 2022 forecast for low-single digit earnings growth unchanged.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.08 billion shares, compared with the 13.9 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 53 new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 103 new lows.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Thursday, wrapping up its worst quarter in two years as investors digested further data pointing to red-hot inflation and President Biden's plan to release a record amount of emergency oil supplies to curb rising energy prices.
The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.6%, or 550 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%. The three major averages were down about 5.2%, 4.8%, and 10%, respectively, for the quarter.
Biden said the U.S. planned to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves over several months to stem the rise in energy prices. In total, up to 180 million barrels are set to be released over six months, which if realized would be largest “release from the stockpile since it was created in 1975,” Stifel said in a note.
Oil prices fell more than 6% and were further pressured by a decision from OPEC and allies including Russia to stick with plans to add 430,000 barrels per day from May, shrugging off calls from world leaders to ramp-up production.
The latest economic data point to further evidence of the impact of energy and other commodity prices that have pushed inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target.  
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 5.4% in the 12 months through March, the fastest gain since April 1983.
In the wake of red-hot inflation, Wall Street experts see the Fed following up its 25-basis-point rate hike with more aggressive hikes later this year.
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are forecasting the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points in May and June.
The bets on aggressive rate hikes ahead have many worried about the Fed causing a recession. Bond markets have been quick to price in the risk of recession. Early this week, the 10-2 Treasury yield curve briefly inverted following weeks of flattening.
Bank stocks, which led the weakness on Thursday, remain on course to post a loss for the quarter as flattening in the yield curve dents net interest margin, limiting banks’ profit from lending.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT),  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were the biggest decliners on the day down more than 4%.
Tech, meanwhile, was also in the red on the final day of the first quarter, as investors appeared to take profits.
Chip stocks were under pressure following a 8% rout in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after Barclays downgraded the chipmaker to underweight from equal-weight cut its price target on the stock to $115 from $148, citing “cyclical risks across several end markets.”
In earnings news, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) fell 6% as concerns about slowing growth ahead overshadowed quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 04:07PM ET</span>","TIM, CDP eye formal talks for network deal in alternative path to KKR's bid -sources","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) and state lender CDP are expected to start formal negotiations over a potential merger of TIM's network assets with those of state backed Open Fiber, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The negotiations would come as TIM boss Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to revamp Italy's biggest phone company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its service business.
The sources said CDP and TIM are expected to ink a confidentiality agreement (NDA) in the early days of April.
TIM and CDP declined to comment. 
While discussions with KKR over the U.S. fund's takeover approach for TIM are ongoing, TIM and CDP's plans to sign off on an NDA would mark a further step in an alternative direction to the bid.
A person familiar with the U.S. fund's thinking on Wednesday said KKR was pessimistic about the prospects of its bid, which it has said it would only pursue with the backing of TIM and the Rome government. KKR declined to comment.
A top government adviser last week said Rome's goal remained that of creating a single broadband network in Italy. This can be achieved by merging TIM's fixed assets with those of Open Fiber, which is 60% owned by CDP.
CDP also owns 10% of TIM and would retain control of any combined network as it oversee other key infrastructure in the country.
CDP has said the tie-up would avoid costly duplication of investment needed to upgrade the national network for Italian households and businesses.
Hindered by antitrust issues, a TIM-Open Fiber deal has proved elusive so far.
PRICE GAP 
KKR, which has already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in TIM's last-mile fixed-line network last year, submitted an indicative bid to buy the group in November.
While a merger of Open Fiber was not part of KKR's plans for TIM, the fund wants to discuss with the company the antitrust implications of a such a deal and how it can create value for the FiberCop business in which KKR is already an investor.
TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has billed KKR's proposal as too low even though it was pitched at 0.505 euros. TIM shares traded at 0.33 euros on Thursday.
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group's ""untapped value"".
Sources have said TIM asked KKR to clarify by Monday whether the price of 10.8 billion euros for the equity was confirmed. TIM and KKR are at odds over a due diligence analysis KKR wants to perform before making a formal offer, while TIM has said it can only have confirmatory nature, meaning it would have preceded by a formal offer. 

""The problems here go well beyond disagreements over the due diligence, there is little appetite on TIM's part and Rome's to work on KKR's takeover project,"" a source familiar with the negotiations said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.
The lawsuit had been brought in Manhattan by digital token investors who had bought nine tokens - EOS, QSP, KNC, TRX, FUN, ICX, OMG, LEND and ELF - through Binance's online exchange starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.
In a 327-page complaint, the investors claimed that Binance ""wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions"" and failed to warn them about the ""significant risks"" of buying the tokens, and sought to recoup what they paid.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, however, said the investors sued too late, having waited more than one year after their purchases.
He also said domestic securities laws did not apply because Binance was not a domestic exchange, even if it used Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) computer servers and Ethereum blockchain computers in the United States.
""Plaintiffs must allege more than stating that plaintiffs bought tokens while located in the U.S. and that title passed in whole or in part over servers located in California that host Binance's website,"" Carter wrote.
Kyle Roche, a lawyer for the investors at Roche Freedman, declined to comment. Binance and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The investors claimed the statute of limitations began running exactly one year before their April 2020 lawsuit, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released a ""framework"" characterizing their tokens as securities. 

Binance has an opaque corporate structure, with a holding company registered in the Cayman Islands. Founder and Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao said in October that Binance planned to establish ""a few headquarters"" around the world.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut some losses Thursday, but remained on track for a first quarter loss, as investors digested further data pointing to red-hot inflation just as President Biden announced the U.S. planned to release a record amount of emergency oil supplies to curb rising energy prices.
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%, or 165 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.2%.
Biden said the U.S. planned to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves over several months to stem the rise in energy prices. In total, up to 180 million barrels are set to be released over six months, which if realized would be largest “release from the stockpile since it was created in 1975,” Stifel said in a note.
Oil prices fell more than 6% and were further pressured by a decision from OPEC and allies including Russia to stick with plans to add 430,000 barrels per day from May, shrugging off calls from world leaders to ramp-up production.
Energy stocks, however, were one of the few sectors trading above the flatline, propped up by  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR), Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB).
The latest economic data point to further evidence of the impact of energy and other commodity prices that have pushed inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target.  
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 5.4% in the 12 months through March, the fastest gain since April 1983.
In the wake of red-hot inflation, Wall Street experts see the Fed following up its 25-basis-point rate hike with more aggressive hikes later this year.
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are forecasting the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points in May and June.
The bets on aggressive rate hikes ahead have many worried about the Fed causing a recession. Bond markets have been quick to price in the risk of recession. Early this week, the 10-2 Treasury yield curve briefly inverted following weeks of flattening.
Bank stocks, which led the weakness on Thursday, remain on course to post a loss for the quarter as flattening in the yield curve dents net interest margin, limiting banks’ profit from lending.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT),  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were the biggest decliners on the day down more than 3%.
Tech, meanwhile, was also in the red on the final day of the first quarter, as investors appeared to take profits following a month of strong gains for the sector.
Chip stocks were under pressure following a 7% rout in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after Barclays downgraded the chipmaker to underweight from equal-weight cut its price target on the stock to $115 from $148, citing “cyclical risks across several end markets.”"

LONDON (Reuters) -A proposed multi-billion pound claim brought by thousands of asset managers, pension funds and financial institutions against major banks over alleged foreign exchange (forex) rigging has been blocked by a London court.
London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which had been considering the case against JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), UBS and NatWest since last July, ruled on Thursday the case was not suitable to proceed as a U.S.-style, opt-out class action.
The European Commission paved the way for the proposed lawsuit by fining banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) in 2019 over two forex cartels, dubbed ""Essex Express"" and ""Three Way Banana Split"", between 2007 and 2013. 
Michael O'Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog The Pensions Regulator, and Phillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at the Competition Markets Authority, had been vying to lead a class action on behalf of financial claimants.
O'Higgins said his team was reviewing its options.
""This decision is extremely disappointing, because this claim is exactly the sort of claim that opt-out proceedings were introduced to facilitate in order to provide access to justice to all entities affected by the illegal behaviour of cartelists,"" he said.
""We are reviewing our options to decide how to move forward in a way that best serves the class that we seek to represent.""

A representative for JPMorgan welcomed the news, saying the tribunal had ""acknowledged the clear weaknesses in the applicants' cases"". Others were not immediately available for comment.

The planned deal is based on a 675 million euro ($748 million) enterprise value for InVivo Retail, they said.
The business would become a fully-owned subsidiary of 2MX Organic while InVivo would become the majority shareholder of 2MX Organic through the issue of new shares, the companies said in a statement.
The partners, who expect to complete the transaction during the second half of the year, aim to develop InVivo's existing network of gardening, pet care and grocery stores into a leading brand of sustainable retail in France and in Europe, they said.
The potential tie-up marks another step in Chief Executive Thiery Blandiniere's overhaul of InVivo, a grouping of French farmer-owned cooperatives. 
InVivo last year acquired French rival Soufflet in deal worth 2.2 billion euros, boosting its grain trading capacity and adding a large malt-making business.

2MX Organic, which is also backed by entrepreneur Moez-Alexandre Zouari and banker Matthieu Pigasse, had been hunting for a merger deal since its stock market listing in late 2020.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:32PM ET</span>",Food stamp recipients are the new frontier for Target.com,"By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) is preparing to let shoppers use food stamps to pay for online orders, following in the footsteps of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com, in a move that could help the nation's seventh-largest retailer gain market share among lower-income shoppers.
Roughly 21.7 million U.S. households use food stamps, which are mostly restricted payments to cold food items, non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants.
Target disclosed to Reuters last week that it will begin to accept payment online with food stamps, tentatively starting in late April, through a service offered by Shipt, its delivery arm. A Target spokesman said Thursday that it hadn't ""shared any official launch date"" for the service, which also will include drive-up and pick-up orders.
Offering food-stamp payment for online orders could help Target fill a long-time gap in its e-commerce strategy and reach households that might otherwise purchase groceries at so-called ""dollar store"" chains, or at Walmart Inc. 
Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) already accept purchases with food stamps on their websites since 2019 as part of a program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which distributes food stamps. Grocery delivery service Instacart also offers the option.
Still, even though Target has lost the early mover advantage, investors and industry watchers were positive on the move. Accepting food-stamp payments online could build customer loyalty and help it sell other products, said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds over $30 million in Target shares. 
""Target is kind of taking the long view, saying you can use your food stamps now,"" he said. ""But maybe at some point you won't depend on food stamps and you'll remember that Target was there for your various shopping needs.""
""I wouldn't call it a game-changer, but I think it is important,"" Klink added. 
Grocery is a big part of Target's operations. In 2020, it accounted for 20% of its overall sales of $92.4 billion, putting it in competition with the 10 largest U.S. grocers, including Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Albertsons. The company this month said it was looking to expand grocery sales, especially through private label.
On March 1, Richard Gomez, Target's chief food and beverage officer, told investors Target is ""going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries.""
Target's house brand, Good & Gather, now offers nearly 2,500 food and beverage products. Target, for example, sells a 12-ounce can of Good & Gather evaporated milk for $0.99 on its website, compared to Nestle's Carnation condensed milk for $1.69.
""Target will put a leading national brand like Nestle on a display, but put the Target (private-label) item right next to it, to get the consumer to cross over,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm, adding that the move was ""transformative.""
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in October began providing about 42.8 million people with an additional $20 billion in food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than 3.2 million food-stamp households shopped online in January, doubling from a year before. To buy groceries online, food-stamp recipients generally must have an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card, similar to a debit card. However card holders can't use the benefits to pay for non-food items.
For Target, one question is whether food-stamp recipients will be willing to pay delivery fees. Shipt, which Target acquired in 2017, charges $7 per delivery but offers free same-day delivery to subscribers who pay $99 per year. 
Instacart, which handles deliveries for BJ's Wholesale Club, Food Lion, Publix and Ahold Delhaize USA, among others, is waiving its $3.99 delivery fees for food stamp purchases made online until March 31.
Amazon has since offered additional discounts of up to 15%on select meat, produce, toiletries and paper products purchased at Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods by food stamp recipients using EBT cards. 
EBT cards can not be used to pay for Amazon Prime subscription membership, tips or items sold by third-party sellers; however, Amazon offers membership discounts of $6.99 per month for customers who are on government programs including SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid. An Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month, or $139 per year. 
Lower-income households are seeing their purchasing power erode as meat and bread prices, and heating and gas costs, rise. The price of groceries purchased online in the United States rose 7.6% on average in February, compared to a year earlier, according to the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index. 

The $50 billion or more that Americans spend annually on groceries purchased with food stamps represents just 5% of the $1 trillion spent on food-at-home yearly, said Bill Kirk, consumer analyst at MKM Partners. 
Still, Target's new payment option underscores its ambition to boost market share in the area of groceries, a category where strong growth in volume sales is hard to come by and where inflation is particularly acute.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are gathering in Geneva this week for their first big industry event in three years, tackling the impact of sanctions on rich Russians arising from the war in Ukraine.
Russia was only the 17th largest market for Swiss watch exports last year, but how to manage business and client relations during such a sensitive time was high on the priority list, Reuters' conversations with executives at Watches & Wonders showed.
Sanctions against Russia and a ban on exports of luxury goods mean brands can no longer ship timepieces to Russia and all the big labels have closed directly operated stores.
Neither Richemont nor Ulysse Nardin, recently sold to its management by  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and traditionally strong in Russia, wanted to comment on reports Russian authorities had seized millions of dollars worth of watches at rival brand Audemars Piguet's Russian subsidiary and what that could mean for their own business there. Audemars Piguet did not return requests for comment.
Ulysse Nardin's Patrick Pruniaux said the brand still had about 20 sales outlets, but was now much less dependent on Russia than in the past.
Russians account for around 2% to 3% of global luxury spending, or around 7 billion euros ($7.75 billion), dwarfed by the U.S. and China, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, senior partner and head of fashion and luxury at consultancy Bain. 
“These are loyal customers that buy every year and that I think have strong relationships with some of these brands on a personal level,” she noted.
Russian retailers were unable to attend the trade show, according to Thierry Stern, the head of independently owned Patek Philippe, which works with big Russian luxury retailer Mercury Group.
DIAMONDS AND DUBAI
Stern said he did not expect the sanctions to hit the brand's access to diamonds because it had stock for at least a year and there was sufficient supply elsewhere. ""If this lasts long, maybe prices will rise a bit,"" he said.
Richemont said it had stopped buying Russian diamonds, but was confident it could source them elsewhere.
Oris, another independently owned brand, said it put plans to expand in Russia with a new retail partner on hold. ""But we shouldn't forget there's also people there, families whose existence is at risk,"" co-CEO Rolf Studer told Reuters on Thursday, saying many brands had long-standing relationships with Russian partners.
Edouard Meylan of independent H.Moser said his brand had received demands from Russians - just before sanctions hit - who wanted to quickly spend their money on watches before it got seized by Swiss authorities. ""We refused, of course,"" he said.
Oris's Studer confirmed this was not uncommon, recalling similar demands from Germans before the end of Swiss banking secrecy a few years ago. Richemont finance chief Burkhart Grund told Reuters the company was very vigilant its products were not used for money laundering or to circumvent sanctions.
Several executives said they were seeing booming demand in Dubai as the United Arab Emirates as well as Turkey see money flowing in from wealthy Russians seeking a financial haven.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. House of Representatives committee said on Wednesday it will hold an April 5 hearing on U.S. Postal Service (USPS) plans to purchase electric vehicles, where lawmakers expect to push for purchases of many more zero-emission delivery trucks.
Last week, USPS said it had placed an initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 next-generation delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp. It said at least 10,019 of those will be electric vehicles (EVs), double its initial planned EV purchases, but some lawmakers feel that is not enough.
House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney said USPS ""should be leading the way, not falling behind private companies that are already moving ahead to save money and curb climate change by electrifying their fleets.""
Previously, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had committed to buying at least 10% EVs as part of a multibillion-dollar plan to retire 30-year-old delivery vehicles.
The hearing will include USPS Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb and Victoria Stephen, executive director of the USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle program.
Congress has considered awarding USPS $5.9 billion to boost EV purchases and charging infrastructure.
USPS in February rejected a bid by the White House and Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its plans to buy mostly gasoline-powered vehicles and hold a new public hearing on the environmental ramifications of the vehicle purchases. 
In February 2021, the USPS announced an initial $482 million contract for Oshkosh and said it could order up to 165,000 vehicles over 10 years in a deal that could be worth $6 billion or more.
USPS estimates its total costs for buying and operating 75,000 new delivery vehicles over 20 years including fueling and maintenance at $9.3 billion for gasoline-powered vehicles and $11.6 billion for electric models.

In 2019, USPS operated 217,000 vehicles that traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles and spent about $706.2 million in maintenance costs for it fleet of 140,000 older delivery vehicles.
USPS said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Stock of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger-owner PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) lost 6.6% Thursday after several brokerages cut their price targets, according to StreetInsider.
Evercore’s $85 was the lowest set by any of the at least six brokerages who trimmed their targets. The brokerage earlier had a target of $120 for the stock. It maintained its underperform rating. Goldman Sachs, which also maintained its buy rating cut its target to $121 from $140 earlier.
The raft of price cuts followed the company’s fourth-quarter numbers that were disclosed Wednesday.
Fourth-quarter revenue increased 16% to $2.43 billion and the company said the pandemic continued to pressure the performance of its stores but not as much. Some stores in Europe and China were temporarily shut while some other operated on reduced hours.
The sales of Heritage Brands business, including IZOD, Van Heusen, Arrow and Geoffrey Beene brands, to Authentic Brands also weighed on the revenue.
Adjusted profit per share was $2.84 compared to a loss in the same period a year ago.
Revenue in 2022 is projected to increase 2% to 3%, impacted by the sales of the Heritage business and the closure of its stores in Russia and Belarus. Wholesale shipments to Ukraine have also reduced, the company said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly C. Greenberger said the economic forces remain volatile and “All in, if the European situation proves more dynamic than currently contemplated, and/or if consumers are less receptive to ongoing price increases, PVH could observe an unexpected departure in earnings results relative to plan”.
Greenberger now sees the stock at $89, down from the prior $122.
UBS analyst Jay Sole was an exception, reiterating a buy with a price target of $156, lower by $12.

For soybeans, the USDA projected plantings at 90.955 million acres, up 4% from last year and above most analyst expectations.

COMMENTS:
* Terry Reilly, senior analyst, Futures International:
""We're pretty much going to need every acre that USDA reported this year in order to meet demand ... The biggest surprise was the corn acres coming in 2.5 million below trade expectations. That could reflect the shortage of supply of fertilizer and also fertilizer prices trading at a record.""
* Brian Basting, analyst with Advance Trading:
""The bean acres number is a record, and we'll see if that is realized. When we saw the (fertilizer) price really skyrocket starting last fall, producers were looking for alternatives. They were looking at the attractive oilseed price, too.""
* Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities:
""The corn number led the charge. Acres were not good enough, and the stocks number was also less than the trade thought. ... It boils down to the fertilizer costs ... But as the market jumps today, these (corn) acres can come back pretty fast.""
* Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading:
""(USDA's corn plantings forecast) tells me that farmers don't like to pay for record fertilizer prices. They are either scaling back their fertilizer use, or they have done a bit of switching (of corn acres to soybean acres). They're just not going to pay these prices.""
* Charlie Sernatinger, analyst with ED&F Man Capital:
""Wow. Corn (futures are) off to the races on the acreage numbers, as well as the spring wheat; new-crop beans (futures) under pressure, but I suspect that even the beans will be bought up off these numbers. Total corn and bean acres were 180.5 million, matching the high from 2020. Bean stocks were bearish as well, adding to the early selling.""
* Craig Turner, senior ag broker at Daniels Trading:
""There should have been a bigger (market) reaction to these numbers. These should have been limit-up, limit-down numbers. ... They say a rising tide lifts all boats, and a rally in corn and wheat could be helping beans in this case.""

* Bob Utterback, president of Utterback Marketing:
""Remember the movie 'The Exorcist', where the girl's head is spinning around and spitting out pea soup? That's what the bears are doing right now. Most of my farmer customers are planning to shift a little of their acreage to beans. It doesn't take a lot from all of these producers making a small shift, to add up an extra million acres.""

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:02PM ET</span>",Build or buy? Automakers chasing Tesla rethink dependence on suppliers,"By Tina Bellon and Joseph White
(Reuters) -Automakers racing to develop battery-powered, software-driven vehicles to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are confronting a new challenge: what technology to build themselves, and what to keep buying from suppliers.
Becoming more vertically integrated by doing more manufacturing in-house represents a major shift for most global automakers, who have relied for decades on suppliers to produce critical parts and software, and manage sprawling manufacturing networks in low-wage countries.
But some established automakers are embracing drastic changes to their longstanding build-or-buy calculations. One factor is the success of Tesla's electric vehicles, which rely on proprietary technology the company develops and manufactures itself. Another is the financial damage done by supply-chain breakdowns during the pandemic.
""The most important thing is we vertically integrate. Henry Ford ... was right,"" Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's CEO, Jim Farley, said at a conference in earlier this month. Farley's reference was to company founder Henry Ford's Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan, which in the early 20th Century took in iron ore and other raw materials at one end, and churned Model Ts off the assembly line at the other.
Farley said the company had to move away from its early EV strategy of buying components off the shelf. Now, he said, Ford aims to control the supply chains ""all the way back to the mines"" that produce battery materials.

Rivals including Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Mercedes-Benz AG are pursuing similar strategies. Mercedes last year acquired British high-performance electric motor manufacturer YASA, and has retooled a factory near Berlin to produce motors based on YASA technology. The German luxury car maker in March opened a new factory in Alabama to build battery packs for U.S.-made electric vehicles, and said it will partner with Japanese battery maker Envision AESC to build battery cells in the United States.
""We are going deep into sourcing,"" Mercedes-Benz Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius told reporters during a briefing in Alabama.
WINNING STRATEGY
The investments by automakers in mines, motors and batteries are a departure from decades of handing control over development and production to suppliers, who could produce steering controls, semiconductors and electronic components at greater scale and lower cost for multiple vehicle manufacturers.
In the new world of electric vehicles, however, investors have decided that Tesla's approach of buying raw materials directly, building its own batteries and engineering its own software is the winning strategy. Tesla's market capitalization has soared back above $1 trillion in recent weeks, outweighing that of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), GM and Ford combined. 
""Major players have realized electric vehicles are the future, but they have yet to widely recognize that they have to up their game in terms of motors, transmissions, battery technologies, inverters and electric powertrains,"" Peter Rawlinson, CEO of EV startup Lucid Group Inc, said in an interview with Reuters. Rawlinson previously was vice president of vehicle engineering at Tesla.
Between the 1970s and the 2010s, the share of automaker-owned intellectual property in their vehicles decreased from 90% to 50%, according to Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.
That meant many automakers lacked the in-house engineering expertise to develop their own electric vehicle platforms, powertrains and battery packs when EV pioneer Tesla showed its vertically integrated cars were a hit with consumers.
""We're designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to the traditional supply base and [execute] like I call it, catalog engineering,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a 2020 earnings call.
Tesla's approach is costly and the company has raised vehicle prices repeatedly in the last few years. Despite promising to deliver a model that could start at about $25,000, Musk earlier this year said ""we're not currently working on the $25,000 car. At some point, we will. But we have enough on our plate right now.""
TECHNOLOGY RACE 
There is also a gap between what automakers say about their vertical integration strategies, and what happens as engineers try to meet deadlines to deliver new vehicles, supplier industry executives said.
""There's a lot of narrative about in-sourcing and vertically integrating, especially in areas like software,"" Kevin Clark, chief executive of auto supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc, told analysts in February. ""Virtually all the OEMs that we are doing business with are struggling with software development.""
Graphic on expected in-house EV motor production: https://tmsnrt.rs/3DAh0FC
Xavier Mosquet, a senior adviser at Boston Consulting Group, said many manufacturers still prefer to buy EV technology to avoid the cost and complexity of manufacturing in-house.
""There are a number of automakers who in a way want to continue buying and manage the final integration,"" Mosquet said, adding that it would take several years to determine which approach is successful.
Many automakers are also hesitant to completely in-source EV manufacturing at a time when EV purchases still make up only a fraction of total vehicle demand.
Today, only Tesla, EV startup Lucid Group Inc and Chinese BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd are completely making their electric motors in-house, according to IHS Markit, followed by Hyundai Motor Co and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.
Other carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz Group, Ford and Porsche, are using electric motors by suppliers for their current EV models.

""The electric powertrain cannot be bought off the shelf at a world-class standard, it is not a commodity,"" Rawlinson said. ""This is a technology race and the market doesn't see it yet.""
Mercedes said it plans to make electric motors, battery packs and electronics in-house starting in 2024. The company is also working to reduce costs by securing raw materials directly from miners, Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer told Reuters.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:51PM ET</span>",Ryanair goads Boeing as jetmaker meets rival easyJet,"By Tim Hepher
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The boss of Irish budget carrier Ryanair raised the stakes in a feud with Boeing (NYSE:BA) over jet prices by saying he could do without a long-stalled deal to buy the 737 MAX 10 - even as Boeing appeared to woo his arch-rival easyJet (LON:EZJ).
The latest salvo in a dispute between Europe's largest low-cost airline group and Boeing, the exclusive supplier of its main fleet, came as airline chiefs met for the first time in two years to review a pandemic recovery clouded by war in Ukraine.
Ryanair last year walked away from negotiations with Boeing for 200 of its largest type of single-aisle jet, the 737 MAX 10, accusing the planemaker of being ""delusional"" about prices. 
On Thursday, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary noted no signs of a breakthrough but said he would meet Boeing in April.
""We have to wait for Boeing to be in a kind of headspace for talking about MAX 10s. At the moment, they're dealing with a backlog of deliveries, 777 issues, design delays or certification delays on the MAX 10. They have a whole heap of problems,"" O'Leary told Reuters.
""There are many times in my life that I missed the market, there's always that possibility. But you know, even if we have, we're very content where we are; we have 210 aircraft deliveries to take over the next five years,"" he said in an interview. 
Boeing officials had no immediate comment. 
The U.S. company has said in response to previous criticism from Ryanair that it is committed to supporting its partner but will ""continue to be disciplined"" in commercial decisions.
O'Leary, hoping to benefit from bargain prices as Boeing claws its way back from a recent safety crisis, urged Boeing to fight harder for customers after what he described as a series of market losses to single-aisle leader Airbus.
""Boeing need to begin to fight back and win back market share from Airbus,"" he said in an interview.
SHIFTING ALLIANCES
But in an unusual twist, Boeing wasted no time in holding a semi-public pow-wow with Ryanair's rival easyJet, a key Airbus customer, just yards away at the A4E airlines conference.
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren was seen huddling with a group of Boeing executives including Senior Vice-President of Commercial Sales & Marketing Ihssane Mounir, the U.S. company's sales boss.
Mounir declined to comment on the half-hour discussion, held in the corner of a quiet public space on conference sidelines.
""As you would expect, we informally speak with others in the industry at industry events,"" an easyJet spokeswoman said.
An Airbus spokesman said, ""We have full trust in our partner easyJet and we never comment on our customers' private agendas.""
It is not uncommon for airlines and manufacturers to chat informally at such gatherings, but the meeting between senior officials cutting across industry alliances caused a buzz.
""Yes, everyone noticed that,"" a European delegate said.
Airbus has long been the exclusive supplier for easyJet, while Ryanair is a die-hard Boeing customer apart from a sub-fleet of leased Airbus jets inherited through acquisition.
The airline industry, hungry for new deals after pandemic losses, has seen a series of defections in recent months.

Boeing lost medium-haul contests to Airbus at Dutch KLM https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-dominant-share-air-france-klm-jet-purchase-sources-2021-12-16 and Australia's Qantas https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-order-renew-qantas-fleet-sources-2021-12-15 but scored an unexpected victory by poaching U.S. budget carrier Allegiant Air, which had previously relied on used Airbus jets.
Such ""flips"" are rare due to the cost of retraining pilots, but reflect fierce competition for new business as the aerospace industry seeks to recover from its worst-ever recession.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:42PM ET</span>",Explainer-Russia wants gas payments in roubles. Will buyers make the switch?,"By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Thursday requiring foreign buyers to pay roubles for Russian gas from April 1 or see their contracts halted, a move described as ""blackmail"" by European states.
WHAT IS BEHIND THE CHANGE?
The move is in retaliaton against Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. 
Moscow, which says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, describes the Western measures as an economic war.
Getting Western countries to pay in roubles would blunt the impact of their curbs on Russia's foreign reserves and boost the rouble.
So far this year, Europe has spent 200 million to 800 million euros ($880 million) a day on Russian gas, converting that into roubles would be a huge boost for it.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Europe is heavily reliant on Russia for its energy needs, with around 40% of its gas coming from the country. If Moscow decides to turn off the taps it could trigger supply shortages, factory closures and crippling energy costs across the region.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has already activiated an emergency plan which could mean power rationing if gas supplies get too low.
Dutch gas prices, the European benchmark, have already hit record highs this year on supply concerns, stoking inflation in the region and raising the risk of recession.[G/EU]
WILL FOREIGN BUYERS SWITCH TO ROUBLES?
So far, it looks unlikely, Western countries have said payment in roubles would breach contracts that can take months or more to renegotiate.
IF THEY DO SWITCH, HOW WOULD IT WORK?
Putin's order makes Gazprombank the intermediary in the gas trade. 
A foreign buyer is now obliged to transfer foreign currency to one special, so called ""K"", account at the lender. Gazprombank would then buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer roubles to another special ""K"" account, the order said.
Britain put Gazprombank on its list of banned entities earlier this month. It was not included in the EU's order excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
It's unclear. Russia would have to physically halt gas flows to the European Union to force the issue.
In the meantime, the European Union may up the ante by putting curbs on Russian energy exports.

The European Commission is readying new sanctions against the Kremlin, EU sources told Reuters on Wednesday, with the magnitude of the new measures depending on Moscow's stance on gas payments in roubles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of users and customers should account for those assets as a liability on their balance sheet and disclose the related risks to investors, the securities regulator said on Thursday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance would apply to a range of listed entities, including crypto exchanges and traditional firms such as retail brokers and banks that are increasingly providing cryptocurrency services and holding digital assets on behalf of a range of clients.
While there is a well-established standard under accounting rules for safeguarding traditional assets on behalf of clients, there is no explicit standard for safeguarding crypto assets and companies diverge in their treatment of these arrangements.
In its guidance, the SEC said there are ""significant"" technological, legal and regulatory risks associated with safeguarding crypto-assets and as a result they should be reflected as a liability on companies' balance sheets.
""The technological mechanisms supporting how crypto-assets are issued, held, or transferred, as well as legal uncertainties regarding holding crypto-assets for others, create significant increased risks...including an increased risk of financial loss,"" the SEC wrote. 
Companies should also disclose ""the nature and amount"" of crypto assets they are responsible for holding, with separate disclosures for each significant crypto-asset, and any vulnerabilities resulting from concentration in such activities. 
The underlying crypto assets should be accounted for at fair value, the SEC said. 

Cryptocurrency platforms and wallets continue suffer major breaches, with hackers just this week stealing $615 million worth of cryptocurrency from blockchain project Ronin. 
In addition, U.S. regulators remain undecided on how to treat cryptocurrencies, with regulators still discussing new rules for how banks should handle digital assets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's top shareholder said it had agreed to sell its stake to Bain Capital if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer, potentially forcing the embattled conglomerate to revive talks for a private equity buyout.
The agreement between Bain and Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, which owns about 9.9% of Toshiba, comes as shareholders last week voted down the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to split its devices unit.
Effissimo said in a regulatory filing on Thursday it had signed a confirmation letter dated March 24 that it would tender to a bid that allows Bain to own at least two-thirds of Toshiba and that clears regulatory approval.
It also said the agreement would be invalidated if a potential bid by Bain was set to fall through, leaving open the possibility for Effissimo to tender its stocks to someone else who makes a superior offer.
""This basically means it's going to kick off a competitive auction process,"" a Toshiba shareholder told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The Nikkei business daily reported that Bain is planning to team up with Japanese investment funds in making a buyout offer.
Bain said in a statement nothing had been decided about a takeover bid for Toshiba, adding there were many issues that needed to be resolved to launch a bid to take Toshiba private.
""We believe we need to have careful and sincere dialogues with Toshiba management, the Japanese government, financial institutions and other stakeholders,"" it said.
INTEREST FROM OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS
Three sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters that other global private equity firms are also interested in taking Toshiba private.
One of them sounded out Toshiba management about a potential buyout in January, saying that it could make a proposal if the company is interested, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks were private.
Toshiba said in a statement it was not involved in the confirmation letter between Effissimo and Bain, as well as in its contents.
It also said the company accepts the opinion of the shareholders expressed at last week's meeting and will aim to build trust with shareholders and reconsider its strategic options to enhance value. 
A spokesperson for Effissimo, when asked about the filing, said the fund planned to announce its stance at the appropriate time.
During a five-month strategic review through November, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers.

Sources said the private equity firms Toshiba held talks with included Bain, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Blackstone (NYSE:BX). At least one private equity firm told Toshiba that a deal to take it private could be done at 6,000 yen a share or more.
Bain owns Kioxia Holdings Corp, the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba has a 40% stake in the chipmaker.

Shares represent gold bars held in vaults and are easy to buy and sell, freeing investors from the hassle of buying and storing bullion themselves.
ETFs and similar products together held 3,570 tonnes of gold worth $210 billion at the end of 2021, according to the World Gold Council, which tracks the sector.
As part of a report on ethical gold investments, Reuters asked the ten largest ETF operators - all based in Europe or North America - what gold they own.
All the funds only hold gold bars made by refiners accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), a standard-setting industry body. 
Six, with 955 tonnes of gold between them, said they prioritised bars made since 2012, when the LBMA introduced rules aimed at stopping the use of gold linked to crime or violence.
Before that date, LBMA rules focused only on the purity, weight and size of gold bars.
Three of the six ETF issuers that focus on newer bars said they aimed to hold bars made after 2019, when the LBMA rules had become tougher. These three held 378 tonnes of gold at the end of 2021. 
Four of the top 10 fund operators, with 2,188 tonnes of gold between them, said they were comfortable holding bars made before and after 2012.

""Invesco Physical Gold ETC seeks to minimise exposure to gold mined prior to the 2012 introduction of the LBMA's Responsible Gold Guidance,"" it said. 
""While much of the gold mined prior to 2012 is likely to have also complied with the responsible gold guidance, it was not previously mandatory. Our holdings are currently 100% post-2012 gold bars.""
DEUTSCHE BOERSE (XETRA)
""I don't have any problems with the old LBMA bars,"" said Steffen Orben, managing director of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) Commodities, which operates the Xetra-Gold fund. ""We should not destroy them, remake them... just to have them re-labelled (with a post-2012 date).""
He said Xetra-Gold was designed to track the wholesale gold price and needed a liquid market to do that. 
ZUERCHER KANTONALBANK (ZKB/SWISSCANTO)
ZKB said its main ETF launched in 2006, before responsible sourcing rules came into force, and grew quickly. 
""The fund therefore still holds bars cast before 2012. For new gold purchases by the fund, we strictly prioritize bars cast after 2012, complying with the responsible sourcing rules of LBMA,"" it said. 
It said it was ""aware of the growing importance of responsible sourcing"" and had therefore launched in 2018 a gold fund for institutional clients which holds only bars cast after 2012.
DWS GROUP (XTRACKERS)
""We aim to include as eligible only London Good Delivery Bars which were cast after 2012,"" DWS Group said. ""It is not uncommon for clients to ask if the ETC adheres to the LBMA Responsible Sourcing Guidance.""
SPROTT 
""We are required to hold London Good Delivery bars from LBMA-accredited refiners,"" Sprott said in a statement.
""Given the age of our funds, we own bars from a variety of time periods which were subject to the industry sourcing standards in place at the time they were produced."" 
""We support the ongoing improvements in responsible sourcing standards.""

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 11:26AM ET</span>",As good as gold? Bullion funds grapple with ethical investing,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - Want to invest in ethical gold? It's harder than it looks. 
A push by investment funds to avoid bullion from unethical sources by buying newly made bars is limited in its impact because many still contain old gold whose provenance is unknown, bankers and refiners say.
That means very few investment funds know the origin of their product and its environmental and humanitarian record, denting ambitions to tap into the booming market for sustainable investments.
The world's biggest gold-backed funds have increasingly focused on holding bars made since 2012, when the standard-setting London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) brought in rules to ensure metal in the $15 trillion a year wholesale market was not linked to crime or violence.
But given how often older bars are melted and recycled, many made after that date still contain gold whose history is unverifiable, bankers and refiners told Reuters.
It is not clear how much old gold is in new bars, but more than half the metal processed by mainstream refineries is recycled, LBMA data show. 
""It is an illusion to believe that if you re-refine, you get 'newly born' gold that is ethically acceptable,"" said Patrick Schein, a refiner and board member at the Alliance for Responsible Mining. ""It resembles greenwashing."" 
Schein said it was fine for funds to hold recycled gold if it was alongside newly dug metal from industrial and artisanal mines, but that they should be transparent. ""When it is not possible to trace origin, just say so,"" he said.
Gold is not a natural draw for ESG investors, given the large environmental cost of digging it out of the ground, but the metal is a valuable financial asset and mines are large employers in developing nations. 
Recycled gold has less environmental impact than mined metal, but because its origin is often unknown there is a risk it may have passed through criminal or violent hands. 
While investors are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics when deciding where to invest, the gold industry, like many sectors, does not have mandatory rules around ESG compliance.
LBMA Chief Executive Ruth Crowell, while acknowledging that old gold ends up in new bars, said the focus on newer bars showed funds are taking ESG seriously.
""It's definitely a positive step,"" she said. She predicts greater transparency and more ambitious sourcing commitments in the future. 
'IT'S THE SAME GOLD'
One of the most popular ways to invest in gold is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and similar products which issue shares backed by bullion. 
Of the ten largest, six, which at the end of last year held 955 tonnes of gold worth around $55 billion, told Reuters they prioritised bars made since 2012. Three of these favoured bars made since 2019, when rules had become tougher.
Several funds use their post-2012 or post-2019 pledges in their marketing materials, though none of the largest explicitly pitch themselves as ""ethical"" or ""green"". 
The LBMA's Crowell said seeking post-2012 bars was meaningful because standards tightened so sharply. Post-2019 pledges appeared more of a ""marketing play"", she said, as changes that year were less significant.
Bankers said rising demand for newer gold bars in Europe had led to more made before 2012 being sent to Asia, where fewer buyers have ESG requirements.
As gold travels east, refineries typically recast the large bars traded in the West into smaller ones favoured in Asia, industry sources said. Some of these return to Europe and the United States and are remade again into bars which, because they are new, funds would accept, the sources said.
""It's the same gold,"" said an executive at a large gold-trading bank. 
The four top-ten funds comfortable with pre-2012 bars include the two biggest, the World Gold Council's SPDR funds, which held 1,050 tonnes of gold at the end of last year, and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares funds, which had 769 tonnes.
The World Gold Council, founded by mining companies to promote the use of gold, said it supported higher ethical standards but that old bars should not be excluded as this has no meaningful ethical impact and would impair market liquidity, which is essential for large funds to operate. 
Blackrock said LBMA rules allowed for use of old bars. ""Our ETPs are classified as responsibly sourced by the LBMA based on its industry standards,"" a spokesperson said. 
TRACEABLE GOLD
Funds do have the option to pay more to avoid wholesale bars and get gold with a guaranteed origin. This could be from mines or recycled metal if the fund prioritises low environmental impact over traceability. 
But the vast majority of ETFs don't hold specific-origin gold. Some said this was because only the wholesale market, with its huge pool of interchangeable gold bars, can cope with the size and frequency of their transactions. Others said their investors did not want to pay a premium.
Some small funds are holding gold whose origin they know.
Swiss banking group Raiffeisen and Swiss wealth managers de Pury Pictet Turrettini each last year launched gold funds committed to traceable metal from large and artisanal mines.
When this is unavailable, they get bars from the wholesale market but seek to later swap them for known-origin ones, they said. 
Making known-origin gold requires refiners to use more complex processes and segregated production lines. Many do produce some gold this way, chiefly for the jewellery market, and although it is more costly, much more could be supplied, refiners said. 

The Raiffeisen and Pictet funds, whose management charges are broadly in line with the 10 largest ETFs, are still small, each containing less than 2 tonnes of gold. 
But bigger funds will follow their lead, said Melchior de Muralt at de Pury Pictet Turrettini. ""More and more ETFs will hold traceable gold, even if only 10% or 20%, to accommodate ESG-driven clients,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Royal Bank of Canada became the latest Canadian lender to expand overseas with a 1.6 billion pound ($2.1 billion) all-cash offer for U.K.-based wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF) on Thursday. 
The bid, representing a 62% premium to Wednesday's closing price, sent the target's shares surging 61%.
The UK is a key growth market, and the combination would make RBC Wealth Management the No.3 wealth manager in Britain and Ireland, Canada's biggest bank said.
RBC is offering Brewin shareholders 515 pence per share, compared with Wednesday's closing price of 318 pence, valuing the firm at 2.8% of its 55 billion pounds in assets under management (AUM) as of Feb. 28.
Brewin's shares hit a record high of 511 pence at 1445 GMT, doubling from their lowest in more than a year reached earlier this month. Royal Bank shares slipped 0.1%, compared with a 0.4% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark.
Brewin Dolphin directors have unanimously backed the deal, which is expected to complete at the end of the third quarter, RBC said.
The premium ""demonstrates the attractiveness of the UK wealth market, with long-term, stable income streams and the potential for growth and higher operating margins"", Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. 
It is higher than the 2.4% of AUM that rival Bank of Nova Scotia paid for Jarislowsky Fraser and the 2.2% that Toronto-Dominion Bank paid for Greystone Capital Management, both in 2018, said Kingwest & Co Portfolio Manager Anthony Visano. 
But demand for such businesses has also increased recently, with banks and asset managers snapping up wealth management firms and direct investing platforms, using economies of scale to cut costs. 
RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay had said on its latest earnings call in February the bank was in ""active dialogues"" related to its search for commercial and wealth businesses in the United States and Europe.
Its wealth management unit accounted for about 28% of total revenues in its first fiscal quarter, although the bulk of that came from Canada and the United States.
Canada's Big Six banks, which hold about 90% market share at home, have been expanding outside their home markets. RBC's bid follows deals by TD to acquire First-Horizon Corp and Bank of Montreal's purchase of Bank of the West, both in the United States. 

Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) last year bought wealth management platform Embark, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) bought Nutmeg for 700 million pounds.

President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will soon require ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for fuel in roubles, raising alarm about a possible gas supply crunch in Europe.
Putin has ordered the Russian central bank and Gazprom to prepare the payment scheme by March 31 amid Western sanctions against Russia for its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Countries in the European Union, where Gazprom accounts for about 40% of gas supplies, have stated their refusal to pay for Russian gas in roubles.

Kommersant said Gazprom had declined to discuss the issue with the newspaper. Gazprom did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Kremlin's spokesman said on Wednesday that customers will not be obliged to switch to roubles as soon as Thursday as ""payments and delivery is a time-consuming process"". 
Germany, Russia's largest gas client, will continue to pay in euros or dollars, a government spokesman said on Wednesday, adding that Putin had told the German chancellor that nothing would change for European partners, despite his plan for rouble payments.

(Reuters) - Circle Internet Financial has selected Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp as primary custodian for its reserves of USD Coin, a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is directly pegged to the U.S. dollar, the crypto operator said on Thursday.
The new partnership will help link the traditional capital market with the market for digital assets, Circle said in a news release. 
As cryptocurrencies rise in popularity -- surpassing $3 trillion in value in November, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko -- the banking system is slowly warming to the idea of working more closely with digital currency companies. 
“We are at a point in the evolution of our industry where the digitization of assets is presenting new and exciting opportunities to a broad range of market participants,” Roman Regelman, BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer of asset servicing and head of digital, said in the release. 
Circle is the principal operator of USD Coin (USDC), which has a nearly $52.4 billion market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. 
The Boston-based company in February said it was valued at $9 billion under new deal terms with Concord Acquisition Corp, a blank-check firm. Blank-check firms, or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), are shell companies that raise funds through a listing to acquire a private company and take it public. 
Last summer, Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, chose BNY Mellon to run accounting and administration of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 

BNY Mellon also announced last year that it would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin for its asset management clients, in one of the first announcements of its kind by a major Wall Street bank. 
In January, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Emily Portney said in an interview that U.S. regulators should provide more clarity on the rules of the road for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets amid confusion over what activities are allowed.

(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc kept its 2022 earnings forecast unchanged even as it beat estimates for second-quarter results, sending the drugstore chain's shares down 7% on fears of slower-than-expected growth for the rest of the year. 
An Omicron-led surge in COVID-19 cases during the second quarter had boosted demand for vaccines and testing at Walgreens. But testing has slowed since January, Walgreens executives said, adding it remains a steady source of business as travel resumes.
Despite the rise of the highly transmissible Omicron sub-variant BA.2, health experts in the United States believe a new wave of infections appears unlikely as overall cases are declining from January's record highs.
Walgreens expects low-single digit growth in profit for 2022, implying it would earn between $1.69 and $1.79 per share in the second half of the year versus consensus estimates of $1.97, according to Evercore ISI. 
The company said its cautious forecast was due to increasing investments in its Walgreens Health unit, which it created earlier in fiscal year 2022. 
""These new investments, paired with tough sales and profit comparisons from last year's COVID-19 activities, could keep sales and profit growth muted for a while, assuming no pandemic resurgence,"" said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan.

""We emphasize SEDG's model (and our largely unchanged estimates) suggesting +60% top line growth in 2022 from 34% in 2021 with legs into 2023 as storage will be yet to hit a run rate fully burdened for Sella 2 capacity until then. But with growth beyond the legacy high margin resi segment (suggested at 40% GM) gross margins on a consolidated basis will fall, framing a clear bifurcation from SEDG's legacy peer Enphase. We acknowledge that some investors may struggle with this comp in particular but point to ~20% EBITDA margins in the outer years as sustainable alongside elevated growth aspirations (vs 13% in Q4),"" Dumoulin-Smith said in a client note.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee raised the price target to $439.00 per share (from $431.00) on the Buy-rated SEDG shares (on Conviction List) as strong growth is driven by robust solar demand and entry into new markets.
""Following SEDG's 2022 analyst day, we come away incrementally bullish on near-to-medium term demand trends and see growth momentum likely to persist long-term as SEDG expands its portfolio to large-scale solar applications as well as battery storage, in addition to others. To that end, SEDG provided updates to its long term financial targets, with annual revenue growth targets above expectations and with more specificity on product level gross margin targets. We believe the company's disclosure of >5.5GW of commercial shipments and backlog for 2022 is a particularly positive sign of robust growth this year, while lower gross margin owing to mix would appear to be offset by increased operating leverage with the net result being higher EPS power vs. our prior views despite more muted unit margins,"" Lee said.SEDG stock is up 1% today.

ALS is a relentlessly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by motor neuron death in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neuron loss in ALS leads to deteriorating muscle function, the inability to move and speak, respiratory paralysis, and eventually death.
The AMX0035 is a proprietary oral fixed-dose combination of two small molecules.
The panel said study data failed to prove that the drug was effective in fighting the disease. The phase-2 trial comprised 137 participants.
The recommendations by the panel are non-binding and the final decision regarding approval of a pending new drug application is likely to be made by the FDA by June 29.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday as economic data pointed to a dip in consumer spending, under the influence of rising inflation. 
Meanwhile, reports of continued intense hostilities in Ukraine also further eroded hopes for a quick end to the fighting there and the associated sanctions on Russia. Russia's President Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree earlier ordering that  'unfriendly' countries pay for Russian gas in roubles, a measure that puts it on a collision course with buyers in Europe such as Germany and Italy who have refused to do so.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 108 points, or 0.3% at 35,121 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite underperformed, sliding 0.5%, as a downgrade on market darling Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) prompted fresh caution with regard to the valuation of technology stocks that have recovered strongly in the last two weeks. AMD stock fell 5.7% as Barclays analysts cut their recommendation to 'equal weight' from 'overweight'.
Earlier, data showed that consumer spending dipped by 0.4% in inflation-adjusted terms in February, as the price index for personal consumer expenditures - widely seen as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - rose another 0.6%.
The figures also showed consumer spending patterns reverting to normal as the pandemic loosens its grip on economic life. Spending on services such as accommodation and restaurants rose, while spending on cars and consumer durables fell. 
Even so, data from the labor market gave little indication of a slowdown, ahead of Friday's monthly employment report. Initial jobless claims rose by a little more than expected to 202,000 but continuing claims fell to 1.307 million, their lowest in 60 years.
Energy stocks were among the outperformers in early trade, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries approved another 432,000 barrel-a-day increase in production from May 1, which will - at least notionally - complete the return of the bloc's production to pre-Covid levels. The world's largest exporters had taken 10 million barrels a day of output offline in 2020 as global demand cratered in the early stages of the pandemic. 
That news came just ahead of an announcement by U.S. President Joe Biden that the U.S. will release up to a million barrels of oil a day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next six months in an effort to tame rampant gasoline prices. 
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 0.8% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 2.9%.
Elsewhere, Chinese ADRs again came under pressure after the Securities and Exchanges Commission added search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) to the list of stocks that risks delisted from U.S. exchanges over their reporting standards. Baidu ADRs fell 6.8%, as did those of e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs fell 4.9%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain have warned the government that a plan to ban all Russians from holding more than 50,000 pounds ($65,430) in their accounts is illegal and unworkable, five sources said.
When Russia invaded Ukraine the government said that ""all Russians"" would be banned from holding large deposits at UK banks, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was part of a strategy aimed at isolating Moscow.
There are currently more than 70,000 Russian-born nationals living in Britain, government estimates show, and London has long been one of the top destinations for Russian money in Europe, with many elite families settling in the capital.
The banking industry sources told Reuters they feared the British proposals on Russian deposits would break equality laws, which forbid discrimination on the basis of nationality, in the latest challenge to rolling out sanctions against Moscow.
""What they are proposing is illegal, there's no question about it,"" said one bank executive, who has held talks with the government on the plans. ""This feels like a rushed announcement where the consequences haven't been thought through.""
A British government spokesperson declined to comment.
Britain is implementing what the government has called the biggest-ever raft of sanctions against Russia, including asset freezes and travel bans on hundreds of individuals and entities it has accused of propping up President Vladimir Putin. 
But some of those measures, such as the blanket ban on wealthy Russian savers, are still at the drawing board, fuelling doubts over the effectiveness of the UK's attempts to pressure Moscow and loosen connections to Russia that have led some to nickname its capital ""Londongrad"".
The bank deposit plan is the only measure that targets all Russians in Britain, not just those being directly sanctioned.
The banking sources said they have asked for reassurances that they will not be sued if they enforce the curbs, seen as one of the most far-reaching sanctions tabled since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, the sources said. 
Such reassurances, however, may not be possible without a change in the law and more than a month after the caps were proposed there have been no announcements about how they will work, including whether dual nationals would be hit or how multiple deposits across many banks would be handled. 
'NO LONGER WELCOME'
While the government has vowed to crack down on illicit Russian wealth, an increasing number of Russians who have not been sanctioned are concerned they will be swept up too.
One Russian national, who has worked in London for 16 years and is not the target of sanctions, said he would consider leaving if the plans were implemented.
""If this happens then the message is very clear that we are no longer welcome,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
European Union regulators have also told some banks in the bloc to scrutinise transactions by all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents, to ensure that they are not used to circumvent Western sanctions.
Russia says it launched a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine, while Western countries say that Moscow's aim was to swiftly topple the government in Kyiv.
One of the banking sources, who also asked not to be named, said talks were ongoing, but government officials had so far failed to provide any details on how to implement the bans. 
He said he was worried the restrictions could put his bank in breach of laws such as the Human Rights Act, which could lead to lawsuits and the possibility of compensation payouts. 
Bankers said they are willing to play their part in tackling oligarchs sympathetic to Putin but want the government to identify those people first.
All of the bank sources who spoke to Reuters said the plan would require significant updates to technology, account opening processes and may be too complex to implement.
Although customers are required to disclose residency when opening an account, this does not usually include providing data on nationality, one said. 

This means banks would need to ask all customers holding in excess of 50,000 pounds to supply details of their nationality in order to identify Russian customers. 
""We are obviously willing to work with the government to target oligarchs aligned with Putin,"" the source said. ""But we have reservations about how effective this would be in tackling those actors, whilst hurting the interests of innocent parties.""

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock traded 3.5% weaker in premarket Thursday after the U.S. securities regulator added its name to the list of companies that face the risk of being delisted.
The root of the case is in a 2020 U.S. law that mandates public companies to grant American authorities access to audit work papers. Firms face desilting in case of non-compliance for three straight years. Beijing has so far refused to permit U.S. officials to review their auditors’ work.
“Baidu has been actively exploring possible solutions. Baidu will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the United States, and strive to maintain its listing status on both Nasdaq and the HKEx,” the company said in a release.
Regulators in Beijing argue that their national security law prohibits them from turning over audit papers to U.S. regulators while the critics argue that Chinese firm get to enjoy access to cheap American capital without really following all the rules that other companies are subjected to.
Before this, there were five Chinese companies that were on the SEC list: BeiGene (NASDAQ:BGNE), Yum China (NYSE:YUMC),  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB), ACM Research Shanghai (NASDAQ:ACMR), and HUTCHMED (NASDAQ:HCM).
The SEC also added  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU), Nocera, CASI Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CASI) and Baidu’s video arm iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) to its provisional list for possible delisting.

The company reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $2.84, compared to the loss per share of 38c in the year-ago period and topping the consensus estimates of $2 per share. Revenue came in at $2.43 billion, up 16% YOY and above analyst expectations of $2.37.
The Calvin Klein brand generated sales of $991.6 million in the period, also above the consensus projection of $948 million. Calvin Klein International revenue totaled $616.6 million, missing the analyst consensus of $622.9 million.
Tommy Hilfiger reported total revenue of $1.3 billion. Comparable sales at Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger rose by 27% and 18%, respectively. PVH reported a Q4 gross margin of 58.3%, compared with the analyst estimates of 57.6%.
Moving forward, the company expects Q1 EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.6 and expects a relatively flat revenue growth. PVH also expects the effective tax rate in Q1 to be in the range of 29% to 30%. For the full-fiscal 2023, PVH expects EPS of roughly $9 and revenue growth in the range of 2% to 3%.
""As we look ahead, we are confident in the strength and momentum in our business and our ability to drive strong underlying top and bottom line growth by leaning in to what is within our control, despite the significantly increased macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility over the last few months, including the war in Ukraine, the impact of the global pandemic, and the inflationary pressures we see across our regions,"" said Stefan Larsson, CEO of PVH.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly C Greenberger downgraded PVH shares to Equal Weight from Overweight. A new price target is $89.00 per share, down from the prior $122.00.
The analyst expects to see range-bound trading amid a lack of near-term catalysts. Moreover, the EPS risk is heightened as 2H-weighted guide hinges on acceleration through the year.
The guidance is notably back-half weighted, which adds risk to full-year earnings, as it requires accurate forecasting into the future while the backdrop and economic forces remain volatile. All in, if the European situation proves more dynamic than currently contemplated, and/or if consumers are less receptive to ongoing price increases, PVH could observe an unexpected departure in earnings results relative to plan, Greenberger wrote in a memo.
Opposite of Greengerger, UBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated a Buy rating and his bullish stance on PVH with a new price target of $156.00 per share, down from $168.00.
""We think PVH has the brand strength and balance sheet to drive earnings growth over the long term, despite multiple macro headwinds. We forecast the company delivering a +DD% EPS CAGR post FY22. New CEO Stefan Larsson has only just begun executing his plan to improve PVH's profitability and we think there are major margin unlocks that will play out over the next few years,"" Sole wrote in the report.
PVH share price is down 1.5% in pre-open Thursday.

Other speciality lines likely to be affected by the conflict include cyber, political risk and marine war insurance, S&P said. 
The aviation market sees years of legal wrangling between lessors and insurers over planes trapped in Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions.
The world's top aircraft lessor AerCap has submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets stuck in Russia.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company PetroRio SA is close to agreeing on terms to purchase the Albacora Leste field from state-run oil company Petrobras, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, though talks around the neighboring Albacora field are proving more complex.
Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, has been in bilateral talks with PetroRio to sell off the two fields since November. It could be one of the last major divestments before a pivotal October presidential election. It would also be transformational for Rio de Janeiro-based PetroRio.
Both PetroRio and Petrobras declined to comment on the matter.
The Albacora field produced 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), according to documents released by Petrobras when the company launched the sale process in 2020. Albacora Leste produced 34,000 boepd at that time.
PetroRio produced roughly 31,600 boepd in 2021, according to the company, so a deal for one or both fields could roughly double or triple its output. Petrobras has publicly said it had received offers for the fields totaling more than $4 billion.
The two sides could agree on the terms for Albacora Leste as early as April, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential sale process.
However, talks for neighboring Albacora have been complicated by new information provided by Petrobras in December indicating the field holds more resources than previously estimated, the sources said.
Among the solutions proposed for Albacora are additional earnouts - provisions requiring future payments from PetroRio depending on the financial performance of the field - as well as a limited increase in the face value, said the sources. 

One of the sources, who is directly involved in the negotiations, said the two parties had discussed a face value increase in the range of 10% to 15%, although the two sides had not reached an agreement and any number was subject to ongoing modifications.
A potential agreement on Albacora may come after Albacora Leste. However, PetroRio remains strongly interested in both fields, said the same source.

(Reuters) - Ascent Resources LLC, one of the largest privately held U.S. natural gas producers, is preparing an initial public offering (IPO) it hopes will give it a market valuation of around $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Depending on timing, it would be the first major stock market listing of a U.S. shale operator since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February drove a spike in gas prices.
The ensuing stock market volatility that prevented many companies from launching an IPO is now subsiding and energy prices remain elevated, making it a favorable environment for Ascent to consider pursuing a listing.
The two private equity firms that own Ascent - the Energy & Minerals Group and First Reserve Corp - are working with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc to prepare for an IPO of Ascent, the sources said.
Bloomberg News reported last week that Ascent had held talks with  Gulfport Energy  (OTC:GPORQ) Corp, another U.S. natural gas exploration and production company, about a possible tie-up. The Reuters sources said discussions have happened sporadically since the end of 2021 and have consistently broken down as the sides were too far apart on valuation expectations.
Ascent may register its IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as early as April and could be ready for its stock market debut in New York in the second half of 2022, the sources added.
The sources cautioned that timing, valuation and whether the IPO takes place at all were subject to market conditions, and spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.
Ascent, Barclays, Citigroup, EMG, First Reserve and Gulfport all declined comment.

By listing Ascent on the stock market, the buyout firms would retain the option of finding a buyer for the company down the line. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, for example, clinched a $615 million deal last August to sell natural gas producer Vine Energy to Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK), only five months after the investment firm had listed Vine in New York.
Ascent produces gas from approximately 337,000 net acres in Ohio's Utica shale formation, according to its website. The company was founded in 2013 by EMG and First Reserve and late oilman Aubrey McClendon, who stepped away from Ascent a year later. It had $2.6 billion of debt at the end of 2021.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's H&M said on Thursday it would need to raise prices this year as it reported a December-February profit sharply below expectations amid high raw material and transportation costs.
The world's second-biggest fashion retailer swung to a pretax profit of 282 million crowns ($30.5 million) in its first quarter from a 1.4 billion loss a year earlier when nearly half of its stores were closed by the pandemic.
As well as missing the average analyst forecast for a 1.0 billion crown profit, the result was also far below the 2.5 billion crowns reached in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2020, sending H&M's shares down 10% by 1130 GMT.
""Sales and profits for the quarter were impacted by the negative effects of the pandemic in many of the group's major markets,"" H&M said in a statement, citing supply chain disruptions and delays, and a new wave of COVID-19 in some markets. 
Increased technology and supply chain related investments also weighed. 
""Looking at inflation it's primarily raw material and transportation costs that affect us and we see, as do many others, that we need to adjust our prices,"" CEO Helena Helmersson told Reuters. ""We'll raise different product types in different countries depending on competition and demand.""
The plan was for price hikes to be smaller than rivals', and not affect basic clothing ranges, she said in an interview. 
First-quarter sales were up 18% year-on-year in local currencies, H&M reported earlier, but still down from two years ago.
Sales growth in the March 1-28 period slowed substantially from the first quarter, to 6% in local currencies. 
Excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, where H&M has temporarily closed stores, the March increase was 11%. Russia last year accounted for 4% of group sales. 
""There is a continued uncertainty concerning developments and the company is monitoring and evaluating the situation continuously,"" H&M said on the Ukraine crisis. 
H&M said its collections had been well received in the first quarter, leading to a higher share of full-price sales than a year earlier, as well as in March. Helmersson said that in countries where spring had arrived, colourful clothes in particular were in demand. 

Biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, has weathered pandemic and global supply chain disruptions better than H&M. It grew sales 33% year-on-year, and 21% from the same period in 2019, in the six weeks from Feb. 1.

""We hope to be able to save around two-thirds of what would normally be possible,"" a spokesperson said on Thursday, referring to the Ukrainian crops harvest. ""We definitely don't expect a total failure.""
The Chinese-owned group, which aims to raise around $10 billion from an initial public offering, sells both crop protection products and seeds. 
It said it was now selling these at the price of cost in Ukraine to ensure as high a harvest as possible.
""We are on the brink of a global food crisis,"" CEO Erik Fyrwald said in a post LinkedIn, referring to the destruction of infrastructure, disruptions of transport and land and water contamination which he said were making it impossible for farmers to work.
Outside of conflict, the current growing season was also being affected by unprecedented floods, droughts and high levels of pest infestation, he said.
Ukraine is a major global agriculture producer and exporter, and Russia's invasion of the country is expected to sharply reduce the 2022 harvest, with Agriculture Minister Roman Leshchenko telling Reuters its spring crop sowing area may more than halve this year.
Syngenta employs around 730 people in Ukraine and about 800 in Russia. It said it has no plans to withdraw from Russia. Crop production is not subject to various sanctions imposed on Moscow.
On a revenue basis, it said Ukraine and Russia each accounted for less than 2% of group sales.
Across the group, it said fourth quarter sales increased by 17% to $7.2 billion as it benefited from farmers investing in seeds and sprays to boost production.
It said it had increased revenue generated from its training centres in China, where it added 167 new sites in 2021 to take its total to 492.
The sites train farmers in the latest agricultural techniques as well as supply equipment, seeds and pesticides.
Syngenta said it had continued to manage its supply chain in the face of procurement and other problems.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 4% to $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. 
Syngenta, which competes with Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), was bought by state-owned ChemChina for $43 billion in 2017, and is currently looking into a flotation.

An internal review had in February identified certain inaccurate statements and the company cut the base salaries of its Chief Executive Carsten Breitfield and founder Jia Yueting, asking them to report to newly appointed Executive Chairperson Susan Swenson.
The review by a special committee formed in November, however, rejected claims made by a short-seller that called the startup ""a new EV scam in town"", saying they were not supported by the evidence reviewed.
The startup said on Thursday it would miss the deadline for filing its 2021 annual report due to delays caused by the internal investigation. It had previously delayed the filing of its quarterly report in November. 

Several EV firms that went public via acquisition by special-purpose acquisition companies have faced regulatory scrutiny due to issues with accounting and claims they made.
Separately, Faraday Future said it expects operating loss to increase to about $186 million in the quarter-ended Sept. 30, from about $18 million a year earlier, mainly due to higher expense related to a production rampup at its Hanford, California facility.

Information about the March 21 crash, which killed all 132 people onboard, must be released in an open, timely and transparent manner, state media said in a report on the meeting of the seven-person Standing Committee of the Communist Party's politburo, China's top leadership.
A nationwide safety inspection should also be launched to prevent as much as possible the occurrence of safety accidents, state media said. If accidents do happen due to negligence, not only will the personnel in charge be punished, the relevant top officials will also be investigated, state media said. 
Earlier on Thursday, an aviation official said China has completed the main search and rescue work at the mountainside in southern China where the crash of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 happened, and a preliminary report is expected within 30 days of the disaster.
A final report into the crash will be completed and made public after the investigation is concluded, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) safety head Zhu Tao told reporters.
Citing the Standing Committee meeting, state media said all relevant parties investigating the crash are to gather experts to comprehensively analyse the aircraft's flight data and other evidence, and find out the cause and nature of the crash ""as soon as possible"". 
Under international rules, a 30-day report must be lodged with the U.N. aviation agency ICAO but it does not need to be public. A final report is due within a year of the crash, though sometimes it can take longer.
Zhu said authorities have done preliminary analyses of the crash, such as predicting the possible trajectory, position and impact force of the airplane when it hit the ground and reading data from air traffic control radar systems. 
CAAC investigators are also working to decode the data from both the black boxes, he added. 

Investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are set to travel to China to support the CAAC's investigation into mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years.
Over 40,000 pieces of aircraft wreckage and debris have been found and a majority of the pieces have been transported to a hangar, Zhu said.

The company operates five dark stores in London, with around 2,500 SKUs (stock keeping units). Customer retention is as high as 40%, which Yango Deli said is around 1.5 higher than the market average, according to its own estimates. 
The London unit is operated locally by Deli International Limited, a UK company.
YANDEX WOES
Nasdaq-listed and registered in the Netherlands, Yandex and its subsidiaries have so far avoided Western sanctions that have crippled Russia's access to global financial systems and supply chains. 
Former Deputy CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan quit after the European Union imposed individual sanctions on him, something Yandex said it had been shocked and surprised to learn. 

The EU has criticised Yandex for warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine of unreliable information on the internet.
Meanwhile, the company has flagged that it lacks funds to cover a potential convertible bond redemption due to a trading suspension of its Nasdaq-listed shares, while earlier in March a data leak exposed personal user data on its food delivery app, Yandex.Eda.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 08:20AM ET</span>",Global fund managers turned more defensive in March- Reuters poll,"By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund managers maintained a cautious stance in March, increasing recommended bond holdings and cash reserves and suggesting reduced equities exposure, a Reuters poll found. 
The March 21-31 survey captured this defensive strategy many fund managers adopted after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out. The February survey was taken partly before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion but had still hinted at caution.
Recommended equity allocations were lowered to an average of 48.5% of the model global portfolio of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan, the lowest since end-2020. It was at 49.5% in February.
Equity markets have suffered from speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates more aggressively than previously thought. 
But the S&P 500 has staged a quick rebound, up 11% since March 8, its biggest 15-day percentage gain since June 2020 when the market was recovering from a steep sell-off near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the last month, asset managers increased their cash buffer to 4.5%, from 4.2%, the highest since November 2020.
""Our view is markets are close to pricing in our central scenario, where the Federal Reserve continues on its policy tightening cycle and in turn reduces inflation without causing a significant growth slowdown,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at abrdn.
""However, we view risks as skewed to the downside, with risks of a global recession within the next two years as 20%-30%.""
The spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year Treasuries flashed signs of a recession on Tuesday when it briefly inverted before turning positive again.
This inversion, when sustained, has previously been an accurate predictor of recession.

Not all fund managers were as cautious, especially given the increase in inflation to multi-year highs in nearly every major economy. 
""In an inflationary environment, equities are the only large and liquid asset class accessible to all that can generate significant real returns,"" said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co.

Bloomberg reported that President Biden may invoke the Defense Production Act to encourage domestic production of key materials for EV batteries.
On how this may affect Tesla, Jonas writes:
""So where does Tesla fit in? Were not going to tell you that Tesla is a car company. Or a tech company. It's both. But it's also an energy company. And what we're seeing emerge over the course of this year is Tesla as a renewable energy on-shore infrastructure company. We believe Tesla's role in constructing the EV supply chain (upstream) and EV infrastructure (downstream) will become increasingly evident to the investment community over the next few weeks/months,"" Jonas said in a client note.
The analyst also reflected on the recent EV car sales numbers for February. Global sales rose 113% YoY with Tesla's market share at around 20%. This compares to a 12% market share last month and a 16% share YTD.
Currently, EV-Volumes suggests that Tesla has sold approx ~130k units through Feb with the last month of the quarter always the biggest push and contribution to units for the company in the Q. Below are forecasts that we've compiled from various sources. Note: last year Tesla delivered 184,877 units in 1Q so these forecasts imply around 72-78% YoY growth, Jonas added.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded 0.3% higher in Thursday’s premarket, shrugging off the company’s decision to delay the resumption of production at its Shanghai plant.
Production of Model 3 and Model Y cars at the company’s factory in Pudong district, east of the city's Huangpu River, was suspended Monday after the city’s authorities launched a two-stage lockdown to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases. The production was expected to resume Friday.
While the lockdown is set to be lifted Friday, a Reuters report said the company had yet to secure permits from the Shanghai government for its trucks to deliver assembled electric cars outside of Pudong to western parts of the city.
Shanghai is set to lock down areas west of the river from the early hours of Friday morning, the report said.
Shortage of workers could also be behind the company’s decision to put off the production, it said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP is preparing to battle a resurrected 5 billion pound ($6.6 billion) lawsuit in London's Court of Appeal next week, launched by around 200,000 Brazilians over a devastating dam failure in 2015.
The claim, one of the largest in English legal history, seeks to hold BHP to account for the disaster in English courts, emulating lawsuits brought in London against miner Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) and oil giant Shell (LON:RDSa) by villagers over alleged pollution in Zambia and oil spills in the Niger delta respectively. 
The Vedanta case has since settled.
The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, ranks as Brazil's worst environmental disaster. 
Nineteen were killed and villages obliterated as a torrent of more than 40 million cubic metres of mining waste swept into the Doce river and Atlantic Ocean over 650 km (400 miles) away.
Tom Goodhead, a managing partner at law firm PGMBM, which is bringing the claim on behalf of individuals - including indigenous people - businesses, churches, organisations and municipalities, told Reuters the team was ""very confident"".
About 120,000 claimants had been to walk-in centres in Brazil to update their details in recent months, he said, and another potential 100,000 new clients wanted to join.
BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value, has labelled the case pointless and wasteful, saying it duplicates proceedings in Brazil and the work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the company and its Brazilian partners to manage reparations and repairs.
The company says it is fully committed to ""doing the right thing"" and has paid nearly 9 billion reais ($1.89 billion) in compensation and direct financial aid to over 360,000 people and will have spent roughly 30 billion reais on reparation and compensation programmes by year-end.
Claimant lawyers argue that most clients have not brought proceedings in Brazil or sought compensation that excludes them from English proceedings and that Brazilian litigation is so lengthy it cannot provide full redress in a realistic timeframe.
But Goodhead conceded the case had been a rollercoaster.
It was blocked by the English High Court in 2020 and, one year later, by the Court of Appeal, which initially agreed it would be ""irredeemably unmanageable"".
But after a last-ditch oral hearing, Court of Appeal judges last July made a rare U-turn, stating the case had a ""real prospect of success"".
The five-day hearing, which begins on Monday, will help establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judgment is expected to be reserved - and the case could be appealed to the Supreme Court. 
Further trials will determine liability and quantify damages in the absence of any settlement.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stock traded 1.6% lower in premarket Thursday after the drug store chain posted disappointing second quarter revenue.
While overall sales rose 3% to almost $34 billion, decline in sales at its AllianceRx Walgreens business hurt the pharmacy retailer. Pharmacy sales fell 3.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by as much as 9.1 percentage points due to the AllianceRx Walgreens business.
The company completed the consolidation of AllianceRx Walgreens on December 31, it said in a release.
Overall sales benefited from an Omicron-led demand for COVID-19 vaccination and testing. A fresh spike in cases in January helped it administer about 11.8 million vaccines and 6.6 million tests in the second quarter.
U.S. retail comparable sales grew almost 15% and was the highest in over 20 years. Digital sales in its largest market were up 38%, boosted by same-day pick-up orders.
Adjusted net profit was about 26% higher at $1.4 billion in the second quarter ended February 28.
The company said the strategic review of the Boots business is progressing. It plans to sell the U.K.’s largest drugstore chain and, according to reports, has offers from Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners.
The company is maintaining its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of low-single-digit growth.

The strategist says that the rebound that we have seen is more rational than it might appear at first glance. He adds that many investors seemed to have missed out on this rally, which left them somewhat puzzled.
Oppenheimer lists 7 reasons why stocks are trading higher in recent days.
Still, the strategist sees little near-term upside for equities given that GS year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 4700.
While equities should provide a hedge against inflation over the medium term, and should outperform bonds, there remain risks to the downside and more volatility, particularly related to growth risks, Oppenheimer wrote in a client note.
He continues to see a fat & flat market where returns are lower than in the post-financial crisis era. Goldman Sachs assigns a 25-30% risk of recession in the US over the next year.
In the short term, Q2 macro data and the upcoming earning season will be particularly important data points for investors... Under a recession scenario, the S&P 500 could fall to 3,600, or 22% below today's level. Client conversations reveal a notable lack of conviction or enthusiasm for US equities at current valuation levels (P/E of 21x our 2022 EPS forecast of $221) given the slowing economy and rising rate environment. We would see more downside risks in many other markets, the strategist concluded.

Net loss in the period totaled $42.9 million. The gross margin in Q4 stood at 67.2%, above the consensus projection of 65%.

For the full-fiscal 2023, the cloud-based software company expects revenue in the range of $338 million to $342 million, topping the consensus estimate of $330.3 million. Adjusted loss per share for the full year is estimated to range from 80c to 84c, compared with the analyst expectations of loss per share of 92c.

SHANGHAI/Hong Kong (Reuters) - China's securities regulator said on Thursday both China and the United States have a willingness to solve their audit disputes, and the outcome depends on the wisdom of both parties.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said whether Chinese companies listed in the United States are delisted in the future depends on the progress and results of the audit and regulatory cooperation between the two countries.
This came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday added five companies, including iQIYI Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), into the latest batch of stocks facing delisting risks from the United States.
Baidu and its streaming affiliate iQIYI said on Thursday they have been actively exploring possible solutions, and they will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the United States.
The CSRC chairman Yi Huiman and his counterpart, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, have held three virtual meetings since last August to discuss a resolution for the legacy issues in coordinated audit of companies, said a statement issued on CSRC's website. 
China has also held multiple rounds of frank, professional and productive meetings with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the statement said. 
The process is smooth in general and will continue. Both sides are willing to solve the disagreements and problems. ""But the outcome will depend on wisdom and the original will of both sides,"" it said.
The statement came after Gensler pushed back speculation of an imminent deal to be reached between the two sides that would avoid any trading suspension of around 200 Chinese companies listed in the United States.
Gensler said U.S. law gives him little room for compromise, during an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, and said the result of the negotiations is ""up to the Chinese authorities"".
The long-running Sino-U.S. audit stand-off has put hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in Chinese companies at stake.
Washington is demanding complete access to the audit papers for U.S.-listed Chinese companies but Beijing bars foreign inspection of local accounting firms’ work. 
In December, the U.S. SEC finalised rules to delist Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), and said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without naming them.
By Thursday, 11 U.S. listed Chinese companies had been identified by the U.S. regulator as carrying risks under the HFCAA.

""The U.S. side has made a case that it is treating everybody equally with its Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. And it is becoming increasingly clear that China is unlikely to ask for an exception,"" said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co.
Hong Kong shares of Baidu closed down 3.2% on Thursday, while the Hang Seng Tech Index lost 1.4%.

The company may have also opted to extend the suspension because of a shortage of workers, with lockdowns continuing on some housing compounds, one of the sources said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its plans to delay resumption of production until after April 2.
It told Reuters earlier on Thursday that it strictly implemented China's epidemic prevention and control requirements and would adjust its work based on the government's COVID-19 prevention policies.

PATH posted a broadly solid 4Q beating Street, but FY23 outlook disappoints.

TURIN (Reuters) -A Stellantis van plant in Russia will have to close shortly as it is running out of parts, the company's chief executive Carlos Tavares said on Thursday.
The world's fourth largest carmaker has previously said it had suspended all exports and imports of vehicles with Russia, where it operates a van-making plant in the city of Kaluga, in partnership with Mitsubishi. 
Production in Kaluga remains for the local market at the moment, following last month's Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking at a news conference, Tavares did not say whether the company was considering a writedown of the value of Kaluga or feared it could be seized by Moscow if operations halted.
Stellantis earlier this month presented its first business plan, just over a year after it was formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA.
Tavares said the group's focus was on executing the plan and it was not looking at major M&A deals.
""We always look at what is in the market, but don't need M&A, this is very clear,"" he said.
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Addressing a supply crisis that has hurt the car industry, Tavares said Stellantis expected to be able to source computer chips from Europe and the United States within 3-4 years.
""We will have to find another way to adapt the supply chain, we have several initiatives to create local sourcing of semiconductors,"" added Tavares, the head of a company whose brands include Jeep, Maserati, Citroen and Opel. 
Tavares said the technology underpinning the shift to electric mobility was not yet finalised, making it hard for automakers to plan and secure future supplies of raw materials.

""We're moving down the supply chain, we have sealed a deal to secure lithium for instance, but we need to do more,"" he said. ""What the ending point is for the chemistry of battery cells is not yet clear. When technology is rather definitive, we'll be able to lock raw material supply through investments, deals, M&A.""
Tavares said carmakers needed to cut the costs of electric vehicles over the next 4-5 years and called on governments to help with the effort.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Analysis-Governments want COVID vaccine developers to aim higher in hunt for better shots,"By Ludwig Burger and Emilio Parodi
(Reuters) - As governments prepare to live with COVID-19, some are questioning how much to rely on drugmakers to adapt vaccines to ward off future virus variants amid signs of tension between companies and regulators over the best approach, according to several sources familiar with the matter.
Some vaccine experts say government agencies should fund and help develop a new generation of COVID shots, and seek innovation from smaller developers, as they did to identify current vaccines.
""We have established a research infrastructure that could do this relatively reasonably rapidly if we primed the pump and created the same kind of plan for second-generation vaccines as we did for the first-generation vaccines,"" Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist who is overseeing U.S. government-backed COVID vaccine trials, told Reuters.
BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), who developed the western world's most widely used COVID vaccine, recently clashed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) over the best strategy for developing a new vaccine against the Omicron variant, and whatever may follow, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
An EMA spokesperson said the agency, along with other regulators, are encouraging companies to explore vaccines that target multiple variants.
In January, BioNTech and Pfizer began testing a vaccine designed to target Omicron alone, believing the best approach is to tackle one major new variant at a time.
They had said a modified vaccine may not be necessary even after emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron late last year led to a record surge in infections.
EMA regulators pressed the drugmakers to give equal priority to a vaccine targeting multiple variants, figuring that would offer broader protection against future mutations, the sources said. One of the sources said EMA would not signal whether the current vaccine trials will be enough to warrant approval even if the companies demonstrate safety and immune response. 
On Wednesday, BioNTech said the companies would broaden their trial to test a shot targeting Omicron and the original version of the coronavirus.
BioNTech said it decided to test a combination shot to scientifically validate decisions on the best vaccine strategy for the near future.
A BioNTech spokesperson declined to comment on the company's discussions with EMA. A Pfizer spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which has also enjoyed great success with its COVID vaccine, is testing a shot that targets Omicron and the original coronavirus, aiming to have it ready in the fall. 
""We believe this may lead to the best breadth in protection,"" top Moderna scientist Jacqueline Miller said at a company event this month.
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is also working with German biotech CureVac on a vaccine that targets multiple coronavirus variants.
'WE NEED TO DO BETTER'
European and U.S. public health officials are pushing for better tools to fight COVID. Current vaccines are very effective against severe disease and death, but no longer against transmission, and immunity levels tend to wane within months.
Some health officials question whether companies that have reaped tens of billions of dollars from first-generation COVID shots and stand to earn billions more from repeated boosters are willing to spend the money to find vaccines offering much broader and longer-lasting protection, which could take years.
Pfizer and BioNTech say their decisions are led by scientific findings.
Any new and innovative approach may come from smaller companies that will need funding for early development work, said Corey, from Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.
""We need to do better, and we need to fund that,"" Corey said, adding that a new generation of COVID vaccines could be supported by about $2 billion in funding. The European Union made a massive bet on future Pfizer/ BioNTech shots in a deal worth up to 35 billion euros ($39.04 billion). That agreement requires the drugmakers to revise their shots to deal with new variants.
EU member states have also expressed interest in shots targeting multiple variants. ""The message they've sent to the companies is 'give us more options,'"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said. The international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which helped fund early research into some existing vaccines, has $200 million available for next-generation vaccine research. It has awarded small grants to manufacturers including the UK's DIOSynVax and MigVax of Israel.
Among the major Western COVID vaccine makers, Pfizer and BioNTech appear furthest along in redesigning their shot.
In late January, they launched a clinical trial testing immune responses to a vaccine targeting Omicron in unvaccinated people, and as a booster in those fully vaccinated. Results are expected in April.
BioNTech has argued that laboratory analyses by other researchers showed that exposure to Omicron in previously vaccinated people leads to a broad immune response against major prior coronavirus variants, the sources said.

Lab tests of a BioNTech/Pfizer shot targeting the earlier Alpha and Delta variants yielded an immune response inferior to what would be expected from a single-variant vaccine, they added.
A combination vaccine could raise other difficulties, including exacerbating temporary side effects seen with current shots, GSK said. Cutting the dose to avoid that could jeopardize efficacy, but GSK said it was working on that.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – H & M (ST:HMb) stock plunged 10% in Stockholm trading Thursday after the fashion retailer reported earnings that were way off expectations for the first quarter.
At one point, the stock traded at a two-year low. The results were weighed down by multiple headwinds including the Russia-Ukraine war, China lockdowns and investments in technology and the supply chain.
In the quarter through February, while the group swung to a pretax profit of 282 million crowns ($30 million) from a loss of 1.39 billion a year earlier, it was well short of the 1.05 billion crown profit analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast.
“Sales and profits for the quarter were impacted by the negative effects of the pandemic in many of the group's major markets,"" H&M said in a statement, citing supply chain disruptions and delays, and a new wave of Covid-19 in some markets.
The retailer has paused sales in Russia, its sixth-biggest market, accounting for about 4% of total revenue. H&M had 227 stores closed as of Wednesday, most of them in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Excluding those three countries, revenue rose 11% in March, the news wire said.
The company has also faced the brunt of Covid-related lockdowns in China, one of its biggest markets. China follows a zero-Covid policy and the strict rules there are hurting retailers badly. Some of the retailers have also suffered due to a rising sentiment against foreign labels in the world’s second largest economy.
In the quarter, sales rose 23% year-on-year to 49.16 billion Swedish crowns, but were still down 11% compared to the same period two years ago.
H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), said sales during March 1-28, were up just 6% in local currencies.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 05:28AM ET</span>",Giga-casting and robots: How Volkswagen's Trinity aims to catch up with Tesla,"By Victoria Waldersee, Jan Schwartz and Nadine Schimroszik
BERLIN (Reuters) - As Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) kicks off production at its new German plant this month, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is weeks away from finalising plans for a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) electric vehicle (EV) factory that it hopes will bring it up to speed with its U.S. rival.
Tesla says it can already churn out a Model Y in 10 hours at its new Giga Berlin-Brandenburg factory in Gruenheide near the German capital, whereas it can take Volkswagen three times as long to make its ID.3 electric car.
The German auto giant now aims to slash production times with its ""Trinity"" EV plant, which should be up and running in 2026, by using techniques such as large die casting and cutting the number of components in its cars by several hundred.
""Our goal is clear: we want to set the standard with our production,"" Volkswagen brand production chief Christian Vollmer told Reuters in an interview. ""If we can get to 10 hours, we have achieved something big.""
The carmaker has been improving productivity at a rate of about 5% a year but must take bigger leaps to keep its upper hand in the European market, Vollmer said, without providing a new percentage target.
Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest carmaker behind Japan's Toyota with a stable of brands from Skoda, Seat and VW to Audi, Porsche and Bentley has a 25% share of the European EV market, ahead of Tesla on 13%. 
But the pressure on German carmakers to both master and ramp up EV production has been intensified by Tesla's presence in the country and Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess has warned Germans must speed up to avoid getting beaten on their own turf.
'IGNITED THE DRIVE'
Volkswagen's goals align with a wider trend in the industry of simplifying product ranges and streamlining production as carmakers scramble to find the cash to fund the electric transition - and keep up with rivals like Tesla that don't have to juggle making EVs as well as cars with combustion engines.
""Tesla really ignited the drive for reducing part counts and making simpler products,"" Evan Horetsky, a partner at McKinsey who was formerly in charge of engineering at Tesla's new Brandenburg plant, said. ""Legacy manufacturers have a more difficult time because they have to maintain current orders.""
A Tesla spokesperson said one of the reasons it can produce its Model Y vehicles in Germany within a 10-hour time frame is because it is uses two giant casting presses, or giga-presses, applying 6,000 tonnes of pressure to make the rear of the car.
Its Gruenheide press shop can produce 17 components in under six minutes. With six more giga-presses on the way, Tesla will soon be making the front of the car with the giga-press too.
""That's why we're so fast,"" the spokesperson said.
The giga-casting technique that VW plans to adopt was popularised by Tesla as an alternative to the more labour-intensive method of assembling multiple stamped metal panels with crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash.
German luxury carmaker BMW has rejected large castings in the past on the grounds that the higher costs of repair outweigh the lower manufacturing costs. 
But advocates say automated driving technology will reduce the frequency of accidents: ""Tesla is designing a vehicle that most likely won't be in a severe crash,"" Cory Steuben, president of manufacturing consulting firm Munro & Associates, said.
'HUMAN-ROBOT COOPERATION'
While VW can produce certain models such as the Tiguan or Polo in 18 and 14 hours in Germany and Spain respectively, its electric ID.3 - made in a factory juggling six models from three Volkswagen brands - still takes 30 hours to put together.
At the Trinity plant, multiple work steps will be condensed into one through automation, shrinking the size of the body shop and reducing the number of jobs requiring uncomfortable physical labour, Vollmer said, dubbing it an expansion of ""human-robot cooperation"".
Volkswagen does not plan to have giga-presses at the new plant in Wolfsburg and will instead use the equipment at its factory in Kassel about 160 km (100 miles) away and transport the products by train.
U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicts that Tesla's Gruenheide factory will produce about 54,000 cars in 2022, 280,000 in 2023 and then 500,000 by 2025. 
Volkswagen, which delivered some 452,000 battery-electric vehicles globally last year, has not yet set an output target for Trinity, which will use its Scalable Systems Platform. 
It aims to build 40 million vehicles worldwide on the new platform - which combines multiple internal combustion engine and electric platforms into one – with half of its global output all-electric by 2030.
Tesla, which produced 936,000 cars last year, has said it aims to put 20 million on the road a year by the end of the decade, or roughly double the current annual production of Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker now.
Still, Tesla can expect numerous challenges as it expands in Germany, from securing more water supplies to environmental groups angry about light pollution and congestion near the plant to unions worried about a management-heavy works council and wages being driven down by workers coming in from elsewhere. 

""Starting production is nice, but volume production is the hard part,"" Musk told a cheering audience at a festival at the plant site in October 2021. ""It will take longer to reach volume production than it took to build the factory.""

1321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 05:27AM ET</span>",Goldman’s Oppenheimer Sees U.S. Stock Rally Running Out of Steam,"(Bloomberg) -- The rebound in equities may not have much further to go, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UBS Global Wealth Management warned on Thursday, as markets in Europe and the U.S. are set to end their first month in the green for this year.
“To be clear, we see little upside now in the shorter term,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS GWM, concurred, saying “our base case now is for only modest upside for stocks.” 
Both Goldman and UBS GWM have a year-end target of 4,700 index points for the S&P 500, less than 2% higher from current levels for the U.S. benchmark. They also both see the gauge dropping by around 22% to 3,600 index points in a downside scenario. 
While developed markets have recouped the losses seen after Russia invaded Ukraine, they are still below their January records. The lackluster performance follows a strong rally on the back of a post-pandemic economic rebound that saw major indexes climb to successive highs. 
UBS GWM said its cautious view “partly reflects risks to corporate profits,” while Goldman’s team said “client conversations reveal a notable lack of conviction or enthusiasm for U.S. equities at current valuation levels,” citing a “slowing economy and rising rate environment.” 
Generali Investments echoed the pessimism: “We see little value in chasing the March equity market rebound at this level of valuation,” the firm said in its quarterly outlook. “The sharp fall in equity volatility relative to bond volatility is not sustainable.”
Still, while the rally may be running out of steam, both Goldman and UBS GWM see opportunities for investors, with the latter recommending a focus on energy, food, data, and climate -- areas which are set to benefit from a renewed focus on security and stability in the aftermath of the war.
For Goldman’s team, instead of playing specific styles such as growth versus value stocks, investors must look for individual companies “that can innovate, disrupt, enable and adapt” and focus on margins.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 05:16AM ET</span>",New company sustainability standards body drafts first guidelines,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A new global standard setter for company sustainability reporting set out its first draft guidelines on Thursday, entering a crowded field as trillions of dollars pour into investments marketed as ""green.""
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published two draft standards for public consultation until July 29 ahead of formal adoption by the end of the year.
The move is backed by world leaders, top investors and regulators, who want a more rigorous international approach to corporate sustainability disclosures which replaces a patchwork of standards. There are also growing calls to combat the risk of greenwashing, or exaggerated sustainability claims by companies.
The ISSB has proposed two new standards, which countries will decide whether to make mandatory.
The first sets out general sustainability related financial disclosures.
The second details specific climate-related disclosure requirements covering ""Scope 1-3,"" meaning data on the company's direct emissions, indirect emissions from purchased energy, and indirect emissions from a company's value chain, such as raw material suppliers.
Critics have argued the ISSB is being less ambitious the European Union, whose rules also require disclosures on a company's own impact on the environment, known as double materiality.
ISSB Vice Chair Sue Lloyd said the ISSB standards seek to meet the needs of investors who want to know the impact of sustainability factors on a company's enterprise value, meaning the value of its shares and net debt.
The ISSB draft standards ultimately capture the impact of a company on the environment given that polluting results in fines and potential customer boycotts which affect profitability, Lloyd said.
""When a company is doing things to people, the planet, the environment which are having impacts, much of that will affect its enterprise value,"" Lloyd said.
The ISSB can work in tandem with the EU norms, she said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also proposed disclosure rules for listed companies which are very similar to the draft ISSB standards, Lloyd said.
""We will be working with the SEC and the EU to try to bring our proposals even closer together,"" Lloyd said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.
Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and imposed billions of euros in fines.
The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.
The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.
""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.
""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said. 

Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.
Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday at the end of a turbulent month, with investors carefully watching developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict as well as volatile energy prices. 
By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%.
The lack of a substantial breakthrough in talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war triggered by the Russian invasion in late February resulted in weakness in Europe Wednesday.
The tone has since improved, with Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia saying Thursday that officials from Russia and Ukraine are set to resume talks via video conference on Friday.
He added that the hope was to have enough agreed on paper in another week to be able to move toward a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
European stocks have suffered a very difficult quarter, with the DAX down over 8% year-to-date and both the CAC 40 and the broad-based Stoxx 600 nearly 6% lower, as the war in Ukraine put upward pressure on commodity prices, increasing stagflation fears.
Some of those concerns lessened Thursday, after oil prices slumped following reports that the U.S. is considering a massive release of crude from emergency reserves over several months in order to tackle prices which have climbed above $100 a barrel in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Biden administration could make the announcement later Thursday, the reports said, with the total release from the country’s strategic petroleum reserve potentially as much as 180 million barrels.
The International Energy Agency has also called an emergency ministerial meeting for Friday, amid speculation the Paris-based organization will attempt to coordinate a global release by other countries.
This news has overshadowed a meeting, scheduled for later in the session, of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which is expected to stick to an existing deal of increasing oil production by around 400,000 barrels per day through May.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.4% lower at $103.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3.5% to $107.53. 
Back in Europe, fourth quarter U.K. gross domestic product rose by 1.3% on the quarter, up 6.6% on the year, more than expected, while German retail sales rose 0.3% on the month in February. 
French consumer prices rose 4.5% from a year ago in March, the most since the data series began in 1997. This sets the scene for Friday’s Eurozone CPI release, which is expected to soar to 6.6%, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to act.
In corporate news, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stock rose 0.7% after the German drugmaker said it would invest around 2 billion euros ($2.23 billion) over the next three years, mainly to bolster production of biotechnology drugs as well as cell and gene therapies.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A quarter for the ages,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Saikat Chatterjee.
Whether you are a macro-guru or an astute stock picker, this is a quarter that most investors would like to forget. 
Most consensus trades coming into 2022 including long value stocks, yield curve steepeners and buying euros have been crushed. Not only world stocks have witnessed the most gut-wrenching volatility in years, the first three months of the year has fuelled the strongest commodities rally since World War I and the fastest rise in global interest rates in decades. 
But as the dust settles on the first quarter, stock markets are slowly finding their feet. U.S. stocks are back to within 5% of the all-time high struck on January 4.
A global stock index will end the quarter down around 4%, its worst performance since the pandemic crash two years ago but well above the 14% year-to-date drop only two weeks ago. 
Bond and currencies have fared worse. A Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) U.S. Treasuries index is on track for its worst quarterly performance in 25 years while the Japanese yen has declined a whopping 6% in the last three months, a speed of decline only rivaled by the British pound after the Brexit referendum vote. Volatility has soared across asset classes.
But taking the 30,000 feet view above the quarterly market performance, some longer term trends are emerging. Russia's invasion of Ukraine means global supply chains will remain under pressure for the forseeable future and global policymakers will struggle to control rampant inflation without choking growth.
For now, markets are taking the optimistic view. U.S. and European stock futures are higher and oil prices lower on signs the Biden administration is considering a massive release of crude oil from U.S. reserves to combat inflation.
However, a slide in Chinese stocks as output data reflect the damage of renewed lockdowns in technology and factory hubs weighed on Asian markets. Treasuries added to price gains, while a portion of the curve has pulled out of a brief inversion that raised concerns about an impending recession.

The group added that Marjan Rintel would replace Pieter Elbers as CEO of its Dutch arm KLM from July 1.
""These two decisions by the Board of Directors stabilise the governance of the group at a key moment in its history,"" Chairwoman Anne-Marie Couderc said in a statement.
Rintel previously held executive roles in Air France-KLM and is currently head of the NS, Netherland's leading passenger railway operator.

The group's board had decided in January against renewing Elbers' mandate for a third term.
Smith has helmed Air France-KLM since 2018 and through the coronavirus pandemic, during which the company received billions in state aid and announced large-scale job cuts.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 02:15AM ET</span>",Global M&A hits the skids as Ukraine war saps confidence,"By Anirban Sen and Pamela Barbaglia
(Reuters) - The value of global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity took a 29% hit in the first quarter of 2022 as market volatility fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed the brakes on last year's breakneck pace of dealmaking.
Overall deal volumes fell to $1.01 trillion from $1.43 trillion in the first quarter of 2021, according to Dealogic data, dragged down by a similar 29% drop in crossborder transactions, as geopolitical tensions forced large companies across borders to take a pause and postpone their pursuit of large strategic buyouts.
""The rising cost of energy, the dislocation of supply chains and higher inflation are key factors impacting both corporate and private equity clients today,"" said Dwayne Lysaght, co-head of EMEA M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
North America accounted for more than half of first quarter deal activity, even though volumes fell 28%, while Asia Pacific activity dropped 33% to $184.2 billion.
European volumes were down 25% to $227.67 billion.
Dealmakers said first quarter activity suffered from sky-high comparisons to last year's record-breaking volumes which were hard to replicate.
""While execution has become a bit harder due to the increased volatility and macro concerns, that hasn't stopped new activity,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Major deals during the quarter included Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $75 billion and European telecom firms Orange and MasMovil combination of their Spanish businesses through a 19.6 billion euros ($21.87 billion) joint venture.
Dealmakers said stock market volatility made it tougher for the world's largest companies to use the might of their market capitalization to buy up smaller rivals.
""In this moment of dislocation, the volatility has greatly affected the use of stock,"" said Cary Kochman, co-head of global M&A at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). ""This is not a frenzied market any longer.""
But for all its challenges the overall environment for buyouts remains robust.
""We're taking a glass half-full approach - while we're seeing volumes down, it still has a pace that looks very similar to 2016 through 2019,"" said Kevin Brunner, co-head of global M&A at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The number of transactions worth more than $10 billion was up to 13 from 12 in the same quarter of last year, signaling that companies and private equity firms did not shy away from pursuing larger deals, despite the broader market turmoil.
With debt still relatively cheap compared to historical levels, private equity buyouts remained at healthy levels, accounting for $204.47 billion of total volumes.
""You're going to see private equity M&A continue to make up a larger portion of the M&A activity overall as the dry powder to deploy remains at record levels,"" said Jim Langston, co-head of U.S. M&A at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.
Direct lenders stepped in aggressively during the first quarter to help finance large leverage buyouts as some traditional lenders shied away from assuming higher leverage risk due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
""There is a lot of focus on public-to-private transactions but as we learnt in the last 24 months this type of deals pose a higher execution risk and not all of them will go through. However, while more expensive, the financing to take companies off the public markets is still available,"" said Simona Maellare, global co-head of UBS' Alternative Capital Group.
HEALTHCARE SLUMP
Dealmaking in the technology sector continued to lead the way, even though overall volumes were lower compared to last year.
Real estate was one of the few sectors where dealmaking jumped significantly, with volumes up 47%, as employees across the world returned to working from offices, thus making commercial property more appealing to buyers.
Healthcare activity, which typically accounts for a big share of deals, slumped by more than half, as large pharma companies adopted a more cautious strategic approach due to the market volatility caused by the geopolitical tensions.
While a number of blue-chip companies rushed to exit Russia and shied away from using their cash piles for large buyouts, activist investors stepped up the pressure on boards to pursue sale processes or break-ups to unlock more value for investors at a time when public market valuations are at lower levels.
""Companies across many industries believe that their business model needs to change dramatically in the foreseeable future, mostly because of the impact of technology but also for several other sector-specific reasons,"" said Pier Luigi Colizzi,  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' head of investment banking for continental Europe and co-head of EMEA M&A.
Going forward dealmakers said boards will remain cautious when pursuing large transformational deals and will need to factor in their companies' exposure to gas and commodities prices.
They expect deal activity to pick up again once geopolitical tensions are resolved, although deals are likely to be smaller in size.

""This is just a moment where I predict that you won't see an outbreak of $75 billion plus transactions,"" said Citi's Kochman.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 02:11AM ET</span>","Analysis-Cyber insurers face hefty Ukraine war-related claims, despite fine print","By Carolyn Cohn and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers face potential multi-billion dollar claims for cyber attacks related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite policy wording designed to get them off the hook for war, industry sources say.
Following the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine and Western sanctions against Moscow, the U.S. government said last week it had seen ""preparatory"" Russian hacking activity aimed at numerous U.S. companies, though it said it had ""no certainty"" such an attack would occur.
Western financial regulators have already warned banks of the risks of cyber attacks though none have been confirmed so far. 
European and U.S. insurers, already facing mounting losses in the past year, have been driving up premiums due to the increased coverage cost and prevalence of so-called ransomware attacks.
If Russia carries out a large cyber attack which spills over into several countries, it could lead to claims totalling $20 billion or more, similar to insurance claims from a large U.S. hurricane, the industry sources said on condition of anonymity.
This comes as insurers also face losses related to the conflict in other business sectors such as aviation, which is seen as particularly exposed to the impact of what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine.
Lloyd's of London, one of the world's biggest players in cyber and other commercial insurance policies, said last week that it faced ""major"" claims from the invasion.. 
Cyber insurance - whose market ratings agency Fitch says totalled over $2.7 billion in 2020 in the United States alone - covers a business for the repair of hacked networks, business interruption losses and also cyber ransom payments. 
Such policies do not cover war, or attacks by so-called ""state-sponsored actors"". 
It is often hard, however, to identify the perpetrator of a cyber attack.
""Defining what is state-sponsored is quite challenging,"" Lloyd's of London chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters last week. ""These policies get tested by new events and we need to work through the wording...and make sure our customers understand where they are covered and where they aren't.""
AMBIGUITIES
Even if insurers can prove a cyber attack was a result of the conflict in Ukraine, war exclusions may not be enough to protect them.
Cyber insurers have become more aware of ambiguities in their insurance in recent years, but some are slower to adapt than others.
Policy wordings vary from insurer to insurer, and are open to interpretation, said Marcos Alvarez, head of insurance at ratings agency DBRS Morningstar. 
This is expected to lead to disagreements between insurers and policyholders about whether or not there is coverage, similar to business interruption insurance cases which have gone to court across the world since the outbreak of COVID-19.
A particular grey area is over cyber terror attacks, which are generally covered by insurance.
Terror is typically more narrowly defined than war, but Westlaw, a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) company, said in a note last week that ""cyber terrorism"" is sometimes defined ""quite broadly to include any attack against a computer system with the 'intent to cause harm' in furtherance of 'social, ideological, religious, economic or political objectives'"".
Policyholders could end up being covered ""quite expansively"" by cyber or cyber terrorism policies, said Yosha DeLong, global head of cyber at insurer Mosaic.
""Any time there's ambiguous wording on a policy, it's to the client's advantage, not the insurer's.""
There is also a risk from ""silent cyber"", in which businesses have other policies which do not specifically exclude cyber attacks, and may look to claim on those.
A New Jersey court ruled in January in favour of Merck & Co over a $1.4 billion insurance claim for the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, which the White House blamed on Russia.
To reduce their overall risk, some cyber insurers are considering broad exclusions for Russia and Ukraine, said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Schnur, U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader at broker Marsh.
CHANGING TACTICS
Military losses could lead to a different approach by Russia, including cyber attacks, analysts at Eurasia said.
Some Russian units suffering heavy losses had been forced to return home and to neighbouring Belarus, British military intelligence said this week, after Russia promised to scale down military operations around Kyiv.
Cyber attacks have taken place on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, government services, banks and telecoms, analytics firm CyberCube said in a report earlier this month.
Russian government institutions and businesses are also being targeted by cyber attackers, CyberCube said, adding that some attacks have spilled over into Belarus, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.
The invasion is also adding to pressure on cyber insurance premiums, with rates rising sharply due to ransomeware attacks where hackers encrypt victims' data and demand a ransom to release it.
Cyber security firm Coveware likened the 90%-plus profit margin from ransomware attacks last year to the gains Colombian cocaine cartels made in 1992.
Cyber insurance rates rose by 130% in the United States and by 92% in Britain in the fourth quarter, according to Marsh.
Industry sources see similar rate rises this year.
Rate rises already vary wildly, one consultant said, giving an example of a small business in Britain which had seen its annual cyber insurance premium leap to 450,000 pounds ($590,940.00) from 80,000 pounds.

""Everyone's prices have gone up, now they will go up even more,"" the consultant said. ""Ukraine and Russia are just putting more stress on premiums and availability.”

Vanke reported a net profit of 22.5 billion yuan ($3.54 billion) in 2021, down from 41.5 billion yuan in the year-ago period, dented by lower gross profit margins in the development business, a drop in investment income and the provision for asset impairment losses.
At the beginning of an earnings conference, Yu said in the webcast that he wanted to offer a ""sincere apology"" to the 520,000 shareholders. ""Our 2021 financial performances have disappointed our shareholders,"" he said.
Yu said profit in 2022 may see some growth because it has 710 billion sales from last year that have yet to be booked, and it expects profit contribution from non-development businesses.
The company forecasts the gross profit margin for property development business at 20% going forward, after dropping to 23% last year.
The world's second-largest economy needs more decisive policy-easing at the city level to stimulate demand from wary buyers and inject new credit to stop more property firms from defaulting, developers told Reuters, as China pledged to shore up its embattled property sector.
Yu, who told a company meeting earlier this year that China's real-estate industry has entered into an era of ""black iron"" from ""white silver"" as developers struggle to deleverage, said on Thursday only those who do not use high debt for growing scale will survive in this market.
He expects more policies to be introduced at the local levels to stabilize the property market.

1335,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:58AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Largely Flat; Oil Prices Slump on Reserves Release Talk,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Thursday at the end of a turbulent month, with investors carefully watching developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict as well as volatile energy prices. 
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
European stock markets largely closed lower Wednesday on disappointment of the lack of a substantial breakthrough in talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war triggered by the Russian invasion in late February.
Ukrainian forces are now preparing for new attacks in the east of the country as Moscow builds up its troops there after suffering setbacks near the capital Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.
Additionally, the United States is looking to up the economic pressure on Moscow, by expanding sanctions on Russia in the coming days, White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said late Wednesday.
European stocks have suffered a very difficult quarter, with the DAX down over 8% year to date and both the CAC 40 and the broad-based Stoxx 600 down nearly 6%, as the war in Ukraine put upward pressure on commodity prices, increasing stagflation fears.
Some of those concerns lessened Thursday, after oil prices slumped following reports that the U.S. is considering a massive release of crude from emergency reserves over several months in order to tackle prices which have climbed above $100 a barrel in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Biden administration could make the announcement later Thursday, the reports said, with the total release from the country’s strategic petroleum reserve potentially as much as 180 million barrels.
The International Energy Agency has also called an emergency ministerial meeting for Friday, amid speculation the Paris-based organization will attempt to coordinate a global release by other countries.
This news has overshadowed a meeting, scheduled for later in the session, of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which is expected to stick to an existing deal of increasing oil production by around 400,000 barrels per day through May.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.3% lower at $102.09 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 4.2% to $106.72. 
Back in Europe, fourth-quarter U.K. gross domestic product rose by 1.3% on the quarter, up 6.6% on the year, while German retail sales rose 0.3% on the month in February. 
The European economic data slate also includes French and Italian consumer inflation data, as well as German and Eurozone unemployment numbers. 
In corporate news,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) is likely to be in the spotlight after the French healthcare group priced its first sustainability-linked bond issue that will be indexed on access to medicines, and worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion).

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>",Explainer-What impact would a Russian debt default have?,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder and Moscow's threats to cut Europe's gas supply seems to be upping the ante further.
Would a default really make any difference at this stage though, and what would it entail? 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COUNTRY DEFAULTS? 
If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default.
Such an event would have been unthinkable before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", and subsequent sanctions that have frozen hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its reserves.
Russia is already locked out of the international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, but a default would mean it couldn't regain access until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.
Defaults in other countries such as Argentina have seen aggressive creditors go after physical assets such as a navy vessel and the country's presidential aircraft. Russia's state-owned energy giants own some of Europe's key gas infrastructure so it would raise plenty of questions.
It could also create a host of headaches if countries or companies that would normally trade with Russia have self-imposed rules that prohibit transacting with an entity in default.
If sanctions are removed at some point in the future Russia's reputation in financial markets would still be tarnished. That would depress Russia's credit ratings and push up the borrowing rates paid by the Russian government and companies. 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?
By continuing to make its debt payments this month, Russia so far has swerved its first default of any kind since a 1998 financial crisis, and its first on the international market debt since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution when the new government refused to recognise Tsar-era borrowings. 
This week Moscow has upped the stakes by offering to make a $2 billion bond payment due next week - its biggest of the year - in roubles rather than the intended dollars.
As long as Russia doesn't force anyone who doesn't want roubles to take them, it wouldn't usually count as a default, but it is walking a tightrope. That the main rating agencies have had to withdraw their Russia ratings, and therefore won't call a default whatever happens, complicates things.
THE NEXT TEST
Another $447 million international bond payment is due on Thursday, but even if Russia remains willing to pay complications are about to stack up.
Western sanctions ban transactions with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund, although the temporary general license 9A https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_gl9a.pdf issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on March 2 makes an exception for the purposes of ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity.""
That license expires on May 25, however, after which Russia will have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.
Analysts say after next Monday's $2 billion payment, the next crucial test will come on May 27 - the first payment due after the current OFAC licence expires.
Russia could be forced to make the payment in roubles, and into bank accounts in Russia, which the finance ministry has said would be its fallback option.

That would constitute a default, however, as the legal terms of that bond state it must be paid back in dollars.
Russia has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -GoTo Group, Indonesia's biggest tech firm, said it plans to raise $1.1 billion in an initial public offering (IPO), pricing the deal in the top half of its indicative range and making it one of Asia's biggest IPOs so far this year.
GoTo, formed last year by the merger of ride-hailing-to-payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia, surprised some investors and analysts when it launched its IPO process earlier this month, braving turbulence in global equity markets.
""We are pleased with the investor response, which has remained resilient, despite global macro and market volatility,"" Andre Soelistyo, GoTo Group's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.
GoTo's offering attracted strong institutional demand in the book-building process despite a weak investor appetite for tech stocks that has battered shares of the company's Southeast Asian peers, such as Sea Ltd and Grab Holdings.
GoTo is backed by the likes of SoftBank Group Corp,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.
It priced its IPO at 338 rupiah per share, representing a projected market value of about $28 billion, which would make it the country's fourth most valuable listed company.
Reuters reported last week that GoTo had received enough investor orders for its IPO to raise at least $1.1 billion, within its targeted price band. [L2N2VS03I]
The firm had set an indicative price range of 316 rupiah to 346 rupiah per share.

It is selling 46.7 billion Series A shares, comprising newly issued and treasury shares, thereby raising 15.8 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion) in total. The IPO will be open from April 1-7 and the listing will take place on April 11 with the stock code GOTO.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:10AM ET</span>","Analysis-Retail traders splurge on risky plays, fueling bounce","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Freshly emboldened retail investors have continued piling into risky assets, supporting a bounce that has buoyed everything from so-called meme stocks to cryptocurrencies despite economic worries and geopolitical uncertainty. 
Weeks-long rallies in some of the market's most speculative names have far outpaced a broader rebound in the S&P 500, despite a selloff on Wednesday that saw the benchmark index shed 0.6% and declines in many of the more comparatively risky assets that have rallied in recent weeks.
Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), two companies most closely identified with the meme stock mania that drove astronomical stock price moves in 2021, have nearly doubled in price over the last two weeks after worries over tighter monetary policy and the war in Ukraine slammed stocks earlier this year.
Other moves include a 26% rally in Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation, an ETF replete with high growth names, a 19% jump in cryptocurrency bitcoin and a 36% rise in electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The S&P 500 is on track to finish the quarter with a 3.4% loss, after swooning as much as 12.5% earlier in the year.
While the rebound has been pinned on everything from quarter-end rebalancing to relief that the Federal Reserve is finally training its sights on inflation, retail investors have definitely played a significant part, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasting in a recent note that households will continue to deploy some of their $15 trillion in cash holdings into the equity market.
Retail traders' net purchases of stocks and ETFs totaled $5 billion this past week, compared with a 1-year average of $3.4 billion, JP Morgan strategist Peng Cheng said in a note on Wednesday.
""Retail is seeing that speculative trading still works and is still trying to catch the high-flyers of the day,"" said Dan Pipitone, chief executive of retail brokerage TradeZero.
For AMC, Gamestop and other stocks popular with individual investors, call options, typically employed to express a bullish view on stock prices, have drawn strong activity in recent weeks.
For example, there are 1.8 AMC call options open for every open put contract on the stock, about the most upbeat this number has been since May 2021, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data. 
Graphic: Bullish positioning - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egpbkbjxmvq/chart.png 
AMC was one of the most bought speculative stocks in the last couple of days, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said in a report Wednesday, noting that in the past strong flows into AMC have heralded a broader rally in other less well-known names.
""The average retail investor portfolio has now clawed back a good portion of the (year-on-year) losses, offering some fresh buffer to punt on meme stocks,"" Vanda’s analysts wrote.
RJ Assaly, head of business development at artificial-intelligence-driven market screening platform Toggle, said his models – based on an analysis of AMC's past trading patterns - had predicted the stock rising as high as $30, a level it touched Tuesday. 
Past instances of such bullish signals, in December 2020 and May 2021, saw the stock overshoot its predicted price by $15 to $30 dollars, he said.
Of course, the volatility associated with meme stocks and many other recent market leaders can be a two-edged sword, particularly for investors who bought them when speculative fervor ran high. GameStop and AMC are still down 52% and 59% from their closing highs from last year, respectively. Bitcoin is off 30% while ARK is down 56%.
So far, that hasn’t stopped some individual investors from betting these speculative names will continue to rise.

Retail traders have been paring buying in the large cap names that were more popular earlier in the year and shifting into more speculative stocks as ""younger and more aggressive investors"" try to recoup year-to-date losses, Vanda’s analysts said.
""This investor base is now purchasing mainly speculative meme stocks, call options, and cryptocurrencies,"" they wrote.

Japan-based Kioxia Holdings Corp — a key supplier of flash memory chips to Apple — had reported a contamination last month at two of its manufacturing facilities, which the company said will result in reduced production. 
Apple is now testing sample NAND flash memory chips by Chinese semiconductor company Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, the report said, adding that the iPhone maker has been discussing the tie-up for months.
Yangtze declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment on the report.

Earlier this month, another key Apple supplier Foxconn had to suspend its Shenzhen operations due to a spike in COVID-19 cases. 
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has also disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning. U.S. counterparts and oil both dropped sharply over a potential massive release of U.S. strategic oil.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.17% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.6%. The manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 49.5, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4, in March 2022. The Caixin manufacturing PMI is due on Friday, and the People’s Bank of China vowed to boost confidence and provide more effective support to the economy.
Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler also tamped down speculation that a deal to keep about 200 Chinese stocks from losing their U.S. listings is in the works.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.13%, while South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.51%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.35%.
Reports that the U.S. is preparing a plan to release roughly a million barrels of oil a day from its strategic petroleum reserve halted a rebound in oil. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) will also meet later in the day.
Global stocks are set for their worst quarter in two years as the war in Ukraine puts upward pressure on commodity prices, forcing central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy.

Kansas City Fed President Esther George said she favors a “steady, deliberate” series of hikes, while Fed Richmond Bank President Thomas Barkin said he is open to hiking rates by a half-point at the next meeting, depending on how strong the U.S. economy is then.
New York Fed President John Williams will speak later in the day and the U.S. releases its latest jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, a day later.

(Reuters) -Labor board officials expect to start counting votes by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers in New York City and Alabama on Thursday afternoon in separate contests that will decide if Amazon sees a U.S. workplace unionize for the first time.
In Bessemer, Alabama, Amazon employees voted in a repeat election after they rebuffed joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) by a more than 2-to-1 margin last year. After finding that Amazon had interfered around that vote, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) called for a re-run. 
Turnout in Alabama decreased from last year, the RWDSU said on Wednesday. About 39% of the 6,143 workers designated to receive mail ballots voted in the new election, down from over 50% in 2021.
In New York City's Staten Island borough workers on Wednesday still had several hours left to vote, and turnout was not yet clear.
The counts for both Bessemer and Staten Island are tentatively scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday, though that could change, an NLRB spokesperson said. Counting could last multiple days.
Low turnout may bode well for Amazon's union backers, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.
""Supporters are more likely to be solid union votes,"" he said, adding, however, that it was tough to generalize. ""Even a close election is going to be in some ways a sort of a morale booster and moral victory for the RWDSU.""
Amazon referred comment on the vote count and turnout to the NLRB.

According to the RWDSU, parties in the Bessemer election have challenged hundreds of ballots as ineligible for counting, based, for instance, on voters' employment dates, job classification or other issues.
Those challenges will be addressed after the remaining ballots are counted and could alter the outcome in the event of a close election.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith wrote to Ukraine's leader this month with a clear message: despite Kyiv's calls for it to sever all ties with Russia, the U.S. software behemoth would continue doing business in the country with non-sanctioned clients, including schools and hospitals.
""Depriving these institutions of software updates and services could put at risk the health and safety of innocent civilians, including children and the elderly,"" Smith said in the previously unreported March 14 letter, seen by Reuters.
Smith told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Microsoft was ""mindful of the moral responsibility"" to protect civilians. However, he said the company was discussing with U.S., British and EU governments whether ""to halt any ongoing services and support"" in Russia and would move ""in lockstep with their sanctions and other economic goals."" 
Asked about the exchange, spokespeople for both Microsoft and Ukraine said a constructive dialogue was underway about actions to support the country.
The decision by some leading Western business technology makers - including Microsoft, German software multinational SAP SE (DE:SAPG) and U.S. giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp - to maintain operations or staff in Russia despite Ukraine's appeals have angered their workers in several countries.
Small groups of employees at Microsoft, SAP and  IBM  have called for management to withdraw fully from Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, according to comments seen by Reuters on internal discussion forums and interviews with 18 workers familiar with the companies, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The employees – echoing Ukrainian officials – have urged the companies to go beyond ending new sales and dropping sanctioned clients in order to increase economic pressure on Moscow. They want their companies to suspend every deal in Russia, including for software clients may use to track sales, supply chains and workforces.
Asked about the internal criticism, IBM said it has ceased working with Russian companies anywhere in the world - though it has stopped short of layoffs or suspending support of foreign businesses in Russia. 
SAP told Reuters it was complying with government actions and even going beyond them, and it would ""welcome new sanctions currently under discussion.""
SAP responded to Ukraine's requests to cut all ties in Russia with a previously undisclosed letter this month to President Zelenskiy – reviewed in part by Reuters – saying that it was supporting essential Russian services, including ""hospitals, civilian infrastructure and food supply chains.""
The three companies have not ruled out further pullback. But for now, their employees in Russia are getting paid and accessing workplace tools, colleagues said. Local phone numbers are active for all three, Reuters found. 
Questioned about the demands on Western tech businesses from their own workers and the Ukrainian government to quit Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said that ""some companies are leaving, others are staying. New ones will come in their place.""
The spokesperson noted that companies had legal obligations to employees that must be fulfilled, such as paying wages.
Russian prosecutors have warned some Western businesses that their staff could face arrests if production of essential goods was stopped, according to media reports. The Wall Street Journal named IBM among those warned. 
The Kremlin spokesperson denied the reports about pressure on companies from prosecutors: ""The part about arrests is a lie."" 
UKRAINIAN LOBBYING 
Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, one of the leading campaigners for a digital blockade, said Russia was already feeling the impact as some technology companies exit, such as developers of digital payment and web development tools. But he is pushing for a complete departure.
""We will keep trying until those companies have made the decision to leave Russia,"" he said.
Fedorov's team told Reuters last week that a ""huge number"" of Russian organizations have contracts for SAP's software, including major banking and energy companies. Reuters could not independently confirm SAP's customers in Russia, and SAP said it was in full compliance with sanctions.
Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media did not answer requests for comment on the impact of departures by Western technology companies, nor the extent of SAP's footprint in the country.
Mirroring the Ukrainian government's message, SAP's five salespeople for Ukraine told regional managers on a call March 18 that the company must end support for remaining Russian clients, according to a person familiar with the discussion. 
Fedorov said on Friday in a tweet, citing a conversation with SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein, that the company would ""gradually stop supporting"" products in Russia. A day earlier, SAP had said it was shutting its Russian cloud business, which two sources described as a small operation.
In a March 23 letter sent to customers in Russia, reviewed by Reuters, SAP asked cloud clients to advise whether their data in the Russian cloud should be deleted, handed back to them or moved outside the country.
SAP confirmed the content of the letter, and said that Fedorov and Klein spoke. It declined to comment further.
At IBM, hundreds of workers criticized the company's response to Russia's invasion, three people with knowledge of internal messages said.
CEO Arvind Krishna on a March 2 call with employees had taken no sides on the war, one of the sources said. In a now-public message to workers the previous day, IBM had referred to what it described as the ""deteriorating situation involving Ukraine and Russia.""
One comment on an internal discussion forum, seen by Reuters, called on the CEO to read a book on IBM's work during the Holocaust describing how https://ibmandtheholocaust.com the company designed punch-card machines that Nazi Germany used to track Jewish people: ""Think carefully and do the right thing - pull IBM and IBMer's in Russia out of Russia,"" the employee wrote.
IBM declined to comment on the remark.
Responding to the outcry, Krishna announced in a March 3 post a suspension of sales in Russia and condemned ""the Russian war in Ukraine."" On March 7, he went further, saying that IBM had suspended ""all business"" in Russia – without elaborating.
An IBM spokesperson told Reuters March 24 that the business suspension meant the company is no longer providing ""goods, parts, software, services, consulting and technology"" anywhere in the world to Russian clients.
Several Microsoft workers on internal chat tools have also demanded the company exit Russia altogether, with some even telling senior management they would quit otherwise, an employee said. Microsoft declined to comment.
DOUBTS
Some workers told Reuters they have not joined the calls for full exits due to doubts over harming civilians and how strong an impact the companies' withdrawal from Russia would have.
For instance, the United States on Feb. 24 sanctioned Russian Railways, a state-owned company operating passenger and freight trains. IBM that day placed the company on its “Denied Parties List” and stopped tech support, according to an IBM letter to Ukrainian minister Fedorov dated March 5, seen by Reuters.
Denied parties cannot access official replacement discs, adapters and memory for mainframes that a former IBM salesperson said need swapping every two years.
But a person familiar with operations at Russian Railways said it can run for years without aid. 

Russian Railways did not respond to requests for comment. IBM declined to comment.
SAP also told Reuters that because some clients have its software installed on their machines they can keep using it regardless of the company's decision not to provide support.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. and European equities rally wavered on Wednesday as investors reviewed economic and geopolitical risks, while oil prices jumped more than $2 on the prospect of more Russian sanctions.
The breather in stocks followed three to four straight days of gains that more than erased losses sustained when Russia invaded Ukraine five weeks ago, and came as bond investors wondered whether the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy tightening could harm the world's biggest economy over the longer term.
A key part of the U.S. yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday in what is widely viewed as a harbinger of a recession, although it has since reverted.
""We see further equity upside medium-term given a robust growth picture, low bar for first-quarter earnings, and narrowing credit spreads,"" analysts at JP Morgan's Global Markets Strategy said.
""We see too much negativity around the Fed since the start of Fed tightening cycles proved positive for equities historically, and policy is easing in Japan and China.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.19%, the S&P 500 fell 0.63%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.2%. 
Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 lost 0.4%, while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, eased 0.32%.
The widely tracked yield curve showing the difference between two- and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields bounced back to 4 basis points on Wednesday. It had briefly inverted to minus 0.03 of a basis point on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019. [US/] 
Longer-dated yields falling below shorter ones indicate a lack of faith in future growth. A drop in 10-year yields below 2-year rates signals a recession.
Sebastien Galy, a senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said fixed income and equity markets are diverging in their outlooks and the split bears watching.
""Equity markets are overly optimistic and the fixed income markets are probably being overly pessimistic."" 
An inverted Treasury curve has in recent decades been followed by a recession within two years, including the 2020 downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Benchmark indexes in Frankfurt and Paris lost 1.5% and 0.74% respectively, while London shares bucked the trend and jumped 0.55%.

A day after rising above 0% for the first time since 2014, Germany's two-year bond yield was up 6 basis points at 0.01% - keeping the previous day's highs in sight.
Shares rallied in Asia overnight after Ukraine proposed on Tuesday that it adopt neutral status, a sign of progress in face-to-face peace talks. 
On the ground, attacks continued and Ukraine reacted with scepticism to Russia's promise in negotiations to scale down military operations around Kyiv. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 1.36% to its highest level in nearly a month, with most Asian stock markets in positive territory.
JAPAN IN FOCUS 
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.3415%, after rising to 2.557% on Monday, its highest level since April 2019, as traders geared up for quick-fire U.S. interest rate hikes.
Rising U.S. yields have also lifted government bond yields in Japan, where inflation is running below target and where the central bank wants yields to stay low.
The Bank of Japan increased efforts to defend its key yield cap on Wednesday, offering to ramp up buying of government bonds across the curve, including unscheduled emergency market operations. 
The widening gap between U.S. and Japanese yields has caused the yen to weaken sharply, but it pared losses on Wednesday. 
The Japanese currency rose 0.9% to 121.81 per dollar from Monday's low of 124.3, amid concerns Japanese authorities might step in to bolster the yen. [FRX/] 
Elsewhere in currency markets, the euro rose 0.6% to $1.1156, its highest in four weeks, supported by the Russia-Ukraine peace talks.
In commodities, oil prices jumped more than $2 on supply tightness and the growing prospect of new Western sanctions against Russia even as Moscow and Kyiv held peace talks.

Brent crude futures were up $2.28, or 2.1%, at $112.51, while U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $107.3 per barrel. [O/R]

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said Grubhub, Uber Eats and Postmates must face an antitrust lawsuit by diners who accused them of driving up menu prices by exploiting their dominance in meal deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said it was reasonable to infer that requiring restaurants to accept ""no-price competition clauses"" left them with ""no choice but to raise prices"" regardless of where diners ordered meals.
    He also said diners plausibly alleged that Grubhub and Uber Eats' more restrictive clauses discouraged restaurants from using other platforms, despite their need to generate enough sales to stay afloat and offset low profit margins.
""Defendants' motion to dismiss is denied in its entirety,"" Kaplan wrote.
Diners claimed that the no-price competition clauses barred restaurants from charging lower prices for dining in or ordering takeout, while Grubhub and Uber Eats also forbade restaurants from charging less to customers who ordered on rival platforms.
They said the harm from inflated meal prices was compounded by ""supracompetitive"" 5% to 10% delivery fees charged to diners and 30% commission rates often charged to restaurants.
The proposed class action sought triple and other damages for dine-in and delivery customers in the United States since April 2016.
Grubhub, owned by Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway.com, said it was disappointed with the decision and will continue defending its dining-related services.
Uber Eats and Postmates, both owned by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the diners said they were pleased with the decision.
The practices of delivery companies faced increased scrutiny after the pandemic forced tens of thousands of restaurants to close and many more to temporarily shut their dining rooms.

Grubhub, Uber Eats and rival DoorDash Inc have also sued to overturn a New York City law capping the fees they charge restaurants at 15%, while Grubhub and DoorDash are challenging a similar law in San Francisco.

Some 60 equity ETFs tracking the city’s indexes added $4.4 billion since end-February, the most in monthly data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2000. The Tracker Fund, the city’s first and largest ETF mirroring the benchmark Hang Seng Index, lured $1.5 billion, more than three times the net inflow for February. 
The piling in of money suggests retail investors are sanguine about Hong Kong’s equity market outlook despite volatility. A growing diversity of products, including those focused on the metaverse, also likely helped ETFs gain traction. The Hang Seng Index has rebounded more than 20% from a mid-March trough, following Beijing’s pledge to end a regulatory crackdown and stabilize markets.

“We have seen retail buying through ETFs when foreign institutional clients were selling in panic,” said Melody He, deputy chief executive officer at CSOP Asset Management Ltd. “It’s a more transparent and efficient way of tactically trading the market.”
The surge in flows into ETFs tracking Hong Kong stocks, many of which are mainland firms, comes as strategists remain split on the outlook for China equities. Skeptics are hesitant to turn bullish barring more policy clarity from the Chinese government, especially on the back of lingering regulatory risks and growing lockdowns in China’s big cities. 
Stocks in Hong Kong are yet to recoup this year’s slump despite recent gains. The Hang Seng Index is down 5% this year, while the Hang Seng Tech Index -- which includes  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. as members -- has lost more than 18%. Both gauges are on track to post monthly losses for March.
Still, another sign of investor optimism can be witnessed in stock purchases via the southbound trading links. Mainland Chinese traders have been snapping up Hong Kong’s beaten-down shares through the links, with net inflows reaching HK$48.9 billion ($6.3 billion) so far in March, set for the biggest monthly figure since December.
The inflows to ETFs signal that the rebound “may have staying power,” said Rebecca Sin, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Chinese technology stocks may finally be on the road to recovery after government pledges revived the market’s risk appetite.”
The ETF market in Hong Kong has a relatively short history, with the first product launching in 1999 and its market capitalization equivalent to less than 1% of the overall stock market. It’s also smaller than the value of ETFs listed in Japan, China and South Korea exchanges, Bloomberg data show. 
But it’s been growing fast of late, with a range of thematic products focusing on tech and ESG helping draw cash. The total market capitalization of 153 listed products on the Hong Kong exchange, including inverse and leveraged funds, reached HK$429 billion in 2021, expanding almost 50% from three years ago. As of February, the average daily turnover has risen to HK$8.9 billion, up 15% from the previous year.  
Regulators are also planning to include ETFs in the stock connect schemes between Hong Kong and mainland bourses, potentially boosting liquidity in the local ETF market.  
“We expect the inflows to continue given more product offerings, diverse issuances and greater connectivity with the mainland,” said CSOP Asset Management’s He. She added that the depth of Hong Kong’s ETF market “will improve over time.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Major U.S. and foreign automakers on Wednesday backed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new tougher vehicle emissions regulations in a court challenge brought by some states and ethanol groups.
Texas and 15 other states have challenged the EPA's vehicle emissions rules that reverse a rollback of tailpipe rules issued under former President Donald Trump.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing nearly all major automakers, said in a court filing the EPA rule ""will challenge the industry"" but provides automakers with ""critically important flexibilities.""
Automakers, the group added, want to ensure ""critical regulatory provisions supporting electric vehicle technology are maintained.""
The states are joined by some corn and soybean growers associations, the American Fuel And Petrochemical Manufacturers and others. Corn growers, a  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) subsidiary and other ethanol producers said the new EPA rules revising emission requirements through 2026 ""effectively mandate the production and sale of electric cars rather than cars powered by internal combustion engines.""
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a challenge joined by Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah. The state of Arizona filed a separate legal challenge.
The automakers, which include General Motors (NYSE:GM) Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Hyundai Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis , said in the court filing the ""transition must be supported by regulatory stability. If the outcome of the litigation remains in question for a significant period ... (automakers) could face stranded investments and planning uncertainty.""

The new rules, which take effect in September and require a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026, aim to speed a U.S. shift to more electric vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday will announce its final parallel Corporate Average Fuel Economy revisions of rules through 2026, Reuters reported. Separately, NHTSA on Sunday confirmed it finalized a dramatic jump in fines for automakers not meeting regulatory standards.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A Massachusetts judge on Wednesday dealt state securities regulators a major setback in their enforcement action against online brokerage Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) by declaring the state's new fiduciary duty rule that underlies parts of the case invalid.
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Michael Ricciuti in Boston ruled https://tmsnrt.rs/3JXkqV5 in a lawsuit Robinhood filed after Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin in December 2020 accused it of encouraging inexperienced investors to place risky trades.
The decision impacts only part of Galvin's administrative enforcement action, and he may still pursue claims that Robinhood's conduct was unethical or dishonest and that it failed to adequately supervise employees.
Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, alleged Robinhood used strategies that treated trading like a game to lure young, inexperienced customers, including by having confetti rain down on the user's screen for each trade made on its app.
He argued that Robinhood violated a fiduciary duty rule he adopted in early 2020 that raised the investment-advice standard for brokers and that its broker-dealer license in the state should be revoked.
The Massachusetts rule went beyond a standard the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted in 2019 by requiring broker-dealers have a fiduciary obligation to provide investment without regard to the interests of anyone but their customers.
But Ricciuti wrote the rule improperly overrode Massachusetts state law governing stockbrokers' duties and that Galvin went beyond his authority by adopting a regulation that conflicted with federal law.
He put his decision on hold to allow Galvin, a Democrat, time to appeal. Debra O'Malley, a spokesperson for Galvin, said his office is reviewing the decision and weighing its options.

An administrative trial is scheduled for Sept. 26. 
Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's chief legal office, in a statement welcomed the ruling, saying Galvin has ""consistently mischaracterized and disparaged Robinhood's platform and customers without any legal basis.""

It also will vote against nominating committee members of boards that are not at least 30% female. Those standards could especially pressure non-U.S. or European company boards, said Aeisha Mastagni, who oversees CalSTRS' stewardship strategies, in an interview.
""It's 2022 and we've been talking about the value of diversity for long enough,"" she said. 
In addition, CalSTRS said it will vote against directors at companies that have not disclosed direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions. A rule recently passed by U.S. Securities regulators, which must still be finalized, has similar requirements.
Some climate activists have also pressed companies to go further and to disclose emissions from suppliers and customers, known as Scope 3. Mastagni said that would be a good regulatory change but the first two types at least will help investors judge corporate emission reduction plans.
Mastagni said the new policies would likely increase the frequency of CalSTRS' votes against directors from 54% last year.
Other big asset managers such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also have called for more boardroom diversity and climate disclosures, as investors pour money into funds that use environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to pick securities.
CalSTRS is the second-largest U.S. public retirement system after the $476 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System. Both have helped push reforms such as last year's drive that elected dissidents to  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s board.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 04:51PM ET</span>","Florida reaches $878 million opioid settlements with CVS, Teva, others","By Jonathan Stempel and Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) - Florida has reached more than $878 million in settlements with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and three drug companies to resolve claims and avert a trial next month over their roles in fueling an opioid epidemic in the third most populous U.S. state.
CVS will pay $484 million, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd will pay $194.8 million, Abbvie Inc's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit will pay $134.2 million and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc will pay $65 million, Florida's attorney general Ashley Moody said in a statement on Wednesday.
Most of the money will be spent on opioid abatement. Teva will also provide $84 million of its generic Narcan nasal spray, which can temporarily reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.
The four companies denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Endo's accord had been reached in January. 
West Virginia reached a similar $26 million settlement with Endo on Wednesday, attorney general Patrick Morissey said in a press conference.
After the settlements, Florida and West Virginia will both begin pared-back opioid trials next week. West Virginia will proceed to trial on April 4 against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva and Allergen. Florida will proceed to trial against pharmacy chain Walgreens, with jury selection scheduled to begin on April 5. 
Walgreens said its 2012 opioid-related settlement with Florida covered the state's latest claims, and that it will defend against ""unjustified attacks"" on its pharmacists.
CVS and Teva said they would defend against other opioid lawsuits, and Teva said it is ""actively"" negotiating a national settlement of similar claims. Allergan said its settlement also covers claims for generic opioids it sold to Teva in 2016.
Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Florida announced the settlements nine days after Rhode Island reached similar accords with Teva and Allergan valued at $107 million.
More than 500,000 people have died from opioid overdoses in the past two decades nationally, including 75,673 in the year ending April 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On Feb. 25, Johnson & Johnson and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) reached final settlements worth $26 billion over their roles in the nationwide epidemic.
State, local and Native American tribal governments in the United States have filed more than 3,300 lawsuits accusing drugmakers such as OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma of fueling opioid abuse, including by downplaying the risks of addiction.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, handing back some of the recent gains as investors digested key reports on jobs and economic output while monitoring developments in Ukraine.
At 4:45 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 65 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.2%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 338 points, or 1% higher and the broad-based S&P 500 gaining 1.2%, both registering their fourth straight day of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8%.
Helping the tone Tuesday were signs of progress in the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey. However, optimism has quickly turned into skepticism, with a Pentagon spokesman saying Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains under threat even after Russia promised to scale back military operations there. 
“Nobody should be fooling ourselves by the Kremlin’s now-recent claim that it will suddenly just reduce military attacks near Kyiv or any reports that it is going to withdraw all its forces,” John Kirby said. It’s “a repositioning, not a real withdrawal” from positions around the Ukrainian capital.
Also catching the interest of investors are a series of important data releases given the Federal Reserve is in the process of weighing up how aggressively to hike interest rates at its May meeting.
Expectations of sharp interest rate increases saw the 2-year Treasury yield briefly climb above the 10-year for the first time since 2019, a move that is often seen as a warning of an upcoming recession.
March's ADP nonfarm employment change report showed employers added 455,000 jobs in March, slightly better than consensus forecasts looking for companies to have added 450,000 jobs, while GDP for the fourth quarter showed a reading of 6.9%, which compared with expectations for 7.1%.
In the corporate sector, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) traded higher after the company gave a robust forecast for the ongoing quarter, suggesting demand from data centers remains strong.
Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) will also be in the spotlight after the athletic apparel maker beat quarterly earnings estimates and announced a $1 billion stock buyback program. 
Oil prices rose Wednesday, rebounding after a two-day retreat following a fresh reminder of the tight nature of the market as data showed U.S. crude stocks fell sharply last week.
Data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, showed U.S. crude inventories fell by 3 million barrels in the week ended March 25. The official data from the Energy Information Administration showed oil inventories declined by 3.4 million barrels, more than expected.
The oil market had dropped sharply this week on progress in the Ukraine/Russia peace talks as well as demand worries over fresh Covid-19 lockdowns in China, the world’s largest crude importer. 
By 4:46 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.2% higher at $107.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $111.05. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,933/oz.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 04:31PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC proposes boosting blank-check company disclosures, liability","By Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's watchdog on Wednesday unveiled a draft new rule to enhance blank-check company investor disclosures and to strip them of a legal protection critics argue has allowed the shell companies to issue overly optimistic earnings projections. 
The move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is part of a broader crackdown on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) after a frenzy of deals in 2020 and early 2021 sparked concerns that some investors are getting a raw deal.
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs are shell companies that raise funds through a listing to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing the target to sidestep the stiffer regulatory scrutiny of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
The SEC proposal, which is subject to consultation, broadly aims to close that loophole by offering SPAC investors protections similar to those they would receive during the IPO process, the SEC said.
""Today's proposal, if adopted, would represent a sea change to the rules applicable to SPACs,"" John Ablan, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown who advises companies on IPOs and other deals, wrote in an email to Reuters. ""The SEC is clearly focused on creating incentives ... to undertake the same amount of due diligence that would be done in a traditional IPO.""
The rule would require SPACs to disclose more details about their sponsors, their compensation, conflicts of interest and share dilution. 
It would also enhance disclosures about the target takeover, known as the ""de-SPAC,"" more information, including the sponsor's view on whether the deal is fair to investors and whether the proposed transaction has been vetted by third parties. Such disclosures would have to be issued at least 20 days prior to any solicited votes on the acquisition.
""Companies raising money from the public should provide full and fair disclosure at the time investors are making their crucial decisions to invest,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. 
The rule would also strip SPACs of a liability safe harbor for forward-looking statements, such as earnings projections.
The SEC has stepped up oversight of SPACs amid worries of inadequate disclosures and lofty revenue projections. Reuters reported last year that the SEC was considering new guidance to rein in SPACs' growth projections.
SPAC sponsors say the projections are important for investors, especially when targets are unprofitable startups, but investor advocates say they are frequently wildly optimistic or misleading but have been shielded by the legal safe harbor. 
""The elimination of the statutory safe harbor ... will cause SPAC issuers and their advisers to be more cautious in including pro forma and other financial information with respect to a proposed business combination,"" said Morris DeFeo, a New York-based partner at law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP.
If SPACs do not meet certain conditions they may have to register as investment companies, subjecting them to a slew of other rules, the SEC said. 
Those conditions include: maintaining assets in certain forms, entering into a deal with a target within 18 months of the SPAC IPO, closing the transaction within 24 months and ensuring that the newly merged company engages primarily in the same business as the target.

Gatekeepers who facilitate the deals, such as auditors, lawyers and underwriters, should also be held responsible for their work before and after the SPAC listing, Gensler added. 
The U.S. SPAC market experienced a wild ride in 2021, with an explosion in deals during the first half of the year that quickly cooled off in the second half. All told, 604 SPACs raised $144 billion in 2021, according to data from Renaissance Capital.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a four-day win streak Wednesday, as bets on tech eased following a stumble in chip stocks, while ongoing worries about aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve triggering a recession weighed on sentiment. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.90%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.52%, or 182 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%.
Chip stocks fell more than 2% to weigh on the broader tech sector, pressured by a weakness in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell more than 3% as better than expected second-quarter results and third quarter guidance were offset by worries about slowing growth amid an unfavorable macro environment.
“Investors concerned about inflationary risk and consumer wallet will likely view strong results skeptically,” Credit Suisse said in a note..
Consumer discretionary stocks, which in tandem with tech have underpinned the recent rebound, also stumbled.
PVH (NYSE:PVH) was the biggest sector decliner down more 6% after its softer than expected guidance offset quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations on the bottom line.
 Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) was also big a drag on the sector, down more than 4% after JP Morgan downgraded the building product firm to underweight, on worries about several headwinds including a slowing housing market amid tighter monetary policy.
Bond markets, meanwhile, continued to be closely watched, a day the after a key part of the yield curve inverted, triggering worries about a recession ahead amid fears the Federal Reserve may tightened too aggressively and tip the economy into a recession.
Those worries remained front and center on Wednesday as Fed officials continue to call on the central bank to pick up the pace of tightening to curb inflation at time. 
“Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate,”  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday.
The 10-2 year Treasury yield spread, which turned negative briefly a day earlier, continued to flirt with inversion.
The Fed has said the economy is strong enough to withstand the pace of expected tightening. Economic data on Wednesday was mixed as private jobs gains in April surprised to the upside but economic growth, or GDP, in the fourth quarter was unexpectedly revised down a tenth of a percentage point to a 6.9% increase.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 snapping four-session winning streaks, on waning signs of progress for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia against a backdrop of a hawkish Federal Reserve curbing economic growth.
Russian forces bombarded the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine, a day after promising to scale down operations.
The S&P has rebounded more than 5% in March after starting the year with two straight monthly declines. Still, the benchmark index is on track for its first quarterly decline since the first quarter of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was reaching full swing. 
Stock prices have reacted to headlines about negotiations to resolve Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices for commodities such as oil and metals have surged since the invasion, intensifying already-high U.S. inflation. 
""Ukraine is the controlling narrative for this market, if we are going to get a settlement and we get the potential from that settlement for lower energy prices, which is really the key, and then some sort of return to normalcy in terms of the world economy that is a real positive for the market,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
""If not, we are going to continue to just go back and forth here as the market tries to digest who the winners and losers are because there are a lot of unintended consequences coming out of this war,"" Meckler added. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 65.38 points, or 0.19%, to 35,228.81, the S&P 500 lost 29.15 points, or 0.63%, to 4,602.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 177.36 points, or 1.21%, to 14,442.28.
As inflation intensifies, so does speculation the Federal Reserve may get more aggressive in raising interest rates, which could put a damper on economic growth.
The S&P energy index was the leading sector on the plus side with a gain of 1.17%. It is up nearly 40% this year, which would mark its strongest quarterly performance ever. 
The sector is currently one of only three that are positive on the year and has far outpaced the next closest performer in utilities, which are up nearly 4% on the year but closed at a record high for a fourth straight session. 
Some investors have taken a defensive stance due to fears of excessive Fed tightening and recent signals in the bond market that often act as precursors to a recession. 
Still, economic data continues to indicate a strong labor market. The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls rose by 455,000 jobs last month after advancing 486,000 in February. Investors will watch for Friday's payrolls report.
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc surged 9.58% after forecasting full-year profit and revenue above estimates, as demand for athletic wear remains strong.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.69 billion shares, compared with the 13.93 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 47 new lows.

Investing.com – Stocks fell back on Wednesday as the fighting in Ukraine continued and investors braced for more data on jobs and a meeting of the international oil producers cartel to decide next steps.
Wednesday’s jobs data hit a positive note, coming in slightly above expectations, and setting the tone for the government’s broader report on employment for March. 
The new print on economic output for the fourth quarter came in a touch below expectations, meanwhile. Thursday will start out with fresh data on jobless claims for the previous week, which hit a low not seen since 1969 in last week’s report.
Thursday also brings data on personal spending and personal income, along with data on inflation. All of this is happening as the Federal Reserve looks at how aggressively to raise rates at its next meeting, given continued elevated energy prices and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
April will usher in a new wave of earnings reports from the S&P 500 companies, and executive outlooks on inflation and supply channels will be front and center. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobless claims
U.S. jobless claims are set to be reported tomorrow after last week falling to the lowest level in 52 years. Analyst forecasts as tracked by Investing.com see initial jobless claims coming in at 197,000 above the 187,000 reported previously but still at low levels relative to the beginning of the pandemic two years ago. All the data mentioned here will be reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT)
2. Personal spending
Personal spending for February is estimated to rise 0.5% from January, which would be a lower rate than the 2.1% gain in the prior month. That could be a sign consumers cut back on spending because of higher energy and food prices.
3. Personal income
The data on personal income will also be reported. The forecast for personal income in February is a 0.5% gain from the prior month, which is slightly better than the 0% recorded in January.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 03:43PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse leaves managers on Greensill hook as shareholders seek audit,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse's board will leave managers potentially liable for the collapse of its Greensill-linked funds when it asks shareholders to grant them a discharge for other activities, the bank said on Wednesday, as a group of investors pushed for a special audit.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.7 billion) loss in 2021, partly as a result of a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos which hit the bank that March. 
Its reputation was also damaged by the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds (SCFF) linked to insolvent British financier Greensill that same month, for which it is still trying to recover investor funds.
The bank conducted inquiries into both matters, publishing a damning report in July on a ""lackadaisical"" attitude toward risk and ""a lack of accountability"" behind the Archegos loss, but in a surprise move, said it would not publish its Greensill report in January.
Now, pension fund adviser Ethos Foundation and seven Swiss pension funds are pressing forward with demands for more information about the affair, asking shareholders to approve a special audit examining the bank's actions in relation to both Greensill as well as the so-called ""Suisse Secrets"" published in February.
""Due to the ongoing process to recover investors' funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the board does not intend to publish the related report,"" the bank said on Wednesday. ""It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.""
Under Swiss corporate rules, directors can be held responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties, with shareholders asked each year to free them from legal liabilities for the previous year.
Approving the vote waives the directors' or management's liabilities, but applies only to facts that have been disclosed to shareholders and the claims of the company and shareholders who approved it.
Credit Suisse withdrew an agenda item from its 2021 AGM asking shareholders to approve management's performance as it conducted investigations into the two scandals.
Now, following investor pushback, it said it would ask shareholders to grant executives and board members a discharge for any liabilities for 2020 and 2021 at its AGM on April 29, but omit matters surrounding the Greensill-linked funds.
It asked shareholders to reject Ethos' proposal for a special audit, saying it had answered questions from the shareholder group seeking more information, which it would make available on its website during the week of April 4. 
A special audit would ""at this stage be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular"", Credit Suisse said.

Ethos, however, said it found Credit Suisse's response insufficient and therefore had decided to press ahead with a vote at the AGM.
Ethos also requested that the audit scrutinise the bank's response to findings published by a group of media outlets in February, who reported the Swiss bank had managed accounts for human rights abusers, fraudsters and businessmen who had been placed under sanctions.

(Reuters) - Profits at the world's biggest banks are expected to fall for the first time in seven quarters, dragged down mainly by a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity and a decline in equity and debt issuance deals. 
According to Refinitiv data, the combined net profits of top global banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) are expected to fall 2% in the March quarter, compared with the cumulative profits in the December quarter.
That would mark their first quarter-on-quarter profit drop since the second quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv. 
Title: Top investment banks' quarterly profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/znpneqxkzvl/chart.png 
The data covers the top 65 global banks, each with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion or more. 
Analysts said lower fee revenue and trading losses due to market volatility triggered by the Ukraine crisis are likely to hurt first quarter profits, despite an overall rise in net interest income levels.
""Market volatility can make issuing equity and debt more difficult, reducing income for these areas of the business that focus on underwriting new stocks and bonds as a major revenue source,"" Andrew Dinnhaupt, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, said in a note this month. 
""This could weigh on companies’ bottom lines, even if their traditional banking operations get a lift from higher (net interest income) and faster loan growth."" 
According to Refinitiv data, the total value of pending and completed deals announced in the first quarter touched $922 billion as of Tuesday, the lowest since the second quarter of 2020. 
Title: Global M&As - Quarterly volume, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/klpykjndrpg/chart.png 
The number of deals where Citigroup acted as bookrunner declined 47% compared with last year, while those involving BoFA Securities Inc and  JP Morgan Chase  fell 39% and 36%, respectively. 
Title: Drop in M&A deal value by bookrunner (in the first quarter of 2022), https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/myvmnqaadpr/chart.png 
Global equity issuance deal volumes plummeted to $129 billion in the first quarter, from $390 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Refinitiv, as the market for initial public offerings came to a virtual standstill. 
Equity underwriting deal volumes fell 80% for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the two most dominant financial advisors on IPOs globally. 
Title: Global equity issuance - quarterly volume, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/byprjbqqepe/chart.png 
Bill Fink, head of U.S. middle market banking at TD Bank, said M&A activity declined in the first quarter due to heightened uncertainties over the Ukraine-Russia conflict, supply chain interruptions and higher inflation. 
""Plus the prospect of the Fed increasing rates beyond the number of times it originally projected, it's a recipe for uncertainty – and the M&A market dislikes uncertainty as it impacts purchase multiples and ultimately purchase price,"" he said.
In February, Citigroup said its total exposure to Russia amounts to $9.8 billion, following questions over whether it will have to set aside funds to cover potential losses. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said that the bank could have to write off nearly half that amount in a ""severe stress scenario.""

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 03:22PM ET</span>","Waymo offers driverless rides to San Francisco employees, expands in Phoenix","By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc unit Waymo said on Wednesday it has started offering driverless rides to employees in San Francisco, accelerating a race with General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co-backed rival Cruise to commercialize the technology in the dense city. 
Waymo also introduced autonomous rides to employees in downtown Phoenix with safety drivers behind the wheel, with a goal to open it to public testing.
""Operating fully autonomously in multiple markets — in addition to Waymo's growing trucking operations — is a critical validator of the scalability of Waymo's operations and technology,"" it said in a statement. 
A self-driving technology pioneer, Waymo started the first U.S. driverless taxi service in 2020, over a decade after it was born in 2009 as a project inside Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While it gives paid rides to hundreds of people a week using Chrysler minivans, Waymo's service has not expanded beyond suburban Phoenix areas that cover about 50 square miles (129.5 square kilometers). [nL1N2R80CD]
Waymo in August started giving autonomous rides free of charge to a limited number of people in San Francisco with safety drivers on board, using its Jaguar electric vehicles equipped with sensors such as spinning lidars on the top. 
Waymo needs to receive at least two more permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to start charging passengers for driverless rides in San Francisco.
Waymo declined to comment on whether it had applied for the permits.

Cruise already is giving fully driverless rides to employees and members of the public free of charge in San Francisco. The company is seeking CPUC approval for commercial driverless service, with a goal to get permitted this year. 
Self-driving technology firms, which have attracted billions of dollars of investments, face challenges of scaling up their technology, after missing their earlier targets to launch commercial services.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stuttered Wednesday, as the run-up in tech stocks paused following weakness in chip stocks as investors continued to watch developments in Ukraine and Federal Reserve officials calling for a faster pace of rate hikes.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.45%, or 157 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%.
Chip stocks fell more than 2% to weigh on the broader tech sector, pressured by a weakness in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell more than 2% as better than expected second-quarter results and third quarter guidance were offset by worries about slowing growth amid an unfavorable macro environment.
“Investors concerned about inflationary risk and consumer wallet will likely view strong results skeptically,” Credit Suisse said in a note..
Consumer discretionary stocks, which in tandem with tech have underpinned the recent rebound, also stumbled.
PVH (NYSE:PVH) was the biggest sector decliner down more 6% after its softer than expected guidance offset quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations on the bottom line.
 Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) was also big a drag on the sector, down more than 4% after JP Morgan downgraded the building product firms to underweight, on worries about several headwinds including a slowing housing market amid tighter monetary policy.
Bond markets, meanwhile, continued to be closely watched, a day the after a key part of the yield curve inverted, triggering worries about a recession ahead amid fears the Federal Reserve may tightened too aggressively and tip the economy into a recession.
Those worries remained front and center on Wednesday as Fed officials continue to call on the central bank to pick up the pace of tightening to curb inflation at time. 
“Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate,”  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday.
 The 10-2 year treasury yield spread, which turned negative briefly turned negative a day earlier, continued to flirt with inversion. The spread on the 10-year Treasury, which briefly dipped below the yield on the 2-year Treasury for the first time since 2019, continued to flirt with inversion again.
The Fed has said the economy is strong enough to withstand the pace of expected tightening. Economic data on Wednesday was mixed as private jobs gains in April surprised to the upside but economic growth, or GDP, in the fourth quarter was unexpectedly revised down a tenth of a percentage point to a 6.9% increase."

The move offers a shot of hope to major U.S. cruise operators such as Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd that have struggled to bring in revenue since the pandemic started.
Cruise operators had also said the health agency was discriminating against the industry, when hotels and airlines could operate with limited or no restrictions.

""While cruising will always pose some risk of COVID-19 transmission, travelers will make their own risk assessment when choosing to travel on a cruise ship, much like they do in all other travel settings,"" the CDC said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) is considering shifting the clearing of contracts that underpin global debt markets away from London, two industry sources said on Wednesday. 
A potential relocation to Chicago is being evaluated, the sources said of a move that could stoke fresh concerns about Britain's post-Brexit role in global finance.
Clearing has become a politically sensitive topic since Britain left the European Union, with Brussels saying that UK-based clearing houses such as ICE Clear Europe and the London Stock Exchange's LCH would no longer be able to serve customers in the bloc after June 2025.
The EU wants to build autonomy in clearing and end heavy reliance on London.
ICE, owner of the New York Stock Exchange and a futures exchange in London, is a major clearing house for credit default swaps (CDS) contracts, which are widely used by banks and investors as insurance against companies defaulting on bonds.
ICE says it clears about 95% of cleared corporate and sovereign CDS market, with 85% in Chicago and 10% in London.
The sources said it is asking customers in London if they could move CDS clearing to Chicago to increase efficiencies.
""The reason they are asking customers is that it reflects the way CDS clearing is done now,"" one of the sources said.
ICE, which declined to comment, has EU permission to clear CDS trades for EU customers from its Chicago business.
Any move by ICE will be closely watched by London Stock Exchange-owned rival LCH, which operates CDSClear.
""CDSClear continues to expand, and we are looking to develop our services for a wider range of customers,"" said Frank Soussan, global head of CDSClear.
While clearing was given a three-year reprieve, a bar on euro derivatives trading between Britain and the EU following Brexit has forced banks in the bloc to use platforms in New York to trade swaps with a UK counterparty.
Banks warn that efforts by Brussels to force euro derivatives clearing to move from London to the bloc could also see swathes of the activity ending up in the United States.

""The EU's constant bickering with London post Brexit has fundamentally destabilised the business case for derivatives in Europe making the U.S. appear the more flexible, pro-business choice,"" said Patrick Young, who writes a daily newsletter on exchanges.
ICE shifted trading in 245 futures and options contracts in North American oil and natural gas liquids from London to the United States in February 2018 and moved its EU carbon trading from London to the Netherlands in June last year.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands attended the Bangkok International Motor Show this week where electric vehicles (EVs) were in the spotlight due to rising petrol prices and a government subsidy taking 15% off the price of some EV cars.
Thailand, along with most other countries in Southeast Asia, has been slow off the blocks to embrace EVs, but demand is starting to gain momentum with Chinese car makers in particular producing cheaper models and increasingly targeting the region.
""I can't handle paying for the price of gas anymore, so I'm here looking to buy an electric car,"" said Natnicha Srimuang, who purchased an EV at the motor show. Thai gasoline prices are around 40 baht ($1.20) per litre, up 50% from last year.
Some see a switch to EVs as a way to save money longer-term.
""I (want) to invest my money in a good electric car that fits my lifestyle,"" said Patricia Duangcham, who said she expects to save thousands of baht a month from the purchase.
The combination of energy price concerns and more affordable models will help spur EV adoption, said Michael Chong, general manager of Great Wall Motor Thailand.
This year's motor show was also the first since government subsidies for EV buyers were introduced.
While many global car makers displayed EVs, there were long queues to take a peek inside Great Wall Motor's competitively priced 'ORA Good Cat' model.
Domestic demand for EVs is a crucial part of a Thai government strategy to preserve its status as a major regional automaker. The government is targeting production of 725,000 EV units a year, or 30% of total vehicle output, by 2030.
Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest auto assembly and export hub for companies like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd.
State-owned energy firm PTT Pcl has teamed up with Taiwan's Foxconn to produce EVs in Thailand by 2024.
China's Great Wall Motor also plans to produce EVs in Thailand in two years' time.
The demand for EVs has been picking up in Thailand, though from a low base. Last year, the number of registered fully electric cars doubled to about 4,000, though that still pales in comparison with total domestic car sales of 759,119 last year.
Despite the hype around EVs, some attending the motor show intend to stick to combustion engines due to concerns about the new technology.

""(The) EV car is only starting, and no one knows what kind of problems are going to happen,"" said Ponchai Lertlai, 59.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 02:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Russia to keep gas contract currency unchanged in rouble switch, sources say","(Reuters) - Russia plans to keep the contract currency for gas exports to Europe unchanged but will seek final payment in roubles as one of the options to switch the currency of gas trade, two Russian sources said on Wednesday.
President Vladimir Putin has said Russia, the world's top natural gas producer, will soon require ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for fuel in roubles, raising alarm about a possible gas crunch in Europe. 
""Only payment currency is changing, the contract currency is not,"" one source said. For example, for deals clinched in euros the payment should be made at the official rouble/euro exchange rate set by the Russian central bank, that source said. 
The Russian president told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz by phone on Wednesday that nothing would change for European partners and payments would still be made in euros and transferred to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) bank, a German spokesperson said.
They added that Scholz is committed to a G7 agreement that energy supplies from Russia would be paid for only in euros or U.S. dollars. 
The proposed scheme is one of the options and is not final, the sources said. According to a third Russian source, Gazprombank, Russia's third-biggest bank, could serve as an intermediary for transactions between the gas buyers and Gazprom. 
The payment should be done in the rouble equivalent on a pre-agreed settlement day, the sources said.
""There is no final decision yet, the work is ongoing,"" a financial source involved in drafting the gas payments scheme told Reuters. The central bank, Gazprom and Gazprombank did not reply to a request for a comment. 
Moscow has yet to describe how it will go about the switch, which the Kremlin indicated on Wednesday could extend to Russia's other exports, and the sources offered the first details that investors and customers have been keenly awaiting.
There is no clarity on whether gas buyers from so-called unfriendly countries - those that joined Western sanctions on Russia - will accept the demand to pay in roubles. 
Gazprombank is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas. It was sanctioned by Britain along with some other Russian companies earlier this month. 
On Wednesday, Germany triggered an emergency plan to manage gas supplies under which Europe's largest economy could ration power if a standoff over Moscow's demand for rouble payments disrupts or halts supplies. 
Putin is due to listen to proposals on how to switch the payments to roubles, including from Gazprom and the central bank, on Thursday, and the scheme will be made public, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. 

The customers will not be obliged to switch to roubles as soon as from Thursday, Peskov said, as ""payments and delivery is a time-consuming process."" 
Gazprom, which accounts for 40% of European gas imports, does not disclose gas prices country by country, but has planned to charge Western countries an average $296 per 1,000 cubic metres this year, up from $280 in 2021.

Canadian carriers, battered during the pandemic due to the country's tough rules, are seeing a bounce in spring traffic. But higher oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have cast a shadow ahead of the busy summer vacation season. 
The company plans to increase its full-year capacity by about 150% compared with 2021, or around 75% of 2019 levels before the pandemic. It also expects a 13% to 15% increase in adjusted cost per available seat (CASM) compared with 2019.
Canada's largest carrier is targeting the faster rebound in U.S. traffic to boost its hard-hit international routes, through so-called sixth freedom travel where Americans from smaller cities connect through Canadian hubs like Toronto en route to destinations like Europe. 
""Looking at the summer of (2022) we estimate there will be over 1,000 city pairs on the U.S. translatlantic connecting through our hubs,"" said Mark Galardo, the carrier's senior vice president, network planning and revenue management.
""This strategy particularly pays off today since sixth freedom demand supports the recovery,"" Galardo told the carrier's investor day. 
Montreal-based Air Canada is the largest foreign carrier operating in the United States and is focusing growth on cities like Atlanta, Austin and Seattle, he said.
Galardo sees rising immigration to Canada fueling demand from destinations like India, even as the carrier is weighing new routes in Africa. 
On Tuesday, Mexico's privately held Aeromar signed an agreement to jointly market routes through Mexico.

Air Canada said last week it would add 26 extra-long-range versions of the Airbus A321neo aircraft as part of its narrowbody fleet renewal.

Mediolanum declined to comment.
Braving turbulent markets and the backdrop of international sanctions against Russia that led to the seizure of the mega-yachts owned by oligarchs, Ferretti last Friday pulled off an 890 million euro ($993 million) IPO two years after a previous attempt foundered.
After pricing the IPO near the bottom of the range it had indicated, Ferretti said on Wednesday it had pocketed a net HK$ 1.77 billion ($226 million) from the deal.
It will use the cash to broaden its brand portfolio and also strengthen services for owners of its boats, it has said.
Chinese firms Sunshine Insurance, Sanya Development Holdings, Hainan Free Trade Port Fund, Hainan Financial Holdings and Haifa Holding acted as cornerstone investors taking 53% of the offering, Ferretti said.
Of the rest, the top 10 investors took more than half, the source and a second person close to the transaction said.
The two sources said Italian participation had been hindered by the fact that some of the investors who wanted to buy into the IPO lacked Asian share denominated accounts to deal in.
Ferretti, whose brands include Riva, Pershing and Wally, is owned by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group.
Piero Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), son of the eponymous luxury sports car company's founder Enzo Ferrari, owns 11% of the company and sits on the board.
The Hong Kong offering was 1.07 times oversubscribed, while demand for the international offering totalled more than twice the amount on sale, the company said.

""The (Office of the Attorney General) OAG confirms that in mid-March it carried out a search of a banking institution in Geneva. This search took place in the context of ongoing criminal proceedings, linked to the Petrobras investigation complex, which were opened in December 2021,"" federal prosecutors said in an emailed statement.
Swiss newspaper Le Temps earlier on Wednesday reported on the raids.
A spokesperson for Pictet confirmed it was the bank in question.
""For Pictet, this inquiry relates to matters which primarily occurred more than a decade ago and as early as 2005,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Swiss prosecutors have been working for years to identify assets and bring forward prosecutions in relation to a sprawling international corruption case linked to Brazilian state oil firm Petrobras. 
The so-called Car Wash probe, known in Portuguese as Lava Jato, began in 2014 with the arrest of a currency dealer and mushroomed into Brazil's biggest ever graft scandal, mainly involving Petrobras contracts in which some 200 businessmen, officials and politicians have been convicted. 
In October, Petrobras said it paid more than $850 million to U.S. authorities as part of an agreement on a related corruption probe.
Other banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Brazil's Banco do Brasil and Geneva-based Banque Cramer & Cie, have come into the crosshairs of related international probes.

(Reuters) -Trulieve Cannabis Corp reported a 24% rise in fourth-quarter adjusted core profit on Wednesday, helped by strong demand for pot and related products.
Trulieve's shares were up 2.3% at C$26.48.
The results come as the sector has drawn renewed investor interest with a cannabis decriminalization bill heading for vote in the U.S. House of Representatives this week.
""Certainly, we would all like to see federal change and certainly the American people are supportive,"" Chief Executive Officer Kim Rivers told Reuters.
However, she added that the industry has not been driven by the requirement for a federal change.
""This is a state-by-state operation and what's happening at the state level, is, at this juncture more impactful on our businesses as well as on people's access to cannabis than what is happening at the federal level,"" Rivers added.
Trulieve, which operates in 11 states including Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania, said fourth-quarter revenue surged 81% to $305.3 million also boosted by its $2.1 billion acquisition of medical pot producer Harvest Health.
The company said it expects full-year 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and adjusted core earnings in the range of $450 million to $500 million.
U.S. cannabis sales, which boomed during pandemic-led lockdowns, is forecast to reach $46 billion by 2026, according to industry research firm BDSA, as states like New York and New Jersey open up.
Still, margins and profits remain thin, triggering calls from investors and analysts for consolidation to improve profitability by finding savings in scale.

Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF) posted a loss of $71.5 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a year-ago profit of $3 million.
The company took $73.3 million of non-recurring fair value of inventory step up, and acquisition charges primarily associated with the Harvest buy.

U.S. health officials on Tuesday authorized second booster shots of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccines for people aged 50 and older, citing data showing waning immunity and the risks posed by Omicron variants of the virus.
The BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron has triggered a surge in infections in many countries across Europe and Asia, and raised concerns over a potential new wave in the United States.
More than half of the COVID-19 cases in the United States are now caused by the BA.2 sub-variant, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also authorized a second booster dose of the vaccines for younger people with compromised immune systems. It cleared Pfizer and partner BioNTech's booster shot for those aged 12 and older and Moderna's shot for people 18 and older. 
Rite Aid said eligible customers may walk in to a store immediately or schedule an appointment online from Wednesday.
Walgreens said people can schedule an appointment to receive the second shot starting on Friday, with walk-in appointments available from Wednesday through Friday, depending on store capacity.

Rival CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is preparing to administer the second boosters, the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday. 
Eligible patients can soon schedule an additional dose four months after their initial booster dose, the company said, adding that same-day or walk-in appointments could be possible but are subject to local demand.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government wants to clinch a deal on the sale of state-owned carrier ITA Airways by mid-June, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
ITA took over from Alitalia in October, permanently grounding the 75-year-old, one-time symbol of Italian style and glamour after years of financial losses and failed rescue attempts.
Shipping group MSC and Germany's Lufthansa have expressed interest in buying a majority stake in ITA and requested an exclusivity period of 90 days to iron out details of an acquisition. But Rome opted for a market-based procedure aimed at keeping the door open to other potential suitors.
The government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi wants a privatisation deal in place before the start of summer, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Draghi's office declined to comment.
Under a government decree entered into force early this month, Rome plans to privatise ITA through a direct sale or a public offer while retaining a minority, non-controlling stake in a first stage.
Last week the Treasury picked Equita and Gianni & Origoni as financial and legal advisers, intensifying efforts to find strategic partners.
The ministry has mandated the advisers to review the expressions of interest for the carrier and short list suitors who will be admitted to the data room, a third source said.
Under an agreement with the European Union, Rome can inject up to 1.35 billion euros ($1.51 billion) into the carrier by 2023. A privatisation deal would reduce the financial support granted by the state, limiting the costs for Italian taxpayers.
Last year the treasury paid a first tranche of 700 million euros. It is expected to inject an additional 400 million euros in April, with another 250 million euros scheduled for next year.
In past decades, Alitalia tried and failed to clinch alliances with Air France and, more recently, Gulf airline Etihad.

Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) last week said it wanted to deepen its commercial ties with ITA Airways but was not interested in taking an equity stake in the carrier.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Wayfair (NYSE:W) stock fell 5% Wednesday after Loop Capital downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ with a target of $90, about 27% lower than its current price of $123.
Analyst Laura Champine earlier had a ‘hold’ rating for the stock with a target of $95, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst points out that a slow replacement cycle is a key feature of the furniture industry and Covid-19 did indeed drive demand for the company’s furniture as the stimulus helped families create home offices and home schools.
But now, according to Champine, given the reopening and with most things back to normal, households don’t need two of those set-ups. Instead, she says many consumers are looking to spend on social activities and vacations they’ve been postponing.
“We see persistent cost pressures on every line of Wayfair’s income statement,” she said in her note. The brokerage has lowered its estimate for Wayfair’s current financial year revenue by $400 million and $1 billion for 2023.
She believes that advertising will remain expensive and less productive due to changes to Apple’s privacy rules."

Russia restricted access to Instagram from March 14 and subsequently found its owner Meta Platforms Inc guilty of ""extremist activities"". Moscow is battling with Big Tech to control information flows after it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
Instagram said the decision to block it would affect 80 million users in Russia. Although people can still sometimes access the photo-sharing platform using a Virtual Private Network, domestic alternatives have started appearing, the latest being 'Grustnogram', or 'Sadgram' in English. 
What began as a joke among friends quickly became something that could work, one of Grustnogram's creators Ivan Semkin told Reuters on Wednesday. 
""We tried to draw a concept, it took a day or two, we tried to make it look good and we realised it came out very well, and it was a seriously good thing that we could show to others.""
Semkin said he was now hoping the government would support their project. 
BROKEN HEART 'LIKE' 
""Post sad pictures of yourself, show this to your sad friends, be sad together,"" a message on the platform's website read. 
An image of the app's planned user interface showed a woman in a fur coat standing in front of St Basil's Cathedral on Moscow's Red Square. The search bar tells users to search for sad compatriots. 
Instead of Instagram's heart-shaped 'like' button, Grustnogram offers a broken heart and the option to 'be sad'. 
""We are very sad that many high quality and popular services are stopping their work in Russia for various reasons,"" Afisha Daily quoted Alexander Tokarev, another of the service's creators as saying. ""We created Grustnogram to grieve about this together and support each other."" 

Tokarev said four people, including two freelance programmers, were behind the project, and said he expected the application to appear for Android devices by the end of the week, and later on the App Store. 
Rossgram, an imitation of Instagram in name, design and colour scheme, was set to launch this week, but its founders only succeeded in publishing a video of a prototype hours after the scheduled launch time.

By Conor Humphries and Tim Hepher
DUBLIN (Reuters) -The world's top aircraft lessor AerCap has submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets stuck in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, setting the stage for a lengthy legal wrangle between lessors and insurers.
Dublin-based AerCap had the largest exposure of any lessor when European Union sanctions forced the termination of Russian leases, accounting for 5% of its fleet by value.
Not only is its insurance claim expected to be the biggest among lessors seeking compensation for the hundreds of planes worth a total of up to $10 billion which remain in Russia, it is also one of the largest single claims ever submitted. 
""Last week we submitted an insurance claim for approximately $3.5 billion with respect to our aircraft and engines remaining in Russia,"" Chief Financial Officer Peter Juhas told investors following the publication of financial results for the final three months of 2021.
""In this case we expect them to be contested, just given the large sums involved across the industry,"" he added. 
Lessors had until Monday to wind up current rental contracts in Russia under sanctions imposed by the European Union.
Analysts have said that the unprecedented nature and scale of the potential losses will likely mean years of litigation between lessors and insurers before any decisions on payouts are taken.
One industry executive predicted an ""ugly battle"" between the leasing and insurance companies. 
AerCap said it may book an impairment in the first quarter of its financial year but it had not yet determined how big that might be. Juhas estimated AerCap's net Russia exposure at around $2.5 billion. 
AerCap had 135 aircraft and 14 engines on lease to Russia but has repossessed and removed 22 aircraft and three engines, it said in financial results for the fourth quarter of the year. 

Its shares were 4% lower at 1415 GMT, and down 18% since the start of the year. 
AerCap, by far the largest aircraft lessor in the world after its acquisition last year of rival GECAS, had 3,701 aircraft, engines and helicopters on its books at the end of December, it said.

1386,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>","Buying by Quant, Short, Pension Funds Dims Stock Market’s Economic Signal","(Bloomberg) -- Tempting as it is to credit the stock market’s rollicking advance to expectations the economy will thrive despite war and inflation, other forces are at work in the rally.
How much they are responsible for is a serious question for traders and central-bank modelers alike.
Down only three times in two weeks, the S&P 500 has now soared 11% since mid-March to post one of its strongest gains over comparable periods in the last decade. The rebound, defying recession alarms from the bond market, has recouped almost three quarters of its losses from January and February.
Before assigning an economic narrative to the bounce, it’s useful to consider some of the constituencies who have helped fuel it. They include pension funds snapping up shares as the quarter rolls over, computer-driven traders programmed to add equities when volatility plunges, and short sellers forced to buy back borrowed stocks when prices rise.
Their actions help explain why stocks have kept rising despite outflows from equity funds, and add fuel to warnings from some Wall Street analyst that the gains are a bear-market rally. The buying from these groups reflected a need to adjust to market movements, rather than genuine demand driven by improving fundamentals. 
“I question how sustainable it is -- there is a lot of technicals,” said Michael Purves, founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. “You need to see fundamental investors come in and feel comfortable buying this dip. But to do that, they’re going to need to see some stability in the back of the Treasury curve and earnings are going to need to be good.” 
With earnings season still two weeks away, investors are left with few clues on how corporate America is navigating runaway inflation and the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike since 2018. Meanwhile, parts of Treasury curve have inverted, spurring concern that the central bank’s campaign to tame price gains could send the economy into a recession.  
All the uncertainty generated by the Fed and the war in Ukraine sent the S&P 500 as much as 13% from its all-time high in mid-March. At that time, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) projected pension and sovereign wealth funds would need to rebuild equity holdings that had fallen in value, with a potential buying spree totaling $230 billion. 
Whether the subsequent rally was aided by actual pension rebalancing or other investors buying stocks in anticipation of that is hard to determine. Regardless, the move has been powerful. The S&P 500 has jumped 11% and reclaimed major trendlines such as its 200-day moving average. The Cboe Volatility Index plunged to the lowest level in more than two months. 
In some ways, the rally has started a cycle that drives macro systemic strategies to load up on stocks. These funds, using momentum and volatility signals to guide trades, had spent the previous few months betting against the market. 
In the week through Monday, quant funds, including volatility-targeting funds and trend-following commodity trading advisers, purchased $25 billion of equity futures, according to an estimate by Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR). 
A similar dynamic played out on the individual-stock level. Richly valued shares, targeted by short sellers during the rout earlier this year, are outpacing the market on the way up as bears have capitulated. 
A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of the most-shorted companies has surged 27% since its March trough, more than double the S&P 500’s gain over the stretch. 
“Leveraged investors have participated in the current sell-off by aggressively reducing their equity exposure,” Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note. “Short covering by these participants helps to explain why some of the longest duration equities have recently risen sharply in the face of rising interest rates and a more hawkish Fed.”  
While the rally may have emboldened some buyers, it has yet to revive animal spirits broadly. Even as stocks climb back toward all-time highs, sentiment is stuck at levels worse more depressed than during the dark days of the pandemic, according to Goldman’s equity sentiment indicator that tracks everything from retail activity to money flows and fund positioning.
From a contrarian’s perspective, the lack of faith means potential buying power, and the only missing ingredient is some kind of catalyst to convince skeptics that the bull market will live on.
What that catalyst could be is up for debate, though one argument gaining traction is that stocks can work as a hedge against inflation. Indeed, analyst estimates have stood firm during this year’s turmoil, a clear sign of corporate resilience.
How much investors are willing to pay for those profits is the main variable that will influence the market, according to Dennis DeBusschere, the founder of 22V Research. He points to a wild swing in price-earnings multiples as the culprit for this year’s market chaos. With borrowing costs poised to rise in coming years, he sees a ceiling in equity valuations. 
At 20 times earnings, the S&P 500 was traded at an elevated ratio that before the 2020 pandemic had happened only once in the past two decades -- the dot-com era. 
“Be skeptical of chasing the latest narrative,” said DeBusschere. “Financial conditions are likely to tighten and are a headwind for P/E, which limits upside.”

Russia scrapped a 20% value-added tax on gold buying for individuals on March 1 as people rushed to park their savings when the rouble sank to record lows. The currency has been hit by sweeping Western sanctions on Russia in response to what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
State-run VTB said it had received over 200 orders since it started selling gold bars at the start of the month. It said customers most frequently bought one kilogramme bars.
In a situation of ""increased uncertainty,"" gold allows investors to diversify their portfolios, secure their savings and protect them for future generations, VTB senior vice president Dmitriy Breytenbikher said in a statement.
Purchases of precious metals by Russian households should also reduce the amount of cash flooding the economy, analysts have said.
Gold prices hovered near $1,933.7 an ounce on Wednesday, not far from 2020's all-time peak of $2,072.50 and up from around $1,800 at the start of the year.

From Monday, Russia's central bank restarted buying gold from banks at a fixed price of 5,000 roubles ($59.35) per gramme after temporarily suspending purchases from banks in mid-March to meet increased demand for the metal from households.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Indian private lender Axis Bank has decided to bulk up its credit card and retail businesses with a $1.6-billion purchase of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s local consumer banking arm.
The deal announced https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/83190dcd-4ae6-45f4-b3fa-8d39d91a4aa6.pdf on Wednesday is Axis Bank's largest by far and would expand its credit card customer base by 31%, narrowing the gap with the third-biggest player ICICI Bank.
""The acquisition strengthens our market position, reduces gap in key segments with peers and provides opportunity to accelerate retail business growth,"" Amitabh Chaudhry, managing director and CEO of Axis Bank, said at a press conference.
Citi was among the first international lenders to introduce credit cards in India in 1987, but its market share, according to Macquarie, has dwindled to 4% from 13% a decade ago. 
The sale advances Citi Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to overhaul the bank by exiting retail banking operations in 13 countries where it does not have the necessary scale to compete.
'SWEET DEAL' 
Axis Bank, India's third-largest private lender, will also gain access to Citi's local wealth management arm in the deal. The lender expects the purchase to increase its deposit base and loan book by 7% and 4%, respectively, while reducing its capital adequacy ratio by 180 basis points to 13%. 
""It looks like a sweet deal for Axis,"" said Anand Dama, a banking analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services. ""While the assets have good value, I think they got an even better deal on the liability side.""
Apart from the $1.6 billion being paid in cash, Axis will also need to set aside around 35 billion rupees ($461.07 million) for loan provisions and other regulatory requirements related to the deal.
The purchase is expected to close in the first half of next year and excludes Citi's Indian institutional client businesses.

Axis Bank's Chaudhry said technology integration after the acquisition remains a key challenge and could take several quarters.

Investing.com – Pearson ADRs (NYSE:PSO) tumbled 6.6% Wednesday after the group’s rejection of an $8.8 billion offer from Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) made the U.S. investment company walk away from the proposed transaction.
“The board of Pearson considered the third proposal, together with its financial and legal advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects,” it said in a statement.
“Accordingly, the board of Pearson unanimously rejected the third proposal.”
Pearson CEO Andy Bird has turned Pearson’s focus to selling directly to consumers and not just its traditional customers comprising schools, colleges, and shops.
The company closed December with 2.75 million registered users on its app including 133,000 paid subscriptions. It recently acquired Clutch Prep, an online video-based learning service to fuel Pearson+ with original video tutorials. It is also catering directly to businesses looking to train staff.
The rejection of Apollo’s offer puts a greater spotlight on Bird to solidify that shift to digital.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>",Swiss Re shareholders urged to oppose chairman's re-election in gender row -FT,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) shareholders have been urged to vote against the re-election of Chairman Sergio Ermotti at the reinsurance company's upcoming annual general meeting, The Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended shareholders oppose the reappointment of Ermotti, as a ""signal of concern"" over the lack of gender diversity on the reinsurer's board, the paper said.
Ermotti joined Swiss Re in October 2020 after a nine-year spell as Chief Executive at Switzerland's biggest bank UBS. He became chairman in 2021.
According to the FT, ISS criticised Swiss Re in its report ahead of the vote, due to take place on April 13, for failing to live up to its commitments to diversity and for falling short of an industry benchmark of having women account for at least 30% of boards.
Three women are standing for election to the 12-strong Swiss Re board, according to an invitation to the AGM seen by Reuters, which would give a 25% representation.
ISS is endorsing the rest of the board appointments and says the vote against Ermotti is warranted ""because the board is insufficiently gender diverse,"" the FT reported. 
ISS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Proxy advisers such as ISS have influence with passive investors and large institutions, who often follow their recommendations.
Swiss Re said it considered gender diversity to be of the ""utmost importance"" in the composition its board, and was committed to reaching the 30% goal by 2023's AGM.

""At Swiss Re, we embrace and build diversity, equity and inclusion, bringing together the best of multiple generations, cultures, skillsets and thinking,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
""We strongly believe that Mr Ermotti's measured approach to succession planning and assuring gender diversity is in the best interests of shareholders and Swiss Re.""

Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) said its net loss rose to 4.05 billion yuan ($637.64 million)from 2.95 billion yuan in the third quarter, taking its full-year loss to 12.2 billion yuan. That is deeper than an 11.8 billion yuan loss in 2020. 
The airline also faces closer regulatory scrutiny following the crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet last week that killed 132 people on board, which has led it to ground 223 planes of that type as a precaution while the investigation proceeds.
The company will closely monitor the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash and evaluate the impact on its financial performance and operational results, said the carrier in its annual report.
Beijing-based Air China (OTC:AIRYY), the country's flag carrier, said its net loss widened to 6.32 billion yuan in the fourth quarter from 3.54 billion yuan and it posted a full-year loss of 16.6 billion yuan. 
China Southern Airlines fell to a fourth-quarter net loss of 5.98 billion yuan, after posting 1.43 billion yuan in the red the previous quarter. It reported a full-year loss of 12.1 billion yuan. 
The Guangzhou-based airline also forecasted a pickup in deliveries of the Boeing 737 series aircraft from 2022, as Chinese carriers are set to resume commercial services of the 737 MAX, which was grounded in China for over two and a half years. 
China's domestic travel market, which had rebounded quickly due to its successful containment of the COVID-19 virus in the early days of the pandemic, is nursing heavy losses as authorities struggle to stop the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant under its strategy of eliminating cases. 
More than two-thirds of planned flights are being cancelled every day across China, according to third-party aviation data providers, while financial capital Shanghai is in the middle of a two-stage lockdown of 26 million people. 
Data firm OAG said on Tuesday that China's available seat capacity this week was down 10.2% from a week earlier and 24.4% from the same week last year.
A strong yuan currency was again a favourable factor this year, offering some relief to Chinese airlines that have financed a large portion of their foreign debt obligations in U.S. dollars. 
However, high fuel costs, which already inflated costs last year, are set to weigh on bottom lines this year, as Russia's war in Ukraine heightens geopolitical risks and reinforces broader inflationary pressures across the supply chain. 
Brent crude futures stood at $113 a barrel, up 45% from the end of last year. 
China remains virtually shut off from international markets as already reduced flights get suspended under its ""circuit breaker"" system when there are COVID-19 positive arrivals, leaving many passengers stranded abroad.

Domestic flights over the northern summer season that began this week and lasts through October are set to reach 117,000 flights per day, up 6.8% from a year ago, according to aviation data provider Flight Master, although a large number of them could be cancelled.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Air France-KLM and its Dutch subsidiary KLM on Wednesday lost their challenge against million-euro fines re-imposed by EU antitrust regulators five years ago for taking part in an air cargo cartel two decades ago.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) said it was considering appeal against the decision.
Air France and 10 of its peers had in 2015 won their court fight against fines levied by the European Commission in 2010 for fixing air freight services, fuel and security surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006.
The EU competition enforcer subsequently fixed procedural errors pointed out by the Luxembourg-based General Court and in 2017 re-issued the same penalties except for Martinair which had its fine reduced. 
The airlines then took their case back to the General Court, Europe's second-highest.
The Luxembourg-based court rejected Air France KLM and KLM's appeals and those brought by Martinair Holland, Cargolux, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY).
""Air France-KLM has taken note of the EU General Court’s judgement on the appeal filed against the decision of the European Commission of 17 March 2017 against 13 cargo operators, including Group airlines Air France, KLM and Martinair for practices considered to be anti-competitive in the air cargo sector,"" Air France KLM said in a statement.
""The Group will immediately analyse this decision in view of an appeal before the Court of Justice. Provisions of 350.6 million euros ($391 million) including interest have been made in respect of these fines in the accounts on 31 December 2021,"" it added.
The Commission had fined Air France 182.9 million euros, the highest, followed by KLM at 127.1 million. The total fine for the cartel made up of 12 airlines came to 776 million euros.
The court reduced the fines for Air Canada, Japan Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY), Latam Airlines Group and its subsidiary Lan Cargo. 
SAS's fine remained about the same after judges reduced the penalties for part of its infringements but increased them for others.
Lufthansa and subsidiary Swiss International Airlines escaped a fine as it alerted the EU competition authority to the cartel.

The cases are T-323/17 Martinair Holland, T-324/17 SAS Cargo Group and others, T-325/17 KLM, T-336/17 Air Canada, T-334/17 Cargolux Airlines, T-337/17 Air France–KLM, T-338/17 Air France, T-340/17 Japan Airlines, Case T-341/17 British Airways, T-342/17 Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and others, T-343/17 Cathay Pacific Airways, T-344/17 Latam Airlines Group & Lan Cargo and T-350/17 Singapore Airlines & Singapore Airlines Cargo.

Nowinski argues that some customers may decide to stay away from OKTA as the company failed to notify the public about the incident in a timely manner.
While the CyberArk platform likely would not have prevented the breach any better than the Okta technology, we believe the time lapse between when the breach was identified (January) and when the breach was disclosed to customers (March) could sway customers toward CyberArk. If this incident does result in a higher win percentage, CyberArk should be able to exceed the 17% revenue growth management guided to for FY22,
though we believe the current valuation is likely factoring in some of this upside, Nowinski said in a client note.
A new price target on EW-rated CYBR is now $170.00 per share, up from the prior $150.00.
Similarly, the analyst hiked the price target on SailPoint to $60.00 per share, up from $55.00.
With Okta's upcoming new IGA solution not launching in North America until mid-year, we see a minimal competitive threat from Okta near term, Nowinski added on SAIL.

The price of nickel, which is essential to making batteries for electric vehicles, had been rising steadily even before the conflict in Ukraine drove it up even further and triggered chaos at the London Metal Exchange in early March.
Prices of other metals used in cars, including aluminum, palladium and lithium, have also soared recently.
Tesla, the world's largest automaker, signed the multi-year supply deal with Vale for nickel from Canada, Bloomberg reported.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Vale declined to comment on the report, but said it had stated previously that the company currently sells 5% of its production into the EV market and plans to increase that to 30%-40%.

Tesla has been less affected by supply chain issues arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared with other automakers that have cut production as they face shortage of several components including chips and battery metals of EVs.
Chief Executive Officer CEO Elon Musk said earlier this month that the electric car maker and his rocket company SpaceX are facing significant inflationary pressures in raw materials and logistics.

The company, which produces about 80% of its output in Russia, proposed a dividend of 0.55 euros per share, down from the 1.32 euros flagged previously.
The conflict in Ukraine has caused high uncertainty related to Nokian's operational environment and manufacturing capacity, the company said.
Nokian also plans to ""expedite"" new production capacity in Europe, it said without elaborating.
Inderes analyst Joonas Koerkiakoski said the decision to reduce the proposed dividend was to be expected.

After Russia sent its troops into Ukraine, Nokian shifted part of its production from Russia to Finland and the United States ahead of possible sanctions. 
The company also scrapped its full-year guidance, citing a slump in the value of the Russian rouble and disruptions to the Russian payment system.

Analyst Stefan Slowinski said investments during the COVID-19 pandemic to build fulfillment centers for faster deliveries and employee bonuses to keep its warehouses staffed in a tight U.S. labor market may eat into the company's margins.
He added that capital expenditure could grow in the mid-teens, initiating with a price target of $2,800. 
Amazon's shares were down about 1% at $3,354 in early trading in a weak broader market.
Of the 58 brokerages covering Amazon, 20 rate the stock ""strong buy"", 36 ""buy"", one ""hold"" and one ""sell"", according to Refinitiv data. The median price target is $4,000.
Amazon boomed during the pandemic as consumers were highly dependent on online shopping for everyday essentials, but those shoppers are now returning to stores.
Customers are also cutting back on discretionary spending in a highly inflationary environment, at a time when costs of raw materials, procurement and shipping are rising for companies. 
""While margin expansion is possible, clearly with high inflation the consumer is under pressure... Amazon is already increasing prices on their customers by increasing their Prime pricing,"" Slowinski said.
He added that Amazon would not raise pricing on many products to match inflation and would probably take a hit. 
The company would need to allocate capital expenditure for its cloud business, as it aims to expand footprint by about 30% in a competitive market, he said.

""Worldwide shipping costs have gone crazy for everybody,"" Friedland told the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago. ""It has posed a challenge, but we see that coming down and you can move the material, it just takes a bit longer.""
Of the $1.28 a pound costs reported by the company for the last quarter of 2021, the cost of logistics for delivery to China accounted for $0.37, or 29%.
Ivanhoe, which operates the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in southern Congo's Lualaba province, currently trucks its output to the South African port of Durban.
It is now looking at using an alternative route through Angola to cut back on transportation costs, Friedland said. 
""It's about a third of the distance and a new Angolan railroad is going to move us much closer to the ocean,"" he said.
Ivanhoe is working with its joint venture partner Zijin Mining to bring down costs, he added. ""We see a lot of shipping alternatives to using containers,"" he said. 
The cost of shipping containers has surged from pre-pandemic levels.
Kamoa-Kakula produced 105,884 tonnes of copper in concentrate last year. 

Ivanhoe is ""very interested"" in expanding into the United States, Friedland said, adding that the country is under-explored and some places have ""enormous"" potential copper resources.

The company’s long-term vision and strategic outlook failed to reverse the losses.
President and CEO Joel Anderson said, the company is navigating a dynamic macro environment related to the lingering impacts of the pandemic.
Sales in the fourth quarter rose 16% to top $996 million. Comparable sales were up 3.4% compared to a time when stimulus check-loaded customers came flocking to stores. The company opened 17 new stores in the quarter and had 1,190 stores in 40 states as on January 29.
Net profit was up more than 13% and topped $140 million to beat estimates.
“We delivered sales growth in line with our expectations against the difficult comparison to last year's stimulus-fueled comparable sales increase of 13.8%, and despite the impact of weather in January. The strength was broad-based, with Sports, Candy, Seasonal and Style worlds outperforming,” Anderson said in a release.
Five Below expects 2022 net profit to be $306 million on net sales of $3.21 billion, both estimates at the center of the guidance range.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday issued new guidance to broker dealers and investment advisors on how to satisfy their obligations to retail investors and comply with agency rules when recommending investment products. 
The guidance clarifies brokers' and advisors' obligations under the SEC's long-standing Investment Advisor Fiduciary Standard and its Regulation Best Interest rule, passed in 2019. 
A key focus is how much brokers and advisors should disclose in cases where they may have conflicts of interest. Investment firms often offer brokerage accounts and advisory accounts, but the rules governing these two types of accounts differ. Advisers must place clients' interests ahead of their own, while brokers must only believe that recommendations are suitable for clients. 
The SEC wants to ensure advisors and brokers consider alternatives and cost, address conflicts of interest, and implement policies and procedures for making recommendations. 
""Firms may have a significant conflict of interest if the account type that is most profitable for them, for example, is not the type of account that is the best fit (for a) particular investor,"" an SEC official said.
The Republican-led SEC finalized Reg BI in 2019 in what was widely seen as a win for Wall Street after its 10-year battle over regulation of the investment advice industry. It fought off a more onerous proposal by the Department of Labor. 

Consumer groups criticized Reg BI for being too vague in its definition of “best interest” while not addressing all conflicts, including the higher payments that brokers receive for selling products that are more expensive to trade.
Wednesday's measure under the now Democrat-led SEC, seeks to plug some of these gaps, analysts said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has breathed new life into an investigation of Google Maps to determine if bundling the service together with other Google software illegally stifles competition, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The probe of the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit first came to light in late 2020 and had been quiet until recent months when investigators again began making inquiries, the sources said.
Google said it cooperates with regulators and welcomes their questions. The Justice Department declined comment.
The probe has two components.
One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided through infotainment screens in vehicles. In its Google Automotive Services package for automakers, the search company bundles together Maps, the Google Play app store, Google Assistant and other services. Car companies are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps with voice assistants developed by smaller rivals, one source said.
In response, Google said the integration provides the best user experience, and that in some instances a rival voice assistant can function with Google Maps.
The other component focuses on app and website developers. Specifically, the department is looking at Google's requirement that if a website or app uses one Google technology, say Google's location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other technologies developed by Google’s rivals, the two sources said.
A congressional antitrust panel concluded in a Big Tech staff report issued in 2020 that Google ""enforces this provision aggressively"" and effectively forces developers ""to choose whether they will use all of Google's mapping services or none of them.""
Google said its policies are aimed at preventing poor experiences, noting that mixing a Google Map with information on another map could lead to errors. The policies also stem from restrictions that partners place on how Google can use their data, it said.
The policies have some exceptions, and Google added that developers ""are also free to use other mapping services in addition to Google Maps Platform – and many do.""
MONEY AND DATA AT STAKE
Two developers have told Reuters over the past year that they received violation notices from Google in recent years after mixing data from the company's services with maps from other providers. The developers said the competing options were less expensive or more detailed than Google Maps in some cases.
The developers, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by Google, also have expressed concern about the company's new privacy options for users of its Android mobile operating system that could limit data collection by rival mapping providers. 
At stake are money and data, including about places and people's interests. Google does not separately disclose sales from licensing the map-related tools. But Google over the years has hiked mapping fees and tied the business to its Cloud unit, whose sales growth is of keen interest to investors.
In addition, the enduring use of Google's mapping services enables the company to collect more data to maintain its dominance over competing options.
Tying products together is not always illegal but antitrust enforcers have stepped in when such bundling does not benefit consumers.
In 1998, the government sued  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for allegedly breaking antitrust law by tying its operating system monopoly to Internet Explorer to crush rival browser Netscape.
There is no sign that the department's staff investigating Google Maps have recommended whether to sue, one of the sources said.
Google already is fighting a lawsuit the department filed in 2020, accusing it of breaking antitrust law to maintain its dominance of search and search advertising. It goes to trial in 2023.

A lawsuit against Google over its dominance of the online advertising business has long been expected to follow. That probe is further along than the one into the maps business, one source said.
The antitrust enforcer could be hampered in wrapping up the long-running probes because it has been swamped by an unusually large number of merger reviews and merger-related trials. A merger trial is expected in April and two more are expected in August.

Investing.com – RH (NYSE:RH) stock plunged nearly 12% Wednesday after the high-end furniture retailer said it had experienced softening of demand in the first quarter so far.
First quarter net revenue is seen growing 7-8% compared to the 78% growth in the same period last year. The company said the weakening coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February and the market volatility that followed.
The company said, “it is prudent to remain conservative until demand trends return to normal.”
The company flagged its concerns after its revenue in the fourth quarter through January 29 fell short of estimates.
Net revenue in the current year is seen growing 5-7%, compared to the 32% growth in financial year 2021. Adjusted operating margin could go either way compared to last year’s, according to the company’s forecast. It is seen between 25% and 26% compared to 25.6% in 2021.
The company just about met the lower end of its annual revenue outlook in 2021. In its third revision of the year, the company had, in December, said its annual revenue would grow 32-33% compared to the previous forecast of a 31-33% rise. Annual revenue rose 32% to $3.76 billion while fourth quarter revenue was up 11% at $903 million.
The company’s online businesses continue to lose money while adjusted operating margin expanded by 1.5 percentage points to 25.2% in the quarter.
Adjusted profit in the fourth quarter rose 14% to $164 million."

The economist argues that the consistently strong jobs data in recent months is likely to allow the Fed to focus more on inflation, hence she expects to see a 50bp hike in May.
The unemployment rate could become just as important to watch as average hourly earnings for signs of a tight labor market, with further declines likely to increase the Feds sense of urgency in raising rates at least back towards their estimated long-run neutral rate. We expect a very low unemployment rate throughout the summer months to support our base case for 50bp hikes at each of the next four FOMC meetings, implying the Feds long-run nominal neutral rate of ~2.5% is reached by September, Clark wrote in a client note.
Despite the very strong labor market, the economist isnt expecting to see the continuation of robust job growth as the pool of available workers continues to shrink.

Investing.com --  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) shares opened 15% lower Wednesday after tumbling in extended and premarket trading following the company's earnings and revenue miss. 
The online retailer of pet food and other pet products reported a loss per share of $0.15 on revenue of $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a loss per share of $0.06 on revenue of $2.42 billion. However, sales did rise to $2.04 billion.
In its shareholder letter, the company said the results showed “the conflict between the fundamentally strong demand that underpins our business and the highly challenging operating environment.”
While Chewy said there were positive trends in site traffic and order volumes, it saw operating conditions in some regions “deteriorate” due to the omicron variant, which “disrupted already-weakened supply chains across our industry.”
However, the company believes the ""near-term pressures on gross margin likely peaked in the fourth quarter,"" and they are ""already seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter.""
Chewy sees net sales in the first quarter between $2.4 billion and $2.43 billion, with net sales for full-year fiscal 2022 between $10.2 billion and $10.4 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire investor Richard (Ric) Kayne is seeking two board seats at Athira Pharma, arguing the biotech company needs a new chief executive officer to successfully guide its development of treatments for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Kayne, who founded private equity investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, told Athira shareholders that he nominated himself and George Bickerstaff, a former chief financial officer of Novartis Pharma AG, to the company's eight- person board, according to a letter seen by Reuters that was sent to shareholders on Wednesday.
He told the company about his plans last month.
The company's stock price climbed 2.15% in early trading as the broader market was off modestly.
""Simply put, Dr. Litton is not the right CEO for Athira,"" Kayne wrote, noting that Litton has little operational, clinical trial or scientific experience and spent most of his career in business development roles.
Mark Litton became CEO last year, succeeding Leen Kawas. Kawas oversaw the development of ATH-1017, an agent designed to regenerate brain tissue, and the company's public listing in 2020.
Kayne, who owns 4.8% of Athira's stock, says the stock price has tumbled 26% since Litton took over day-to-day operations in June and investors generally don't have faith in Litton's credentials or his ability to tell the company's story.
He is similarly critical of Athira's board, arguing the directors had little relevant expertise until recently when new members with biotech experience were added after he started pushing for changes. Kayne said the company offered him a board seat earlier this month but noted the ""offer was quickly rescinded with little explanation.""
A company representative said three independent directors joined in the last year and that the board already has the skills Kayne and Bickerstaff would add. She noted that board members have spoken with Kayne ""numerous"" times in an effort to find a ""collaborative path"" but that Kayne ""rejected our attempts to find common ground."" 
""Adding me and George Bickerstaff will help the Board restore credibility and refocus on what really matters: attracting the best management team and giving ATH‑1017 the best chance of success,"" Kayne wrote.

Five Below reported Q4 EPS of $2.49, up from $2.20 in the year-ago period and just above the consensus estimates of $2.48. Net sales came in at $996.3 million in the quarter, up 16% YoY and short of the analyst consensus of $1.01 billion.
The company reported a total location count of 1,190, up 1.4% QoQ and in line with the consensus projection. The number of store openings was 17 for the period, also in line with expectations.
Going forward, Five Below expects Q1 EPS in the range of 54c to 62c, well below the consensus estimates of 88c per share. The company expects comparable sales growth from 0% to 2%, compared with the analyst estimates of 1.13% growth. Net sales in the first quarter are expected in the range of $658 million, missing the consensus projection of $681.6 million.
Five Below expects EPS for the full year in the range of $5.19 to $5.70, short of the analyst expectations of $5.86 per share. FY net sales are expected in the range of $3.16 billion to $3.26 billion, compared with the analyst expectations of $3.35 billion.
The company expects to double sales and more than double EPS by the end of FY2025. It plans to open 1,000 new stores by the end of FY2025, including 375-400 new stores in the following two fiscal years, plus 550-600 new stores over FY 2024 and FY 2025.
The discount store company expects to triple the number of stores to more than 3,500 by the end of FY2030. FIVE's operating margin target is roughly 14%.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday as the peace euphoria of Tuesday faded against a backdrop of continued Russian offensives in part of Ukraine. Fears of inflation were also in evidence again as the latest revision of fourth quarter GDP data contained an upward revision to key measure of inflation in the period.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5 points - effectively flat - at 35,289 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%.
Earlier, a Ukrainian government spokesman said that Russia had renewed and intensified its attacks in the east of the country, lending substance to Western suspicions that the announcement of a de-escalation in the region around Kyiv (following some damaging battlefield reverses) was little more than a maneuver to gain time to regroup. Optimists pointed to more comments from the head of Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul.
News closer to home was more encouraging. ADP's monthly report on private sector hiring indicated that 455,000 jobs were created through the middle of March, only a slight moderation from February's rate. That follows the Labor Department's monthly job openings survey on Tuesday that showed vacancies still close to record highs, with little sign of a slowdown in sight. However, GDP growth data for the fourth quarter were revised down slightly to an annualized rate of 6.9% while the rate of personal consumer expenditures inflation was revised up to 6.4%.
The mood was supported by two stronger-than-expected earnings reports that came in the previous evening.  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock rose 6.7% to its highest in nearly three months after it beat forecasts with both its latest quarterly numbers and its guidance for the current year. Meanwhile Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock rose 4.7% as the company reported a banner quarter, thanks to the burgeoning demand for data center chips and high prices paid by automotive groups beset by component shortages. 
Going in the other direction was Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock, which lost 15% after the online pet food retailer reported a quarterly loss that was more than double expectations. It blamed the development on the wave of Omicron-variant COVID-19, which it said disrupted its already-strained supply chains. Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) stock also fell 3.6% after the discount retailer likewise missed expectations with its quarterly numbers. 
Elsewhere, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock surged 6.7% after the COVID-19 vaccine maker announced a special dividend and flagged plans for a buyback program worth up to $1.5 billion. The makers of COVID-19 vaccines have lost significant momentum in recent weeks as the disease has appeared to become both endemic and less virulent. Even at its current level, BioNTech stock is down 50% from its peak only four months ago.
Further afield, ADRs in German chemicals giant BASF (OTC:BASFY) fell 3.1% after Germany proclaimed the first stage of a three-stage emergency plan that could lead to the rationing of natural gas. Russia has threatened to stop shipments if 'unfriendly' countries don't pay it in rubles from the start of April, a move that would undercut existing sanctions on Russian banks including the central bank. Germany and other G7 members rejected that demand earlier this week, and the Kremlin walked back its previous threat a little earlier on Wednesday, saying any supply curtailments would take place over time."

LONDON (Reuters) -China's biggest offshore producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd is preparing to exit one of the North Sea's largest field in a strategic shift of focus to newer oil and gas developments and away from Western assets, banking and industry sources said. 
CNOOC has hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to start preparing a formal sale of its North Sea assets, which could raise more than $3 billion, the four sources said.
CNOOC declined to comment. Bank of America declined to comment.
CNOOC acquired the North Sea assets as part of its $15 billion purchase of Canadian producer Nexen in 2013, in its largest overseas acquisition yet. 
The deal was then seen as evidence of China's growing role in the international oil and gas industry as CNOOC took over the operatorship of one of Britain's largest oilfield Buzzard, whose crude is among the streams that set the North Sea Brent benchmark oil price. 
The planned sale coincides with a sharp rise in global oil and gas prices following a tightening of global supplies and oil exporter Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began at the end of February.
Given the extreme volatility of the markets, it is unclear if buyers and sellers would be able to agree on the value of assets, the sources said.
CNOOC, which holds a 43.2% stake in the Buzzard field, oversaw investment in the drilling of new wells that arrested its declining output. Today Buzzard produces around 80,000 barrels per day. 
CNOOC also operates and holds stakes in the Scott, Telford and Rochelle North Sea fields cluster and has a 36.5% stake in the Golden Eagle field. 
Two Chinese industry executives said the planned sale was part of a broader review of CNOOC's international assets as the Chinese giant seeks to focus on its most profitable and largest assets as well as new development prospects in Guyana and Uganda.
One of the sources said CNOOC's top mangement, including chairman Wang Dongjin, found managing former Nexen assets in Western nations such as Britain, Canada and the United States was ""uncomfortable"" because of red tape and high operating costs compared with developing nations. 
Growing trade tensions between the United States and China, exacerbated by China's stance over the war in Ukraine, have also played a role, as China fears possible tarrifs and sanctions in the future could impact its investments, a banking source said.
All of the sources asked not to be named because the sale is not yet public.

CNOOC's success in making sizeable discoveries offshore China, particularly in the vast Bohai Bay basin, has given it confidence to offload these marginal assets, the two Chinese sources said.
CNOOC reported on Wednesday record annual net profit for 2021, with earnings nearly tripled from 2020.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded 1% lower in premarket Wednesday, giving up its previous session’s gains amid reports of the company tying up supplies of nickel in secret deals.
The stock had added $84 billion in valuations Monday on the company’s plans for a second stock split in less than two years.
Tesla is focused on nickel-based chemistries for longer-range vehicles. It uses iron phosphate for shorter-range vehicles.
According to a Bloomberg report, among the many such deals the world’s most valuable automaker signed, is a multiyear supply pact with mining giant Vale. The agreement, which hasn’t been announced, covers nickel from Canada, the report said.
The efforts are part of CEO Elon Musk’s focus on vertical integration to maintain control over the supply chain, important for controlling costs and ensuring timely deliveries.
Musk has repeatedly flagged nickel supply as the company’s biggest concern and the metal’s availability is a source of anxiety throughout the EV sector. Battery-sector demand for nickel is expected to more than triple to about 1.5 million tons in 2030 from 400,745 tons this year, according to BloombergNEF.
Sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have added to worries about secure supplies, since the country holds about 17% of global capacity for refined Class 1 nickel, the type required for EVs.
The London Metal Exchange had to intervene on March 8 to calm the nickel market after prices spiked as much as 250% in two sessions to go beyond $100,000 a ton. That spike was due to a short squeeze and the gains have mostly pared since, but the market remains anxious about where prices are headed.
In January, Tesla committed to buy 75,000 metric tons of nickel concentrate from a Talon Metals (TSX:TLO) project being developed in Minnesota. That followed agreements with BHP (NYSE:BHP).

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a shortage of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in a car and are unique to each model, hitting the automotive sector.
""This threatens a loss of truck production for several weeks and a massive reduction in production in the second quarter,"" MAN said in a statement on Wednesday.
Since March 14, production has been at a standstill at its truck plants in Munich and Krakow, and it has seen significant production downtimes in Nuremberg, Salzgitter and Wittlich, MAN said.
MAN said it would take several months to duplicate Ukrainian supply structures for truck wiring harnesses in other countries.
In addition, it has decided to stop spending on non-business-critical activities and implement a hiring freeze. 
MAN has prolonged shortened working hours in Munich, Nuremberg, Salzgitter and Wittlich, and extended them to include administration.
""This means that up to 11,000 MAN employees in Germany will go on short-time work at the peak,"" it said, adding that country-specific regulations would apply to employees abroad. 

MAN has offered customers the possibility to cancel their orders as it is unable to meet its agreed delivery deadlines. They can also place orders at new conditions, it said.

The analyst said he is more confident in his Q1 delivery forecasts of 2,100 units and sees scope for upside. RBCs data shows an improving production ramp, Spak said in a client note.
Earlier this month, Rivian suggested they produced 1,410 vehicles in 2022 but said that in recent weeks the average weekly production rate was practically doubled to Q421 numbers.
RBC estimates the weekly production of around 320 vehicles per week. This implies a Q122 production level of ~2.37k.
We note that Visible Alpha consensus 1Q22 deliveries is 1.5k (but based on only 7 inputs). We forecast 1Q22 production is closer to the 2.4k level but assume that ~1 week of production is in transit, Spak added.
The analyst also weighed in on the massive selloff in Rivian shares.
The bar has been reset, we continue to have faith in management, the product, the business plan and the go-to-market strategy. We also believe Rivian is thinking thoughtfully about the entire value chain and how that needs to evolve (down and upstream). The near-term risk is supply chain, but we believe management contemplated the risks in their revised outlook. We view current levels as an attractive entry point for long-term holders. Tactically, as shown above, we may start to get more positive data points. Hitting near-term expectations can lead investors to gain more confidence in outer-year potential. And the valuation looks relatively attractive with an interesting risk/reward, Spak added.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:26AM ET</span>",Russia says buyback will prevent discrimination against Russian bondholders -Ifax,"(Reuters) -Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that a proposed sovereign Eurobond buyback would stop discrimination against Russian bondholders, who he said were not able to access funds sent to settlement system Euroclear, Interfax reported. 
Russia has offered to buy back dollar bonds maturing next week in roubles in a move seen by analysts as helping local holders of the $2 billion sovereign issue receive payment, while easing Moscow's hard-currency repayment burden.
The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4, Russia's biggest debt payment this year, follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its actions in Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.
""This is because we see money coming into Euroclear successfully reaching foreign holders, money on our debts,"" Interfax quoted Siluanov as saying. ""And settlements are frozen for Russian resident holders.""
Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""So in this case we have offered to settle directly with our residents in roubles, so as not to discriminate against our security holders and have proposed the possibility of buying back our debt from Russian residents,"" Siluanov added.
The finance ministry did not say how much of the issue is owned by foreign investors, but a Russian source familiar with the process said that the bulk of the Eurobond due on April 4 is split among Russian holders. 
The rouble initially crumbled after the sanctions, plunging by as much as 40% against the dollar since the start of 2022, but has since recovered some ground and was trading at around 83 to the dollar on Wednesday.
Although that is some way off levels of around 75 before Russia began what it calls a special operation in Ukraine, there were signs that the buyback may be popular among Russian bondholders. 
""Some Finam clients have those Eurobonds in their portfolio and they plan to take part in the finance ministry's buyback,"" said Dmitry Lesnov, head of Finam brokerage's client service development department. 
""The benefit of this decision may be that clients receive certainty on their positions and will be able to receive payments on assets, in spite of restrictions, introduced by European depositories Euroclear and Clearstream,"" Lesnov said. 
The bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30. 

Bondholders who do not sell their Eurobonds under the voluntary offer will be paid in U.S. dollars on April 4, another source familiar with the buyout process said. Russia has made other dollar coupon payments earlier this month. 
Russia's next deadline is on March 31, when a $447 million payment falls due. On April 4, it is also due to pay $84 million in coupons on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond.

Discount stores, which have benefited from shoppers turning to off-price retailers to protect their pockets during the pandemic-led economic downturn, have been bumping up prices and focusing on selling costlier items to offset shrinking margins.
Dollarama's U.S. counterpart  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) also raised prices for most of its products to $1.25 from the traditional $1 price point last year, in a bid to protect its profits from spiraling freight costs.
Montreal-based Dollarama, which has over 1,400 stores across Canada, said it expects supply chain and other inflationary pressures to be more this year and projected a decline in gross margins for its fiscal year 2023. 
The company said it expects annual gross margin to be between 42.9% and 43.9%. It reported a gross margin of 43.9% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 30.
Dollarama also saw a boost from increased spending on seasonal items in the holiday quarter, as well as price-sensitive shoppers looking to buy everyday essentials at cheaper rates, as higher prices of everything from clothing to cooking sauces began to hit consumers' wallets.
The dollar store chain posted an 11% rise in fourth-quarter sales, in line with analysts' average estimate, even as a fresh round of COVID-related restrictions hampered footfalls at its stores over the holiday season.
Sales rose to C$1.22 billion ($977.64 million) in the quarter from C$1.10 billion a year earlier.

Excluding items, Dollarama earned 74 Canadian cents per share in the three months to Jan. 30, above estimates of 71 Canadian cents per share.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:12AM ET</span>",Wall Street regulator proposes to expand the definition of broker-dealers,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday proposed expanding the definition of broker-dealers and mandating that Principal Trading Firms (PTFs) must register with the agency in a bid to enhance market resiliency and help level the playing field.
The Wall Street regulator said its proposal, which is subject to public consultation, aims to expand the definition of a dealer as ""one that engages in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,"" which would capture a range of activities it sees as critical to the agency's monitoring of systemic risk.
""In recent years, we've seen a number of high-profile events in markets with significant participation by PTFs. Tremors in the Treasuries markets in 2014, 2019, and at the beginning of the COVID crisis in 2020 demonstrate the importance of the SEC's oversight of dealers,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.
Monday's proposal specifies that broker dealers who routinely make comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day must register with the regulator. 
Dealers who ""routinely express trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other market participants"" must also be registered, the SEC said, in addition to mandating that a dealer must register with the agency if she earns revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer.
The regulator also seeks to scrutinize dealers who capture any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests.

Regulators have long argued that high-frequency trading, a computerized strategy that can move billions of dollars in fractions of a second, carries risks in the U.S. government bond market that threaten the ability of the market to function, as well as the ability of investors to fairly value assets.
The SEC, as the U.S. market's regulator, should require that such trading firms comply with capital and record-keeping rules and be subject to periodic exams, much like equities and corporate bond markets, Gensler has argued.

The analyst is cautious on HOOD as he sees strong competition that will likely weigh on user growth. Moreover, 2022 is seen as a transition year.
HOOD has established a presence in the retail trading marketplace with a sleek and user-friendly mobile app offering free stock, options, and crypto trading. We see a significant opportunity for HOOD to grow with this ~150m Gen Y/Z demographic as they age into their prime earning and savings years. The financial super app the company envisions can offer a full suite of financial services products with significant revenue potential, just as SCHW has met the needs of the baby boomers and Gen X, Cyprys said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley projects the account growth at a 6% CAGR to 41 million by 2031 and a similar 6% CAGR through 2024, which is significantly below the Street consensus of 13%.
Overall, Cyprys is bullish on Robinhood's long-term potential and opportunity set but sees near-term challenges and limited visibility.
A higher interest rate environment reduces shareholder patience to wait for progress on growth and the path to profitability. HOOD went public in July 2021 at $38/share, and with the stock down ~80% from the August peak, we see sentiment skewing negative, though a $7/share cash pile provides downside support. However, tough comparisons loom over the next several quarters: Retail customer engagement in the markets has softened in the more challenging macro/geopolitical backdrop, pressuring account growth and transactional revenues, Cyprys concluded.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>","Rouble extends recovery gains, stocks up on 5th trading day","(Reuters) -The rouble firmed on Wednesday, extending a recovery and heading towards levels seen before Russia launched what it calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine.
Stocks inched higher on the fifth trading day after a month-long hiatus.
At 1147 GMT, the rouble was 2% higher at 83.50 against the dollar and had touched 82.55 on the Moscow Exchange, a level last seen on Feb. 25, the day after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.
Against the euro, the rouble rose 2% to 92.30, having briefly hit 90.73, its strongest since Feb. 23.
The rouble is now driven by export-focused companies that are obliged to sell foreign currency as well as by month- and quarter-end tax payments that boost demand for roubles, while importers' activity is low, said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank.
""This created an imbalance on the currency market as a result of which foreign currency supply substantially exceeds demand and thus leads to the firming of the (rouble) rate... I see the current (rouble) rate strengthening as temporary,"" Orlova said.
Dynamics driving the rouble lately are to some extent artificial. The currency, which had been free-floating until late February, is now steered by capital controls, a ban on buying cash dollars and euros and other administrative measures.
Sberbank CIB said the rouble could continue firming until the central bank starts to ease capital controls.
On the interbank market, the rouble traded at about 83 against the dollar. Banks offered to sell euros at 91.25 roubles and buy at 95 roubles.
This week, the rouble received some support from the recent round of Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, where the Russian delegation promised to scale down military operations around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.
The Russian currency is extending gains made last week after President Vladimir Putin demanded that natural gas exported to Europe or the United States be paid for in his country's currency.
European countries, which import about 40% of their gas from Russia and pay mostly in euros, say state-controlled Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is not entitled to redraw contracts. The G7 group of nations rejected Moscow's demands this week.
VOLATILE STOCKS
Russian stocks have moved sharply and sometimes erratically in the past few days, after the central bank allowed the market to end a nearly month-long pause. 
Trading hours on the stock market are shorter than in the past and trading volumes are far lower than normal, and non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
London-listed internet firm VK, one of a few companies to have flagged issues with servicing debt, saw its Moscow depositary receipts rallying 27% at some point on Wednesday after a 72.3% leap the day before. They ended the day 9.7% higher.
Shares in Russian state energy company Inter RAO jumped 25.5% after that firm recommended paying dividends.

The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 7.7% to 949.23 points, and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 4.3% higher at 2,513.0 points.
Flag carrier Aeroflot, one of the most volatile securities since the reopening, jumped 24.7%. Oil major Rosneft was 4.6% higher and dominant state lender Sberbank gained 4.5%.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>","H&M seen posting first-quarter profit, Russia clouds outlook","By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's H&M is seen swinging back to profit in its December-February quarter as pandemic effects ease, though the closure of its Russian stores and the economic fallout from war in Ukraine has made the company's outlook more uncertain. 
Analysts polled by Refinitiv on average expect the world's second-biggest fashion retailer to report a pretax profit of 1.04 billion crowns ($112.2 million) for its first quarter on Thursday.
Sales were up 23% year-on-year, H&M has reported, but down 11% from two years earlier, before the pandemic.
The year-ago period, when nearly half of stores closed due to the second wave of the pandemic, H&M made a 1.39 billion crown loss. Two years ago, it made a 2.50 billion crown profit.
Alongside many other companies reacting to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, H&M on March 2 said it would temporarily close its stores in Russia, expressing concerns about the ""tragic developments in Ukraine"". 
Some companies, such as brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), have decided to exit Russia permanently, while the Kremlin has threatened to seize assets of companies that pull out.
Russia was H&M's sixth-biggest market with 4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. While the group is reducing its store count overall, it has been increasing its number of stores in Russia, to 170 at the end of November.
Analysts have been lowering full-year earnings estimates for H&M recently.
""For H&M we could see further downside risk to estimates if H&M decides to pull out of Russia/Ukraine permanently due to the conflict there, or this leads to further upwards pressure on inflation and commodity prices,"" RBC analysts said in a note.
H&M's sales halt in Russia follows a sharp drop in demand in China over the past year, related to concerns the group has expressed about workers' rights in the Xinjiang cotton growing province. China had accounted for around 4% of H&M's sales. 
As recently as January H&M unveiled targets to double sales by 2030 and to reach an operating margin of 10% by 2024. Last year it reached 7.7%.
Competitor and market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, grew sales 33% year-on-year, and 21% from the same period in 2019, in the six weeks from Feb. 1.

H&M's shares are down 18% so far this year, while the European retail index is down 22%, and Inditex 26%.

Investing.com – BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock gained 8% in premarket trading Wednesday after the company beat fourth-quarter estimates and promised to channel its surging cash flows from its life-saving Covid-19 vaccines into the research of similar therapies for oncology and other infectious diseases.
A special dividend of 2 euros per share and a likely buyback of up to $1.5 billion worth of shares were also adding to the gains in the stock. The company expects to authorize the share repurchase plan that will be executed over two years.
The company expects its Covid-19 vaccines to generate sales of anywhere between 13 billion euros and 17 billion euros. That will be less than the 19 billion euros the company booked in 2021 and indicates a slight softening of demand with much of the world’s population vaccinated with at least one dose. The virus is also expected to weaken with most of the world having had at least two surges since 2020.
Revenue in the final quarter was 16 times higher at 5.53 billion euros, riding on the unique mRNA technology in the company's vaccines that saved millions of lives the world over. Under collaboration agreements, territories have been allocated amongst BioNTech,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and Fosun Pharma (HK:2196) based on marketing and distribution rights. Gross profits are shared between the companies.
As of mid-March, BioNTech and Pfizer have signed orders for nearly 2.4 billion doses in 2022, the former said in a release. As of the beginning of this month, they have so far delivered more than 3.1 billion doses of BNT162b2 to more than 170 countries.
Net profit in the quarter was 3.16 billion euros.
The company said it is developing the next generation of Covid-19 vaccines while fully leveraging the potential of all technology platforms across autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and regenerative medicines.

On the former, Ng forecasts EPS growth of over 20% after 2022, which should likely help PYPL shares to re-rate following massive losses suffered recently.
The EPS growth will be driven by secular tailwinds from the digitization of payments and e-commerce growth, abating headwinds after 2022 (e.g., eBay, supply chain, credit & funding normalization), and product initiatives to improve monetization & market share at Venmo and Paypal.
Ng has a $144.00 per share price target on PYPL, which signals an upside of nearly 19%.
Similarly, Ng started Block at Buy with a $173.00 per share price target.
SQ is well-positioned to benefit from Cash App's growing monetization from new product features (e.g., tax preparation, card spending, cash management, stock investing, Bitcoin) while enjoying ongoing user growth from the network effects of P2P payments, as well as Square's continued share gains within SMB acquiring. The recent acquisition of Afterpay should generate synergies and integrate the Square and Cash App ecosystems through the addition of new consumers and merchants, as well as helping to establish commerce & brand discovery features into Cash App while generating leads for merchants, the analyst wrote in a client note.

The analyst remains bullish on Disney's Theme Park recovery as metrics show that the company is yet to experience strong demand despite achieving near-record results in FY1Q.
This prediction is backed by the following factors:
All these factors are likely to provide additional tailwinds over the next 18-24 months.
The robust recovery, thus far, is currently being driven by a bounce back in domestic attendance, yield management, Genie+ and strong merchandise sales. DIS was opportunistic during the pandemic to implement transformational changes to the park to increase the longer term operating margin potential of the business. These include implementing a new park reservation system, mobile ordering, managing annual pass holder visits (which are typically lower revenue generators), integrating food and merchandise through storytelling (a large driver of per-cap increases) and new attractions, Reif Ehrlich said in a client note.
The analyst expects to see new investments in attractions, ships, locations to continue driving additional attendance.
As a result, Reif Ehrlich raised FY23/24 estimates for Parks, Experiences and Products. The analyst is also positive about other parts of Walt Disney's business.
With the parks in strong recovery mode, content ramping for Disney+, peak Disney+ losses expected in FY22, and options on sports betting, NFTs, metaverse, etc., Disney is entering a period of very strong earnings growth (44% EPS CAGR ˜21-24E), the BofA analyst concluded.

1430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:18AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Strategists See Threat to U.S. Profits From Wages,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. profits are likely to feel the heat from a jump in wages this year caused by a historically tight labor market, according to Morgan Stanley strategists. 
“The challenges companies face in attracting workers seems to be worsening in quarters,” strategists including Andrew Pauker and Michael Wilson wrote in a note.
Companies have so far responded by raising prices to offset higher wage costs, but that could become increasingly difficult as demand weakens across industries such as household durables and autos, they said.
After consistently lagging behind productivity growth over the past two decades, wages have rapidly caught up in the post-pandemic economic recovery. What’s more, the jump in costs is likely here to stay, rather than being a temporary squeeze as fiscal policies lead to persistently tight labor markets.
“Wage gains are not just due to the rapid recovery from the Covid-19 shock that may ease as the economy loses some steam,” said Morgan Stanley economists Julian Richers and Ellen Zentner. “Instead, higher wage growth in excess of productivity is likely to be the norm, not the exception for some time as the labor share of corporate income normalizes.”
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists flagged the issue last month, saying that concerns about rising wages had dominated fourth-quarter earnings calls at S&P 500 companies. 
For Morgan Stanley strategists, a “full convergence of real wages with productivity implies that economy-wide pretax profit margins would fall to 10.7% from 17.8%.” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts expect operating margins of 16.5% in 2022.
Earnings Could ‘Make It or Break It’ for Stocks: Barclays’ Cau
The Morgan Stanley strategists recommend utilities, telecoms and energy as sectors that are relatively immune to higher wages, while hotels, restaurants and leisure, retailers and healthcare providers and services are more exposed. 
Among individual stocks, investors should focus on names that still have the ability to pass on costs to consumers, that have more flexible cost structures and more durable margins.
They listed FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).,  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)., AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO). and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) among firms “adversely exposed” to wage pressures.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>",Generali investor Del Vecchio backs Caltagirone's plan for insurer - Bloomberg,"MILAN (Reuters) - A strategic plan for Generali (MI:GASI) backed by rebel shareholder Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone goes in the right direction by setting up the company for growth, another of the top investors in Italy's biggest insurer was quoted as saying.
Leonardo Del Vecchio, the billionaire founder of eyewear giant Luxottica and the third-largest investor in Generali behind Caltagirone, told Bloomberg in an interview that candidates put forward for Generali's board by Caltagirone were ""highly competent and well balanced."" 
Construction magnate Caltagirone has challenged the reappointment of Generali Chief Executive Philippe Donnet, by proposing the group's former head of Austria, Luciano Cirina, as an alternative CEO.
His slate of board nominees also includes former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna as chairman.
The duo unveiled their strategic plan for Generali, dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"" in a reference to the insurer's symbol, on Friday in Milan.
Del Vecchio, 86, expressed appreciation for the plan saying it reflected ""a long-term entrepreneurial vision that doesn't just look for dividends but also at the need to grow the company.""
Del Vecchio holds around 8% of Generali and is considering further raising the stake, Bloomberg reported quoting sources familiar with the matter.
Generali's board, with backing from the company's single largest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), has proposed handing Donnet a third term as CEO when shareholders vote to name a new board on April 29.
Donnet in December presented his own three-year strategy for Generali, hiking dividends and announcing the first share buyback in 15 years.
The alternative plan Donnet's challengers unveiled on Friday targets much higher profit growth to be achieved in part through mergers and acquisitions, as well as cost-cutting.
Del Vecchio said he hoped to see ""major and transformative transactions"" at Generali, which a chairman ""with operating capabilities"" could help to achieve.
The Luxottica founder also backed the choice of Cirina, who was fired by Generali on Monday for alleged breach of contract, as CEO because he came from within the group.
Finally, he took aim at Mediobanca, in which he is in turn the single biggest investor with nearly 20%, saying Generali's growth may have been ""held back by a shareholder that is only interested in extracting dividends.""

Mediobanca derives a third of its profits from its near 13% Generali stake and Del Vecchio in the past has criticised what he deemed an excessive reliance on the Generali contribution.
To counter the two tycoons' weight at the April 29 AGM Mediobanca has borrowed shares in Generali to reach a 17% voting stake, a move which also drew criticism from Del Vecchio.

1432,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:03AM ET</span>","Apple: Ignore Press Reports, iPhone Demand Remains Strong - BofA","BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating and a $215.00 per share price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares following reports that the Cupertino-based giant is planning to cut iPhone SE production.
Nikkei recently reported that Apple is looking to produce 20% fewer iPhone SE next quarter as it is experiencing weaker demand amid war in Ukraine. Moreover, the report noted some order cuts for iPhone 13 and AirPods.
Mohan reiterated that the demand for iPhones remains strong following his analysis of iPhone trade-in prices.
Apple is offering trade-in values that are at a discount compared to 3rd parties in the U.S. and the UK. Further, Apple recently reduced the trade-in prices for the majority of its models in the U.S., UK and China. In our opinion, lower Apple trade-in prices vs 3rd parties and the reduction in overall iPhone trade-in prices signifies strong demand. This compares to the year 2019 when Apple was offering high trade-in prices vs 3rd parties to drive upgrades, Mohan said in a client note.
Moreover, BofA's recent survey showed that over 25% of respondents globally still have old iPhones (iPhone 8 or earlier).
We see this as an opportunity for driving a replacement cycle. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus ownership is relatively higher in China compared to the U.S. and U.K. Apple could be targeting to upgrade these users to a newer iPhone which could be a reason Apple still accepts the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models for trade-in in China but not in the U.S. and U.K.
The analyst is also not worried about the new round of lockdowns in Shanghai as both Apple and Foxconn are able to relocate production to other non-impacted areas.
We do not expect a material impact from these shutdowns, Mohan concluded.

(Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747-8 freighter leased to Russia's AirBridgeCargo has flown to California from Hong Kong, according to FlightRadar24, after a U.S. judge signed an order allowing lessor BOC Aviation Ltd to repossess it.
The order was unsealed and made public on Tuesday, court documents showed and the aircraft arrived in the United States on March 25, according to the flight tracking service. 
BOC Aviation and its lawyers declined to comment.
Singapore-based BOC Aviation is one of many global aircraft lessors that had planes on lease to Russian airlines before sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced the cancellation of leases and insurance policies.
More than 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion remain in Russia despite a Monday deadline for contract cancellations, though the Interfax news agency last week reported that 78 had been seized abroad.
BOC Aviation shares closed 4.4% higher on Wednesday, outpacing a 1.4% rise in the Hong Kong index. The lessor on March 10 said its 18 planes leased to Russian airlines had a book value of $935 million and could be affected by insurance policy cancellations.
In court documents filed on March 14, BOC Aviation sought orders for one of three 747-8 freighters on lease to AirBridgeCargo that was in Hong Kong to be repossessed and flown to the United States for storage.
BOC Aviation said the aircraft was worth $148 million and that AirBridgeCargo had breached leases for two other 747-8s when it flew the planes, which were in mainland China, back to Russia despite the lessor's explicit instructions to ground them on March 5 after insurance coverage was cancelled. 
One of the planes returned to Russia even after its airworthiness certificate was suspended by Bermuda, the location of registry, BOC Aviation said.
Those two freighters remain in Russia, according to FlightRadar24 data. 

Volga-Dnepr Group, the owner of AirBridgeCargo, said on March 18 it had grounded the subsidiary's fleet of Boeing planes because of Western sanctions, according to media reports. 
A Volga-Dnepr spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the situation, citing ongoing negotiations with lessors.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 06:52AM ET</span>","In Zimbabwe, coal power project seeks other backing after China's U-turn","By Nelson Banya and Helen Reid
(Reuters) - A Zimbabwean company that had been banking on Chinese financing to build a major coal-fired power plant says it is now looking for alternative backers as China pulls back on funding such projects overseas.
The effort by RioZim Ltd, one of Zimbabwe's biggest mining and energy companies, reflects how China's recent U-turn on foreign coal financing is forcing developing nations across Africa and Asia to rethink their energy plans. China, which had been a top funder of coal power projects around the globe, announced in September it would not build new coal projects abroad as part of efforts to curb future carbon emissions.
Energy and climate specialists are watching to see the impact, including whether it will force a speedier shift to cleaner energy, result in other funders stepping in or lead to power shortages. Zimbabwe, which already suffers from a lack of electricity, has among the biggest coal reserves in Africa.
""The energy policy juncture Zimbabwe now finds itself at is emblematic of what many developing countries around the world are facing,"" said Leo Roberts, UK-based research manager who focuses on coal transition at climate think tank E3G.
Plans for the multi-billion dollar Sengwa power plant in northwest Zimbabwe involve more than doubling the country's current electricity capacity.
RioZim's energy division, Rio Energy, had been hoping for funding for the planned plant and associated coal mine from Chinese banks Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China Minsheng Banking Corporation Ltd.
Now, Rio Energy is considering alternative financing plans. ""We are still in the market to fund the project and we will work with all possible funders, including the Chinese,"" parent RioZim told Reuters.
The company said another option under consideration is to transform the project to a gas-powered plant, but that idea is ""subject to the outcome of feasibility studies"" and no time frame for those has been set.
RioZim told Reuters that ICBC and Minsheng Bank ""came in to play a supporting role"" but that it can't comment on the current status of their involvement because it doesn't have a direct relationship with the companies. Chinese bank financing for coal power plants overseas has often been arranged to support Chinese construction companies, which then enter into building contracts with the company planning the power plant.
ICBC told representatives of environmental non-governmental organisations in a June 2021 meeting that the bank would no longer finance the Sengwa project, according to two people who attended the meeting.
ICBC did not respond to requests for comment, including about the meeting or whether it plans to fund the Sengwa project. Minsheng Bank also didn't respond to Reuters questions about funding plans.
Plans for another large coal power project in Zimbabwe, known as Lusulu, are also up in the air, according to PER Lusulu Power, the Harare-based energy company behind the plant which had been planning on Chinese backing.
A Zimbabwe government spokesperson declined to comment on the status of either project. He said Zimbabwe has the right to exploit its coal resources if needed and would not ""sacrifice growth prospects on the altar of arguments to do with the environment.""
China's foreign ministry didn't respond to questions about the status of the funding of the Sengwa and Lusulu projects. But it said Beijing will support developing countries in shifting to greener energy.
The foreign ministry added that China, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Harare, ""will increase its support to Zimbabwe's development of renewable energy power projects, and help Zimbabwe's sustainable development.""
HANGING IN THE BALANCE
Christine Shearer, programme director for coal at U.S. think tank Global Energy Monitor, said Chinese financing for coal power appears to be frozen.
Despite the lack of clarity about what Xi's announcement means for planned projects, no new coal plants have since publicly announced Chinese support, ""suggesting the international financing tap for new coal projects from China has indeed been turned off,"" said Shearer.
Globally, some $63 billion of Chinese state financing across 57 projects could be at risk from China's withdrawal from coal financing overseas, according to Global Energy Monitor. The pullback could cut Africa's pipeline of coal power projects by two thirds to 3.6 gigawatts (GW), estimates think tank E3G. 
In Zimbabwe, less than half the population has access to electricity. The country has been betting on coal-fired power to address chronic electricity shortages and create jobs.
RioZim has talked about building the Sengwa plant for more than a decade. Plans include adding 2.8 gigawatts (GW) to the grid and restarting the adjacent coal mine, which has been closed since 2014. Currently, Zimbabwe has the capacity to generate around 2.3 GW, which comes mostly from a large hydroelectric power plant but also four coal-fired power stations.
The planned Sengwa plant, near the town of Gokwe, would create 1,100 permanent jobs and nearly four times as many temporary construction jobs, according to Rio Energy. Sedeya Jetro, head of a local primary school, said the jobs would enable parents to pay school fees and ""mean a lot to this community.""
Rio Energy told Reuters that ICBC had in 2019 provided an expression of interest - or non-binding commitment - to a Chinese construction company to fund the first phase of the Sengwa project. Neither the construction company, PowerChina International Engineering Co., nor its parent, Power Construction Corporation of China, responded to requests for comment.
Minsheng Bank also provided a non-binding commitment to RioZim to fund a second phase of the Sengwa project, according to Rio Energy and an August 2020 letter of interest from Minsheng Bank that Reuters reviewed. The pledge expired in February 2021, according to the letter.
A Minsheng Bank official who signed the document said in an emailed response to Reuters that the letter of interest was ""a trade secret"" and didn't respond to questions about funding plans. Spokespeople for Minsheng Bank and ICBC didn't respond to requests for comment.
Rio Energy was hoping for $3.4 billion of funding for the second phase of the power plant, according to a draft contract with a unit of engineering and construction company China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC). The contract, which was reviewed by Reuters, was dated November 2020 and drafted by both companies.
In response to questions about the planned Sengwa plant, CGGC's parent company China Energy Engineering Corporation told Reuters that a subsidiary signed a construction cooperation agreement in 2020. ""There is no progress on this project currently,"" it said, citing a lack of financing commitments.
PER Lusulu Power plans to build the 2.1 GW Lusulu plant in Zimbabwe's western province of Matabeleland North. It announced in 2015 that Chinese financial institutions had agreed to fund its construction, subject to conditions. PER Lusulu Power's website says the company entered into a construction contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation, which would secure debt finance from Bank of China.
PER Lusulu Power had also sought financing of up to $2 billion for the project from ICBC, according to extracts of a term sheet dated August 2020 viewed by Reuters. The term sheet is a non-binding agreement setting out the terms and conditions for an investment. It was unsigned, and was prepared by ICBC, according to a person familiar with the document.
Bank of China said in a statement that it doesn't have any electricity projects in Zimbabwe and has no plans to develop any. ICBC and China State Construction Engineering did not respond to questions about the Lusulu project. 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
One Chinese-funded project that is progressing is in the northwestern town of Hwange, where construction was already well underway when China announced its coal-funding freeze. The project involves the expansion of an existing coal-power plant and has been financed by a loan of roughly $1 billion from Export-Import Bank of China, the Zimbabwe government has said.Zimbabwe Power Company, which manages the plant, said in a November statement that the expansion ""continues to progress well"" and was more than two thirds complete. China's EximBank didn't respond to a request for comment.
The project is expected to increase employment by nearly doubling the current 2,853-strong workforce, while also sustaining the town's coal-mining industry, which employs thousands more people. The Zimbabwean government spokesperson said the country will be much better placed to meet electricity demand once the expansion - which is due to add 600 megawatts - is complete.
Renewable power advocates in Africa and elsewhere say China's pullback from coal power provides an opportunity to clean up. Zimbabwe is expanding its plans for generating renewable energy, such as solar power, but such projects can require fewer permanent employees than coal, making them less attractive for governments keen to generate employment. 

Sydney Gata, executive chairman of the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, said that an instant switch to solar and wind isn't feasible given the scale of the country's power needs.
""Renewables are not an immediate plan B for Zimbabwe,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Education group Pearson said on Wednesday it had rejected a third takeover offer from Apollo, valuing it at 6.7 billion pounds ($8.8 billion), prompting the U.S. investment company to walk away and sending its shares down 12%.
Pearson revealed earlier this month that it had rejected two takeover approaches from Apollo, sending its shares up 22% on the day.
The second proposal valued each Pearson share at 854.2 pence while the third offer came in at 884.2 pence. Pearson shares were trading at 697 pence at 0950 GMT on Wednesday. 
""The board of Pearson considered the third proposal, together with its financial and legal advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects,"" it said in a statement.
""Accordingly, the board of Pearson unanimously rejected the third proposal.""
Pearson's decision to dismiss a takeover, after it spent seven years navigating the difficult switch from traditional learning to online, will put even more focus on boss Andy Bird, and whether his new strategy can work. 

Bird has lately sharpened Pearson's focus to sell directly to consumers and not just schools, colleges or shops, while also expanding into the workforce training sector with recent acquisitions.
The company recently set medium-term targets for the first time in six years, believing it has turned the corner after changes in the industry hit its once thriving U.S. higher education courseware business, leading to a string of profit warnings. ($1 = 0.7605 pounds)

Chewy reported fourth-quarter net sales of $2.39 billion, up 17% YoY and below the analyst consensus of $2.42 billion. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $28.1 million, compared to a $60.8 million profit in the year-ago period and an expected loss of $73,000.
The number of active customers in the quarter was reported at 20.7 million, missing the consensus projection of 20.9 million. Net sales per active customer came in at $430, just above the analyst expectations of $429.61. Chewy reported a Q4 gross margin of 25.4%, compared to 27.1% in the year-ago period and consensus estimates of 26.2%.
For the first quarter, the retailer of pet-related products expects net sales in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.43 billion, missing the analyst estimates of $2.51 billion. For the full year, Chewy expects net sales to range from $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, below the consensus projection of $10.79 billion.
The company expects the FY2022 gross margin to be in line with the FY2021 gross margin.
Our ability to deliver 24% net sales growth in 2021, on top of the outsized growth we delivered last year, reflects the durability of our business and the Pet category beyond the near-term benefits of the pandemic, and is a strong testament to Chewy's ability to execute in the face of rapidly evolving macro conditions, CEO Sumit Singh said.
BofA analyst Nat Schindler lowered the price target to $108.00 per share, down from the prior $133.00 following as earnings suggest the company is suffering a growth slowdown in the first half of this year. Still, Schindler remains Buy-rated as he likes the long-term Chewy story.
We continue to see Chewy's subscription-driven model and recession-resistant segment as appealing and sustainable heading into a post-pandemic world. We reiterate our Buy rating and shift our valuation model by a year to FY23, Schindler said in a client note.
Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler echoed Schindler's comments.
Long-term, we remain positive on CHWY fundamentals given: 1) the significant shift in pet care spending to the digital channel; 2) predictable customer economics; and 4) our expectation for 15%+ long-term revenue growth and 5-10% long-term EBITDA margins (vs. ~1% in FY21). That said, we believe shares are fairly valued at ~7.5x FY22 EV/Gross Profit and believe that risk/reward is balanced at current levels, Kessler wrote in a memo to clients.

Investing.com –  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock surged 7.5% in premarket trading Wednesday after the company issued a strong forecast for the year, indicating sticky demand for its athletic wear.
The company benefited immensely in the last two years as people preferred its comfortable and casual clothing to manage both office and domestic chores during lockdowns. That demand isn’t weakening as people focus on health and general well-being more than they ever did.
For the year, the company expects revenue to be $7.49-7.61 billion. Diluted profit per share is seen at $9.25 at the midpoint of its guidance range.
The company crossed $6 billion in annual revenue for the first time while net revenue in the fourth quarter through January 30 rose 23% to $2.1 billion.
It was up 21% in North America and 35% internationally despite many of its stores operating for fewer hours in the last quarter.
Like most other companies, LULU continues to see cost pressures in labor, raw materials, and transportation. As a result, prices hikes will follow, Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald as telling analysts.
""We are taking modest selective price increases over the course of the year... It's a very small portion of our styles that are impacted... this will help offset some of the pressure we're seeing on average unit cost”.
The company closed the year with 49% more inventories in dollar terms and 33% on a number of units basis, suggesting tight control over stocks in an environment of supply chain issues.
In the current quarter, net revenue is seen at $1.54 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. Diluted EPS is expected to be $1.38-1.43 for the quarter.

The adjusted gross margin was reported at 50.4%, up from 47.4% in the year-ago quarter and above the consensus projection of 48.5%. The adjusted operating margin stood at 25.2% in the period, up from 23.7% in the year-ago period. RH reported a total location count of 81 in Q4.
For the current first quarter, RH expects an adjusted operating margin in the range of 23% to 23.5%. The company anticipates Q1 revenue growth of 7-8%. For the full-fiscal 2023, the company expects revenue growth of 5-7% and estimates adjusted operating margin to range between 25% to 26%.
Furthermore, the home-furnishings company said it plans for a 3-for-1 stock split in the spring.
RH's CEO Gary Friedman plans to offload roughly 1.7 million shares related to 2.9 million options that are due to expire. Following the sale, Friedman will retain beneficial ownership of around 21%.
The company said that rising inflation and interest rates, as well as geopolitical tensions, continue to add to the uncertainty. It said first-quarter sales and margin trends remain healthy, though the company has seen softening demand following Russias invasion of Ukraine and the consequent market volatility.
Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski upgraded RH to Buy from Hold with a $560.00 per share price target.
Matuszewski argues that the plunge in RHs P/E seems excessive, hence he sees a solid buying opportunity in a high-quality and branded business. The analyst also sees strong demand for furniture driven by the companys initiatives.
Elsewhere, BofA analyst Curtis Nagle lowered the price target to $650.00 per share from the prior $700.00 after not so cool results.
Despite recent uncertainty, RH management has also never been more positive on the company's competitive positioning, reiterating several large growth initiatives launching this year and long-term revenue targets. RH is operating with strong margins in a difficult environment, and has optionality with $2.2bn of cash on its balance sheet.

LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of the Ukraine war on banks in the European Union is 'manageable' but the effects of commodity markets on lenders needs to be watched, the bloc's body for winding down failing banks said on Wednesday.
The war has created volatility in markets like commodities and raised the spectre of a slowdown in the economy.
""We are monitoring the entire banking space, looking at first round impact, which seems from all we are seeing manageable,"" Elke Koenig, chair of the Single Resolution Board, told a media conference.
The impact of commodity markets on banks is an area to be watched, however, Koenig said.
""I would not see anything currently that I find deeply troubling for the moment."" 
However, Koenig said she does expect the level of souring loans to pick up due to economic slowdown.
The SRB intervened in the European operations of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, which looked set to fail as due to a run on deposits after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A second Russian bank, VTB, continues to operate in Europe because, unlike with Sberbank, its largely Germany based depositors had not fled, Koenig said.
The SRB requires banks in the EU to issue a set amount of special debt that can be written down in a crisis to replenish depleted capital without the need for taxpayer bailouts.
There were no worries that banks won't meet a 2023 deadline for special debt issuance, SRB officials said, but banks need to continually be on guard as existing debt expires over time.

""You need to issue this on a constant basis,"" Koenig said.
In case of a special debt shortfall in a crisis, a backstop single resolution fund is being created with contributions from banks and will be in place soon, Koenig said.

On Wednesday, the world's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), warned that China faces ""shrinking demand, disrupted supply and weakening expectations"" in its annual earnings report.
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd(AgBank) signaled the same in its full year report. 
China's banking industry is facing ""a more complicated and severe business environment,"" the country's second-biggest lender by assets, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB), said on Tuesday.
""The global epidemic will continue to recur, the easing policies of developed economies will be withdrawn, geopolitical conflicts will intensify,"" Bank of China (BoC) also said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the president of China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom), on Friday said it would be difficult for the bank to deliver satisfactory earnings this year.
China has been battling a resurgence in COVID infections in some of its largest cities, which has led to partial and full-scale lockdowns which analysts say will be a drag on the economy.
The main impact on banks will be ""rising loan delinquencies among service sectors"", said Nicholas Zhu, a banking analyst at Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
""These industries include wholesale and retail, leisure travel and other consumer discretionary services,"" he added.
The banks' warnings about the difficult outlook came alongside full-year net profit figures from the five lenders which beat estimates.
ICBC's net profit increased 10.3% to 348.3 billion yuan, above estimates, while AgBank also outperformed. 
It was the same story at BoC, CCB and BoCom.
SOUR DEBT
The non-performing loan ratios at four of the five lenders fell, though it increased at BoC.
However, corporate bad loans to the real estate sector jumped 98% at AgBank to 28.2 billion yuan, as developers continue to smart from stringent debt rules introduced last year. At CCB, real estate bad loans rose 50% on year to 13.5 billion yuan.
Since the introduction of the 'three red lines' rules on debt ratios last year, developers large and small have had cash flow issues.
However, large banks’ exposures to distressed developers such as Evergrande only account for a small proportion of their loan books and shareholders’ equity, said Zhu. 
""The impact on some regional banks will be larger because of their portfolios’ higher concentration and fewer mitigants,"" he added.

The net interest margin, a key gauge of bank profitability, stood steady at all the lenders other than CCB.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 06:01AM ET</span>",'Mystifying' U.S. stock rally defies economic unease,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -As a stunning rebound in U.S. stocks charges on, investors are questioning how long the surge can continue in the face of a hawkish Federal Reserve, warnings of recession from the bond market and geopolitical uncertainty. 
The S&P 500 is up 11% since March 8, its biggest 15-day percentage gain since June 2020, led by many of the high-growth stocks that have been pummeled for much of the year. The benchmark index has cut its year-to-date losses to 2.8%, after it earlier swooned by as much as 12.5%. 
The move has come despite a broad range of concerns that rocked equities earlier this quarter, among them the war in Ukraine, surging inflation and a sharp rise in Treasury yields fueled by tightening monetary policy from the Fed.
Stocks shrugged off the latest ominous sign from the bond market on Tuesday. The S&P 500 closed up 1.2% even as the widely tracked U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since September 2019, a phenomenon that has reliably predicted past recessions.
""It's been mystifying,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""I think that the bond market is sober and the equity market is quixotic."" 
Investors are pointing to a number of factors that could be driving the bounce in equities. 
Many have taken heart from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's assessment of the U.S. economy as strong enough to handle an aggressive pace of rate increases and may be cheering a Fed that now appears to be tackling sky-high inflation head on, analysts said. 
The S&P 500 has gained over 6% since the Fed's March 16 monetary policy meeting, at which it raised interest rates by 25 basis points and penciled in 150 basis points of tightening for the rest of the year.
""While stock investors love low interest rates, they don't love an inflationary environment that gets out of control,"" said J. Bryant Evans, investment advisor and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management. 
Recent weeks have also seen institutional investors driving up prices as they unwind so-called ""short"" bets against equities, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent report. 
At the same time, individual investors have been using the weakness in stocks as an opportunity to buy, the bank said.
According to Goldman, $93 billion of capital has flowed into U.S. equity funds since the start of the year, ""suggesting that households have continued to buy after the record year for U.S. equity inflows in 2021."" 
Indeed, many of the stock rally's biggest gainers have come in high-growth, retail investor favorites that had been hammered as bond yields shot higher earlier this year. Those include so-called meme stock darlings GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, whose prices have more than doubled from their 2022 lows, and Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund ETF, which is up 36.5% from its recent low.
Strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research said March 8 may have marked a bottom for the stock market this year, believing stocks are gaining support from investors using equities as a hedge against inflation, which stands at its highest level in nearly four decades. 
""The fog of war had masked the outlook, but the long-term bull market, punctuated by panic attacks, remains intact,"" he wrote on Tuesday.
The corporate earnings outlook also remains solid, even as higher energy and other prices threaten to erode profit margins. Estimates for S&P 500 profits have risen since the start of the year with companies overall expected to increase earnings by 8.8% in 2022, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
""Stocks were knocked down, but earnings estimates just kept going up,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ""Investors are hesitant to really unload on stocks here as the earnings and economic picture looks still very favorable."" 
Another factor may be investors adjusting their portfolios as the quarter winds down, strategists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said. Investor rebalancing of portfolios ""likely played a major role over the past two weeks, hurting bonds and supporting equities,"" they wrote.
Plenty of investors are suspicious of the rebound. Neuberger Berman said on Monday it was looking to ""fade"" equity rallies.
""High inflation, rising rates and slowing growth is a potentially poisonous mix for equity investors,"" Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer, multi-asset class, at Neuberger said in a written commentary. 

Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said he was holding slightly higher than normal cash levels in client portfolios.
""I am wary that this is a bear market rally that could turn around and that we could re-test the lows,"" Pavlik said.

Investing.com – Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock traded 4% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company gave a robust forecast for the ongoing quarter, suggesting demand from data centers remains strong.
Sales could touch $8.9 billion in the third quarter, the company said. At their worst, they will be $8.5 billion, but still higher than a year ago. Adjusted profit per share could touch $2.47 and will be at least $2.45.
Quarterly gross margin is also seen between 47% and 49% on an adjusted basis.
Micron is looking at a record year in fiscal 2022,” he said in an interview. “Our end market demand is strong, our customers’ demand is strong and supply is constrained,” Bloomberg quoted CEO Sanjay Mehrotra as saying.
Memory chips are now used in a wide range of consumer devices like TVs and washing machines, going beyond their traditional market of computers and smartphones. That’s helped Micron continue to grow even as the PC market slows.
A large part of Micron’s recent growth has come from supplying chips to data centers. That infrastructure has boomed as companies invest heavily in digital ecosystems to cater to customers faster and better.
Data center revenue grew more than 60% in the second quarter. Automation of factories and security systems was behind around 60% growth in industrial sales. Auto revenue set a new record.
While ruling out any impact on production volumes due to the Russia-Ukraine war but given that the region is a supplier of gases and some minerals that go into chips, costs could rise, Mehrotra said.
In the quarter through March 3, Micron’s revenue grew 25% to $7.79 billion. Net income was $2.26 billion, or $2 a share, more than triple what it was a year ago."

The company's board also approved a new stock buyback program of up to $1 billion.
Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach reiterated a Buy rating as better than feared results showed LULU has the best-in-class brand momentum.
We come away from F4Q with improved conviction in LULU's several drivers of durable growth that enable the company to gain market share despite tough compares.

The U.S. group, which manages more than $10 trillion in assets, recently led a consortium purchase of a $15.5 billion stake in  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s gas pipelines company, having taken a stake in Abu Dhabi energy company ADNOC's pipeline assets a couple of years earlier. 
""We're looking at many of those types of opportunities,"" Stephen Cohen, head of BlackRock's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told Reuters. 
""We're looking at a number of things on the private market side across the country,"" he said, citing unlisted growth companies in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.
Cohen said BlackRock is also looking across the region for infrastructure investments and what he called ""transition finance"" to fund long-term sustainable energy projects that help to reduce carbon emissions.
Gulf oil producers are considering sales of stakes in energy assets and raising cash through long-term leases, capitalising on a rebound in crude oil prices to attract foreign investors
RUSSIA IMPACT
When asked about the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said Europe's move to diversify its energy sources ""naturally plays"" to the strength of the Gulf region.
Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the exposure to Russia in its clients' portfolios was less than 0.2% of BlackRock's assets under management, Cohen said.
A BlackRock spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that the exposure to Russia of its clients is less than 0.01% following a markdown in the value of those assets.
""Following the invasion, BlackRock moved quickly to suspend the purchase of any Russian securities. BlackRock is monitoring the direct and indirect impacts of the crisis and working with our clients to support them as they take appropriate investment action,"" Cohen said.

He said the company is also looking at expanding its team in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It currently has 44 employees in the UAE and 15 in Saudi Arabia, BlackRock says.

By Julia Payne and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trader Vitol Group made a record net profit of just over $4 billion last year, sources familiar with the matter said, as oil, natural gas and other commodity prices soared.
Vitol, the world's biggest independent oil trader, declined to comment. 
The unaudited result beats its previous record net profit in 2020, when oil markets were upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bloomberg reported Vitol made $3.2 billion in 2020. The company does not disclose its net profit. 
Last week, Vitol said revenues leapt to $279 billion in 2021 as oil prices recovered from 2020 lows. Its revenues were $140 billion in 2020. 
The company said it traded 7.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products in 2021, up from 7.1 million bpd in 2020. Traded oil volumes were still lower than its 2019 record of 8 million bpd after taking a hit during the very low demand period of the pandemic. Jet fuel in particular was still down 22%.
For traders, 2021 was initially a tougher year to make money than 2020, when the market structure was in a dramatic contango - with front-month oil futures prices lower than the following months - which makes storing oil profitable. 
For most of last year, the market was in backwardation - the opposite situation - but the oil price became more volatile and rose by over 50% compared with the start of the year. 
The sharp rally in gas prices in the second half of 2021 boosted traders' bottom lines. Natural gas and electricity prices around the world soared on tight gas supplies and higher demand as economies rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Benchmark European gas prices TTF and Asian LNG prices spiked to unprecedented levels in the fourth quarter, though TTF has since hit new records following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

China Securities Regulatory Commission said it holds ""zero tolerance"" towards illegal behaviour in the stock market and has punished some brokers who analysed, forecast, or offered investment advices by applying aspects of feng shui such as the heavenly stems and earthly branches, also known as tiangan dizhi, Yin-Yang, and Five Elements, according to the official China Securities Journal.
The newspaper did not offer more details or name any of the brokerages that were fined by the regulator.
Some Chinese brokerages, including Guosheng Securities and Essence Securities, have received warning letters from the regulator over the past year after they released reports by applying feng shui to form their investment strategies, according to statements on the regulator's website, as some of these notes prompted wide market discussion.

The latest crackdown also came at a time that Chinese stock markets are experiencing higher volatilities, with the blue-chip CSI 300 Index losing about 14% so far this year.
Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA publishes a tongue-in-cheek Feng Shui Index ahead of the Lunar New Year that uses the Chinese zodiac to predict stock performance and remains popular among investors.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's antitrust agency on Wednesday raided offices of tyre companies including Germany's Continental AG (OTC:CTTAY) and India's Apollo Tyres and CEAT in a case of suspected competition law violations, four sources told Reuters.
Shares of Apollo, one of India's biggest tyre makers, fell as much as 3% after Reuters first reported the raids, while CEAT dropped 2.2% in the Mumbai market, which was trading higher. 
Shares in Continental, which is a relatively small player in India, fell about 3.5% in morning trade in Frankfurt. 
Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls and messages to CEAT spokespeople went unanswered.
In a statement after the Reuters report was published, Continental confirmed that officers of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had visited its office near New Delhi. 
“Continental is fully cooperating with the authorities,” it said.
The raids were being conducted by CCI officers across multiple cities, the sources said.
The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency does not publicly disclose its raids.
One of the sources said the case was related to an antitrust investigation into the use of unfair trade practices and rigging of bids while supplying tyres for public transport vehicles in the northern state of Haryana.

Reuters reported in 2020 the CCI was conducting a broad investigation covering many tyre companies after it received a complaint from the Haryana state government. The CCI said at the time: ""there appears to be some arrangement or understanding amongst the tyre manufacturers"". (https://reut.rs/3JQHvJe) 
A finding of bid-rigging could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the prices were fixed by the companies, or 10% of annual revenue, whichever is more.

The RJC, which sets ethical standards for the jewellery and watch industry and whose members include Richemont's Cartier and  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF), has failed to suspend Russian companies or urge its members to halt business in the country following its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Pandora said.
""The war requires all businesses to act with the utmost responsibility regarding any interactions or business dealings with Russia and Belarus,"" Chief Executive Alexander Lacik said in a statement. 
""Pandora cannot in good faith be a member of an association that does not share our values,"" he added.
RJC was not immediately available for comment.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown roiled auto production on Tuesday as two major suppliers joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in shutting plants to comply with measures to control the spread of the coronavirus.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s joint venture in Shanghai maintained production by asking workers to sleep on factory floors and getting passes for trucks to continue deliveries, two people familiar with the matter said.
A key auto supplier, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) PLC, told workers at one of its Shanghai facilities that supplies Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture to head home on Tuesday because of the need to enforce COVID controls, people briefed on the measure said.
Thyssenkrupp said it had closed a facility in Shanghai where it assembles production lines for automotive components, including powertrains and batteries, until April 6 to comply with local coronavirus regulations.
The Aptiv and Thyssenkrupp closures came on the second day of a lockdown in Shanghai, home to 26 million people and a major hub for manufacturing of vehicles and other goods. The city has instituted tough controls on movements of people to try to control the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant.
The lockdown, one of the biggest tests for China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, has forced automakers and suppliers to either try to adapt with extreme measures to keep factories running or to shut down and risk delayed shipments at a time when demand for vehicles is strong.
German auto supplier Bosch on Tuesday said its two plants in Shanghai are working with reduced personnel. ""We are doing everything we can to maintain the supply chains as much as possible and to serve the demands of our customers,"" the company said in a statement. 
For global automakers and suppliers, the latest coronavirus-related disruptions in China, the world's largest market, are piling on top of problems created by the war in Ukraine.
The measures GM took to keep its Shanghai plant open equate to a ""closed-loop"" management process, which China's financial hub has asked companies to adopt to stay open during a two-stage lockdown to battle its outbreak.
In the bubble-like arrangement, workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of the world to prevent virus transmission. A similar system was used at the Winter Olympics in Beijing to seal event personnel off from the public.
The facilities, which GM runs as part of a joint venture with Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC Motor Corp, produce Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles. The facilities are in areas east of Shanghai's Huangpu River that have been locked down from Monday to Friday.
CONTINGENCY PLANS 
GM, which said on Monday that its Shanghai joint venture was producing normally, declined to comment on the arrangements at its factory. A spokesperson said the company and its joint ventures had developed and were executing contingency plans with their suppliers to mitigate uncertainty related to COVID-19. SAIC did not have immediate comment.
SAIC-GM's ability to keep its Shanghai production lines running contrasts with that of Tesla Inc, which Reuters reported has suspended production for the four-day period. It was unable to secure sufficient provisions for its workers to achieve closed-loop management, one source said.
The workers at the affected Aptiv site were told to stay home on Wednesday and await further notice, the four sources told Reuters. Two of the sources said the affected compound produces for Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture with SAIC.
Aptiv's Shanghai facilities are in the west of the city and had not been affected by the city's lockdown, which started in eastern districts. The sources said the workers at the affected facility had been told that it had to shut due to COVID-19 issues. 

Aptiv declined to comment on the production suspension. ""I can confirm that we are following all government orders and not impacting customers' production,"" an Aptiv spokesperson said. Tesla, GM and SAIC did not have immediate comment. 
TCL Corp and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Foxconn and Shenzhen Deren Electronic Co Ltd managed to keep production going in southern China this month with closed-loop management after manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen and Dongguan were hit by similar lockdown measures.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s hefty gains amid skepticism over the likely success of the latest Ukraine-Russia peace talks. 
By 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 outperformed, climbing 0.2%.
Investor sentiment was boosted Tuesday after Russia stated it will sharply reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv following face-to-face peace talks between the two sides in Istanbul, with chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky saying the country would take steps to “de-escalate” the conflict.
This prompted European equities to close sharply higher, with the DAX gaining 2.8% and the CAC 40 rising 3.1%.
However, the tone has become more circumspect Wednesday, with the Pentagon warning that Kyiv remains under threat and U.S. President Joe Biden saying he’ll wait and see whether Russia delivers on its pledge. 
""The good news from the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul is not that Putin is suddenly acting in good faith,” said former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Twitter, “but that heroic Ukrainian resistance is making him look for off-ramps and diplomatic disguise.""
Meanwhile, Germany, Europe's largest economy, is bracing for a cut-off of Russian gas supplies, activating the first phase of a national emergency plan. The move comes two days ahead of a deadline set by Russia for 'unfriendly' states to start paying for deliveries of Russian energy in rubles, rather than in euros or dollars.
Spanish inflation data gave a vivid illustration of the impact of the war on the Eurozone economy, jumping 9.8% from a year ago in March, surging at the fastest rate in almost four decades.
Italy and Germany will release their inflation numbers later in the session, feeding through to Friday’s Eurozone release, which is expected to show a fresh high considerably above the European Central Bank’s 2% target.
In corporate news, UBS (SIX:UBSG) stock fell 0.5% after the Swiss lender announced the results of its 2021 share buyback, spending 3.81 billion Swiss francs ($4.11 billion) repurchasing its shares equivalent to 6.49% of its share capital.
Oil prices rose Wednesday, rebounding after a two-day retreat following a fresh reminder of the tight nature of the market as data showed U.S. crude stocks fell sharply last week.
Data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, showed U.S. crude inventories fell by 3 million barrels in the week ended March 25. The official data from the Energy Information Administration is due later in the session.
The oil market had dropped about 2% in the previous session following the progress in the Ukraine/Russia peace talks, and more than 7% on Monday on demand worries over fresh COVID-19 lockdowns in China, the world’s largest crude importer.

Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said its group, including Daihatsu and Hino Motors Ltd, produced 884,528 vehicles globally for the month, an increase of almost of 11% from the same month a year ago. 
It also produced a record number of vehicles for February in markets outside Japan despite a parts shortage triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak.
Toyota alone exceeded its February global production target plan released a month earlier by almost 41,000 vehicles. But the production level was below the year-ago period due to a COVID-19-induced parts supply shortage in North America and tight parts supply in Europe because of rising demand.
While it also faced tight semiconductor supplies in China, the automaker said it had used chips that were rendered surplus from a factory shutdown in January due to COVID-19 to mitigate this. 
Likewise, Honda Motor said its February global production rose by 8.1% with 344,712 vehicles. Although the semiconductor shortage and COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and lowered production level compared to February last year in North America, the problem was not severe in Asia, where production level increased compared to the same time last year.

In contrast, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co said its global production for February was down 7.8% year-over-year at 275,437 units due to the shortage of semiconductors. 
Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp's February global production fell by 23.6% during the same period at 47,625. The company said it had adjusted and suspended operation due tight supply of parts using semiconductors.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A 1-2 punch from the bond markets,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
Whether or not you believe in the signalling power of the U.S. Treasury curve, inversion of the key 2-10 year segment remains a sit up and pay attention moment for world markets.
That's what happened, albeit briefly, on Tuesday when two-year bond yields rose above 10-year ones, inverting the curve for the first time since 2019 in what is widely regarded as an indicator of rising recession risks. That spread is just under four bps in London, flirting with inversion territory. 
And while Fed researchers believe the predictive power of the spread to signal a recession is ""probably spurious,"" suggesting other yield curve measures are better, the spread's track record as a recession indicator is punchy. 
Since the 1960s, an inverted Treasury curve has been followed by a recession within two years, including the 2020 downturn caused by COVID-19. That means the significance of the latest inversion won't be lost on markets -- or the Fed.
And in another wow moment for the bond markets, the two-year German bond yield popped briefly into positive territory for the first time in eight years. Only three weeks ago, that yield troughed at around minus 80 bps. 
With Germany warning that it could be heading for a gas supply emergency even as inflation surges, bond yields may be headed higher. 
Graphic: U.S. yield curve inverts - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgqbwzpb/morningbid.PNG 
Russia-Ukraine talks meanwhile will remain in focus, with positive headlines likely to be a trigger for a fresh risk-on move. 
Asia shares joined a global rally as hopes rose for a negotiated end to the Ukraine conflict. European stock futures are mixed and U.S. futures are a touch softer. 
Equity markets appear to be in a rally on anything kind of mood but uncertainty remains high and that resilience will likely be put to the test soon. 
German inflation data out later in the day is also one to watch.

The equity capital raise will be conducted via a deeply-discounted rights issue and redeemable shares raising NZ$1.8 billion, of which NZ$850 million will be used to repay outstanding debt owed to the New Zealand government, which owns 51.9% of the airline.
The remaining NZ$950 million will be used to strengthen the balance sheet and aid recovery from the COVID-19 ravages, the carrier said. It has also undertaken a fresh debt of NZ$400 million from the government to provide additional liquidity. 
""The timing is right to position our airline for recovery,"" Chairman Therese Walsh told reporters.
The carrier, which uses a June-end financial year, plans to return to 2019 profit levels by 2025 and to restart dividends by 2026, she said.
Chief Executive Greg Foran said capacity would reach 90% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025 but would be weighted more toward domestic flights than in the past.
The two-for-one rights issue will be offered to shareholders on record on April 5 at a 61.5% discount to the last traded price.
The shares closed at NZ$1.375 on Wednesday.
Air New Zealand had last month flagged its worst annual loss since 2001 due to a combination of an Auckland lockdown, expiring government relief schemes, rising fuel prices and an international border closure.
As international borders reopen, the carrier has seen some improvement in sales, prompting the company to forecast an annual underlying loss before tax and significant items to be less than NZ$800 million, lower than its earlier view.
It logged an underlying loss before tax and one-off charges of NZ$440 million in the last financial year http://nzx-prod-s7fsd7f98s.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/AIR/377956/353175.pdf.

HANOI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Vietnam's automaker VinFast said on Tuesday it has signed a preliminary deal to initially invest $2 billion to build a factory in North Carolina to make electric buses, sport utility vehicles (SUVs) along with batteries for EVs.
The unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup, said it plans to have a total investment of $4 billion in its first U.S. factory complex. 
Construction should begin this year as soon as the company gets necessary permits, and is expected to finish by July 2024. The plant's initial capacity will be 150,000 units per year, Vinfast said. 
""With a manufacturing facility right in the U.S. market, VinFast can stabilize prices and shorten product delivery time, making our EVs more accessible to customers,"" said Nguyen Thi Thu Thuy, Vingroup vice chair and VinFast Global CEO. 
VinFast has begun taking pre-orders globally for two electric SUVs with a goal to begin delivering them in the fourth quarter.
U.S. President Joe Biden said the VinFast investment, which will create more than 7,000 jobs, is ""the latest example of my economic strategy at work."" 
""It builds on recent announcements from companies like GM, Ford, and Siemens to invest in America again and create jobs, said Biden, who set an ambitious goal for half of new car sales to be electric by 2030. 
This will be North Carolina’s first car plant and it is the largest economic development announcement in the state’s history, the governor's office said in a statement. 
VinFast said prices for its VF8 sport SUV started from $41,000 in the United States. By comparison, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) SUV sells for around $63,000. VinFast is targeting global electric vehicle sales of 42,000 this year.
PRODUCTION IS HARD 
VinFast is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with affordable electric SUVs and a battery leasing model. 
Other electric vehicle startups like Rivian and Lucid have slashed their production targets this year due to supply chain disruptions caused by coronavirus, which hit their share prices. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last year, ""It's insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.""

VinFast, which became Vietnam's first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer in 2019, plans to transition to all-electric vehicle production from late 2022. 
Outside of North America, the company is looking for a plant in Germany, it said in January.

The oil market had dropped about 2% in the previous session following the progress in the Ukraine/Russia peace talks, and more than 7% on Monday on demand worries over fresh Covid-19 lockdowns in China, the world’s largest crude importer. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $105.52 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $109.08. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,924.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1110.

Over the past week, 15 companies seeking initial public offerings (IPOs) on Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market have suspended applications, almost all citing impacts from the epidemic, exchange filings showed. The city started lockdowns on Monday.
In Shenzhen, which conducted three rounds of mass testing in March, 67 IPO applicants targeting the start-up board ChiNext have suspended the listing process this month, citing the need to update disclosure to regulators, according to filings. 
In all, the suspensions potentially delay fundraising worth 60 billion yuan ($9.4 billion), official newspaper Securities Times estimated. That's equivalent to more than one-tenth of China's roughly $84 billion in domestic IPO fundraising in 2021.
The real impact on IPO fundraising is likely bigger, as listing hopefuls on China's main equity boards are not required to make timely disclosures on the vetting process. 
The share sales disruption piles pressure on an economy already suffering from developers' debt woes, anaemic consumption, and contagion from the Ukraine crisis.
DUE DILIGENCE 
To minimise the impact, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has vowed to maintain the steady operation of capital markets during the ""special"" virus control period.
The bourse said on Sunday it would continue to vet share sale plans by STAR Market candidates and strengthen online communications with issuers and underwriters.
Nevertheless, a growing number of IPO applicants are pressing the pause button, at a time when many companies are required to update their financial results. 
Nanjing CIGU Technology Corp, which plans to list on STAR, said on Tuesday it is applying to the Shanghai bourse to suspend vetting of its application.
""Due to the epidemic, the company and intermediary agencies cannot complete due diligence, or answer regulators' queries during the stipulated time period,"" the company said. 
Other STAR candidates which halted IPO plans over the past week include Guangzhou Xaircraft Technology Co, CICT Mobile Communication Technology Co and Yuanjie Semiconductor Technology Co.
In Shenzhen, companies including Guangdong Lvtong New Energy Electric Vehicle Technology Co, Plotech Technology (Kunshan) Co and Shenzhen Mould-Tip Injection Technology Co have halted IPO plans over the past month, according to exchange filings.

The Hang Seng Tech Index was up 0.3% as of the mid-day lunch break in Hong Kong, having earlier gained as much as 2.3%, following the report which said Beijing is preparing new regulations on the live-streaming industry including a daily cap on tipping -- a key revenue source for such firms. Key player Kuaishou Technology slid as much as 8.3%, reversing an earlier surge buoyed by the firm’s earnings beat. 
The latest regulatory development sours sentiment as investors were expecting China to loosen its grips following Vice Premier Liu He’s mid-March pledge to stabilize capital markets and end crackdowns on private enterprise. The Hang Seng Tech Index has jumped more than 30% from its trough two weeks ago. 
“This will create pressure for live streaming firms as they share a proportion from digital tips,” said Willer Chen, analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd. “If true, this will be a big regulation on live-streaming hosts. A great number of leading hosts earn way higher than the proposed 10,000 yuan daily cap.” 
Sentiment has also been fragile following a number of earnings miss by technology companies, including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. The 30-day volatility for the Hang Seng tech gauge is at a record high as traders look for more clues on the sector’s earnings and regulatory outlook.

The firm is selling the land-use and building ownership rights for the project, which is under construction, to Zhejiang Zhejian Real Estate Group and Zhejiang Construction Engineering Group, Evergrande said in a filing. 
It will use the proceeds to repay construction fees of 920.7 million yuan owed to Zhejiang Construction Engineering and the rest for its own general working capital. The deal is expected to post a gain of about 216 million yuan. 
Saddled with over $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande has been struggling to repay suppliers, creditors and complete projects. State-owned enterprises have stepped in to help with the debt restructuring process and taken over some of its assets to quell market concerns about a disorderly collapse. 
In a separate filing late on Tuesday, Evergrande said it had set up an independent committee to investigate how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan in deposits of its property services arm, Evergrande Property Services Group, that had been pledged as security for third party guarantees.
Preliminary investigation has found the pledge of the relevant deposits and the enforcement by banks took place in 2021, Evergrande said.
Shares of its unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group resumed trading on Wednesday and plunged up to 14.5%. 
They have been suspended since last Monday pending news of the enforcement. But trading will be halted again on Friday per listing rules as the firm will not be able to publish its 2021 financial results by March 31. 

Shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services have both been suspended since last Monday.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 11:11PM ET</span>",Analysis-Sony launches Game Pass counterattack with subscription service upgrade,"By Sam Nussey and Dawn Chmielewski
TOKYO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Sony Group Corp's revamp of its PlayStation subscription service is a major step toward levelling the playing field with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rival Game Pass, although holding back new releases may dampen enthusiasm, analysts say. 
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY) said its expanded PlayStation Plus service will offer hundreds of games, including recent hits such as ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"", for a flat monthly fee when it launches in the United States, Europe and Japan in June. 
The service will not include new releases, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan told Reuters, but users can still find big-budget titles such as ""Returnal"" and ""God of War"". 
""There will be more from PlayStation Studios, and all of the major publishers will be represented,"" Ryan said.
Sony is widely seen as leading in the console war, selling 17 million PlayStation 5 (PS5) units even as chip shortages hit production, but has been under pressure to respond to the growth of Netflix-style game subscription services. 
The revamped Sony service combines the current PlayStation Plus, which has 48 million subscribers and offers online gaming and only a few free games each month, with PlayStation Now, which has 3.2 million users and a library of games to download and stream.
There are three tiers, priced at $9.99 to $17.99 monthly or $59.99 to $119.99 annually. The lowest-price tier, PlayStation Plus Essential, looks like Sony's current offering.
PlayStation Plus Extra adds a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games. PlayStation Plus Premium offers a further library of older titles, cloud streaming in major markets and time-limited game trials. 
Such streamlining is ""overdue"", said Lewis Ward, head of gaming research at IDC. 
""The number of PlayStation subscribers in the higher two tiers... will tick up over time, which is undoubtedly a core reason for this change,"" Ward said.
Given the high cost of developing new games, analysts had raised concerns that pressure to bundle more content with subscriptions may eat into profit at Sony's coveted games unit.
Sony will seek to preserve new game sales alongside the subscription service. 
""I think this move should improve margins, as more gamers will be driven to higher-cost subscriptions,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis. 
""If content acquisition costs do increase, Sony will need to balance that with the additional revenue it will be generating from the PS Plus subscriber base,"" he added.
HIGH STAKES GAME
Microsoft is aggressively growing Game Pass, which has 25 million subscribers, by adding new titles on their launch day while buying studios to expand its offerings. 
In January, the Redmond, Washington-based firm struck a $68.7 billion deal for ""Call of Duty"" publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
Sony, which has built its own in-house studio network, responded by buying ""Destiny"" publisher Bungie for $3.6 billion, with many analysts expecting further dealmaking.
Microsoft has gained an early lead in subscriptions, accounting for 60% of the games subscriptions in North America and Europe, compared with 7% for Sony, according to Ampere Analysis. Subscriptions make up only 4% of total gaming spending.
""PlayStation believes it is smarter for them and for third-party publishers to put older games into the subscription plan so that new games can maximize their revenue potential during their launch windows,"" said IDC's Ward.
That hesitance means Sony's offering ""won't have the pull of Microsoft's service,"" added Ampere's Harding-Rolls.
Sony's newly announced pricing is seen as competitive. The premium tier's $120 annual fee compares with $180 for Game Pass Ultimate. Both offer cloud gaming, with Sony users able to stream titles to their consoles and PC. 
Cloud gaming is seen as the future for the industry, because it doesn't require downloading or installing games on a console or PC. That is a potential threat to the console business, whose operators that have acted as industry gatekeepers. 
An annual subscription to the mid-tier PlayStation Plus Extra, which lacks this cloud-gaming feature, works out at just over $8 monthly, compared with $9.99 for the Game Pass. 
""Value and pricing of that nature would simply not be possible if we were to put our new games into the service upon their release,"" said Sony's Ryan.

Microsoft has said that Game Pass subscribers play more games and spend more on games, too - a view echoed by Sony. 
""Everything comes down to engagement,"" Ryan said. ""If you get people engaged on your platform, monetization typically follows.""

(Reuters) -United Auto Workers (UAW) President Ray Curry said on Tuesday he has had no discussions with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or its Chief Executive Elon Musk about a potential union vote by workers at the electric-car maker's California factory.
On March 3, Musk tweeted that he was inviting the ""UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them."" 
During an online press event, Curry said Tesla could drop an appeal of a U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling that it violated U.S. labor law and ""reinstate some workers who were actually terminated.""
""That would be a good faith effort if they were interested in having that type of exchange,"" Curry added.
""We definitely would welcome that opportunity,"" Curry said. ""It's not the whim of a tweet or anything else... it's about the workers in those locations having a voice inside of their workplace.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Curry also said he is engaged in ongoing discussions with Detroit's Big Three automakers about joint venture battery plants and the potential for the union to represent workers.
""Those have not generated final decisions,"" Curry said, noting that they have not started production. ""Our No. 1 goal for the joint ventures is to make sure that those locations that are supplying components to (UAW represented auto plants) are represented"" by the UAW.
Curry wants General Motors (NYSE:GM) Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis to ensure a ""level playing field"" for organizing efforts. ""Card checks, neutrality and other things are clearly on the table for those discussions,"" Curry said.
The union chief said the UAW also wants to organize autoworkers at start-ups, saying the goal is to ""be able to represent any auto work assembly that would take place in the country, especially EV pieces."" 
Last year, the NLRB ordered Tesla to direct Musk to delete a 2018 tweet saying employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union. 
Musk has repeatedly heaped criticism on the UAW. On Tuesday, he tweeted: ""UAW slogan – 'Fighting for the right to embezzle money from auto workers!'""
Musk was referring to the guilty plea of a UAW local official to embezzling $2.2 million in union funds.

Curry said the union had adopted significant reforms and that it was its auditors who had found the wrongdoing and referred the issue to federal prosecutors that led to the guilty plea. 
Curry, who became president last summer after his predecessor retired a year before his term ended, said he plans to run for a new term as president later this year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with investors digesting the probability of a de-escalation in the war in Ukraine and oil pared declines.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.27% by 10:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI 50 was up 0.27% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.8%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.85%. China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.63% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.41%.
Oil clawed back some of its losses in early Asian trading, with investors remaining cautious about the war coming to an end. Russia said it will sharply reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said the country would take steps to “de-escalate” the conflict.
However, Tuesday’s talks between Ukraine and Russia failed to reach an agreement on a cease-fire, with the Pentagon warning that Kyiv remains under threat. With no end in sight to the war in Ukraine triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, analysts are casting doubt on Russian intentions.
Hopes that Ukraine and Russia could make progress in peace talks had seen oil prices and inflation expectations come down, giving bonds a respite from their recent drubbing. Long-end yields slid, which led to a brief inversion in the two- to 10-year curve. 
The U.S. Treasury yield curve’s inversion sparked a debate over the risks of a growth downturn as central banks begin to tighten their monetary policies. They include the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to continue hiking interest rates throughout 2022.
“We knew that we were late-cycle and typically the yield curve inverts, and it takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months to actually move into a recession,” Pacific Investment Management Co. portfolio manager Erin Browne told Bloomberg.
“There are reasons to believe this time around that yield curve inversion may not be as good an indicator as it has been in the past, particularly given the enormous amount of quantitative easing undertaken by global central banks,” she added.
Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker said he expects a series of “deliberate, methodical” rate increases in 2022, but said he is open to a half-point move in May if near-term data shows more inflation. Harker’s colleagues, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, and New York Fed President John Williams will speak on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
In the latest U.S. data, the Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence Index was at 107.2 in March 2022, while JOLTs job openings totaled 11.266 million. Further data, including the GDP and the latest jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, will be released later in the day and on Friday respectively.
In Asia Pacific, China will release its manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) on Thursday, followed by the Caixin manufacturing PMI on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P notching their fourth straight session of gains, on optimism some progress was being made toward a deal to resolve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. 
Russia pledged to cut down on military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine, while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status, the first sign of progress toward peace in weeks.
Prices eased for oil and other commodities, helping calm concerns about rising inflation and the path of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has started hiking interest rates to combat rising prices. 
""If you look over the course of the month this war has been going on, the market has priced in much more bad news than good news,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
""It certainly shows the market has a natural coiled spring that will be a reaction function to any good news and we saw a bit of that this morning, but everything will have to be taken with a grain of salt and we will have to see things actually play out versus being actually talked about.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 338.3 points, or 0.97%, to 35,294.19, the S&P 500 gained 56.08 points, or 1.23%, to 4,631.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 264.73 points, or 1.84%, to 14,619.64.
After a dismal start to the year for stocks that saw the S&P 500 fall into a correction, commonly referred to as a drop of more than 10% from its most recent high, the benchmark index is now down less than 3% on the year. 
Still, there were signs of market nervousness that the Fed could make a policy mistake that leads to a slowdown, or possibly a recession, in the economy as the widely tracked U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury inverted for the first time since September 2019.
""While I think the ultimate result of an aggressive Fed tightening cycle is a recession, I do not expect it to occur quickly. Historically speaking, all recessions are preceded by 2s10s inversions, but not all inversions result in recessions,"" said Ellis Phifer, managing director, fixed income research, at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.
After slumping more than 2% on Monday, the S&P energy index was the only declining sector as crude prices fell more than 1%.
As the conflict in Ukraine has escalated in recent weeks, already rising prices saw more upward pressure on commodities such as wheat, energy and metals.
But even with the recent surge in inflation, data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March, while the current labor environment favors workers.
Real estate, up nearly 3% on the session, was the best performing sector, which indicates some investors may see inflation remaining but no recession on the horizon. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the group since Jan. 28. 
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) gained 3.70% after the global delivery conglomerate named operating chief Raj Subramaniam as its top boss.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.22 billion shares, compared with the 14 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.97-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 51 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 38 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets tore higher across the world on Tuesday and oil prices shed $2 a barrel, as investors celebrated signs of progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine that they hoped would lead to a settlement in a five-week conflict.
Even though the U.S. government warned that Russia's latest move was a sign it is redeploying, not withdrawing, troops, investors nonetheless piled into risky assets, ignoring surging inflation and imminent rate hikes that could mar the growth outlook and upend stock market buoyancy.
In a sign that the exuberant stock market may run into headwinds, a closely-watched section of the U.S. yield curve briefly inverted for the first time since September 2019, signalling a possible recession ahead.
Indeed, some analysts warned that the latest bout of optimism may be misplaced.
""Over the last two weeks, the S&P has produced one of its sharpest rallies in history, larger than the biggest 10-day rallies in seven of the S&P's 11 bear markets since 1927,"" said analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Equity Derivatives Research.
""It has done so despite clearly weaker fundamentals (more hikes, higher inflation, and curve inversion) and the Fed leaning against equity market strength to hike faster,"" they wrote, adding that they think sustained gains in U.S. stocks are unlikely.
U.S. stock indices jumped over 1%, Europe's main bourses enjoyed 1% to 2.5% gains, and oil tumbled close to $5 at one point as Russia's deputy defence minister emerged saying Moscow has decided to drastically cut military activity around Ukraine's capital Kyiv and also Chernihiv.
With Tuesday's rally, Wall Street - aided by data that showed a rebound in U.S. consumer confidence in March - notched its fourth straight day of gains. Asia was lifted overnight too after the Bank of Japan defended its vast stimulus programme, although the yen's worst month since 2016 was still raising eyebrows.
Dealers also shrugged off bigger-than-expected drops in French and German consumer confidence data and signs that Russia will push ahead with plans to start billing for its gas in roubles, and is prepared to risk a historic sovereign debt default.
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield - the main gauge of European borrowing costs - hit its highest since early 2018 and 2-year yields turned positive for the first time since 2014, adding to the seismic shifts in global rates markets this year as inflation has surged.
U.S. Treasury yields paused their ascent on Tuesday, but have risen an eyewatering 165 basis points this quarter. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S Treasuries retreated to 2.391% while the equivalent 2-year yields were at 2.367%. More than 200 basis points of U.S. interest rate rises are also now priced in for 2022 which, if realised, would be the most in a calendar year since 1994.
The difference between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields, which is tracked as a harbinger of recession, briefly fell as low as minus 0.03 of a basis point on Tuesday, as traders bet that aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve could hurt the economy over the long term. 
This so-called curve inversion is considered a reliable predictor of recession, although some analysts say the curve has been distorted by quantitative easing and investors should not read too much into it. The Fed has also urged investors to watch other curve segments which are still steep, giving it room to tighten policy further and faster.
""We have seen something that is a little unprecedented because the Fed is suddenly facing a question about its credibility and whether it can effectively reduce inflation,"" said Amundi's head of multi-asset strategies, Francesco Sandrini.
He added that Amundi had revised its European growth forecast downward to 1.5% for the year from 2% previously, but it could be lower if the situation continues to deteriorate.
""We question a lot our forecasts,"" Sandrini said, especially as Europe's big companies are more heavily exposed to commodity price pressures than U.S. counterparts. ""It is extremely complicated, we need to proceed cautiously.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.97%, the S&P 500 leapt 1.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.54%.
All the three of the main S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes are on course to end March higher. However, they are also set to record their worst start to a year and indeed any quarter since the start of 2020 when the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on financial markets.
In the currency market, the yen continued to languish at 122.88 per dollar even after staging a small recovery from its bruising the day before, when the Bank of Japan vowed to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year government bonds to prevent its bond yields from rising too much further.
The central bank was finding it tough going, however. The 10-year JGB yield stood at 0.245%, right up against the BOJ's implicit 0.25% cap. 
Among commodities, oil prices clawed back some of the day's losses, which were incurred after Russia's top negotiator in the talks with Ukraine described the discussions as ""constructive"". Brent crude settled down $2.25, or 2%, at $110.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell $1.72, or 1.6%, to $104.24.
Prices had weakened earlier too as China's financial hub Shanghai tightened its latest COVID-19 lockdown, after it reported a record 4,381 asymptomatic cases and 96 symptomatic cases for March 28 - though the caseload remains modest by global standards.

A month after taking on McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) over the treatment of pigs, Icahn is expanding the battle beyond animal welfare to include focusing on what he calls ""egregious wage gaps"" between Kroger's chief executive officer and cashiers, stock clerks and others.
The activist investor wrote a letter to Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen on Tuesday, pointing out the supermarket chain's inability to create policies concerning animal welfare and criticizing its wage disparities.
In response to Icahn's letter, Kroger said that it prioritizes ESG matters and the board, along with its committees, directly oversee its animal welfare strategies. 
Kroger added that while it was not directly involved in raising or processing of any animals, the company has established a framework to clearly define its policies, requirement and practices, including its Animal Welfare Policy that hopes all suppliers transition away from gestation crates by 2025.
Icahn nominated Alexis Fox and Margarita Paláu-Hernández to stand for election to Kroger's board, during the company's 2022 annual meeting.
Fox is the co-founder of Lighter, a startup that focuses on plant-based diet, while Paláu-Hernández is the founder and chief executive at Hernandez Ventures, a private firm involved in Spanish-language media, business and real estate ventures.

The grocer said it will review the proposed nominees and present its formal recommendations.
Icahn previously made a similar push at McDonald's in February, nominating two members to its board in an escalating fight over the treatment of pigs by the burger chain's suppliers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The outgoing head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday the agency's ""zero tolerance policy"" for addressing unruly passengers should remain in place indefinitely.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told reporters the policy first imposed in January 2021 should remain even if the Biden administration decides to lift a mandate requiring masks onboard airplanes.
The Biden administration has extended the transit mask mandate through April 18 and is considering whether it should end or again be continued. The FAA in March 2021 extended the zero tolerance policy and said it would enforce it at least as long as the face mask order remained in effect.
""Regardless of what happens with the mask mandate, I think this is something that we need to keep in place,"" Dickson said Tuesday.
The FAA said since January 2021, there have been a record 6,900 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules - but have declined.
""Once the federal mandate is lifted, I think we can safely assume that those rates will decline further,"" Dickson said.
The FAA last month said it has referred 80 unruly airplane passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Dickson spoke to Reuters and another media outlet Tuesday just days before he steps down about halfway through his five-year term as FAA chief, discussing a wide range of challenges he has faced in the job.
He praised Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s efforts to improve its relationship with the FAA.
""We are demanding more transparency and completeness and rigor out of their processes,"" Dickson told reporters Tuesday. ""(Boeing) will call me if there is anything that they think I am going to be concerned about ... They are not asking for anything.""
Last week, the FAA warned the planemaker may not gain certification of a lengthened version of the 737 MAX ahead of a key safety deadline set by Congress, a source told Reuters.
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the 737 MAX 10 before the end of the year. Dickson declined to say if he thinks Boeing can win approval before January.
""Boeing knows what it needs to do and what it needs to provide to us,"" Dickson said.
Boeing said it shares ""an enduring commitment to safety and transparency with the FAA and respect their oversight role as we engage with their team going forward.""
Dickson declined to comment on last week's not guilty verdict of a former Boeing test pilot charged with deceiving the FAA during its certification review of the 737 MAX.

Asked if Boeing had been properly held to account for the two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, Dickson said: ""We hold Boeing accountable everyday as we do ourselves.""
Boeing entered into a $2.5 billion deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January 2021.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 07:40PM ET</span>",Facebook advertisers can pursue class action over ad rates,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that a lawsuit accusing Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of deceiving advertisers about its ""potential reach"" tool can proceed as a class action.
The decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco allows potentially millions of individuals and businesses that paid for ads on Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram since Aug. 15, 2014 to sue as a group.
Meta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
The lawsuit began in 2018, as DZ Reserve and other advertisers accused Facebook of inflating its advertising reach, by increasing the number of potential viewers by as much as 400%, and charging artificially high premiums for ad placements.
They also said senior Facebook executives knew for years that the company's ""potential reach"" metric was inflated by duplicate and fake accounts, yet did nothing about it and took steps to cover it up.
After calling out Meta's ""blunderbuss"" objections to class certification, Donato rejected its contention that the class was too diverse, including ""large sophisticated corporations"" as well as individuals and small businesses, and that it would be too hard to calculate damages.

Donato also said it made sense to let individual plaintiffs sue as a group, given that ""no reasonable person"" would sue Meta individually to recover at most a $32 price premium.
The judge is expected later this year to consider Meta's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

Air Canada, which already flies to seven tourist hot spots in Mexico, will now allow travelers to connect to 11 new cities in Mexico as well as Cuba's capital, Havana, through the regional carrier, the companies said. 
The partnership will push Canada's flag carrier over pre-pandemic levels for flights to Mexico this summer, with plans to offer more than 100 flights to the country by winter, the airlines announced. 
""This agreement will advance our strategy to strengthen our major Canadian hubs with connecting traffic,"" Air Canada executive Mark Galardo said in the statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday sought to cast doubt on the testimony of the wife of a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, who is on trial over allegations he helped loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. 
Roger Ng, Goldman's former chief for Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-corruption law. Prosecutors say he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from 1MDB development fund, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty. 
Hwee Bin Lim, Ng's wife, testified on Monday that she made a $6 million investment in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Judy Chan, Leissner's then-wife. Lim said she received around $35 million as a return on that investment in 2012 and 2013.
But prosecutors say that money represented kickbacks Leissner paid to Ng from the 1MDB scheme. Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith on Tuesday, Lim said she was no longer in possession of a two-page agreement she signed with Chan describing the deal and had no written updates on investment performance. 
Smith repeatedly asked Lim why, despite her training as a corporate lawyer, she did not press for documents or keep records.
""For investment in China there's no point for you to have documents,"" Lim said. ""Where do I go to enforce it?""
Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges as Ng in 2018, testified last month that the investment involving the two men's wives was a ""cover story"" to explain the kickback payments so the banks that would process the transfer would not grow suspicious.

The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history, in which U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB and meant for the economic development of Malaysia was instead diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Fintech Stori, whose credit cards target the overwhelming majority of Mexicans who lack any kind of formal credit, said on Tuesday it plans to invest $175 million to grow in 2022 as it grows its customer portfolio and hires more people.
The startup issues its cards to ""underbanked"" Mexicans like 33-year-old Nadir Redon Texta, who makes a living reselling clothes and stainless steel accessories in the town of Zihuatanejo and could not get a credit line in any bank.
""I earn from 4,000 to 8,000 pesos every month, since my business is informal and seasonal,"" he said in a phone interview. ""I started with a 1,500 Mexican pesos ($75.18) monthly credit with Stori and I've always been able to pay it.""
Only 31% of Mexicans have some type of credit, and those who do, tend to use department store or convenience store cards, according to the country's statistics agency.
Stori extends a line of credit to 99% of applicants after a background check that studies a combination of factors like where they live and how they make a living, said Marlene Garayzar, the co-founder of the company launched in 2018.
""Some applicants don't have the official documents that we require. Otherwise, our percentage of acceptance could reach 100%. We give credits as small as 500 pesos, and, in our experience, people do pay,"" she said.
Garayzar said Stori, which is backed by such investors as U.S. GGV Capital and Goodwater Capital, expects to expand into at least one other Latin American country in the next two years but declined to say which markets it is considering. 
Mexicans with informal jobs or bad credit history tend to knock on many doors before they can get approved for a loan. That was the case of Eduardo Alvarado, 28, whose request for a card was rejected by Brazilian fintech Nubank.
""Nu asked me to try again later, so I went to Stori and they accepted me. Months later, I tried again with Nu, and they approved it. I guess it was quite influential to have Stori as a starting credit."" he said.

Stori has one million clients and most of them are first-time credit card holders, while Nubank has around 1.4 million customers in Mexico and 60% of them had some other card before contracting its services.

(Reuters) -Lululemon Athletica on Tuesday forecast full-year profit and revenue above estimates as demand for athletic wear remains consistent even as people return to offices, and said it plans selective price increases on some of its products.
Shares of the yogawear maker rose about 8% in extended trading as the company also posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings despite reduced store hours due to an increase in Omicron infections.
Since the pandemic started, many consumers have shifted their preference to comfortable and casual clothing helping brands such as Lululemon whose athleisure and sportswear have now become a major part of everyday fashion. 
""We are taking modest selective price increases over the course of the year... It's a very small portion of our styles that are impacted... this will help offset some of the pressure we're seeing on average unit cost,"" Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald said in an earnings call.
Morningstar Research analyst David Swartz said as Lululemon has premium pricing all the time, ""having high cost, high price products is nothing new for Lululemon... they can push through that price increase without any problem."" 
Lululemon forecast full-year 2022 revenue between $7.49 billion and $7.62 billion, while analysts are expecting $7.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
It also forecast full-year profit between $9.15 and $9.35 per share, compared to estimates of $9.06 per share.

""Raising prices helps the company especially as they are still being impacted by lingering supply chain issues. And given the fact that they don't need to be as promotional, they probably have some room to raise prices,"" said Matthew Jacob, senior analyst at M Science.
Excluding items, Lululemon earned $3.37 per share in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, beating estimates of $3.28 per share.

Ukraine's two leading neon suppliers, which produce about half the world's supply of the key chip-making ingredient, have halted their operations, threatening to drive up prices and worsen an ongoing semiconductor crunch.
Global chip output was already under pressure after the pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.
That same demand helped Micron forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates and deliver higher-than-expected results in the second quarter, sending shares up more than 4%.
""We currently do not expect any negative impacts to our near-term production volumes because of the Russia-Ukraine war, but we do expect an increase in our costs as we secure supply of certain raw materials that could be addressed,"" Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in a post-earnings conference call.
Recent efforts to diversify supply and maintain inventories of raw materials and noble gases helped contain the blow, he added.
The impact from Ukraine-driven supply shortfalls will not show up until about seven to nine months later, when global raw material inventories run out, said Kinngai Chan, managing director - semiconductors at Summit Insights Group LLC.
Micron forecast current-quarter revenue of $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $8.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Revenue rose 24.8% to $7.79 billion, beating estimates of $7.52 billion.

Micron also charged more for its NAND and DRAM memory chips, helping gross margins as a percentage of revenue rise to 47.2% from 26.4% last year.
Excluding items, net income was $2.14 per share, higher than estimates of $1.97.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 05:16PM ET</span>",U.S. authorizes second COVID booster for Americans 50 and older,"By Michael Erman and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Tuesday authorized a second COVID-19 booster dose of the two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines for people age 50 and older, citing data showing waning immunity and the risks posed by Omicron variants of the virus.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration agency said the new boosters - a fourth round of shots for most vaccine recipients - of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines are to be administered at least four months after the previous dose. They are intended to offer more protection against severe disease and hospitalization.
The FDA also authorized a second booster dose of the vaccines for younger people with compromised immune systems - those aged 12 and older for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and 18 and older for Moderna's.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) backed the FDA's authorization, recommending the additional shot, particularly for older people and those with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk.
The decision to offer second boosters in the United States comes as some scientists have raised concern about the highly contagious and newly predominant BA.2 Omicron subvariant, which has driven up COVID-19 cases in other countries. 
""If it were my relatives, I would be sending them out to do this,"" top FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said during a news conference of getting booster shots. ""COVID-19 has had a really disproportional adverse effect on people 65 years of age and older and those with comorbidities.""
COVID cases in the United States have dropped sharply since a record surge in January, but have seen a small uptick over the past week, according to CDC data.
BROADER BOOSTER CAMPAIGN MAY BE NEEDED
Marks said the FDA will soon weigh the benefits of authorizing another round of boosters - perhaps specifically targeted to combat new variants of concern - to a broader population after the summer.
""There may be a need for people to get an additional booster in the fall along with a more general booster campaign, if that takes place, because we may need to shift over to a different variant coverage,"" he said.
The FDA said it looked at data from a relatively small, ongoing clinical trial in Israel to help make its decision. In addition, safety data from more than 700,000 people who received second boosters in Israel revealed no new concerns, the agency said. 
Scientists and officials have debated for months if and when an additional booster shot would be needed as they parsed data on how long protection from the vaccines and boosters would last.
""It's not clear that now is the right time for people to get a fourth dose,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said. 
If there is a surge in cases in late fall or early winter, as is typical for respiratory viruses and influenza, an additional boost may then be needed, he said. The body's neutralizing antibodies spurred on by a fourth booster given now may decline in just a few months, he said. 
It is also unclear whether young, healthy people will need a fourth shot. The study of Israeli healthcare workers cited by the FDA suggested that the fourth dose added little additional protection in the age group.
Biden administration officials have said that the U.S. government currently has enough doses of the vaccines to meet the demand for another round of booster shots in older Americans, even as funding for the U.S. pandemic response has all but run out. 

They say that unless Congress approves more spending, the government will not be likely to be able to be pay for future inoculations, if they are needed, particularly if the vaccines need to be redesigned to target new variants. 
Around two-thirds of fully vaccinated Americans over the age of 65 and just over half of people between the age of 50 and 64 have gotten their first booster dose so far.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who spent years building his reputation as a vocal corporate agitator, now plans to work mainly behind the scenes with management and adopt what he calls a ""quieter approach"" to force change.
Fresh off three years of strong double digit returns, Ackman told investors on Tuesday that corporate America now knows who he is and that there is no need for the kind of noisy tactics other activist investors might employ.
""All of our interactions with companies over the last five years have been cordial, constructive and productive,"" Ackman wrote in the Pershing Square Holdings Annual Report.
""So if it is helpful to call this quieter approach Pershing Square 3.0, let it hereby be so anointed,"" he wrote.
Ackman on Tuesday put into writing what investors had long suspected; the once voluble investor who fought noisy proxy contests at  Target  (NYSE:TGT),  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway and Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) was shifting gears.
Pershing Square's recent investments - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Canadian Pacific, again, - underscore the new mood as Ackman immediately heaped praise on the men in charge. In earlier years, his pressure campaigns often led to CEO changes at companies like JC Penney (OTC:CPPRQ), Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).
Ackman also said he would never again delve into the noisiest for activism: ""activist short selling"" as he did at nutrition company  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF).
""We have permanently retired from this line of work,"" he wrote.
Ironically, just as Ackman is trying hard to stay out of the limelight, Carl Icahn, the prominent activist he sparred with publicly on cable television over Herbalife, appears to be moving the other way.
Supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co said on Tuesday that Icahn plans to nominate two people to its board. He is also fighting for board seats at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and is battling Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings.

Meanwhile, Ackman wrote Pershing Square 3.0 will make ""our jobs easier and more fun, and our quality of life better.""
While Pershing Square is nursing small losses for 2022, the firm is still faring far better than the broader stock market thanks to interest rate hedges that protected against a sharp market drop. The last three years were lucrative. In 2021, Pershing Square Holdings returned 26.9% after a 70.2% gain in 2020 and a 58.1% increase in 2019.

""It's quite difficult to do full self-driving in Europe,"" he told factory workers on Tuesday, saying much work needs to be done to handle tricky driving situations in Europe where roads vary a lot by country. 
Although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also attended the event, lauded the gigafactory as the future of the car industry, it has faced opposition and some environmental activists blocked the factory's entrance while displaying banners flagging its high water use.
Two protestors abseiled from a motorway sign near the factory, blocking traffic for hours after the event.
Musk had hoped to begin output from the factory eight months ago, but licensing delays and local concerns around the plant's environmental impact held up the process.
Tesla was forced to service European orders from Shanghai while it awaited its German licence, adding to rising logistics costs at a time when it was struggling with industry-wide chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
It got the final go-ahead from local authorities on March 4 to begin production in Germany, provided it met conditions ranging from its water use to air pollution controls.
The plant opening came on the same day as the top U.S. securities regulator urged a federal judge not to let Musk back out of an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored.
Tesla shares ended up 7.9% at their highest level in more than two months on Tuesday. 
RACE WITH VW 
The new owners received the Model Y Performance configuration, a vehicle costing 63,990 euros ($70,500) with a 514 km (320 miles) range, Tesla said, adding that new orders from the plant could be delivered from April.
Tesla said that around 3,500 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far.
At full capacity, the plant will produce 500,000 cars a year, more than the 450,000 battery-electric vehicles that German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) sold globally in 2021. 
It will also eventually generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, surpassing all other plants in Germany. Tesla is expected to initially import batteries from China for its German-made Model Ys before it starts local battery production.
Musk said on Tuesday that battery production will be a ""challenge"" next year and will be ""the limiting factor"" in the coming years, as Tesla aims to aggressively boost vehicle production. 
For now, Volkswagen still has the inside track in the race to electrify Europe's fleet, with a 25% market share to Tesla's 13%. Musk has said ramping up production would take longer than the two years it took to build the plant.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted Gruenheide would produce around 54,000 cars in 2022, increasing to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.
Volkswagen, which has received 95,000 EV orders in Europe this year, is planning a new 2 billion euro EV factory alongside its existing facility in Wolfsburg and six battery plants across Europe.

But its timeline lags Tesla's, with the EV factory due to open in 2026 and the first battery plant in 2023.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s positive tone helped by peace talks between Ukraine and Russia and ahead of the release of key economic data on jobs and spending.
At 4:08 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 338 points or 0.97%, the S&P 500 was up 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.8%.
The three main averages on Wall Street closed higher Monday, with the tech-based Nasdaq Composite leading the way, rising 1.3%, aided by strong gains from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which announced plans to split shares if shareholders approve.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams met in Istanbul Tuesday, with the diplomats appearing to be on the verge of a breakthrough while discussing a possible ceasefire. 
Mykhaylo Podolyak, an aide to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, earlier tweeted that the delegations ""are working in parallel on the entire spectrum of contentious issues.""
Away from eastern Europe, the week sees the release of a lot of important U.S. economic data, including the much-watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report due out Friday. 
Ahead of that, JOLTs job openings for February came in at 11.3 million, against expectations for 11 million. The data, along with other jobs data to be released this week, will be studied carefully given the Federal Reserve is seen to be mulling whether to move more aggressively on interest rates at its May meeting.
Expectations of sharp interest rate increases have resulted in the 5-year Treasury yield rising above the 30-year yield, the first such inversion since 2006, prompting fears of a recession.
However, stock investors shouldn’t worry just yet, said strategists at JPMorgan Chase. “Recessions don’t typically start ahead of the curve inverting, and the lead-lag could be very substantial, as long as 2 years,” they said, in a note. “Further, over this timeframe equities tended to beat bonds handsomely.”
In the corporate sector, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will be in the spotlight after the delivery giant announced its Chief Operating Officer, Raj Subramaniam, will take over as CEO and founder Fred Smith would become executive chairman as of June 1.
Tesla will remain in focus after the electric car manufacturer’s stock rose 8% on Monday, while  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and RH (NYSE:RH) are set to report earnings. 
Oil prices fell Tuesday, though they came off lows reached earlier in the session. There were earlier reports that  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the world’s largest oil exporter, will likely boost pricing of its main crude variety to a record, suggesting a bullish outlook.
Crude prices had slumped Monday on fears that a surge in Covid-19 cases in China, and the financial hub of Shanghai in particular, will hit demand from the world’s top crude importer.
The American Petroleum Institute reports its weekly inventory data at 4:30 PM ET as usual.
By 4:10 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded down 0.9% at $105.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $108.53. Both benchmark contracts lost around 7% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,918/oz.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 04:10PM ET</span>",TIM board examined private equity interest,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -The board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) on Tuesday was informed about a proposal from CVC for a stake in its enterprise services business and its directors were also briefed on discussions with KKR over a rival approach.
CVC has put a value of 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) including debt on what would be a newly created TIM enterprise services business, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday.
The interest from CVC comes as TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to split TIM's service business from its network operations as part of a broader strategy to revamp the debt-laden former phone monopoly.
U.S. fund KKR pitched a non-binding offer for TIM in November, valuing the whole of the group at 33 billion euros, when including net debt. 
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group's ""untapped value"".
On Monday TIM said it remained in talks with KKR to assess the ""attractiveness, actuality and deliverability"" of its approach. Two people with knowledge of the matter said TIM had asked KKR to further clarify the terms of its bid by April 4.
Also on Monday, TIM said that CVC, in its expression of interest, proposed setting up an entity including connectivity operations for big corporate clients, cloud, cybersecurity and IoT services.
CVC's evaluation of the business, included in the fund's proposal, was first reported by Italian daily La Stampa.
Analysts' valuation for the targeted business ranges widely between 5 and 10 billion euros. TIM and CVC both declined to comment. 
BID INTEREST
The European private equity firm would be interested in taking a share of up to 49% in the business once it would be carved out, sources have previously said.
CVC, which is being advised by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Nomura, requested a 10 week exclusive period for negotiations, including eight weeks for due diligence, the same sources added.
Private equity firms are looking at whether there is value to be found in European telecoms companies as the telcos seek to improve fast services delivered over broadband.
One of the sticking point in negotiations remained KKR's request for due diligence before formalising its bid, which the fund reiterated last week, two sources said. 
In a letter sent to the U.S fund late on Monday, TIM asked KKR to clarify by Monday whether its due diligence would only have a confirmatory nature as requested by the phone group, the sources said.

TIM also asked whether the November price of 10.8 billion euros for the equity was confirmed, and sought details on the financing of the bid after KKR said it would not make extensive recourse to debt, the sources added. 
One of the sources said that in reaffirming its interest for TIM, KKR had made a reference to recent market volatility which raised a question mark over whether the terms of its initial indicative proposal stood.($1 = 0.9098 euros)

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched gains on Tuesday, as a tech-fueled rally and growing hopes of a de-escalation in the Ukraine-Russia conflict helped stocks shrug off further signs from the bond market sounding the alarm on a potential recession. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.3% to close above 4,600 for the first since January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.97%, or 339 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.84%.
Russia sees its pledge to reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas as a means of building up trust in talks with Ukraine that could ultimately lead to an agreement that could prove key to ending the war. 
There are doubts about whether much can be read into Moscow's willingness to scale back military activity as Russia’s progress toward Kyiv has stalled recently, and there wasn’t any mention of cutting back military operations in the South of Ukraine, where fighting has intensified.
The prospect of progress at the talks were boosted a day earlier after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was open to discussing some of the Kremlin’s demands around neutrality.
Oil prices, dominated by headlines from Ukraine and Russia, were in the red, dragging energy stocks lower as investors cooled their expectations of prolonged war disrupting energy supplies.  
The growth corners of the market including tech and consumer discretionary continued to add to recent gains.
Chip stocks resumed their uptrend following a sluggish start to the week as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) climbed following favorable commentary on the stock from Wall Street.
Tigress Financial raised its price target on Nvidia to $410 a share from $400, citing new products launches and growing data center demand.

The move higher in stocks hasn’t taken focus away from the bond market, in which a key part of the Treasury yield curve briefly inverted, exacerbating concerns about a potential recession ahead.

Investing.com -- Stocks continued to climb higher, as investors await key economic reports on jobs and economic output on Wednesday.
Despite Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine, and peace talks meant to at least achieve a ceasefire, investors appeared to focus on the upcoming data releases. 
The strong surge in stocks, particularly technology shares, in the afternoon on Tuesday came despite a recession warning in the bond market, when the 2-year Treasury yield briefly ran higher than the 10-year for the first time since 2019.
The Federal Reserve is trying to weigh how aggressively to target inflation, and the jobs data this week will factor into its decision making at the May meeting. 
Expectations are building that the Fed will raise rates by a half-point rather than the customary quarter-point increase. On Tuesday, data on job openings showed there were 11.3 million positions available in February, and some five million more than there were workers available.
Oil has been pressured in recent days, falling again on Tuesday ahead of the government’s much-followed report on inventories for the previous week. The oil industry’s own report is due out after the market closes tonight.
Later this week, the government will release data on personal income and spending, which may show how households have been affected by rising prices for food and other goods and gasoline price spikes in the last month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. ADP payrolls
March's ADP non-farm employment change data —  a measure of the monthly change in non-farm, private employment — is set to be released Wednesday morning at 8:15 AM ET. Consensus forecasts are for companies to have added 450,000 jobs, below the previous 475,000 reported. But the data comes a couple of days before the government's broader report on employment and is likely to be a barometer of market sentiment.
2. Economic output
GDP for the fourth quarter will also be reported at 8:30 AM ET, with expectations for a 7.1% reading from the month before, well above the previous 2.3% number.
3. Crude inventories
Elsewhere, crude oil inventory data will be released mid-morning at 10:30 AM ET, with analyst's forecasting crude oil inventories falling 1.022 million barrels. This data comes as oil prices have steadily fallen despite Russia's war on Ukraine and sanctions potentially hitting supply. EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks are forecasted as falling 1.550 million, while gasoline inventories are forecast to fall 1.744 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon delayed its decision to award an enterprise-wide Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract that could be valued as much as $9 billion to December from April, the Pentagon's chief information officer said on Tuesday.
Proposals are being evaluated from four companies: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Pentagon Chief Information Officer John Sherman told reporters. 
""This is going to take us a little bit longer than we thought,"" Sherman said, adding that the workload to evaluate multiple proposals simultaneously was cumbersome. 
Up to four winners could be selected with the combined value of the contracts coming to as much as $9 billion over five years if all options and extensions were exercised, Sherman said.
The JWCC is the multi-cloud successor to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), which was an IT modernization project to build a large, common commercial cloud for the Department of Defense.

While the Trump administration wanted a single cloud-computing provider for the Department of Defense as laid out under JEDI, the Biden administration canceled it in favor of parceling out the project to multiple companies.
Such a move would put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors to avoid being locked in to any specific one.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 03:00PM ET</span>",Ericsson CEO faces investor ire over handling of Iraq probe,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Investors publicly rebuked Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Chief Executive Borje Ekholm and the telecom equipment maker's board on Tuesday over a scandal involving potential payments to Islamic State.
Ekholm's handling of an internal probe into Ericsson's operations in Iraq has come under scrutiny after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said the company was in breach of a 2019 deferred prosecution agreement for failing to inform U.S. authorities of potential misconduct it had uncovered there.
The risk of a hefty fine for that breach has lopped a quarter off Ericsson's market value and angered investors, who were not given any information about the company probe until media enquiries about it earlier this year.
At the group's annual general meeting (AGM) on Tuesday, shareholders representing more than 10% of Ericsson shares voted against discharging board members of liability for the previous year. That means Ekholm and other board members could be held personally liable for their actions.
Under Swedish law, if board members are not annually discharged of their liabilities by shareholders owning at least 10% of the stock they can be sued by the company and its investors.
Shareholders, however, approved a proposal to reappoint the CEO and the board.
Several criticised the handling of the Iraq probe during the meeting. But many questions were left unanswered, with Chairman Ronnie Leten and CEO Ekholm saying they were unable to give details due to the ongoing DoJ investigation.
""I fully understand the concern over the recent turbulence in Ericsson. I want to emphasise again the full commitment to rebuild your trust in Ericsson,"" Leten told the meeting.
Ericsson shares closed down 1.6% at 85.87 crowns. 
In comments after the AGM, Leten said Ekholm and the management team had the full support of the board.
""We have made good progress, but there is much still to do,"" he said in emailed comments, noting his work on ethics and compliance in five years at the helm. 
While losing the vote may not mean Ekholm has to step down, it will raise further questions over his stewardship.
Ekholm, the company's chief financial officer Carl Mellander and Ericsson have been named as defendants in a U.S. class action lawsuit accusing them of misleading investors over the company's dealings in Iraq.
In 2014, a scandal over business dealings in Uzbekistan at telecoms company Telia Company, then called TeliaSonera, led shareholders to vote against discharging former CEO Lars Nyberg from personal liability in 2014.
Nyberg was later charged with bribery, but was acquitted by a Swedish court.
TRANSPARENCY 
Ekholm took https://www.reuters.com/article/ericsson-ceo-idINASM00072G the helm at Ericsson in 2016 after a string of poor results https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ericsson-ceo-idUSKCN1050IT and when the company was under investigation by U.S. authorities over bribery allegations.
Backed by top shareholder Investor AB, he revived the company's performance and paid https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU a $1 billion fine to the DoJ to settle bribery cases in several countries.
In the same year, a company probe into its operations in Iraq identified payments designed to circumvent customs at a time when militant organisations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.
While Ekholm has been fostering transparency and urging employees to speak up about improprieties, the company did not disclose details of the new probe to shareholders.
Ekholm told Reuters in February the substance of its findings did not pass the threshold to make a disclosure.
Last week he told investors that he had instructed his staff to disclose the investigation to the authorities. The company replaced Chief Legal Officer Xavier Dedullen, who handled the settlement in 2019, earlier this month.
An Ericsson spokesperson said Dedullen declined to comment.

Cevian, which owns just under 5% of Ericsson shares, had said it would have to vote against discharging board members of their liabilities because it did not have enough information to do otherwise, while it would support their re-election.
Investor AB said it would vote in favour of discharging the board and it had full confidence in the board and CEO.

Cargojet said on Tuesday it had reached a five-year extendable deal to provide air-transportation services for DHL Network Operations, as demand for e-commerce soars during the pandemic. 
Shares of Ontario-based Cargojet, which provides time sensitive air cargo services, rose almost 14% to C$186.10 in mid-day trading.
International flights using widebody aircraft that offer belly space for shippers are returning more slowly than domestic traffic, creating the need for additional capacity on dedicated cargo planes.
DHL Express Division said the deal for Cargojet to support its international requirements could be renewed for an additional two years.
Under the deal, DHL would be issued warrants to acquire up to 9.5% of Cargojet's outstanding voting shares over a period of seven years, at a price of C$158.92 each, with vesting tied to the delivery of C$2.3 billion in business volume during the term. 
""Cargojet is an important aviation partner of DHL in North America and we see this expansion of our relationship further strengthening intra-regional and intercontinental links to and from this region,"" said Mike Parra, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express Americas.

""This step builds on the significant investments we have made in DHL's aviation capacity and capabilities over the last two years in the Americas,"" Parra added.
DHL also intends to be Cargojet's launch customer for new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 7777 wide-body, long-range cargo aircraft which are expected to be deployed in late 2023 or early 2024.

The new financed option on offer will allow customers to pay for charging infrastructure as an operational expense, with the turnkey option enabling them to offer public charging to host a station at zero cost. 
""This partnership will enable customers to implement a superior EV charging solution at no capital expense,"" they added. 
Pasquale Romano, president and CEO of ChargePoint, said the partnership ""reduces the barrier to entry for businesses who have been interested in adopting clean energy but have held back due to lack of tailored financing."""

(Reuters) - Canadian insurer Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) Corp said on Tuesday that employees can return to its offices across Canada from April 25 regardless of vaccination status, amid a fall in COVID-19 infections.
The country's biggest life insurer has asked staffers to return under a hybrid model with certain days of the week designated for remote work, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Guidelines on mask mandates and physical distancing will be set in line with local regulations, the memo said.
Several financial firms across Canada and the United States that had postponed their back-to-office plans late last year are now looking to reopen offices and bring back employees with fresh coronavirus guidelines.
Earlier this month, Manulife had opened select office locations as a part of its return-to-office plans in Canada after COVID-19 cases in the country declined.
Canadian lender Bank of Nova Scotia issued a similar guidance in February allowing staffers to return to the majority of its Canadian offices on a voluntary basis from mid-March.

Delfin, the holding of the Italian billionaire Leonardo del Vecchio, and Fondazione CRT said they ended the pact as of March 27 since the purposes for which they signed it have ceased to exist.
Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle that has cast doubt on the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, whose term ends in April.
With the backing of Mediobanca, the insurer's board has put Donnet forward for a third term.
Italian tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who is Generali's second-largest shareholder, has proposed veteran former Generali executive Luciano Cirina as CEO in a challenge to Donnet.
Caltagirone, who holds 9.52% in Generali, had also been part of the pact with Delfin and CRT but quit in January to prevent, sources said at that time, regulatory scrutiny on whether the alliance was indeed a consultation pact or represented a more substantial concert party which could have seen its voting power curtailed.

Investment bank Mediobanca is the largest shareholder in Generali and the row over the board stems from differences between it and the other large investors over how the insurer is run.
The composition of the board will be settled at an investor vote on April 29.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 01:22PM ET</span>","Bank analysts, investors antsy for spending outlook as inflation risks grow","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Analysts and investors of major Wall Street banks are eagerly anticipating any insight from executives on the outlook for consumer spending and borrowing, a key source of revenue, when first-quarter earnings are unveiled next month. 
U.S. consumer spending has been rising for months as the country emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and Americans make up for lost time traveling, shopping and dining out, bankers and economists say. 
Despite the momentum, there are signs that the end of pandemic-era financial aid and inflation hovering at 40-year-highs, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are beginning to hurt the finances of lower-income Americans.
Executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which together bank around half of all U.S. households, have said for months the American consumer is in good health, spending more and using account balances, which grew during the pandemic, to pay down credit cards and other debt.
So far, they say, consumer spending appears to be holding up. But the outlook for income growth an 
Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, said its customers spent $63 billion in February on debit and credit cards, up 21% from a year ago, with higher spending on travel, dining, public transportation and gym memberships.
""We saw a strong continuation of payment and spending trends in February,"" said Mary Hines Droesch, head of consumer and small business products at Bank of America. ""(The data) suggest more consumers are returning to the office and resuming more in-person activities.""
U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March, while retail sales in February, the most recent month available, rose more than 17% over last year, according to data from the U.S. Commerce Department.
""Despite record-high inflation and an 11-year low in consumer sentiment, U.S. consumption, especially retail sales, has proven resilient,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management. 
Consumer behavior was bolstered by a tight labor market, excess savings and ""solid household balance sheets,"" she said. 
More data will be available on April 13 when JPMorgan kicks off earnings season, followed by Wells Fargo on April 14 and Bank of America on April 18. 
While people return to old spending habits - confidence about their prospects for meaningfully growing income over the next two years is at an eight-year-low, according to data from the University of Michigan, and economists say real incomes, a more specific measure of wealth, are cratering.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economic analyst Jason Briggs expects that real household income will only grow by 0.5% in 2022, and that income for the lowest-wage earners will decline this year because of inflation and the end of government assistance.
""The largest headwind to real spending growth in 2022 is very weak real income growth,"" Briggs wrote in a note to investors last week. 
One area of lending - cars - is seeing a rise in delinquencies from borrowers who have the lowest-quality credit. 
Delinquencies on auto loans rose in February for the ninth-straight month, led by sub-prime borrowers, according to a report from Manheim Consulting. The report also found that the percentage of sub-prime auto loans in serious delinquency was at its highest rate since 2006, although the proportion of overall loans that are subprime has been hovering near record lows.
The New York Federal Reserve last week identified another possible reason for trouble on the horizon: 37 million federal student loan borrowers will have to start making payments again starting in May. 
Payments on federal student loans have been suspended since March 2020 when the government temporarily placed these loans in administrative forbearance.

Meanwhile, the 10 million borrowers with private student loans who had to continue making payments ""struggled with their debt,"" New York Fed research analysts wrote.
""The difficulties faced by these borrowers in managing their (private) student loans and other debts suggest that (federal student loan) borrowers will face rising delinquencies once forbearance ends and payments resume,"" New York Fed researchers wrote in a blog post.

The move comes a week after the Dutch Senate passed a motion asking Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government to ""use its powers"" to temporarily block construction of the site in the northern town of Zeewolde, 50 km east of Amsterdam.
""Given the current circumstances, we have decided to pause our development efforts in Zeewolde,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.
The town in December had approved plans to build the largest facility of its kind in the Netherlands, from which Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would serve users across Europe.
It would use 1.38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and cover 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, and was expected to run on green energy and create 400 permanent jobs.
It was, however, opposed by some environmental campaigners who do not want the limited supply of sustainable power generated in the Netherlands to be used by a multinational company. Some residents of Zeewolde said they felt their voices had not been heard in the permitting process.
The Senate motion asked the government to delay construction until a government policy on data centres had been agreed.

“After having been invited in 2019 by the local, provincial and national government to consider a data center investment in the Netherlands and Zeewolde in particular, Meta envisioned a strong partnership that would bring jobs and community benefits to the region,"" the spokesperson said.
The company left the door open to restarting the project, saying it would continue to cooperate with the municipality over what to do next.

The deal offers $28 for each Nielsen share, a premium of 60% since early March when the deal talks were first reported. Shares of Nielsen jumped about 21% in mid-day trading.
Nielsen had earlier this month rejected an offer of $25.40 per share from the consortium without naming the suitors. 
The offer was led by Brookfield and Elliott Management's tech-focused private equity arm Evergreen Coast Capital Corp, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Nielsen gathers viewership data across TV, radio and digital platforms that are used by advertisers and others to determine prime-time hours, but it has been under pressure as more cord-cutters move to streaming.

Earlier this month, Britain's anti-trust regulator said the company’s proposed $8.6 billion purchase of Avast needed a deeper probe owing to competition concerns.
The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software.
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation, and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe, according to a Reuters report earlier.
NortonLifeLock had then said it did not plan to propose any remedies. It called the CMA's decision ""surprising.""
Under the deal announced in August, Avast shareholders were to get a mix of cash and newly issued shares. NortonLifeLock expected the merger to result in cost savings of $280 million.

The company Monday said it will issue 5.5 million shares at $74 apiece. The offering will raise around $392.5 million on a net basis and close on Thursday.
Assuming the underwriters choose to subscribe to the 825,000 shares they have the option of buying, the dilution will amount to about 9.6% of the current outstanding equity. A share dilution tends to depress a company’s earnings per share.  
Southwest’s purchase of Questar was opposed by investor Carl Icahn, whose offer to buy the former at $82.50 per share was rejected by the company. Southwest shares are currently trading around $78.
It termed Icahn’s offer “inadequate, structurally coercive, highly conditional” and said it undervalues the company. The activist investor’s first offer of $75 for each share of the company was rejected by it on November 9 last year.

(Reuters) -European shares rallied on Tuesday, taking cues from strength in Asian markets and on Wall Street, as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded the most tangible sign yet of progress towards negotiating an end to the war.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 1.6% to its highest in nearly a month, and extended gains to a third straight session, as a sell-off in bonds continued. [GVD/EUR] 
All major sectors were in positive territory, led by automakers and banks which jumped 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.
Russia promised on Tuesday to scale down military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine as a confidence-building step. Ukraine proposed adopting neutral status in the most detailed formula yet for a potential settlement to the five-week conflict.
""After the potential breakthrough in peace talks, European stocks accelerated gains made earlier in the day, as there has been real concern, not just about violence on Europe's doorstep, but also the effects on commodities,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Germany's two-year yield briefly turned positive for the first time since 2014, while the U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve moved another step closer to inversion. [GVD/EUR] [US/]
""You're not seeing the same movements in Germany treasury markets as in the U.S., but soaring inflation could prompt the European Central Bank, too, to tighten faster than anticipated, which will spur an increased cost of living squeeze for consumers... The other worry is the possible recession indicated,"" Streeter added.
Investor focus is also on oil and gas supplies after Russia said it would accept payments for its gas exports in roubles. Russian gas accounts for about 40% of Europe's total consumption and the move could exacerbate a crunch in the continent and fan inflation.
Gains in London's FTSE 100 were curbed by a 2.5% slide in lender  Barclays  (LON:BARC) after one of its top investors offloaded stock roughly equivalent to a 3% stake in the bank.
The STOXX 600 is on course to end March with small gains - its first month in the black this year. But the index is on course for its first quarterly loss in eight, as worries over broadening inflation given the surge in commodity prices and the subsequent hit to economic growth keep risk appetite in check. 

France and Germany saw bigger than expected drops in consumer confidence this month as government measures to help with rising inflation and fuel costs offered little relief following Russia's invasion, surveys showed. [nL2N2VW0GX]

The bonds, which are denominated in dollars, climbed between 5 cents and 6.3 cents, Tradeweb prices showed. Most continue to trade below 50 cents on the dollar.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
Ukraine has said it holds little hope of an immediate breakthrough in the talks with Russia in Turkey on Tuesday. But the resumption of face-to-face discussions is seen as possible step towards a ceasefire in the month-long war.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 11:57AM ET</span>",Pro-market consultant emerges as unlikely new Petrobras CEO,"By Gram Slattery and Gabriel Araujo
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has made little secret in recent weeks of his ire at state-run oil company Petrobras over rising fuel prices, teasing the possibility of swapping out its chief executive.
However, Adriano Pires, the man tapped for the job on Monday, did not fit the profile that the market was expecting.
A well-known energy consultant and academic who once worked at national oil regulator ANP, Pires is a staunch defender of the market-friendly policies at Petrobras that Bolsonaro bashes, particularly the way it tracks global energy markets with its domestic fuel prices.
In a public debate last month, Pires said he hoped Brent prices would soar to $200 per barrel so the government could rake in tens of billions of dollars in dividends as the largest shareholder of Petrobras. 
In a column this month for financial blog Brazil Journal, he criticized the company for keeping domestic prices too far below global benchmarks.
That may be one reason the market seems to have taken the sudden putsch of current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna in stride. 
Brazil-listed preferred shares in the company, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, opened 2% higher on Tuesday, even amid fears the shake-up may portend more intense political pressure heading into Brazil's October elections. 
""Pires is someone with a technical background in the energy sector who sympathizes with Petrobras' current pricing policy. Therefore, for now we do not see negative impacts in the medium term,"" Guide Investimentos analyst Rodrigo Crespi wrote in a note to clients.
Pires, who did not respond to a request for comment, holds a doctorate from the Sorbonne, and co-founded the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure think tank (CBIE). 
He is a long-time columnist, consultant and professor of energy policy, and spent roughly two and a half years in high-ranking positions in Brazil's ANP national oil regulator through 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile.
In his public comments and articles, Pires has not advocated a totally hands-off approach to the fuel market, instead calling for measures that would cushion consumers from high fuel prices without incurring losses for Petrobras and the private sector.
In particular, he has favored a government fund, financed in part by royalties currently paid by oil producers in Brazil, that would help to stabilize fuel prices at the pump during periods of high volatility. 

Bolsonaro has also shown interest in such a policy, which is awaiting consideration in the lower house of Congress after government allies pushed a bill through the Senate.
However, the proposal has met stiff resistance from Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who argues it would serve little social purpose, particularly when compared to its potentially enormous impact on public finances.

NextEra, however, said the department's decision did not affect the company's long-term financial expectations. 
U.S. trade officials on Monday said they would launch an investigation that could result in tariffs on solar panels imported from four Southeast Asian nations, a blow to clean energy project developers, like NextEra, that rely on cheap imports to keep costs down.
The Commerce Department's decision regarding imports from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia was a victory for Auxin Solar. The San Jose, California-based solar manufacturer this year requested the probe, arguing that Chinese manufacturers shifted production to those nations to avoid paying U.S. duties in place for nearly a decade on Chinese-made solar goods.
""We are disappointed with the Commerce Department's decision to grant Auxin's request to investigate as we believe it has no merit,"" NextEra Chief Executive John Ketchum said in a statement.
""However, we are optimistic the investigation will be resolved favorably and that no additional antidumping and countervailing duties tariffs will be put in place,"" Ketchum said.
But, he said ""some of NextEra's solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by the disruption this decision is expected to cause.""
For 2022, NextEra continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85.

For 2023 through 2025, NextEra expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share.
""We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025,"" Ketchum said.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 11:42AM ET</span>",U.S. agency to review if Pony.ai complied with crash reporting order,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday said it will review whether startup technology firm Pony.ai complied with government reporting requirements for driverless crashes.
Pony.ai earlier this month agreed to issue a recall for some versions of its autonomous driving system software after an October crash in California. The recall, which the NHTSA said was the ""first recall of an automated driving system,"" covered three vehicles.
The NHTSA said it will review whether Toyota-backed Pony.ai complied with reporting requirements ""with respect to both the timeliness and accuracy of its reports.""
On Oct. 28, a Pony.ai vehicle that had been operating in autonomous mode hit a street sign on a median in Fremont, California, after turning right, prompting California in December to suspend the company's driverless testing permit. No one was injured in the incident.
Pony.ai on Tuesday said it reported the incident to the NHTSA in ""a good faith effort to comply with the relevant requirements"" and added that it ""has been fully cooperating with NHTSA throughout the process.""
Pony.ai said earlier that the crash occurred less than 2.5 seconds after the automated driving system shut down. It said in very rare circumstances, a planning system diagnostic check ""could generate a 'false positive' indication of a geolocation mismatch.""
The NHTSA told Pony.ai earlier it believed the software had a safety defect and requested that the company conduct a recall. 
The company said it has updated the software code and the three affected vehicles have been repaired.
Earlier this month, Pony.ai announced that it had completed a new round of financing that gives it a valuation of $8.5 billion. 

California last year said Pony.ai had 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit.
The suspension does not impact Pony.ai's permit for testing with a safety driver.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Bermuda court on Tuesday ruled former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and his family are due damages ""substantially in excess of $500 million"" from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s local life insurance arm in a costly setback for the bank.
The court said that Ivanishvili and his family were due the damages as a result of a long-running fraud committed by a former Credit Suisse adviser, Pascale Lescaudron.
Credit Suisse said its life insurance subsidiary, which is in the process of being wound down, intended to ""vigorously pursue"" an appeal of the verdict.
The ruling is another blow for the scandal-stricken bank, still reeling from billions in losses racked up in 2021, which prompted a top management shake-up, and as it faces further probes over compliance and risk failings.
Chief Justice Narinder Hargun of the Supreme Court of Bermuda said: ""CS Life did not take action or adequate action to prevent Mr. Lescaudron's fraudulent mismanagement of the policy accounts because it was prioritising the revenues Mr. Lescaudron generated for Credit Suisse over the interest of its clients."" 
A client of Credit Suisse between 2005 and 2015, Ivanishvili alleged he racked up hundreds of millions in losses due to forged trades made by his Geneva-based private banker, Lescaudron, appointed to handle his investments in 2006.
Lescaudron was convicted by a Swiss court in 2018 of having forged the signatures of former clients, including Ivanishvili, over an eight year period, and admitted he falsified trades and hid mounting losses as part of a scheme that made him tens of millions of Swiss francs. 
The Bermuda case covers only a portion of the damages Ivanishvili is seeking from Credit Suisse, centering on roughly $400 million in alleged losses incurred from fraudulent and ""imprudent"" trades on $755 million invested in insurance policies at Credit Suisse's Bermuda-based life insurance subsidiary, CS Life.
The Bermuda court said the extent of damages was yet to be settled but should be calculated based on the amount Ivanishvili's policies would have generated through March 29, 2022 had they been invested in a suitable medium-risk portfolio instead.
""The plaintiff's primary claim is for damages calculated as amounting to $553.86 million as of 31 July 2020, being the difference between the value of the assets on the policy accounts...and the total value...had they been invested instead in the medium-risk portfolio identified by the plaintiffs' investment expert,"" Hargun said in the verdict delivered by video conference.
'SEVERE CRITICISM'
A spokesperson for Ivanishvili said the ruling confirmed the Bermuda subsidiary was aware of Lescaudron's frauds.
""It is shocking that Credit Suisse continues to refuse to offer the Claimants compensation or repay the money it admits was stolen, whilst continuing to behave in a manner which has drawn severe criticism from the Court,"" he said.
Total losses yet to be repaid, spanning investments in Bermuda, Singapore and Switzerland, exceeded $800 million, he said.
The spokesperson also said Ivanishvili and his family would continue to quantify losses incurred both in Bermuda and in Singapore, ""where Credit Suisse's Trust business is adopting the same tactics to avoid taking responsibility.""
The Swiss bank last week flagged potential losses exceeding $500 million in connection with the Bermuda ruling.
Lescaudron, sentenced to five years in prison by a Swiss court in 2018, was ordered to pay damages of $130 million in Switzerland in connection with the fraudulent schemes set up in relation to Ivanishvili and other clients.
Credit Suisse was recognised as a victim in the Swiss case, and has said Lescaudron operated as a lone wolf and worked to conceal his illegal activities from the bank.
The Bermuda court said Lescaudron's fraudulent mismagement included making investment decisions without proper authority, making sales and purchases below market value and ""forging documents (and) executing investments for the purpose of obtaining unlawful commissions.""
Credit Suisse last week said it had already set aside reserves to handle the Bermuda matter, without specifying further, and would determine whether it needed to increase them.

Ivanishvili is also suing the bank and an affiliate, Credit Suisse Trust Ltd., in Singapore over trusts set up there.
He is seeking a further $300 million in the Singapore case, his spokesperson said, which is set to go on trial in September.

On Tuesday, the Spanish government said in its official bulletin that the fine related to a ""very serious infringement"", without identifying the name of clients or the potential case it was referring to.
The issue is unrelated to one that involves the suspected mis-selling of risky investment bank products to customers in Spain that has resulted in a lawsuit and investigations. 
Deutsche said it would appeal against the fine, the highest penalty in Spain since November 2018, when the CNMV fined Santander (MC:SAN) 4.5 million euros for improperly charging incentives to investment clients, according to public records from the supervisor.
According to the government gazette, Deutsche Bank had not applied the required measures to manage the ""existing conflict of interest in the repurchase from clients of structured bonds issued by Deutsche Bank Group, applying significant spreads compared to their fair value of which customers were not informed.""

The German lender said it had acted correctly in this situation, ""applying conflict of interest management policies and taking additional measures in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the events inspected"".

Several copper miners have paused investment decisions in the country while the political negotiations play out.

The department granted China Eastern's request starting March 31 to move existing twice weekly Shanghai westbound passenger flights from New York to China's Fuzhou Change International Airport in Fuji province through the end of April.
The Chinese airline said earlier because of ""evolving coronavirus pandemic control measures in the Shanghai region, China Eastern has been instructed"" by Chinese aviation officials ""to divert Shanghai-bound passenger flights arriving from the U.S. to certain alternate airports in China."" 
China's aviation regulator said earlier this month it would divert 106 international flights scheduled to arrive in Shanghai to other domestic cities from March 21 to May 1 due to COVID-19.
The affected flights include those operated by Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Juneau Air and Spring Airlines, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.
On Tuesday, China’s most populous city tightened the first phase of a two-stage COVID lockdown, asking some residents to stay indoors unless they are getting tested as the number of new daily cases exceeded 4,400.
The financial hub of Shanghai, home to 26 million people, is in its second day of a lockdown authorities are imposing by dividing the city roughly along the Huangpu River, splitting the historic center from the eastern financial and industrial district of Pudding to allow for staggered testing.

Since early 2020, China and the United States have been at odds at various times about international flights between the two nations and restrictions imposed by both countries.
In January, the U.S. government said it was suspending 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government's decision to suspend some U.S. carrier flights over COVID-19 concerns.

The most expensive package PS Plus Premium costs $18 a month or $120 annually. It includes 340 more games than Extra, and lets players stream a wide selection of games.
Ryan said the service will initially be launched in Asia, followed by North America, Europe and the rest of the world.

The analyst also lowered sales estimates for this and next year to more reflect the consensus view among analysts. This has resulted in a new price target of $140.00 per share, down from the prior $185.00.
Though ETSY beat expectations last quarter, we think the macroeconomic environment has materially worsened since our last note in late February. We now expect 15% GMS growth this year, down from our prior estimate of 19%. We have GMS targeted to grow 20% over the longer term, compared to our prior estimates of 25% (which were above management's long-term outlook). Our earnings estimates were already below consensus, but we are lowering them today on additional inflation in digital advertising. We are hearing from several consumer companies of digital marketing inflation in the 20-40% range. The consumer is distracted, pushing up CAC more than inflation, Champine wrote in a client note.
Another reason why the analyst downgraded Etsy is the fact that she sees potential for negative near-term catalysts.
We see significant risks to expectations for sales and profitability this year, and our new estimates may prove aggressive barring an easing of inflation.
Despite these near-term challenges, the analyst remains positive on the long-term outlook for the ETSY stock.
We believe in the long-term growth potential given the differentiated offerings, brand equity, and improving search functionality Etsy offers, the analyst concluded.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>","Russian rouble soars to 83 vs dollar before easing, stocks mixed","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble soared over 7% to 83 to the dollar in Moscow on Tuesday before paring some gains, hitting a more than one-month high near levels last seen before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, while stocks ended another volatile session in mixed fashion.
The Russian market is gradually reopening after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
By 1333 GMT, the rouble was up 5.2% against the dollar at 85.10, having earlier touched 82.9525, its strongest since Feb. 25. It gained 1.9% to trade at 94.76 versus the euro, earlier clipping a Feb. 25 high of 92.10. 
In offshore trade, the rouble was weaker, hovering at 87 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform.
Two powerful drivers - Russia switching to roubles for gas export payments and exporting firms being mandated to convert 80% of their foreign currency earnings into roubles - are supporting the Russian currency, said Iskander Lutsko, chief investment strategist at ITI Capital. 
""The market now really depends on progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,"" Lutsko said of the Russian stock market, as the two sides met for face-to-face talks in Turkey and there were signs of tentative progress.
STOCKS RECOVER
Russian stocks were trading in curtailed sessions and with various restrictions, including a ban on short-selling. Non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1. Trading volumes are far lower than normal.
The dollar-denominated RTS index finished the shorter session up 7.1% at 881.6 points, but the rouble-based MOEX Russian index pared early gains to shed 0.9% to 2,408.5 points.
Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCredit Bank, said the entire capitalisation of the MOEX index is now about six times smaller than the market capitalisation of U.S. tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Flag carrier Aeroflot, one of the most volatile securities since the reopening, jumped 16.4%. Oil major Rosneft was 3.4% higher and dominant state lender Sberbank gained 3%. 
The Moscow-listed shares and depositary receipts of some companies with primary listings abroad returned to trading on Tuesday. 
Nasdaq-listed tech giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) saw its Moscow shares climb 4.6%, while depositary receipts in London-listed retailer Fix Price soared 13.2%. 
London-listed internet firm VK, one of a few companies to have flagged issues with servicing debt, saw its Moscow depositary receipts leap 72.3%, recovering to levels seen in mid February.
Moscow Exchange said it had held ""discrete auctions"" on securities of Aeroflot and VK. A discrete auction is a tool the bourse can use to try and ease extraordinary volatility and allow a base price for the security to form.
VK securities closed the session at a price of 510 roubles, up from a record low hit on Feb. 24, but still way off levels of around 2,000 roubles seen in early 2021. 
VK's flagship social network Vkontakte has set new records for user activity in the last month, in the wake of foreign platforms being blocked.
""Market participants are probably over-valuing the company after the work of rival social networks was restricted in Russia,"" said BCS analysts. 
EUROBOND TEST
Russia's finance ministry said on Tuesday it had fully paid a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2035, its third payout since unprecedented Western sanctions called Russia's ability to service foreign currency debt into question.

But Russia retaliated in what it has called an ""economic war"" with the West by offering to buy back its $2 billion Eurobonds maturing next month in roubles rather than dollars.
Yields on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds dropped to 12.68%, moving further away from last week's record high of 19.74%, which was just below the central bank's key interest rate. Yields move inversely to prices.

J&J (NYSE:JNJ) said it would continue to supply medicines and medical devices in the region as those are excluded from Western sanctions. It will, however, not enroll more patients in clinical drug trials it was running in Russia, it said earlier.
The company, which gets about 1% of its sales from Russia, has previously said that half of its business in the region is pharmaceuticals and a majority of its product portfolio from its consumer health business comes within the essential health space of over-the-counter medicines.
J&J is one of the biggest drugmakers in the world and also has a sizeable consumer health business that sells skin care, beauty and oral care products under brands including Neutrogena, Aveeno and Listerine. 
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), which owns blockbuster wrinkle treatment Botox, said earlier this month it had temporarily suspended operations for all its aesthetics products in Russia.
Consumer goods giants such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) have said they will retain a presence in Russia to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene. 
J&J had previously said it would pause enrollment in clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus but was committed to providing essential health products.

Large U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) have announced plans to pull back investments and promotions from Russia, but pledged to continue supply of medicine and medical equipment. 
Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged pharmaceutical companies including J&J to join conglomerates withdrawing from Russia completely.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Tuesday likened himself to the rapper Eminem in seeking to throw out his 2018 agreement with the top U.S. securities regulator requiring the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive to obtain preapproval for his tweets.
In a filing in federal court in Manhattan, Musk also renewed his effort to quash a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena for details on whether he and Tesla are complying with their disclosure requirements under the 2018 consent decree.
The SEC is investigating Musk's Nov. 6, 2021, tweet asking his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake, to cover tax bills on stock options. He has since sold about $16.4 billion of his shares in the electric car company.
In Tuesday's filing, Musk said requiring Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets was an unconstitutional prior restraint on his speech, violating the First Amendment.
""The (SEC) won't let me be or let me be me so let me see; They tried to shut me down,"" Musk said, quoting from Eminem's 2002 song ""Without Me.""
Eminem's lyrics referred to the Federal Communications Commission, which had fined radio stations playing ""The Real Slim Shady,"" an Eminem song whose content it deemed offensive.
Musk also said the SEC issued its subpoena in bad faith, and could not pursue a ""fishing expedition"" to harass him.
The SEC declined to comment.
It has said Musk was not immune from scrutiny over his Tesla-related tweets, and should not be excused from the 2018 agreement because he found compliance ""less convenient than he had hoped.""
That agreement stemmed from Musk's Aug. 7, 2018, tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take Tesla private. Musk said on Tuesday that the tweet was truthful.

The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan. She last week won U.S. Senate approval to become a federal appellate judge, and may continue presiding over her existing cases.
The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865.

PARIS (Reuters) -Decathlon, the sportswear arm of a French retail empire facing criticism for staying in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, said on Tuesday it was now suspending activities in the country due to supply difficulties. 
Decathlon is owned by the Mulliez family, which is also behind DIY retailer Leroy Merlin and food retailer Auchan, both of which continue to operate in Russia. 
Western companies from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have stepped back from Russia, under pressure from customers and their governments to inflict an economic price on Moscow for waging war on its neighbour. Western sanctions on Russia have also complicated doing business there. 
""In strict compliance with international sanctions, Decathlon notes that the supply conditions are no longer met to continue its activity in Russia. Decathlon has to suspend the operation of its stores,"" it said in a statement.
Decathlon imports the bulk of the products it sells in its 60 stores in Russia. It said it would continue to support its 2,500 Russian staff, some of whom have been involved with the company since 2006.
Auchan, which has around 30,000 staff, 231 stores and e-commerce activities in Russia, where it makes 10% of its global turnover, has been singled out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for continuing operations in Russia.
The CEO of Auchan, however, told French newspaper Journal du Dimanche on Sunday the company planned to maintain its presence in Russia, in part because it feared losing assets or exposing local managers to legal troubles if it pulled out.
A spokesperson for Auchan told Reuters on Tuesday there was no change in the company's position towards Russia. The retailer sources the bulk of the products it sells in Russia locally.

Leroy Merlin, which has 45,000 employees and 113 stores in Russia, also sources most of its products locally. The company, which made 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of revenues in Russia last year - behind only France - said it was maintaining its presence in Russia for the same reasons as Auchan.

The company said comparable store sales in the first eight weeks of the new financial year were up 5.4%, compared with the same period in 2019.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday on relief at signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, even though hostilities continue to rage on the ground. 
Russia's chief negotiator said his country had agreed to de-escalate the attacks on the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv in an effort to ""build trust."" Earlier, Mikhaylo Podolyak, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, had briefed that discussions on a ceasefire had taken place that were based on a future of armed neutrality for Ukraine, guaranteed by various countries including the U.S. and Russia, while Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that Russia had effectively achieved its aims in securing the 'liberation' of the eastern region of Donbas. 
It wasn't immediately clear whether the progress made would be acceptable to the top leadership of either country, given that Ukraine still refuses to acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea and given Vladimir Putin's previous comments on the need to restore a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. However, Russia appears to have dropped its implicit demand for regime change in Ukraine, something it styled as 'de-Nazification' even though Ukraine's President is both Jewish and democratically elected.
The news more than made up for worrying signs of inflation from the housing market, where annual house prices rose by 18.2% in the year through January, according to data released earlier. There were also fresh signs of tightness in the labor market, with the number of job openings rising again last month
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 359 points, or 1.0%, at 35,315 points, while the S&P was up 0.9% to stand less than 4% off its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3%.
Markets were mainly affected, as so often in recent weeks, through the oil channel. Peace would reduce the likelihood of extreme western action to remove Russian energy exports from world markets, the threat of which has driven oil, gas, and coal up just as inflation is running at a four-decade high in much of the world. Lower oil prices would change the outlook for inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in tightening monetary policy. As such, bond yields fell along the yield curve, bringing down the cost of capital for companies and improving the outlook for equity returns.  
Among early movers, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock rose 4.2%, helped not only by the prospect of lower fuel costs but also by the news Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam will take over as CEO from June 1, replacing long-time leader Fred Smith. Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) stock rose 21% after the market research company agreed to be bought by a Brookfield-led private equity consortium for around $16 billion including debt.
Elsewhere, Dave & Buster’s (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock rose 4.0% after the restaurant and entertainment chain said comparable sales were up 5.4% from pre-COVID times in the first eight weeks of the year - an update that more than made up for a quarterly report that missed expectations on both top and bottom lines due to various pandemic-related issues."

In addition, the company said it now sees first-quarter revenue below the low end of its prior guidance of $118 - $120 million and EBITDA for the quarter below the low end of its previous guidance of $(15) - $(12) million.

The analyst lowered FY22/23 revenue forecasts while increasing their net loss per share assumptions.

Ynsect breeds mealworms that produce proteins for aquaculture, livestock, pet food and fertilisers. 
The company made its first entry into the U.S. market in late 2021 through a supply deal to Pure Simple to make premium food for dogs.
The acquisition of Jord Producers, based in Nebraska, will allow it to enter the fast-growing backyard chicken feed sector, it said. 
The number of Americans having chickens in their backyards has doubled since 2018. By 2026, the U.S. market is predicted to reach approximately $400 million, according to a recent study by consultancy Arthur D. Little, cited by Ynsect. 
Pet food makers are increasingly using insects such as flies and mealworms as a sustainable source of protein, capitalising on rising pet ownership and booming demand from environmentally conscious consumers.
Farmed bugs require far less land, water and feed than livestock and they emit less greenhouse gasses.
French rival InnovaFeed signed a deal with U.S. grains merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland last month to supply insect protein to its pet food division.
Last year Ynsect agreed to take over Dutch firm Protifarm, a leader in insect ingredients for human food, marking a move into the food market amid rising demand for healthy, eco-friendly eating.
The company, which raised around $450 million from global investors, is building what it says will be the world's largest vertical farm, which uses stacked layers, in Amiens, northern France, set to open in the last quarter of 2022.

A spokesperson for Aptiv declined to comment on the production halt but said the company was following government orders and customers' production would not be impacted.
Aptiv has a number of production sites in Shanghai's Jiading district in the western part of the city. The district has not been affected so far by the city's two-stage COVID-19 lockdown, which started in the east on Monday. 
Four sources said workers at one of the sites, which makes wire harnesses, were abruptly told to head home on Tuesday. They declined to be named as the information was not public.
The affected workers were told to stay home on Wednesday and await a further notice, the sources added.
Customers of the plant include Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp, two of the sources said. 
Tesla, GM and SAIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Wire harnesses are vital components that bundle up to 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of cables in the typical car. They are unique to each model and vehicles cannot be built without them. 
Automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have been scrambling to find alternative sources of wire harnesses and other parts as Russia's invasion of Ukraine - a key producer of harnesses - has halted assembly lines and disrupted complex supply chains.
Aptiv is one of China's largest auto wire producers and supplies almost all carmakers in China, according to the website of the Jiading district.
Besides Tesla and GM, it supplies Volkswagen's joint ventures with SAIC, as well as Ford and Toyota. Reuters could not immediately establish how extensive Aptiv's production halt was and when production was set to resume.
The production pause comes as Shanghai, home to 26 million people, tightened the first phase of its lockdown on Tuesday, with daily new cases hitting a record above 4,400. 
Shanghai's western districts are set to go under lockdown on Friday until the early hours of April 5. 

China's ""dynamic clearing"" playbook sees local authorities rapidly identify and quarantine every infected person and their close contacts, and venues where cases are found can be locked down for up to 14 days.
GM has managed to maintain production at normal levels in the face of Shanghai's lockdown by having workers sleep at the factory, sources told Reuters. Tesla on Monday suspended production for four days.

Brokerages, asset managers and financial exchanges in Lujiazui - China's answer to Wall Street - rushed to summon key personnel to offices ahead of Monday's lockdown in Shanghai, and prepared sleeping bags and basic supplies for overnight stays.
Some have also adopted two-team rotation shifts, and initiated disaster recovery centres in a financial hub that processed more than 2,500 trillion yuan ($292 trillion) of financial transactions last year.
The 20,000 people working at 285 office towers in Pudong's Lujiazui Financial City, east of the Huangpu River, include white collar workers and some service staff, according to the administration bureau of the district, also home to some non-financial institutions.
Shanghai, home to 26 million people, started a lockdown on Monday by dividing the city roughly along the Huangpu River, to allow for staggered testing. Shanghai houses China's biggest markets for stock, bond, foreign exchange and derivative trading. 
Amundi BOC Wealth Management Co said its senior executives, as well as key investment, trading and risk-management staff are working and sleeping in their offices, to ensure smooth business operations.
Meanwhile Haitong Securities Co said Chairman Zhou Jie arranged emergency on-site duty shifts at its subsidiaries in Pudong on Sunday night, and led more than 150 key staff to work in offices starting Monday. The brokerage also kicked off two-team rotation shifts between its two office areas, it said on its official website. 
HFT Investment Management, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' Chinese fund venture, also put 52 workers in key positions in offices around the clock during the lockdown period.
Elsewhere Sinolink Securities issued a notice on Sunday night, urging its staff on duty to rush back to its headquarters in Pudong before midnight, so as to ""ensure continuity of system operation and trading"", the Chinese brokerage said on its website.
An executive at a foreign bank in Shanghai, who declined to be identified, said his bank is on a hybrid working model, with some staff working and sleeping at a backup office in Puxi, in the western side of the city, while some others staying in a trading room in Pudong.
A source at another foreign bank said the lender had been using disaster recovery centres for over a week, a practice that will continue. 
The officials declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange told Reuters it kept minimum teams of staff in key positions within the bourse, while others work from home in an arrangement designed to minimise human contacts, while ensuring safety of trading.

Arya focused on breadth (what % of sample set owns) and depth (how much owned in portfolio relative to stocks weight in S&P 500 index) among money managers to identify stocks that could benefit from increased ownership.
Stocks with the highest ownership include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 51.5% of fund managers, but still below broader semis peers, which suggests there is still room for current owners to increase their exposure.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is another semi stock with high ownership (39%), while relative weighting is now at lowest levels on record. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has the same level of ownership as TXN with a relative weighting down 25% YoY.
Additionally, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO),Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) are less owned than smaller market cap peers.
""We see opportunity for expanded ownership breadth for AVGO, AMD which, despite their large ~ $200bn+ market caps are owned by only 21%/30% of funds, respectively, below peers with smaller market caps. AVGO is owned by fewer investors but with larger weighting (concentration, 1.9x, above semis average), but AMD weighting of 0.96x is well below, so presents opportunity for greater depth also. Separately MU is owned by only 14% of funds, below similar mkt cap peers, though MUs depth of ownership of 1.21x is up the most QoQ (and 2nd most YoY) within semis,"" Arya said in a client note

The deal will combine the provider of healthcare services at home, mainly for older patients dealing with chronic illness and injuries, with UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s Optum unit, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services.
Demand for home healthcare over clinic-based services has increased in the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as patients and caregivers increasingly prefer to access vital services from the safety of their homes.
The deal comes a month after the U.S. Justice Department sued to stop UnitedHealth's $8 billion acquisition of billing and payment services provider Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG), saying the deal would give the health insurer access to its competitors' data.
UnitedHealth will pay $170 for each share of LHC Group, representing an 8.12% premium to the stock's last close.
Shares of LHC climbed 7.5% and were trading just shy of the offer at $168.70 before the opening bell, while those of UNH rose marginally.
UnitedHealth expects the LHC deal to be neutral to its outlook for adjusted profit per share in 2022 and modestly add in 2023. LHC Group co-founders Keith and Ginger Myers will invest $10 million in the health insurer's stock, following the close of the deal.

Last year, health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) acquired the remaining 60% stake it did not own in home health provider Kindred at Home for $5.7 billion to expand its patient care business.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will ban the shipment to Russia of precious metals, especially gold, in response to its invasion of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.
The ban on Russia-bound precious metal reflects Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's resolve to impose further sanctions against the country, pledged at last week's meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced nations.
From April 5, Japan will ban the export of precious metals such as gold as well as other items including luxury cars, jewellery, cosmetics and liquor. 
Japan's move comes after the United States and Britain took steps to curtail transactions in gold with Russia.
Britain revised its sanctions guidance on Friday to make clear that British entities cannot help Moscow sell its gold reserves, while the U.S. Treasury Department said a day earlier that gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by U.S. authorities.
Russia-bound exports of gold would require pre-approval by Japan's finance minister, as the new rule starts to take place on April 5, government officials said.
The latest ban comes on top of curbs on high-tech exports to Russia, including semiconductors, censors and communication equipment.
Kishida has announced plans to revoke Russia's most-favoured-nation trading status, which could lead to higher tariffs on its imports, as well as a ban on certain imports from Russia.

Japan has also frozen the assets of more than 100 Russian individuals and organisations, and is considering extending financial regulations to Japan-based crypto-currency exchanges.

The China Securities Regulatory Commision (CSRC) was responding to social media articles claiming regulators were stepping up scrutiny over Xiaomi-invested companies, some of which are seeking listings.
CSRC said it would continue to vet initial public offering (IPO) plans according to relevant rules and regulations, saying it would treat all applicants fairly and keep policy expectations stable.
""We hope market participants don't believe in or spread rumours and work together to safeguard a sound market environment,"" CSRC said in a statement. 

Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, said in a statement on Tuesday it had launched a lawsuit in response to ""fabricated and baseless rumours"" online about its industrial chain and investment activities.
Xiaomi told Reuters they had no further comment.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates expects to significantly reduce losses in the current financial year and return to profit next year, the airline's president indicated on Tuesday.
""We are in for a good set of results, we haven't reversed it completely but we have swung it,"" Tim Clark told reporters, adding the carrier had been cash-positive since October.
""We've swung the business back to profitability, we are cash-positive again big time, we have a very strong balance sheet again which we have been rebuilding,"" Clark said.
""We are forecasting profits next year and hopefully to pay a dividend and repay some of the equity that the government has put into the business,"" he added.
The carrier's financial year runs through March. 
In June last year, Emirates got an additional $1.1 billion in state support from Dubai after the coronavirus pandemic hurt long-haul travel and triggered the airline's first annual loss in more than three decades.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai, Clark said Emirates would not take delivery of A350 passenger jets if they have surface problems similar to those reported by Qatar Airways.
""We're not going to take airplanes with degradation. I made clear ... that this has to be resolved prior to delivery to Emirates.""
Airbus is locked in a UK court dispute with Qatar Airways over the contractual and safety implications of paint and lightning protection damage on existing A350 passenger jets. 

Several airlines have reported A350 paint problems, while Qatar Airways has complained of deeper underlying issues with a layer of lightning protection attached to the paint and said these raised questions over the safety of the affected jets.
Airbus, which has acknowledged quality problems but denied any safety threat, had no immediate comment on Clark's remarks.

Investing.com – Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) stock surged by 22% in premarket trading Tuesday after the TV-ratings company agreed to be acquired by a consortium for $16 billion with freedom to go to the market for a superior proposal.
The consortium comprises Evergreen Coast Capital, private equity affiliate of Elliott Investment Management, Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU) and others.
The all-cash offer values each Nielsen share at $28 apiece, 26% higher than the stock’s Monday close of $22.21. A previous offer made by the consortium was rejected by Nielsen owing to lower valuations.
The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2022, will also need the U.K. court approval.
A competing bidder who makes a superior proposal will bear a $102 million termination fee that is payable by Nielsen if it terminates the current transaction. The “go-shop” period expires in 45 days.
Nielsen said it will drop its share buyback proposal earlier approved by the board.
The company has been working on growing beyond its bread-and-butter TV rating business as more people shift to streaming. To cater to the clients’ need to better gauge the new audience, Nielsen now offers solutions enabling cross-platform linking and universal search. It has launched campaign measurement in 40 new markets and global expansion with leading digital publishers.
As a result, fourth-quarter revenue rose 2.5% to $894 million while adjusted profit per share jumped about 44% to 46 cents to beat estimates."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A supervisory body of Hong Kong's central bank has decided to replace a unit of  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) as manager of the territory's largest exchange-traded fund of more than $14 billion, the first such move since the vehicle was launched more than two decades ago.
State Street said in a statement on Tuesday its unit State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) - which has been running the exchange-traded fund (ETF), dubbed ""TraHK"", since 1999 - would be removed. This follows a U-turn by SSGA last year over an investment decision linked to U.S. sanctions on Chinese firms.
State Street, which remains the custodian of the fund, said Hang Seng Investment Management Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank, an affiliate of HSBC, had been selected as the new manager for TraHK.
Hang Seng Investment Management said in a separate statement the appointment was subject to regulatory approvals and the transition was expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.
The ETF, which is popular among Hong Kong retail investors and pension funds with HK$111 billion in assets as of Monday, was set up in 1998 by Hong Kong's government to offload shares it bought during the Asian financial crisis.
""TraHK underpins the retirement (and) wealth proposition for much of Hong Kong’s working population, with Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) investments accounting for approximately 17.5% of TraHK’s assets,"" Diana Cesar, CEO of Hang Seng Bank said in a statement, referring to compulsory pension savings. 
SSGA said in January 2021 it would stop buying shares in two large constituents of the Hang Seng index, citing a decision to no longer invest in securities of U.S. sanctioned entities.
But three days later SSGA said it would resume investing in stocks denied to U.S. investors under an executive order by then U.S. President Donald Trump.
The initial TraHK decision to stop investing in the banned securities sparked anger from some investors, who called for SSGA to be replaced by a manager that could buy the stocks.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in an ensuing push last year, asked a long-standing seven-member supervisory committee to initiate a review where in total seven ETF managers headquartered in different jurisdictions, including SSGA, were invited to bid for the business.
The committee cited the lower management fee proposed by Hang Seng as one of the supporting considerations to choose the local-grown manager, which has promised to reduce the current charge of 0.05% per annum to 0.022% in the first three years of handover, and another cut to 0.019% starting the fourth year.

Investing.com –  LHC Group  (NASDAQ:LHCG) stock jumped 7.4% in premarket trading Tuesday after UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) said its subsidiary Optum will buy the in-home health care services provider at $170 a share.
LHC stock closed at $157.23 Monday.
The deal values LHC at about $6 billion, including debt, The Wall Street Journal reported. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.
LHC co-founders Keith and Ginger Myers will personally invest $10 million in UnitedHealth Group stock following the close of the combination, UnitedHealth said in a release. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to UnitedHealth Group’s outlook for adjusted net earnings per share in 2022, modestly accretive in 2023, and advancing strongly in subsequent years.
Much of LHC’s home-health and hospice network is owned in partnerships with hospitals. The company claims to care for more than 500,000 patients annually.
The deal comes amid increasing demand for at-home care as patients shun nursing homes and seek lower-cost alternatives. It’s a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Players like UnitedHealth and rival Humana (NYSE:HUM) are thus keen to push into that area.
Humana last year completed its acquisition of Kindred at Home, spending about $5.7 billion for the 60% share of the company.
UnitedHealth is currently locked in an antitrust battle with the Justice Department that’s blocking its acquisition of health-technology firm Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG). The authorities argue that UnitedHealth could use it to help its insurance unit to deal with competition."

The company reported a Q4 loss per share of 76 RMB, compared to the loss per share of 53 RMB in the year-ago quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at 8.56 billion yuan, topping the consensus estimates of 8.12 billion yuan. Net loss in the period totaled 1.29 billion yuan.
The Chinese electric vehicle maker reported 41,751 vehicle deliveries in Q4, above the consensus projection of 40,922.
The gross margin stood at 12% in the period, slightly below the analyst expectations of 12.6%.
For the first quarter, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) expects revenue in the range of 7.2 billion yuan to 7.3 billion yuan, missing the consensus estimates of 7.59 billion yuan. The company expects vehicle deliveries in the range of 33,500 to 34,000 units, short of the 38,310 consensus.
Fueled by our strong vehicle models on the market, planned new launches based on new platforms, and technology leadership, we are confident in our continued growth trajectory and structural improvement of gross margin.
Three Wall Street analysts have reflected on the company and XPEV shares following earnings.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Nick Lai (Overweight, $42):""XPeng's 4Q21 result today was a mixed bag where GPM missed on weaker sales mix but OP/ bottom line beat thanks to lower-than-expected opex. Managements tone on the analyst call was cautiously optimistic considering the company's recent price hikes (to mitigate input cost increase) and new model launches this year. We believe XPeng's stock performance will be stronger in 2H22 as we project margin to expand from 1H22 while sales volume also benefits from easing supply constraint, new capacity and new model.""
Citis Jeff Chung (Buy, $92): ""Our positive view towards its business outlook is based on: 1) our expectation that the company will gain market share in the BEV sector, given its superior NEDC range compared with peers, its leading autonomous driving technology and its quicker product launch pace (enabled by its two flexible EV platforms and a two-pronged manufacturing approach); 2) expectation of a sharp volume growth translating to greater economies of scale; and 3) all this along with battery cost reduction materially driving up margins. The company should also benefit from China's newly-launched NEV subsidy.""
BofAs Ming Hsun Lee (Buy, $50 down from $61): ""Considering price hike, we lower 2022E sales by 2% and lower target EV/sales to 5.5x (was 6.6x, in line with XPengs historical average). Our new PO is USD50/HKD194 (was USD61/HKD236). We reiterate Buy on XPeng given its robust model pipeline and leading capability in AD to win share in China EV industry.""

By Alun John and Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) -The London Metal Exchange board will see what lessons can be learned from this month's chaotic nickel trading, the chief executive of its parent company Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said on Tuesday. 
The LME suspended activity and cancelled nickel trades earlier this month due to volatility that saw prices double to more than $100,000 a tonne within hours. A spate of technical glitches after trading resumed left traders fuming. 
""In terms of the way forward of course, the LME board is responsible for understanding the full impact on the market, and what actions can be taken,"" said HKEX CEO Nicolas Aguzin, speaking to media after an HKEX investor day. 
""I'm sure the board of the LME will take the necessary steps to evaluate what are the lessons learned and how we can continue improving the market structure of the commodities market.""
HKEX acquired the LME in 2012, and Aguzin is an LME board member. 
Earlier in the day, Aguzin re-emphasised that HKEX's strategy is to focus its attention on connecting Chinese and global capital markets, and said the bourse was working on a series of initiatives to enhance the vibrancy of its markets. 
These included a new digital trading exchange named Diamond to facilitate 24 hour-a-day trading of assets benefitting from ""mega trends"" such as environmental, social, and governance concerns, though the bourse gave few specifics about the plan. 
HKEX has seen a decline in trading volumes so far this year, with an average daily turnover of HK$130.4 billion ($16.7 billion) in February compared to HK$233.9 billion a year earlier.
Aguzin attributed this, and a slowdown in IPO volumes, to a combination of China-U.S. tensions exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tightening regulatory environment for tech and platform companies, and persistent inflation concerns. 
He also acknowledged that the number of people leaving Hong Kong was affecting financial markets in the city. 
""We're seeing limited inflows of talent and an increasing number of individuals leaving the city, which has resulted in a talent war in the financial industry,"" he said. 
He added that Hong Kong had shown its resilience in the past, and that China's expanding capital markets offered a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity. 
Hong Kong has recently begun easing stringent anti-COVID measures, which business lobby groups warned were undermining the business environment in the financial hub and causing an exodus of professionals. 

Restrictions on daily life and quarantine for inbound travellers remain in place, however.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shares in  Barclays  (LON:BARC) fell as much as 6% in early trading on Tuesday, after one of its top investors offloaded a $1.2 billion chunk of stock in the lender at a discount overnight.
An unnamed investor sold 599 million shares on Monday evening, facilitated by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The shares are roughly equivalent to a 3.6% stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The sale deals a further blow to Barclays just a day after it disclosed a compliance blunder leading to an estimated 450 million pound ($589 million) loss for overselling structured products in the United States.
Barclays shares were last down 3.3% at 115.22 pence at 1004 GMT on Tuesday, after tumbling 4% on Monday.
Capital Group offloaded 399 million shares on Monday, according to Eikon data, but it was unclear whether the sale was connected to the transaction managed by Goldman Sachs.
Capital Group is one of the world's largest investment firms, and parent to the American Funds brand that is popular among millions of U.S. investors and retirement savers.
Capital Group declined to comment.
Other top Barclays shareholders with around a 3% stake in the lender include the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), according to Eikon data. 
Blackrock declined to comment when approached by Reuters on Monday, while QIA was not immediately available for comment.
QIA last week offloaded 1.2% of miner and commodity trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) for about $1.04 billion.
The Barclays sale was priced at 150 pence on Tuesday, towards the top of the target range of 147.50 pence to 150.75 pence, but this still represented a discount greater than 6% to Monday's closing price, pressuring the share price.
The sale was slightly bigger than the 575 million shares outlined on Monday evening, netting the seller 899 million pounds ($1.18 billion), a person involved in the deal told Reuters, adding the book was multiple times oversubscribed.
Barclays said on Monday it would have to delay a planned 1 billion pound share buyback because of the structured products loss, which it will have to incur as a result of buying back the securities in question at their original purchase price. 

The regulatory blunder is an early test for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the newly-appointed chief executive of Barclays, whose previous roles included heading the bank's global markets and risk operations.

The restaurant & entertainment company reported a fourth-quarter EPS of 52c, compared to the loss per share of $1.19 in the year-ago period and consensus estimates EPS of 61c.
Revenue came in at $343.1 million in the quarter, up from $116.8 million in the year-ago quarter and missing the analyst consensus of $364.6 million. The companys Q4 EBITDA stood at $80.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87.7 million.
Food and beverage revenue was reported at $120.1 million, up from $40.2 million YoY and below the consensus projection of $132.3 million. Amusement and other revenue totaled $223 million in the period, up from $76.6 million in the year-ago quarter and short of the consensus estimates of $235.1 million.
Cost of products was reported at 16%, compared to 17.3% in the year-ago quarter and analyst expectations of 16.7%. Dave & Busters reported a total location count of 142 in the period, down 0.7% QoQ and slightly below the consensus estimates of 144.
The results showed that Q4 comparable store sales were down 2.6% compared to the same quarter in 2019, excluding 14 stores based in areas that had vaccine mandates during the quarter. Total comparable store sales declined 6.8% YoY.
The company saw its comparable sales rise by 5.4% YoY during the first eight weeks of the current Q1, while walk-in comparable store sales are up 9.1% during the same period. Special Event store sales plunged 42% during the first eight weeks from the same period last year.
Truist analyst Jake Bartlett sees a buying opportunity in PLAY shares following the pullback in pre-market trading.
""We view the pull-back in PLAY's stock following 4Q21 results (-8% after hours), as a strong buying opportunity. PLAY's 4Q21 sales missed sharply, due to an outsized impact of Omicron (special events weakness and likely pressure on staffing), but SSS have accelerated since (+5.4% QTD vs. pre-COVID vs. -6.8% in 4Q21). Additionally, 4Q21 store-level margins were stronger than expected, despite the revenue miss, suggesting that cost savings found during COVID are sustainable and highlighting PLAY's relatively low exposure to operating cost inflation,"" Bartlett said in a client note.
Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull reflected more negatively on the Hold-rated PLAY after a disappointing earnings report.
""PLAY reported disappointing sales ($343M vs. Street $365M) and earnings ($0.52, Street $0.61). We believe the sell-side comp mean is less indicative of what was embedded in revenue estimates because it appears many estimates used an average weekly sales base (i.e., 4Q20) that was too high,"" O'Cull wrote in a report.

1565,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 07:18AM ET</span>","Tesla, Amazon Stock Splits Trigger Retail Stampede","(Bloomberg) -- Recent proposals from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. tell us one thing: Stock splits can spark big rallies as retail traders pile in.
Tesla surged 8% Monday, adding about $84 billion in value, after saying it’s planning a second stock split in less than two years. Amazon jumped more than 5% the day after announcing a 20-for-1 split this month and the stock has been on a tear ever since.
In theory, this shouldn’t happen. A split doesn’t affect a company’s business fundamentals, and investors averse to a stock’s high price tag can simply buy fractional shares instead. Yet splits are causing day traders to pile in, fueling rallies in these companies’ shares.
Tesla was by far the most-purchased stock among Fidelity customers on Monday, according to data from the brokerage firm. Amazon’s announcement attracted “significant” retail interest and was likely the biggest factor in the stock’s outperformance during a week when the Nasdaq 100 fell almost 4%, according to Vanda Research.
“It is just a sentiment effect,” said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Retail investors perceive price differently -- and the stock is now attainable at a lower price.” 
There may be other reasons for a company like Tesla to consider increasing its outstanding shares.
“The split can make the stock look more attractive, luring new buyers into the stock to help keep the recent momentum,” said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally Invest Securities. “Perhaps this is Elon’s way of increasing retail ownership and reducing institutional ownership?”
Employee ownership and retaining human capital are more reasons. “A lower-priced stock makes it easier for employees with equity as part of their compensation to sell a more specific amount to satisfy tax liabilities and manage their personal wealth,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research said. “Once one company does it, they all have to do it since they are competing for similar talent.”
Prior to 2020, share splits had almost disappeared from U.S. stock markets with only two completed in the S&P 500 in 2019 compared with a total of 41 in 2006 and 2007, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. But Apple Inc. and Tesla helped revive the practice after splitting their stocks in 2020, with more joining the pack this year. 
In 2020, Tesla Inc.’s shares surged more than 60% from the day of the announcement to the execution date, while Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose about 30% in a similar time frame. Weekly retail purchases surged to just shy of $1 billion of Apple shares in the period leading up to its actual split, from about $150 million prior to the news, according to Vanda.
Tech Chart of the Day
The Nasdaq 100 Index’s 13% rally over the past two weeks has been far from a straightforward ride for investors. After gaining for four straight sessions following its lowest close in nearly a year, the tech-heavy benchmark has alternated between gains and losses for six straight sessions. While the current run of choppy trading is the longest since June 2021, the gauge has managed to recoup the prior day’s losses and then some following each dip.

Jiangxi Fangda Steel Group Co Ltd has submitted an application and deposit to the Henan Zhongyuan Property Rights Exchange, as part of its offer of at least 11 billion yuan ($1.73 billion) for the 80% stake, according to the Henan exchange and a statement by Anyang Iron and Steel Co Ltd.
Anyang Group, the top steelmaker in China's central Henan province with annual steel capacity of 10 million tonnes, has been planning ownership reform after China called for further consolidation of its mammoth ferrous sector. 
It signed a letter of intent with Jiangsu-based private steelmaker Shagang Group in May 2021, before the local government decided on a public listing of its 80% stake last November.
Jiangxi Fangda, which also owns Shanghai-listed Fangda Special Steel, has capacity to make around 20 million tonnes of steel products per year. 
The result of the stake transfer in Anyang Group is pending further negotiation and could lead to changes in the listed Anyang Iron and Steel's ownership, the filing said. 

China had pledged to speed up mergers and acquisitions in the steel sector and expects its top 10 steel producers to account for 60% of the country's total steel output, up from 37% in end-2020.

Raj Subramaniam, who currently serves as the company's President and COO, will succeed Smith as the new CEO.
Smith founded FedEx in 1973 when the company started delivering documents and smaller packages to compete with the post office. Since then, FedEx saw rapid growth and became one of the largest delivery companies in the world, providing both ground and air service. Smith pioneered overnight operations in April 1973 that paved the way for the delivery of freight anywhere.
""FedEx has changed the world by connecting people and possibilities for the last 50 years,"" said Smith.
He added he plans to focus more on global challenges such as innovation, sustainability, and public policy.
Subramaniam joined FedEx 30 years ago and initially served in the company's marketing and management operations across the U.S. and Asia. He was later promoted to Chief Marketing and Communications Officer and the top executive of FedEx Express. In 2019, he became the company's President and COO and joined its board just a year later.
For BofA analyst Ken Hoexter, this marks a historic shift given Smiths importance to the delivery industry.
""Given Mr. Smith's historic focus on growth, we believe investors will view the transition positively, as Mr. Subramaniam has focused on ways to integrate FedExs Express, Ground, and Freight segments in ways it had not tried before. As president & COO (the company's 2nd ever COO, and heir apparent since Feb. 2019), he shifted the operating principals of FedEx to compete collectively, operate collaboratively, and innovate digitally, from compete collectively, operate independently, and manage collaboratively,"" Hoexter said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker isn't surprised by the announcement.
""The initial thought the market will likely have (in our view) is whether this transition will mean any fundamental changes in FDXs operating strategy going forward. We doubt it. Mr. Subramaniam has been at FDX for a long time and has been a key player, if not a co-architect, of the current strategy and we do not see a high probability of a sudden and dramatic pivot in strategy (like combining Express and Ground as thought by some investors, for example) any time soon,"" Shanker wrote in a client note.
FedEx is set to host its first investor day in 10 years on June 28-29, just a few days after it releases F4Q results on June 23.
Shanker sees the upcoming event as a very important catalyst for both the company and FDX investors as it offers an opportunity to reset the narrative though the bar is both very low and very high at the same time.
""The succession plan was a key focus topic for the event but that is now out of the way with the twin announcements. We now wait to see what other big announcements lie in store for us at the event. Whether FDX is a $150, $225 or $300 stock in the next 12 months will come down to whether the market believes normalized EPS is $15, $20 or $25, which should become evident at the analyst day,"" Shanker added.

Investing.com – Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock traded 2.3% lower in premarket Tuesday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts downgraded it to ‘equal-weight’ with a target of $30, citing multiple headwinds as reasons for their pessimism.  
The target price is over 43% lower than the previous one. The stock closed at $26.45 Monday, up 3.8%, but is down nearly 62% in the last year.  
The analysts admitted they overestimated the company’s ability to innovate and improve its user offerings rapidly. The pace of innovation is slower than they initially expected as advertising, user, and engagement trends remain challenging, StreetInsider said quoting the analysts’ report.
The analysts continue to see US time spent per user decline from1% to 19% year-over-year over the past four quarters and believe the platform’s total US user minutes have deteriorated to 2017 levels.
In addition, analyst Brian Nowak sees further uncertainties related to the shift toward lower-monetizing creator economy video offerings like those on Facebook’s Reels and YouTube’s Shorts.
While Pinterest came out flying in the fourth quarter, brushing aside concerns over the impact on its business due to changes in Apple’s privacy rules, the company last month said the new provisions could still come to weigh on it in the future.
To counter that, the company is investing more in technology and focusing on scaling up video features like Pinterest TV and Idea Pins. It’s also boosting influencer marketing, a space dominated by YouTube, Instagram and TikTok."

Sumitomo Metal, which supplies cathode materials for the Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) EVs, said demand for nickel used in rechargeable batteries will climb to more than 410,000 tonnes in 2022 from nearly 330,000 tonnes in 2021.
Nickel is mainly used in stainless steelmaking, but is also a vital ingredient for the lithium-ion batteries used to power EVs, where demand is set to accelerate over coming years.
""Nickel demand for EVs is growing much faster than we had expected a year ago,"" Yusuke Niwa, general manager of Sumitomo Metal's nickel sales and raw materials department, told reporters.
But higher nickel prices may erode demand in the long term as companies will work to use less nickel or develop nickel-less batteries, he said. 
Sumitomo Metal also predicted that the global nickel market deficit will narrow to 68,000 tonnes this year from 135,000 tonnes in 2021 as output of nickel pig iron (NPI) in Indonesia is expected to grow to more than 1 million tonnes.

Global demand for nickel is seen increasing by 8.4% in 2022 to 2.999 million tonnes, while supply is expected to climb by 11.4% to 2.931 million tonnes.
Japan's nickel demand is projected to rise 0.2% to 170,400 tonnes, while supply is forecast to increase 1.6% to 168,800 tonnes.

Our hypothesis is on years following strong market up moves, individuals are more likely to sell equities in advance of the mid-April payment date The 2020 COVID period was a clear outlier.

The strategist is also cautious on cryptocurrencies.
Performance of crypto markets going into the US tax season will be interesting. Increased adoption and regulatory awareness has also increased scrutiny.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Avolon says bruised jet lessors in no hurry to return to Russia,"(Adds dropped word, paragraph 5)
By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Russian airlines could be frozen out of the aircraft leasing market well beyond the Ukraine conflict, one of the industry's biggest players warned on Tuesday, blaming what executives have described as a default involving hundreds of Western jets.
Global leasing companies had until Monday to sever ties with Russian carriers under Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but executives say only a fraction of the more than 400 jets directly involved have been returned.
Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Dublin-based Avolon, the world's second-largest leasing firm, told Reuters its own risk is limited, with a net exposure of below $200 million on 10 jets still blocked in Russia after it recovered four aircraft.
But the mainly Ireland-based leasing sector, which accounts for about half of the world's airline fleet, will be in no hurry to reset relations with Russian airlines even if sanctions against Moscow are lifted, he predicted.
""From an Avolon perspective it is not material; from a sector perspective it is a problem, unquestionably,"" Slattery added.
""In terms of future appetite in a post-war scenario for further business in Russia, I think all players in our sector will think long and hard about the risks of that jurisdiction and the appetite for going back in,"" he said in an interview.
Moscow earlier this month introduced a law allowing airlines to re-register leased planes locally in a move widely seen as encouraging airlines to hold onto planes and avoid a collapse of Russia's airline sector, which relies heavily on leasing.
Until now, aircraft leased to Russia have been registered in Bermuda or Ireland under an agreement designed to provide security to leasing firms already worried about the willingness of Russian courts to uphold the rights of foreign lessors.
Avolon, controlled by Bohai Leasing, a majority-owned subsidiary of China's HNA Group, has a gross exposure of just under $400 million to Russia, Slattery said.
After deducting the value of four jets that have been recovered, as well as security and letters of credit that have been drawn down, Avolon's net exposure is below $200 million.
""Given our scale that puts it in the realm of a headache rather than a migraine,"" Slattery said.
""We believe our aircraft are all appropriately insured..., all the leases are terminated and we will continue to try to get them back,"" he added.

Russia's airline industry, the world's 11th largest, had 980 aircraft in its fleet on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, of which 777 were leased rather than owned by the carriers. 
Of these, 515 were leased from foreign firms and about 400 of those - worth up to $10 billion - were most immediately at risk from the crisis, according to aviation data firm Cirium.

Levy projects that Tesla will deliver 307k electric vehicle (EV) units in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the consensus of 313k. Tesla delivered 308k units in Q421.
Decomposing 1Q deliveries, Jan/Feb combined deliveries was likely ~130k units; for context, Jan/Feb is below the prior first-two-months record of ~138k in Oct/Nov. Assuming Jan/Feb sales of ~130k, our expectation assumes March deliveries of ~177k units, which would represent the highest-ever final month of a quarter for Tesla (prior high of ~170k in Dec21), benefiting from the continued ramp of volume in China, Levy explained in a client note.
The analyst reiterated that deliveries estimates are almost completely dictated by supply while the recent COVID-19-related challenges in China are also likely to push the risk to the downside.
Given Tesla deliveries are typically heavily weighted toward the end of the quarter, it is certainly possible that Tesla's likely quarter-end wave will be somewhat limited by the rise of COVID (albeit, the shutdown is not nationwide, thus it's unclear how much the shutdown will impact deliveries).
Despite these challenges, Levy has reiterated his Outperform rating on Tesla as he believes the long-term case for Tesla is only stronger “amid rising oil prices, EV uptake is an increased priority, and with Tesla the global leader in EV, its long-term case is amplified.""
Tesla stock price is up a further 2.7% in pre-open Tuesday after closing 8% higher yesterday on the stock split announcement.

(Reuters) - The maker of Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru will keep prices unchanged for the next six months but won't rule out future price hikes given Britain's high inflation, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
A.G. Barr, the group behind the bright orange drink Irn-Bru, raised prices last month when inflation reached a 30-year high due to global supply chain problems and higher raw material costs. Many firms have passed the costs on to customers.
""We might have to increase further, but the current price levels should suffice for the next six months,"" A.G. Barr Chief Executive Roger White said in an interview.
""Price does have a role to play. I wouldn't discount the possibility, as we are seeing higher levels of inflation,"" White said about future increases. 
The group has been implementing cost-cutting measures including using cheaper packaging and moving production closer to retail shops, he said.
His remarks came after A.G. Barr, which also sells pre-mixed cocktails under its Funkin brand, reported an 18% jump in annual profit and said it would now resume paying dividends to shareholders, having paused them during the pandemic.
The company has benefited from greater at-home consumption of food and drink during the pandemic, but there has been a ""slight reversal"" in that trend as pubs and restaurants re-opened, White said.
In light of the crisis in Ukraine, A.G. Barr won't fulfil any orders by Moscow Brewing Company, its Russian franchisee, White said, although he added that it hasn't ended the contract.
Shares in A.G. Barr were up 2.4% as of 1056 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

A.G. Barr also said sales in the early weeks of the new financial year were well ahead of the prior year and in line with expectations.

Volkswagen aims to conduct the Porsche initial public offering (IPO) in the fourth quarter of 2022, though that may change if the conflict in Ukraine drags on, Porsche SE's finance chief said.
""We cannot rule out, if the conflict lasts a longer time, that this could have potential implications on the listing,"" Johannes Lattwein told a news conference, without elaborating on how it would affect plans.
No final decision has been made on the proposed IPO, the company said.
A framework agreement for the listing proposed by Volkswagen in February includes selling 25% plus 1 ordinary share in the carmaker to Porsche SE as well as listing up to 25% of Porsche AG's preferred stock.
Some 49% of the IPO proceeds would be paid out to Volkswagen's shareholders as a special dividend.
""Porsche SE thereby supports the plans of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) to expand its financial flexibility and accelerate the technological transformation of the group,"" Porsche SE said in a statement reporting its annual results.
""Due to the leading positioning of Porsche AG in the sport and luxury segment, this attractive investment would diversify our portfolio and our dividend inflows,"" Lattwein said.
Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which is controlled by the Porsche and Piech families and holds a 31.4% equity stake in Volkswagen, has no plans to reduce its stake in the German carmaker, Poetsch said.
The IPO would also not impact the composition of the Volkswagen supervisory board.

Porsche SE reported a 2021 group result after tax of 4.6 billion euros ($5.06 billion). It forecast group results after tax in 2022 at between 4.1 billion and 6.1 billion euros, not including the impact of the possible Porsche IPO.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The copper market has solid fundamentals despite current market volatility and will maintain high prices for at least the next 12 months, Ivan Arriagada, CEO of Chile's  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO), forecast. 
In an interview with Reuters during the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago, Arriagada also said the company is still looking to develop its Twin Metals project despite the Biden administration's refusal to renew its licenses.
And although the company is on the lookout, it sees few options for copper deals on the market.
When it comes to copper prices, Arriagada said he based his forecast on the key role that copper plays in energy transition, especially with electric cars.
""In the short term, in the next 12 months, the important thing is that we have a market with solid fundamentals,"" Arriagada said. ""There is a context of relative tightness due to supply chain conditions, inflation, and all that means we expect prices to remain at levels that they have been at recently, which are good prices."" 
However, he said the world economy is entering a phase of lower growth in the midst of the Ukraine conflict and that will have to be considered going forward, particularly in 2023.
The company maintains its goal of producing 660,000-690,000 tonnes this year. This factors in the impact of a drought at its flagship Los Pelambres mine, which the company plans to offset with a desalination plant in the second half of the year.
Arriagada reiterated Antofagasta's intention to reach a production level of 900,000 tonnes by 2026, citing the company's deposits.
""We have the mining resources to sustain that projection and a plan that contemplates making those investments, if the conditions exist and we obtain the permits,"" he said.
The Antofagasta board of directors must decide whether to go ahead with a plan for a new concentrator at its Centinela mine by the end of the year during a time of political uncertainty due to a new leftist government and the drafting of a new constitution.
We hope to have ""a horizon of certainty regarding the prevailing conditions to make that investment and we therefore hope that by that time the processes that are under way will be at a degree of progress"" to decide, Arriagada added.
Additionally, a plan for a mining royalty to raise revenue for social programs is currently under way in Chile's Congress.
""In tax decisions, a balance between contribution through taxes and industry competitiveness should be maintained and we think that's something extremely important that should be weighed,"" he said.
TWIN METALS
Antofagasta suffered a setback in its Twin Metals project in the United States after the renewal of two federal licenses was suspended. Arriagada said the suspensions affected a significant part of the company's mining operations, but do not affect the rest of the company's licenses.
""We are evaluating the best action, from the legal standpoint, to reverse these decisions, which seem to us to be administrative and clearly arbitrary,"" Arriagada said.
""I hope that over the course of the next six months we'll have clarity on the best legal path to take in regard to recovering these licenses,"" he added.
The company expects to be able to implement the project by the end of the decade.
On the other hand, Arriagada said the company remains open to any attractive acquisition opportunities to increase its portfolio, but he admitted they are ""very limited.""

Arriagada noted that neighboring Peru remains a point of interest despite ongoing political turmoil and other local challenges.
""We have a team working there looking for exploration targets that could be interesting and we have a preference for that region (Americas), including Peru, and we look at our projects with a long-term perspective,"" Arriagada said.

Investing.com – FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock traded 2.6% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company said its President and Chief Operating Officer, Raj Subramaniam, will take over as President and Chief Executive Officer with effect from June 1.
Subramaniam will replace Frederick W. Smith who will now be the company’s Executive Chairman.
Prior to his current role, Subramaniam was President and CEO of FedEx Express, the world’s largest express transportation company. Subramaniam, who joined the company in 1991, is being named CEO-elect effective immediately.  
Smith founded the company in 1971 when he bought controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation Sales to give birth to a concept paper he had written at Yale University in 1965 on airfreight shippers and their challenges. FedEx was officially born two years later.  
While FedEx rode the COVID-19-led boom for quick deliveries as customers shopped for everything online, its overall growth trajectory has trailed rival UPS last few years. That was reflected in the stock prices. FedEx is down 18% in the last year while UPS (NYSE:UPS) is up almost 31% in the same period. S&P is up over 15%.
There wasn’t a clamor for Smith stepping down though, and the succession was planned, only delayed by the pandemic.

The company was forced to suspend output at its Bergara mill, in the Basque Country, on March 16 and at its Legasa and Lesaka mills, in Navarra, on March 26 as a result of the strike, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Parts of the mills in Gijon and Aviles, in Asturias, were closed for lack of supplies, he added.
The other plants located in Zaragoza, Bilbao and Sagunto, near Valencia, were operating on Tuesday but reported a lack of raw materials and semi-processed products from the idled plants.
The strike is another blow to an energy-intensive industry that was already hit by high electricity costs that have surged in tandem with gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

ArcelorMittal had already halted output during hours of peak demand, when power prices spike, at its electric-powered steel mills in Spain to curb costs, which it cannot fully pass on to customers.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), India's top-selling electric carmaker, said the cost of battery cells had increased by around 20% because of a global surge in raw material prices, mainly lithium, putting pressure on the company in the short-term. 
Shailesh Chandra, managing director of the passenger vehicles and electric mobility subsidiaries, told Reuters that cell prices have been rising over months and he expects them to remain high for about a year.
""Immediate impact seems to be about a 20% kind of an increase which will have short-term pressure. This should moderate within a year and then start coming down,"" he said.
Chandra did not comment on whether this would affect the company's sales or profitability but said that demand for ""green personal mobility"" was rising sharply and he expected to offset some of the costs by increasing the use of locally sourced components in its cars.
Automakers globally are facing inflationary pressures due to surging costs of nickel, cobalt and lithium that are used in making batteries - the most expensive part of an electric vehicle (EV) - as demand outstrips supply. 
This has been made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say it threatens to slow the trend of falling battery prices which could hamper the broader adoption of EVs, especially in price-sensitive markets like India.
In India's nascent EV market, electric cars make up only 1% of total car sales. High battery prices and an insufficient charging network are the main reasons why there are few takers, and why more carmakers are yet to launch electric models.
Spot prices for lithium carbonate, which is typically used to make lithium-ion batteries, surged to over $70,000 per tonne in March 2022 from about $10,000 a year earlier, according to data from industry forecaster Benchmark Market Intelligence.
""Going forward this inflationary impact is expected to continue,"" said Manish Dua, senior analyst at Benchmark. 
Tata recently raised the price of its Nexon electric SUV in India by over $300 - a 2% rise for the base model, following similar moves globally by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and China's BYD.
Even so, Tata, which has over 90% share of India's electric car market, expects sales of its electric cars to grow over four-fold this fiscal year from 4,200 units last year.
The EV maker sources lithium-ion batteries for its cars from Tata AutoComp Systems, which has a joint venture with China's Guoxuan Hi-Tech to produce them locally. 
Chandra said as battery recycling gains pace there will be access to raw materials beyond mines and that will offset some of the cost pressures. 

""Short term spikes will happen. It is good to focus on the secular long term trend which will keep going down,"" he said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and a Chinese-backed consortium risk losing their mining licences if they fail to meet a tight construction timeline for the Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea, the West African country has said. 
Guinea's government has grown increasingly impatient with the mining firms that control the giant Simandou deposit which has not been developed since Rio was first granted an exploration licence for it 25 years ago.
The ruling junta signed an agreement on Saturday with Rio Tinto and Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) under which the firms will collaborate on a 670-kilometre (416 mile) railway and a port to get Simandou's high-grade ore to market.
""The framework agreement gives Guinea a very precise calendar with significant penalties up to and including the withdrawal of the mining licence, for any mining company that does not respect its commitments,"" Guinea's presidency said in a video statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday night.
The threat to withdraw the licences has not previously been reported. Rio Tinto declined to comment on the penalties and WCS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Guinea's mines minister has said the railway and port infrastructure must be completed by the end of 2024, and commercial production must start by March 31 2025, a timeline analysts say is ambitious for a project with significant environmental and social impacts to navigate.
""The worry for investors is that this ultimatum may incentivise the developers to cut corners,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
Rio Tinto's chief executive of copper, Bold Baatar, has said the framework sets out how the project will be built to international Environmental, Social, and Governance standards. Rio Tinto declined to provide details.

Rio Tinto owns a 45.05% stake in the southern half, Blocks 3 and 4, of Simandou, with Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) holding 39.95% and Guinea's government the remaining 15%. SMB-Winning - the consortium behind WCS - won a government tender in November 2019 for Blocks 1 and 2.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are meeting in Istanbul for face-to-face talks, the first direct talks between the two sides in more than two weeks, with the conflict now in its second month.
The war has exacted a heavy toll with a total 2,975 civilian casualties recorded since the conflict began, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Still, despite the stock market gains, there appears little hope of a breakthrough, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty while Russia continues to make territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014.
The United States and its allies plan to up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by levying new sanctions on more sectors of Russia's economy that are critical to sustaining its invasion of Ukraine, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Tuesday.
The existing sanctions are not only having an impact on the Russian economy, as the forward-looking GfK German consumer climate index fell to -15.5 for April, down from a revised -8.5 the previous month, as the war in Ukraine and rising commodity prices weighed on sentiment.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 03:20AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Trade-offs,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
It's not just the costs of producing goods that's going up, the price that must be paid to transport them shows no sign of easing -- shipping a 40-foot container unit by sea costs double what it did a year ago and remains six times above pre-pandemic levels, the Freightos FBX index shows. 
This will add 1.5 percentage points to 2022 inflation, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warns that consumers will feel the full brunt of price increases only after 12 months. 
This causes ""complicated trade-offs"" for central bankers, the IMF says. 
Or maybe not. Money markets are betting policymakers will opt to stomp inflation, even at the expense of economic growth. More than 200 basis points of U.S. rate rises are priced by end-2022, which if realised, would be the most in a calendar year since 1994,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) points out. 
In any case, the gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields seems well on the way to turning negative for the first time since 2019, narrowing below 6 bps on Tuesday. 
This is the so-called curve inversion that is considered a reliable predictor of recession. Yet, the Fed has signalled it's watching other curve segments which are still steep, giving it room to tighten policy further and faster.
The question is when do stock markets start to get seriously spooked? While two-year U.S. yields rose 165 bps this quarter and the 2-10 curve has snapped in some 70 bps, world stocks have recouped some gains recently and will end the quarter with only a small loss. 
On Tuesday, Wall Street equity futures are positive and European stocks are higher, following on from Asian gains led by a 1% rise in Tokyo. 
They likely have their eyes trained on ""real"" interest rates; stripping out inflation, 10-year yields remain deeply negative while ""real"" yield curves are so far sloping upwards. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-BOJ ramps up battle to defend yield cap
-German consumer sentiment lowest since Feb 2021
-ECB President Christine Lagarde, ECB bank supervisor Elizabeth McCaul, ECB board member Peter Kazimir
-New York Fed president John Williams, Philadelphia Fed president Harker
-U.S. monthly house price index, JOLTS job openings, consumer confidence
-U.S. 7-year note auction

-Chile to raise interest rates by 200 bps to 7.5%

The Chinese coastal city, home to some of the world's busiest sea and airports, began locking down half of the city on Monday and intends to do the same to the other half for four days starting Friday in a two-stage testing exercise.
While it has kept its airports and deepwater port open, it has imposed stringent movement curbs, barring unapproved vehicles from streets and telling millions of people not to leave their homes. 
""Trucking service in and out (of) Shanghai will be severely impacted by 30% due to a full lockdown on Shanghai's Pudong and Puxi areas in turn until 5th April,"" Maersk, the world's second-largest container shipping company, said in an advisory to clients on Monday.
It adding that warehouses in Shanghai would be closed until Friday. 
""Consequently, there will be longer delivery time and a possible rise in transport costs such as detour fee and highway fee.""
SEKO Logistics, a U.S.-based freight transport and warehousing company, said factories in the neighbouring province of Zhejiang were opting to move cargo out of Ningbo's port, rather than Shanghai.
""We are anticipating: a sharp increase in air freight rates from today. We have already received some sky-high offers for enquires to Europe so far today,"" it said on its website. 
China is battling its largest number of COVID-19 infections since the onset of since the country's initial outbreak receded in early 2020. This month it placed lockdowns on other manufacturing exports hubs such as Changchun and Shenzhen, which gave rise to lengthening queues outside major Chinese ports.

Although curbs in Changchun have remained in place, they have been relaxed in Shenzhen, where businesses and factories were allowed to resume operations on March 21. 
However, a survey conducted by a state newspaper found Shenzhen's ""war"" on COVID-19 has hurt up to 93% of local small and medium-sized companies, with many suffering production disruptions because of shutdowns, interruptions in supply chains, and delays in order executions.

Of the total sum, hydrogen investment platform Hy24 will inject 70 million euros through the Clean H2 Infra Fund, which it manages, and H2 Mobility's seven other existing shareholders will stump up 40 million euros.
Green hydrogen is in the spotlight in Europe, where European Union environment ministers want truck CO2 emissions cut by a third by 2030 from 2019 levels.
While battery powered vehicles have established a lead in the truck sector, fuel cell driven ones are expected in greater numbers in the long-haul segment in a fierce technology battle.
H2 Mobility's existing investors are industrial gases makers Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) and Linde (NYSE:LIN), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck and Hyundai Motor Co, utility OMV and oil companies Total and Shell (LON:RDSa).
H2 Mobility's managing director Nikolas Iwan said the money being raised will go into expanding the fuelling station network and gradually help it become profitable.
""We operate 92 stations, some can serve trucks already today, all can serve light commercial vehicles and passenger cars,"" he said.
""The next step is to create stations with more refuelling capacity to be ready for the expected ramp-up of intensive use vehicles, in particular trucks and buses, due to come from the auto manufacturers,"" he said.
Iwan said H2 Mobility aspired to break-even in 2026, once anchor customers bring more volume.

Hy24 is a joint venture between private equity firm Ardian and big energy, chemical and financial firms grouped in the FiveT Hydrogen investment platform.

1592,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 02:00AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Ukraine/Russia Peace Talks in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Tuesday ahead of the start of another round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey this week. 
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set later Tuesday to meet in Turkey for face-to-face talks, the first direct talks between the two sides in more than two weeks.
However, despite the stock market gains, there appears little hope of a breakthrough, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty while Russia continues to make territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and some eastern territories.
Ahead of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday urged Western nations to toughen sanctions quickly against Russia, including an oil embargo, something a number of European countries have been reluctant to impose given their reliance on Russian energy supplies.
U.S. and German government officials are set to meet later this week with energy industry executives to discuss ways to boost alternative supplies for Germany, the Eurozone’s largest economy which has been reliant on Russian oil and gas.
Looking at the European economic data slate, the GfK German consumer climate index fell to -15.5 for April, down from a revised -8.5 the previous month, as the war in Ukraine and rising commodity prices weigh on sentiment.
Later in the session, the Bank of England is set to publish its latest Quarterly Bulletin, which will be studied carefully as the U.K. central bank continues to increase interest rates.
In corporate news,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) will be in the spotlight after the French healthcare group raised its peak sales target for eczema-treatment product Dupixent to more than 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion).
Oil prices retreated Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s weakness on fears that a surge in Covid-19 cases in China will hit demand from the world’s top crude importer and ahead of the Ukraine/Russia peace talks.
The city of Shanghai, China’s financial hub, remains under a two-stage, nine-day lockdown to curb rising numbers of Covid cases.
Sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine have disrupted oil supplies from the world’s second largest crude exporter, sending prices to 14-year highs earlier this month.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>",UniCredit CEO's pay draws fresh criticism from investor advisers,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Leading investor advisory firms have again raised concerns over the salary of UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel, with one recommending for a second straight year shareholders vote against his pay.
Orcel, former head of investment banking at Swiss bank UBS, narrowly dodged an investor revolt last year over the remuneration package that made him one of Europe's best paid bank CEOs when he took the reins at UniCredit in April.
Leading proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis again took aim at his compensation ahead of an annual general meeting on April 8, but ISS stopped short of calling for investors to reject the bank's pay policy.
Orcel received 6.7 million euros ($7.4 million) from UniCredit in 2021, including 4.8 million euros in shares as a sign-on bonus unrelated to performance.
The banker, one of Europe's best known and highest paid dealmakers, had forfeited millions in deferred pay from UBS in joining.
His variable pay, equivalent to up to twice the 2.5 million euro fixed annual pay, is from 2022 linked to targets set under the 'UniCredit Unlocked' plan Orcel unveiled in December.
While acknowledging the ""significantly improved framework"" for Orcel's remuneration, ISS said the package remained ""concerning and of particular concern is the high cap to severance payments (15 million euros or six times the fixed pay).""
Glass Lewis went further, saying it did not believe ""the company's remuneration strategy, as currently constituted, is sufficiently aligned with shareholders' best interests.""
""As such, we do not believe that this proposal merits shareholder support"", it added in a report seen by Reuters.
Addressing Glass Lewis' criticism in a letter to shareholders, UniCredit said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the firm's stance.
Orcel's pay package passed with just 54% of votes last year and was rejected by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), UniCredit's leading investor and the world's largest asset manager. 
Orcel's pay is double that of previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, who had waived his severance payment on his arrival and voluntarily taken a 40% salary cut as he prepared to axe thousands of jobs. 
UniCredit told shareholders in the letter the CEO remuneration was broadly in line with that of its main competitor Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) while Mustier's self-imposed pay cut was not relevant, reflecting his ""personal considerations at the time."" 
Glass Lewis also said it was worried UniCredit had not paid sufficient heed to the dissent shareholders expressed last year.
""While the company indicated that it engaged with shareholders, we are concerned that it failed to specifically address the results of the 2021 annual general meeting,"" it said.
UniCredit said in its letter it had reached out to 55% of its investors.
""We have completely overhauled our remuneration approach during the year, incorporating all the output from the broad engagement round,"" it said. 

In addition to linking Orcel's variable pay to performance and fully disclosing the relevant mechanisms, UniCredit said it had subjected it to claw-back clauses.
Orcel's pay is also at the heart of a court case pitting the banker against Spanish giant Santander (MC:SAN). In December a Madrid court ordered Santander to pay 51.4 million euros for dropping an offer to make him CEO, a ruling which the bank has appealed. ($1 = 0.9114 euros)

""We can't just withhold life-saving cancer drugs from Russian patients. There is international consensus that medicines are exempt from sanctions,"" Schwan told Swiss newspaper TagesAnzeiger, adding that prices being fixed in Russian roubles meant the pharmaceutical giant was currently losing money on Russian sales.
The statement echoed other pharmaceutical giants, who have said they will supply essential medicines in Russia but halt some other activities in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Roche has 800 sales staff in Russia, he said.
Speaking about his upcoming exit from the board of big bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Schwan said he had already considered resigning a year ago but it had become opportune after a twin set of scandals hammered the bank last March.
The bank was now in ""good hands"" under new Chairman Axel Lehmann, the outgoing vice-chair said. 
Asked whether larger Swiss rival UBS or a foreign bank might take over Credit Suisse since its share price had been battered, Schwan said he hoped the bank would remain independent.
""It would be a huge loss for Switzerland if there were only one major Swiss bank. That's why it's important that CS stabilises its business, rebuilds trust and seizes its opportunities,"" he said.
He said he would be willing to take on another board role in the future.

""In principle, I think it is feasible to sit on the board of a bank alongside my job as CEO at Roche,"" he said. 
""The fact that I'm stepping down now doesn't mean that I don't think it's important for an active CEO to take on such a task. We need banks, they are like the oil in the gears. And for some things we need specifically Swiss banks.""

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 01:01AM ET</span>",Tesla adds to wave of megacap stock splits,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) -Tesla's announcement on Monday that it will seek shareholder approval to increase its share count in order to enable a stock split adds to a recent wave of megacap companies splitting their shares in a bid to attract more investors.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said in a filing it would hold a vote at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting to increase the number of authorized shares in order to enable a stock split.
A stock split by Tesla, which would have be approved by its board of directors, would be the electric car maker's second since 2020, and it would follow stock split announcements by other major U.S. companies in recent years.
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have recently announced upcoming share splits.
Companies split their shares to make their stock prices appear less expensive and appeal to more investors. However, splitting a stock does not affect its underlying fundamentals.
Still, BofA Global Research said in recent research note that stock splits ""historically are bullish"" for companies that enact them, with their shares marking an average returns of 25% one year later versus 9% for the market overall.
Tesla's stock surged 8% on Monday, adding over $100 billion to its stock market value.
Amazon has gained about 20% since March 9, when the ecommerce heavyweight announced a stock split that will take effect on June 6. That compares to a 7% gain in the Nasdaq during the same period. During that time, Wall Street has also seen a broad rebound in megacap growth stocks following losses earlier this year, as well as volatility related to rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Tesla was the most traded stock among Fidelity's online brokerage customers on Monday, with buy and sell orders almost evenly split, suggesting retail investors are cautious about the company.

Since joining the S&P 500 in December 2020, Tesla has been one of its most heavily weighted stocks, currently accounting for over 2% of the index. It has gained about 300% since announcing its first stock split in August 2020.
Other S&P 500 companies with nominally high share prices, which analysts say could hint at a future stock split announcement, include Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), up 0.1% on Monday at $1,558, as well as Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), trading near flat at about $2,247.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose for a third day on Monday, as a sharp climb in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) overshadowed weakness in energy and bank stocks, while Russia and Ukraine were poised to hold their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks. 
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc jumped 8.03% and was the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after saying it will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split, helping to lift the consumer discretionary index 2.67% as the best-performing sector on the session. 
The S&P energy index, off 2.56%, was the worst-performing sector on the session after oil prices tumbled on the heels of a lockdown in China's financial hub, Shanghai, to curb a jump in COVID-19 infections that sparked demand worries.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) lost 2.81% and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) fell 1.75%. 
Financials were also among the weaker sectors on the session, due in part to a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgrade on U.S. banks, which cited escalating risks and the likelihood that rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have already been priced in by the market. The S&P bank index shed 0.99%. 
The sell-off in the bond market resumed on Monday, with short-dated yields hitting their highest since 2019 and the yield curve as measured by the gap between five- and 30-year yields briefly inverted for the first time since early 2006, raising concerns the Federal Reserve's more aggressive monetary policy will dent economic growth and potentially cause a recession.
""Financials ... so a lot of people bought those or own those on the basis of these will do better in a higher rate environment so I’m not surprised to see the financials back off relative to what is going on in the bond market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""Of course commodity names have rallied so high and so hot that it is not surprising to see those names back off, that is kind of what led the market down, but I still think the news for most of these commodity companies will be very, very good.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.65 points, or 0.27%, to 34,955.89, the S&P 500 gained 32.46 points, or 0.71%, to 4,575.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 185.60 points, or 1.31%, to 14,354.90.
The S&P was able to rebound from declines earlier in the session, with the benchmark index falling as much as 0.6% at one point. 
Strong economic data and gains in beaten-down growth stocks have helped Wall Street's main indexes recover in recent days even as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues and a host of Federal Reserve policymakers have made hawkish comments about the path of interest rate hikes. 
Still, analysts noted that value stocks remain cheap relative to their growth counterparts.

Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia said their delegations would arrive in Turkey for peace talks that are expected to take place on Tuesday. A senior U.S. official said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to make compromises, with Ukrainian officials also playing down the chances of a major breakthrough at the talks. 
Poly soared 52.63% after HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) said it would buy the audio and video products maker for $1.7 billion in cash. Shares of HP declined 2.74%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.23 billion shares, compared with the 14.09 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 107 new lows.

(Reuters) - Liberty Strategic Capital, a Washington D.C.-based private equity fund founded by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has acquired a controlling stake in enterprise security firm Zimperium for $525 million, both told Reuters on Monday. 
The deal is Liberty Strategic Capital's first majority stake acquisition since its launch last year. It has also led late-stage funding rounds in cybersecurity firms BlueVoyant and Cybereason. 
SoftBank Corp, which has been an investor in Zimperium since 2017, will continue as a minority owner. 
Founded in 2010, Zimperium provides mobile security solutions for iOS, Android, and Chromebooks devices. It serves enterprises across industries, including financial services and healthcare, counting JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and the U.S. Department of Defense as its customers. 
The Dallas, Texas-headquartered firm has raised over $100 million in equity and debt financing from investors including Warburg Pincus, according to PitchBook data. The business has been growing during the pandemic, with its annual recurring revenue expanding 53% last year, the company said. 
""It's been a big tailwind for us because as workers are starting to work more from home, they're starting to do more of their work on mobile devices,"" said Shridhar Mittal, chief executive at Zimperium. 
Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive who served as Treasury Secretary during the Trump administration, will chair Zimperium's board of directors. 

Mnuchin raised $2.5 billion for Liberty Strategic Capital last year and focuses on investment opportunities in the cybersecurity, payment as well as media space. 
He said he did not invest in former President Donald Trump's new media venture Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), but signed up for the wait list for the Truth Social app it launched in beta version last month. TMTG is still in the process of going public through merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp since the deal was announced in October.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Tuesday morning, with investor sentiment improving thanks to a rally in U.S. equities, falling oil prices, and more cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine that will start later in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.59% by 10:31 PM ET (2:31 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.31%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.79% after retail sales rose 1.8% month-on-month in February. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is to hand down its annual budget later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.32%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.08% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.84%.
U.S. shares wavered, but technology firms helped the S&P 500 to rally for a third day. Oil continued its fall, as the latest lockdowns in China to curb the rising number of COVID-19 impacts on fuel demand. U.S. Treasuries were mixed, with the two-year yield resuming an upward trend on bets that the Federal Reserve will aggressively hike interest rates.
The dollar gave up some gains, and the Japanese yen was near a six-year low against the U.S. currency due to the disparity in their central banks’ monetary policies. While the Fed maintains a hawkish stance, the Bank of Japan is set to continue with a more dovish tone and looks to continue an unprecedented bond-market intervention.
Fed policymakers, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, and New York Fed President John Williams will speak on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
On the data front, the U.S. will release its GDP on Wednesday and the latest jobs report two days later. China will also release its manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) on Thursday, followed by the Caixin manufacturing PMI a day later.
Global shares have pulled up around 8% from the lows hit after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, in comparison with a bond rout and inverting yield curves. Investors are weighing the invasion, sharing commodity prices, and the tighter Fed monetary policy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -World stock markets cast aside fears of rising interest rates on Monday with the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq index rallying 1.3%, even as parts of the Treasury yield curve signaled recession risks while oil prices tumbled on fears of weaker Chinese demand.
After a choppy session where stocks oscillated between gains and losses, U.S. shares finally broke higher, with electric car marker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surging almost 8% on news that it will seek investor approval for a stock split.
But the buoyancy in stocks was foreshadowed by several signs and analyst warnings that it may not last, as global interest rates will likely climb higher this year and could drag on economic growth.
In the Treasuries market, for example, the yield curve for two- and 10-year Treasuries presaged growing recession risks on Monday, even though the curve for three-month bills and 10-year Treasuries still pointed to robust economic expansion.

The tide of rising global yields led Japan's central bank to declare on Monday a steadfast attempt to defend its 0.25% yield cap, vowing to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds for the first four days of the week. 
The announcement sent the yen reeling to a six-year low at one point. Unlike other major economies that are battling surging price pressures, inflation in Japan remains well below its 2% target.
By early evening, MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.39%.
The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.31%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.27% and the S&P 500 climbed 0.71%.
A lockdown in China's financial hub of Shanghai to contain surging COVID-19 cases, on the other hand, weighed on Chinese shares and dragged on oil prices, as investors anticipated weaker demand from the world's No 2 economy.
U.S. crude fell a whopping 9.14% to $103.49 per barrel and Brent skidded 9.1% to $109.70. [O/R]
In the currency market, the Japanese yen shed 1.4% versus the dollar to 123.87 per dollar, after skidding as much as 2.5% at one point to notch its biggest one-day drop since March 2020.
Japan should intervene in the currency market or raise rates to defend the yen if it weakens beyond 130 to the dollar, the country's former top currency diplomat, Eisuke Sakakibara, said.
TECH STOCK RALLY COULD STALL
With some investors betting that U.S. rates could rise by 50 basis points in April, analysts warned that stocks could succumb to deeper losses in coming months.
""One of the more confounding developments during the past two weeks has been the strength of the rebound in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index at the same time interest rates soared to cycle highs,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of the global investment office at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management.
""As this and other yield curves head toward inversion, the nascent rebound in megacap tech stocks may stall."" 
Indeed, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, as measured by the gap between five and 30-year yields, inverted on Monday for the first time since early 2006, as a sell-off in the bond market resumed, with short-dated yields jumping to their highest since 2019.
Fixed-income analysts said the inverted yield curve indicated that some investors believe the Fed's policy tightening will put the brakes on economic growth. [US/]
The two-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.334%, from 2.299%, while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields retreated to 2.459%, after initially pushing above the 2.5%-marker for the first time since 2019 [US/].
Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth management firm Prime Partners, said portfolio rebalancing ahead of quarter-end helped explained strength in equities in the face of surging bond yields.
""A day of reckoning is coming because at the start of April you have earnings season and you will get a sense of the impact of rising energy prices and guidance for the future,"" he said
""I would not bet on the rally continuing in a straight line,"" Savary added.
Euro zone bonds continued their move into positive-yield territory, while money market pricing suggested investors were now anticipating 60 bps worth of rate hikes from the European Central Bank by year-end compared with 50 bps last week. 

British 10-year bond yields hit their highest levels in six years, Swiss 10-year yields and Australian three-year bond yields rose to their highest levels since 2014.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Monday dismissed long-running litigation accusing seven U.S. stock exchanges of defrauding ordinary investors by quietly allowing high-frequency traders to trade faster and at better prices.
Exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets were accused of providing high-frequency trading firms with enhanced data feeds and faster order processing, and letting them locate their servers near the exchanges' own so trading signals would be sent faster.
But in a 46-page decision, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said investors in the proposed class action could not prove they suffered harm because of the exchanges' actions, which they said violated federal securities law.
The judge said reports from the plaintiffs' expert witness, a former high-frequency trader who now consults on market structure, were ""not based on reliable methodology,"" and did not track the trading firms' use of the specialized services.
Because those reports were inadmissible, ""it follows that plaintiffs have adduced no admissible evidence that their own trades were harmed by the exchanges' challenged conduct,"" depriving them of legal standing to sue, Furman wrote.
The investors were led by the city of Providence, Rhode Island and several pension plans, including for the city of Boston. Their lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
High-frequency traders use computer algorithms to gain split-second trading advantages.
They were the subject of Michael Lewis' best-seller ""Flash Boys,"" published in March 2014. The lawsuit began the next month.
The NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc said they were pleased with the decision. Neither the other defendants nor their lawyers provided comments. BATS is now part of CBOE Global Markets Inc.

Furman had also dismissed the investors' claims in 2015, finding the exchanges absolutely immune from liability under federal law, but an appeals court overturned that finding two years later.
The case is City of Providence, Rhode Island et al v BATS Global Markets Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-02811.

The Chamber, along with the Computer and Communications Industry Association and Business Roundtable, argued that the district court judge hearing the case was right to toss it out because the states had waited too long to file their case.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wife of former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Roger Ng on Monday testified in her husband's defense at a U.S. trial over the looting of hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund between 2009 and 2014. 
Ng, Goldman's former chief for Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-corruption law. Prosecutors say he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from 1MDB, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty. He argues that some $35 million he received from Leissner, which prosecutors characterize as kickbacks from the scheme, was actually the proceeds of a legitimate business venture between the two men's wives.
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, testified on Monday that shortly after Ng began working for Leissner in the mid-2000s, she invested 48 million yuan - about $6 million at the time - at a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's wife, Judy Chan. 
Lim's testimony came on the second day of the defense's case in the trial, which began in early February. 
Lim said she and Chan had a falling out in 2011, and Chan told her to divest her share, which had appreciated substantially. In 2012, Chan told her she was ready to transfer $26 million, Lim testified. 
When asked by Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo if the money Chan said she would send to Lim came from 1MDB, Lim replied, ""Not at all.""
""It had to come from Judy and her family,"" Lim said. 
A lawyer for Chan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Leissner, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to similar charges, testified in February that the investment Lim made in Chan's Chinese business was a ""cover story"" that he and Ng concocted to explain the kickback payment so that the banks processing the funds would not grow suspicious.

The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history, in which U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

(https:// The move sets the stage for what is expected to be one of the marquee listings this year, even as investor interest in IPOs has waned significantly due to recent stock market volatility amid fears of aggressive rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the economic fallout of geopolitical tensions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. corporate stock buybacks are being targeted in U.S. President Joe Biden's 2023 budget plan announced on Monday, which seeks to discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stocks in order to benefit executives. 
Under the plan https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf, company executives would be required to hold on to company shares that they receive for several years after taking them, and they would be prohibited from selling shares in the years after a stock buyback.
Such legislation ""would align executives' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders, workers and the economy,"" such as investing money in growth and innovation, according to the proposal.
Corporate share repurchases, which reduce the number of shares outstanding, tend to boost a company's stock price. Executives who receive compensation in the form of stock awards and options can benefit when share repurchases cause a stock price to go up.
Biden's proposal simply starts the debate over the topic, and the implications for companies and their executives are unclear, analysts and others said.
""There's nothing in there that says I can't do all the buybacks I want"" as a company, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York. 
Also, executives are not the only people at companies who could benefit, he noted. ""What we saw last year was that a lot more people turned in their stock options that didn't have to.""
Some said the plan seemed to be a move to appeal to one political base.
""It's kind of playing to a certain political base - anti-capitalist, anti-wealth-creation,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
He added: ""I don't think it's a system that's been abused in the first place,"" and so the proposed changes seemed unnecessary to him.

Buyback levels have been rising in recent months. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earlier this month raised its 2022 buyback forecast for S&P 500 companies to $1 trillion, driven by a ""strong backlog of authorizations.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has led companies in terms of buyback levels in recent years, Silverblatt said.

The carrier has increased the number of planned new orders to 250 aircraft and also plans to increase the number of destinations to 165 from 70, al-Mohanna was reported saying. 
The acceleration in the airline's growth plans, which coincides with ambitions by Saudi Arabia to develop its airline industry and become a hub for tourism, was first reported by Bloomberg.
Flynas, part-owned by the investment firm of Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, was launched as Nas Air in 2007 with an all-Airbus fleet.

Investing.com – Stocks closed higher in the U.S. on Monday after a late-afternoon surge in tech helped lift all three indexes.
It was a change from earlier in the day when stocks weren’t showing any momentum and oil prices plunged. Russia’s war on Ukraine continued though there were discussions about peace talks sometime this week.
One catalyst was Tesla, which announced plans to split shares if shareholders approve.
It’s a data-heavy week coming up, with fresh information on the state of the housing and job markets, including the much-watched monthly jobs report due out Friday. The data comes as the Federal Reserve mulls whether to move more aggressively on interest rates at its May meeting.
The focus on the Fed’s action has weighed on financials and pushed the benchmark 10-year Treasury to above 2.5%. Reuters reported that one measure of the U.S. bond yield curve - the gap between five and 30-year Treasury yields - inverted for the first time since 2006 signaling rising concerns over economic growth.
Oil fell after China imposed lockdowns on Shanghai after an outbreak of Covid-19 infections there. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Energy stocks
Shares of energy stocks have fallen on new concerns regarding demand from China. Shanghai has started a two-stage lockdown to curb a further spread of the coronavirus.
The first phase is for five days, starting Monday, and is limited to Shanghai’s Pudong financial district and nearby neighborhoods. The second stage is a five-day lockdown, starting Friday, that will target Shanghai's downtown area.
The move should also put pressure on oil majors such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp. (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), and  BP PLC  ADR (NYSE:BP).
2. Tesla stock split
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be watched as it makes plans to increase the number of additional shares to enable a stock split. It joins other big companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in splitting shares.
3. Travel stocks
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian cruise shares rose sharply even as pandemic lockdowns returned to focus after Shanghai initiated its most restrictive lockdown in two years following a surge in cases. Analysts have been watching the travel sector for signs of a spring thaw.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two new funds that let investors place bets on stock market gyrations are expected to launch this week, potentially filling the void left by the implosion of similar products four years ago.
The 1x Short VIX Futures ETF (SVIX) and 2x Long VIX Futures ETF (UVIX) have received regulatory approval to list and will start trading on Wednesday, said Stuart Barton, chief investment officer at Volatility Shares, the company releasing the ETFs.
The new ETFs will track the daily performance of two separate volatility futures indexes, one which rises when stock gyrations pick up and another that benefits from falling volatility.
Volatility-linked exchange traded products have a checkered track-record on Wall Street, with only eight of the 20 volatility ETFs ever launched still trading, according to Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet Research Systems.
In February 2018, a volatility-tracking note called the VelocityShare Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN went bust amid a surge in market volatility in an event which was eventually dubbed “Volmageddon,” taking with it nearly $2 billion in investor assets.
""Historically, investors of all stripes have struggled to use volatility-tracking ETFs well,"" Kashner said.
The turbulence in February 2018 also prompted several volatility products to tweak their investment objectives to reduce risk. Since then, the combined assets in volatility-linked products has about halved to $2.69 billion, Kashner said.
Still, some investors who had been hurt by the XIV blowup said they are ready to trade the new ETFs.
""There is definitely demand from the retail community for another product,"" said Seth Golden, president of investment research firm Finom Group, who experienced a sharp decline in February 2018 due to the upheaval in volatility-tracking products and derivatives when XIV collapsed, though he did not own XIV shares. 
Interest in volatility-related products has grown amid the stock market’s gyrations in recent weeks. One-month trading volume for ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF and the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, popular volatility-linked ETFs, stands at 72 million shares, up about 400% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
Volatility Shares' Barton said the new products have been designed to avoid the pitfalls that had affected older products, including the way the fund goes about buying or selling volatility futures to keep it in line with its benchmark.
The new fund’s daily valuation will be calculated from the average futures prices over the last 15 minutes of the trading day, rather than just the futures settlement price, as in the case of XIV. In theory, that would reduce the funds’ vulnerability to sophisticated investors anticipating how its rebalancing could impact futures prices, according to analysts.
XIV's vulnerability to investors trying to trade volatility futures in anticipation of the fund's rebalancing needs may have created imbalances some analysts believe led to the fund’s undoing. 
The new funds will limit their trading in volatility futures to no more than 10% of the volume during a given rebalancing period, and possibly extend the daily rebalancing period if it finds the market unusually volatile.
That would ""go a long way to addressing the XIV-type situation,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, and plans to use the new ETFs.
A debut would come in the midst of a months-long period where worries over a hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical certainty stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have kept markets choppy. 
The adoption of these products can often ""pick up sharply after market drawdowns when volatility spikes,"" said Anand Omprakash, head of derivatives quantitative strategy at Elevation Securities.
The rise of retail traders as a force in markets may also boost demand for the products, analysts said, although some may not be eager to jump into volatility funds after getting hurt in the past. 

""The audience is more limited than pre-Volmageddon, but growing again,"" Finom's Golden said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada has picked  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) as the preferred bidder to supply 88 new fighter jets, Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi said Monday, in a clear sign the U.S. company is set to win the multibillion-dollar contract.
The move indicates Canada - under pressure to boost defense spending as the war in Ukraine rages - is closer to making a decision that has dragged out for more than a decade.
""This announcement marks another important milestone in Canada's competitive process to purchase modern fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" Tassi said.
Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a decade to replace its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.
""The F-35 is in operational use by NORAD and NATO partners in missions around the globe. It has proven to be a mature, capable and interoperable aircraft and that is why we are moving to the finalization phase of this procurement,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand, speaking alongside Tassi, told reporters. 
The federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will now only hold detailed talks with Lockheed Martin. Ottawa says it hopes to award the contract this year and take first deliveries in 2025.
Defense sources had long bet on the U.S. company, given Canada belongs to the consortium that developed its F-35 jet and the fact the plane is the military's first choice. Ottawa says the contract could be worth up to C$19 billion ($15.10 billion).
""We look forward to continuing our partnership with Canadian industry to deliver and sustain the F-35 for the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" Lockheed Martin Canada Chief Executive Lorraine Ben said in a statement.
If the negotiations for some reason fail, the government will turn to Sweden's Saab, the other contender.
""While we maintain our position that Saab presented the best offer for the Future Fighter Capability Project, we respect the decision of the government of Canada,"" the Swedish company said in a statement, adding that it would continue to collaborate with Canada in current and future programs.
Canada though has a long history of using U.S. military equipment and, unlike Sweden, belongs to both NATO and NORAD, the North American defense organization.
Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 as too expensive but has shifted his position.

The obvious alternative would have been Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co but it fell out of favor after taking trade action against Canadian rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc and was excluded from the competition last December.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday after a late-afternoon surge in tech lifted all three indexes.
At 4:23 PM ET, the S&P 500 added 0.72%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.27%, or 94 points, the Nasdaq surged 1.3%.
The three main averages on Wall Street posted gains last week, their second consecutive winning week, with the broad-based S&P 500 index now having more than erased its losses since Russia invaded its southern neighbor in late February.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams are set to meet in Turkey this week, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling independent Russian reporters that he would be willing to accept permanent neutrality as a basis for peace, as long as it was guaranteed by third parties.
Meanwhile, the White House has rowed back on President Joe Biden's weekend remarks calling for the departure of Vladimir Putin as Russian president, saying he had not been calling for regime change.
Away from Eastern Europe, investors will continue to focus on the strength of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s plans for upcoming interest rate hikes.
The monthly nonfarm payrolls report for March is due on Friday, with economists expecting the U.S. economy to have added another 475,000 jobs, after 678,000 were created in February.
Additionally, February figures on personal income and spending arrive on Thursday, with the widely-watched core PCE price index seen rising to rise 5.5% on an annual basis, staying well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
The strength of the economy coupled with the soaring inflation levels have seen investors price in an aggressive rate hike cycle, pushing the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% on Friday.
In the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said on Monday it would ask shareholders to vote at its annual meeting to increase the number of additional shares in order to enable a stock split.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will also be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the retail giant is stopping cigarette sales in some U.S. stores.
Oil prices slumped Monday on fears of reduced demand from China, the world’s largest crude importer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted the country’s officials to instigate a two-stage lockdown at its financial hub of Shanghai.
All firms and factories in Shanghai would suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely in a two-stage lockdown, closing half the city in turns, over nine days. Public transport, including ride-hailing services, will also be suspended.
By 4:24 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 9% lower at $103.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 9% to $1.06.78
Oil is still heading for a fourth monthly gain after Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine, prompting fears of disruptions to global supplies, driving prices above $100 a barrel. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.6% $1,922/oz.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 04:21PM ET</span>","Barclays faces $590 million hit, scrutiny over sales slip-up","By Iain Withers and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) faces an estimated 450 million pound ($592 million) loss and regulatory scrutiny for exceeding a U.S. limit on sales of structured products, some of which have surged in popularity since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Barclays also said on Monday that it will have to delay a planned 1 billion pound share buyback as of the loss, which it will have to incur as a result of buying back the securities in question at their original purchase price.
Shares in Barclays closed down 4% after the bank said it had oversold billions of pounds worth of the securities over a period of about a year, overshooting a $20.8 billion limit agreed with United States regulators by $15.2 billion.
The major regulatory blunder is an early embarrassment for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the newly-appointed chief executive of Barclays, whose previous roles included heading up the bank's global markets and risk operations.
Analysts at Shore Capital said in a note that Barclays appeared to be ""tripping over its shoelaces"".
The wider investment bank had previously proved a stellar performer for Barclays over recent years, helping it to post a record annual profit for 2021.
While the current share buyback has only been delayed, the error could reduce future capital distributions to shareholders by the bank, the Shore Capital analysts said.
In a further blow after the London market close, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) note seen by Reuters showed that the U.S. investment bank had been instructed by one of Barclays' top investors to sell a significant chunk of stock in the bank.
The target price range for the sale of 575 million Barclays' shares was 6.1-8.1% lower than the closing price, a factor which is likely to put further pressure on the stock price when it opens on Tuesday.
VOLATILITY BETS
The products involved include two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to crude oil and market volatility, a source familiar with the matter said. Barclays suspended sales and issuance of both this month.
Before sales were suspended, the so-called VXX product had surged in popularity as investors placed bets on volatility as the Ukraine crisis roiled global markets, with the number of shares changing hands daily doubling to 71 million in a month.
Barclays said at the time that capacity issues were to blame and the actions were not linked to the crisis in Ukraine.
The bank said on Monday its best estimate was that the loss on the affected securities would amount to 450 million pounds, cutting its core capital ratio to the middle of its 13-14% target range. The loss estimate did not include tax. 
Barclays said it would delay its share buyback until the second quarter of the year as a result.
It said that it had commissioned an independent review, while regulators were conducting inquiries and requesting information from the bank.

Barclays said the securities were registered for sale in August 2019, adding that it would file a new registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. pressure on Huawei Technologies has served to strengthen the resolve of the Chinese telecoms giant, finance chief Meng Wanzhou said on Monday after its first set of results since her return from nearly three years' detention in Canada.
The daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei played a central role in the company's tussle with the United States, having been detained in Canada in 2018 over alleged attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.
The United States then imposed a series of trade restrictions on the company throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns. This impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses. 
Meng was allowed to return to China in September after agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end a bank fraud case.
""Over the past few years our teams have undertaken a lot of pressure, and along this process we have become more united and our strategy has become clearer,"" she told reporters in her first public appearance at a company event, adding that Huawei had become more capable of dealing with uncertainty. 
Asked what she had been doing since she returned to work six months ago, Meng said the world had changed so much. 
""I've been learning and trying to catch up,"" she said.
STEEP REVENUE DROP
Washington's sanctions have continued to weigh heavily on Huawei's business. 
Full-year revenue tumbled 29% last year to 636.8 billion yuan ($100 billion). Net profit jumped by a record 76% to 113.7 billion yuan, but that was mainly thanks to the sale of its Honor handset division and server businesses under U.S. pressure. 
Meng attributed the revenue drop to the impact of U.S sanctions on the smartphone business, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and slowing demand for 5G base stations in China were also contributing factors. 
Guo Ping, Huawei's current rotating chairman, said the company hopes to find a solution to sustain its smartphone division and will ramp up investment in research seeking microchip ""breakthroughs"" after losing access to certain advanced technologies because of U.S. sanctions.
Though Guo did not directly answer repeated questions on whether Huawei planned to build its own chip manufacturing facility, he highlighted artificial intelligence (AI), Wifi6 connectivity, green energy, automotive and cloud computing as key areas for R&D and new business opportunities.
Asked if Huawei would be affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia, Guo said the company is evaluating related policies, adding that it has no plans to take its mobile operating system Harmony OS overseas. 

Many observers have questioned whether Chinese companies such as Huawei can fill the void left by overseas companies that have exited Russia in protest over the conflict in Ukraine.

The five-year Treasury yield briefly rose above the 30-year yield for the first time since 2006.

The support of Germany's Union Investment, which is a top-20 shareholder, for CEO Werner Baumann to see out his contract to 2024 comes after Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Singapore state investor Temasek, another large shareholder, was pushing for Baumann's removal. 
Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, said Temasek had concerns about Bayer’s operating performance under Baumann and the company’s lack of succession planning.
Janne Werning, Union Investment's head of capital markets and stewardship, said in a statement he was satisfied for Baumann to step down as planned in two years because, while Bayer's 2018 takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) was an unnecessary financial risk, the CEO should stay on to oversee recent positive changes.
""Initial progress is visible and to bring forward his departure by cancellation of his contract would only sow chaos,"" Werning said.
He cited improvement at the Crop Science division, driven by higher produce prices, and a recent slew of drug development transactions as among promising signs.
In 2020, Baumann's contract was extended until 2024. He said at the time he was initially offered a longer term but that he had opted for a shorter duration due to personal plans.
Bayer's executive board won clear votes of confidence from shareholders at last year's annual general meeting (AGM) and in 2020, but suffered a rebuke in 2019 over the handling of lawsuits related to Monsanto's weedkiller Roundup, which has cost Bayer billions of dollars to settle.

Another shareholder, Swiss investment manager Alatus Capital SA, this month filed a motion for Bayer's AGM scheduled for April 29, to vote against ratifying the actions of the executive board.
Bayer responded at the time by saying the motion was unjustified because the operating business was developing positively and progress had been made in the Roundup litigation.

Credit Suisse was asked to hand over documents related to the financing of yachts and private jets owned by potentially sanctioned individuals, according to a letter sent by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Reform to the bank's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, on Monday. 
The probe comes after the Financial Times reported earlier this month that Credit Suisse had asked hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents relating to its richest clients' yachts and private jets, in an attempt to stop information leaking about loans to oligarchs who were later sanctioned.
The letter was sent by U.S. representatives Carolyn Maloney and Stephen Lynch. Maloney chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee and Lynch is chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security. The letter expressed concern over the timing of the bank's instruction to destroy the documents as it coincided with Switzerland's statement that it would join other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia. 
Credit Suisse on Monday declined to comment on the probe. It referred back to a statement made earlier this month in response to the FT's report.
In that statement, it said that the request had been made to ensure investors complied with a nondisclosure agreement and was ""in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions - with which we are fully compliant.""
Credit Suisse has been asked to comply with the committee's request by April 11 and will need to send documents starting from January 2017 to present day, according to the letter.
The probe is another headache for Gottstein as he looks to get the bank back on track following a challenging 2021. Last year, the bank's chairman, Antonio Horta-Osorio, resigned after an internal investigation revealed he breached COVID-19 rules, lost billions of dollars from the collapse of investment fund Archegos Capital Management and was tarnished by its involvement with now-defunct financier Greensill Capital. 

Credit Suisse stopped pursuing new business in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Swiss bank said on Monday in an internal document seen by Reuters. 
Prominent U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) last week asked more than 30 financial services trade groups for information on what steps their members have taken to end business relationships in Russia.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 02:06PM ET</span>",Major Ericsson investors to vote against some board members at shareholder meeting,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Major Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) shareholders will vote against a motion to clear some board members of responsibility over possible payment of bribes to militant organisations in Iraq, deepening a crisis at the Swedish group that has knocked a quarter off its market value. 
Shareholders, including Cevian Capital, Swedbank Robur and Norway's wealth fund, plan to vote against discharging the board members of liability at Ericsson's annual general meeting on Tuesday.
The shareholder vote is likely to be close to a 10% threshold that would give investors the right to sue board members in the future under Swedish company law.
Ericsson has been under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Justice and from shareholders for not properly disclosing that its 2019 investigation had found the company may have paid militant organisations in Iraq.
""We still lack the information necessary to make an informed judgment of what went wrong, why, and who should be held responsible,"" Cevian said. ""Given the lack of information and the magnitude of the damage, we have no choice but to hold the entire board accountable."" 
Cevian owns just under 5% shares in Ericsson. 
Investor AB along with Primecap Management, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and AB Industrivärden are also among major investors in the company, Ericsson's website said.
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it would vote against granting a discharge to five of the company's board members, including Chief Executive Borje Ekholm. 
""When voting on a proposal to discharge the board of responsibilities, we will consider whether any information raises reasonable doubt about the board's actions,"" said the fund, which has around a 1.9% stake based on Refinitiv data. 
Fund manager Swedbank Robur, which has a 3.9% stake, said: ""We will not grant discharge of liability for the board members and CEO.""
It also said it still had confidence in the board and CEO, and would vote for the Nomination Committee's proposal to appoint them.
Swedish business daily Dagens Industri cited fund managers Nordea Funds and Lansforsakringar Fondforvaltning, with a 1.1% stake and a 0.3% stake respectively, as saying they would vote against discharge from liability for the board. 
Fund manager Avanza Fonder, which has less than 1% of Ericsson, said it would vote against discharge from liability for Ekholm and board members who are part of Ericsson's Audit and Compliance Committee.
""We ... want to let our dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency in the serious breaches identified in Ericsson be known,"" Avanza Fonder CEO Jesper Bonnivier said.
Sweden's shareholders association, representing small shareholders, told Reuters it would also vote against.
Under the Swedish Companies Act, a company or shareholders can sue board members or the CEO if a group representing at least a 10% stake in the company votes against ratifying acts of the CEO in the past year.
Telecom gear maker Ericsson said: ""We are awaiting the result of the vote at tomorrow’s AGM and will comment further then.""
'CHALLENGING SITUATION'
Investor AB, Ericsson's largest shareholder in terms of both capital and votes, and Industrivarden said they planned to vote in favour of discharge of liabilities.
Investor AB, backed by the Wallenberg family, said it had continued full confidence in Ericsson's board and CEO.
""It is important that the company's Board and Management feel they have our support in this challenging situation,"" Investor AB CEO Johan Forssell said in a statement. 
It is rare for shareholders in big Swedish companies not to grant discharge of liability, and any such move would be likely to raise pressure for a boardroom overhaul. 
In 2014, a scandal over telecoms company Telia Company' , then called TeliaSonera, business dealings in Uzbekistan pushed shareholders to vote against discharging former CEO Lars Nyberg from personal liability in 2014.
Ekholm, who had served as CEO of Investor AB, took over as CEO of Ericsson in 2016. He oversaw a turnaround of the company and in 2019 settled a U.S. government probe for alleged payment of bribes from at least 2000 to 2016 in countries including China, Vietnam and Djibouti.
In the same year, Ericsson investigated allegation of bribes in Iraq but chose to not disclose the findings to shareholders. It released details in February this year after media enquiries, sparking the current tension.
""Unquestionably Borje has done a good job of turning around the company, but this scandal clearly puts a dark cloud over his efforts,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. 

The Ericsson board, including Chairman Ronnie Leten, has also been backing Ekholm, after proxy firms, including Glass Lewis, had recommended shareholders vote to remove him following the disclosure and a sharp fall in the company's share price.

BERLIN/MILAN (Reuters) -ProSiebenSat.1 said on Monday that MediaForEurope (MFE) had rejected the offer of a seat on the supervisory board of the German broadcaster, suggesting that no compromise has been reached with its top investor ahead of a May shareholder vote.
MFE, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has called for closer cooperation with Munich-based ProSieben, in which it has a voting stake of more than 25%.
The Milan-listed group has also asked ProSieben to engage in talks over strategy, focusing on its core TV business.
ProSieben said in December that it was extending CEO Rainer Beaujean's contract until 2027, and the supervisory board intended to propose Andreas Wiele, a former Axel Springer executive board member, as its new chairman.
MFE was not given advance notice of this plan and it was not involved either in the decision to propose former RTL boss Bert Habets and Rolf Nonnenmacher for other two seats that are to be reallocated at ProSieben's annual general meeting on May 5.
ProSieben said in a statement on Monday that its supervisory board unanimously approved the proposals, which were the result of a comprehensive selection process initiated in mid-2021. 
It said it had also offered MFE the opportunity to propose its own candidate, in return for supporting the supervisory board candidates. 
""MFE-MediaForEurope rejected this proposal, which the supervisory board very much regrets"", it said.
MFE does not have any supervisory board representatives but has reserved the right to present rival candidates by April 20.
""MFE has absolutely no interest in controversy. Our position will be presented at the appropriate time... and in the interests of the company and all its shareholders"", a spokesperson for MFE said.
A source familiar with the matter said MFE's own board of directors could be updated on the developments at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday.

Formerly known as Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), MFE sees building a continental TV champion as the answer to challenges posed by streaming giants and online advertising platforms.
For its part, German TV group ProSieben has been pursuing a standalone strategy, while investing in tech businesses, such as e-commerce operations and online dating platform ParshipMeet.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split in the form of a dividend, the electric-car maker said on Monday, sending its shares up about 5%.
The plan came as the company suspended its Shanghai factory amid COVID-19-related lockdown measures and its artificial intelligence head took a sabbatical as the company aims to achieve full self-driving capability this year. 
The proposal, first announced on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), has been approved by its board and shareholders will vote on it at an annual meeting. The stock split, if approved, would be the latest after a five-for-one split in August 2020 that made Tesla shares cheaper for its employees and investors.
Following a pandemic-induced rally in the technology shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), too, have in the recent past split their shares to make them more affordable. 
Title: Tesla shares soar after stock split in 2020 Tesla shares soar after stock split in 2020, https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-SHAREHOLDERS/TESLA-SHAREHOLDERS/lbpgnmbyevq/Tesla%20performance.jpg
Tesla debuted at $17 per share in 2010. Following its 2020 5-for-1 stock split it is trading above $1,000, equivalent to over $5,000 on a pre-stock split basis. 
Since the stock split in 2020, they have surged 128%, boosting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion and making it the biggest U.S. automaker by that measure.
""This (stock split) could further fuel the bubble in Tesla's stock that has been brewing over the past two years,"" said David Trainer, chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs.
Tesla has delivered nearly a million electric cars annually, while ramping up production by setting up new factories in Austin and Berlin amid COVID-19-related disruptions and increasing competition. 
Tesla on Monday notified its suppliers and workers that its Shanghai factory in China will be closed for four days as the financial hub said it would lock down in two stages to carry out mass COVID-19 testing.
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Monday that he had ""supposedly"" tested positive for COVID-19, a few days after he attended a car delivery event at the company's new Berlin factory. 
""We think Berlin ramping, and both the MiniCar and India are on the horizon, we would agree with the timing,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said, hinting that companies usually execute stock splits when good news is ahead.
AI CHIEF 
Musk also said on Sunday Tesla's artificial intelligence chief Andrej Karpathy was on a fourth-month sabbatical, at a critical time that Musk wants to achieve full self-driving capability and roll out a humanoid robot prototype this year. 
""Especially excited to get focused time to re-sharpen my technical edge and train some neural nets!"" Karparthy tweeted.

""Though I already miss all the robots and GPU/Dojo clusters and looking forward to having them at my fingertips again,"" he said, referring to Tesla's AI chip Dojo.
Musk said in a podcast interview in January that Karpathy played an important role, adding: ""People will give me too much credit and they’ll give Andrej too much credit.”

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 01:31PM ET</span>",Biden wants $813 billion for defense as Ukraine crisis raises alarm,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion boasts a 4.6% pay raise for troops and the largest research and development budget in history, as Russian aggression in Ukraine spurs demands for more military spending.
Biden's request earmarks $773 billion for the Pentagon, and eclipses the budget requests by former President Donald Trump. An additional $40 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $813 billion, up from $778 billion last year.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven recent support for greater defense spending among Democrats and Republicans who see a growing national security and foreign policy threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The budget increases funds for the Pentagon's European Deterrence Initiative by $360 million to a total of $4.2 billion. 
At the same time, the budget slows the Department of Defense's purchasing of the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, after Air Force leaders complained that technological improvements to the jet's hardware were too slow. 
Budget talks between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the White House coalesced around the $773 billion early on, defense officials said. Reuters first reported the figure in February.
Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.
Only 61 F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) were requested by the Pentagon, down from a request of 85 last year, though experts believe Congress will increase that figure during the budget process. 
The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). 
The 2023 fiscal budget, which starts on Oct. 1, boasts the Pentagon's largest research and development budget ever, with $130 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia. 

Some of that investment is funded by retiring equipment like Littoral Combat Ships that are expensive to operate, and older planes like A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies. 
The national defense budget request crafted during Trump's final year in office was for $752.9 billion. Congress then increased that amount by $25 billion, ultimately landing at $778 billion for fiscal 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday proposed expanding the definition of broker-dealers and mandating that Principal Trading Firms (PTFs) must register with the agency in a bid to enhance market resiliency and help level the playing field.
The Wall Street regulator said its proposal, which is subject to public consultation, aims to expand the definition of a dealer as ""one that engages in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,"" which would capture a range of activities it sees as critical to the agency's monitoring of systemic risk.
""In recent years, we've seen a number of high-profile events in markets with significant participation by PTFs. Tremors in the Treasuries markets in 2014, 2019, and at the beginning of the COVID crisis in 2020 demonstrate the importance of the SEC's oversight of dealers,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.
Monday's proposal specifies that broker dealers who routinely make comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day must register with the regulator. 
Dealers who ""routinely express trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other market participants"" must also be registered, the SEC said, in addition to mandating that a dealer must register with the agency if she earns revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer.
The regulator also seeks to scrutinize dealers who capture any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests.

Regulators have long argued that high-frequency trading, a computerized strategy that can move billions of dollars in fractions of a second, carries risks in the U.S. government bond market that threaten the ability of the market to function, as well as the ability of investors to fairly value assets.
The SEC, as the U.S. market's regulator, should require that such trading firms comply with capital and record-keeping rules and be subject to periodic exams, much like equities and corporate bond markets, Gensler has argued.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 12:51PM ET</span>","China's Sinopec pauses Russia projects, Beijing wary of sanctions -sources","(Corrects to show that Novatek did not respond to requests for comment, not that it declined to comment)
By Chen Aizhu, Julie Zhu and Muyu Xu
(Reuters) - China's state-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.
The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions. 
Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.
But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.
Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multi-billion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.""
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. 
The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said.
The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment. 
The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about ""whether there are internal meetings or not"".
""China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,"" it said in a faxed statement. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Global oil majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its ""special operation"" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.
TALKS ON HOLD
Sinopec, formally China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) and Chemical Corp, has suspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the new gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said.
The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest petrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec and 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024.
""The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by building another one and were in the middle of site selection,"" said the source.
Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been sanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires with ties to Putin.
Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions.
The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the sources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key lenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank and European credit agencies.
""It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome the difficulties in financing,"" said a Beijing-based industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Sibur said it continues to cooperate with Sinopec including working jointly on implementing the Amur plant. It denied that there was a plan to team up with Sinopec for a project similar to the Amur Gas Chemical Complex in east Siberia.
""Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the project's construction management, including equipment supplies, work with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working on the issues of project financing,"" Sibur told Reuters by email.
Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture with Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S. sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the wake of the sanctions.
Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered a preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to create a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China as well as distributing natural gas in China.

Novatek did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the agreement with Sinopec.
Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were among the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector, taking minority stakes in major export project Arctic LNG 2 in 2019 and Yamal LNG in 2014.

Earlier in the day, CBS News first reported JetBlue's hiring plan.

The company's shares were down about 1% at $14.41.
In December, top executives of major U.S. airlines including JetBlue said that they would tell a Senate committee about ramping up hiring amid rising concerns over the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock traded 4.3% lower Monday after Piper Sandler cut its target by 42% to $29 with analyst Michael S. Lavery citing growing competitive intensity and pessimism around the U.S. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) partnership as reasons for his somber outlook.
Lavery earlier had a target of $50 for the stock with a ‘neutral’ rating, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst points out that Beyond Meat is still burning cash “with no clear path to positive EBITDA.”
The lowered target reflects lower estimates for 2022 and 2023 sales, in addition to the lowered EV/sales multiple to reflect the company’s growth, profitability, and balance sheet.
The analyst also shared key findings from Piper’s survey, which showed that 31% of respondents said they would try plant-based meat if it were cheaper than animal meat.
According to the analyst, the company remains committed to lowering prices below that of animal protein (despite current inflation) by 2024, which will likely drive prices down more than it will lift volumes.
Beyond Meat had reported disappointing fourth-quarter numbers in February. In the fourth quarter ended December 31, the company’s net loss more than tripled to over $80 million on revenue of about $101 million.
Sales to U.S. grocers, convenience stores, and other retailers declined by almost a fifth in the fourth quarter. The company attributed this to softer demand, fewer shipping days, increased discounting, and “to a lesser extent, loss of market share.” President and CEO Ethan Brown called it a “temporary disruption.”"

The Authority for Consumers and Markets said its fines against the company in the long-running dispute now total 50 million euros ($55 million), the maximum possible under its current order.
It said Apple had submitted a new proposal for complying with the order on Sunday - a move the watchdog said it welcomed but that came too late to avoid the fine.
Apple's practice of requiring developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. 
Although the Dutch case is limited to dating apps in the Netherlands, it could set a precedent for the U.S. company, which has denied wrongdoing. The ACM has been levying weekly fines against the company in the dispute since January.
The ACM said on Monday that Apple's new compliance proposal was concrete enough that it expects be able to make a finding ""as soon as possible"" as to whether the company has complied with its order. It said it would consider the proposal and consult with dating app makers such as Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH).
Depending on the outcome, the agency said it might still move to impose further periodic fines ""with possibly higher penalties"" to encourage the company to comply.

Under new rules agreed last week between the European Commission, EU governments and EU lawmakers, Apple will be required to open up its App Store to alternative payments once the legislation comes into force in October.

The Russian market is gradually reopening after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russian stocks and bonds resumed trading in full on Monday, albeit for a curtailed timeframe and with various restrictions, including a ban on short-selling, still in place. Non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
By 1530 GMT, the rouble gained 7.7% to 89.10 to the dollar, its strongest level since March 1.
The rouble has gained support from conditions of continuing capital controls and the absence of serious sanctions tightening, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest. 
But the rouble was weaker on the EBS electronic platform, hovering at 96 to the dollar.
The rouble had gained 7.1% to trade at 98 versus the euro, a one-month high.
Investors are watching the outcome of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that may get under way in Turkey on Tuesday. 
STOCKS STRUGGLE
Equities largely lost ground, with flag carrier Aeroflot a notable exception, recovering to gain 5% after touching its lowest since 2009 in early trade. 
The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 1.9% lower at 2,436.0 points. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 0.9% to 822.4 points. 
The Russian government has promised to support Russian companies by buying their stocks with money channelled from the rainy-day National Wealth Fund.
As of Monday, Russia has not started spending the fund's money on stocks purchases, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said, according to Interfax.
Trading in depositary receipts in Russia remained suspended. Finam brokerage said in a note that the stock market's slide was continuing in the absence of any growth drivers. 
Dominant lender Sberbank shed 3.9%, gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) fell 3.6% and oil major Rosneft slid 1.9%. 
Yields on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds were at 13.62%, down from last week's record high of 19.74%, which is just below the central bank's key interest rate, but still at levels last seen in March 2015.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 11:27AM ET</span>",Former aircraft designer Shimada may find silver lining in Toshiba gloom,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The crisis at Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp may have a silver lining for new boss Taro Shimada, allowing him to keep - at least for now - businesses pivotal to his digital strategy that predecessors had planned to sell.
Investors last week voted down management's plan to spin off Toshiba's devices unit with nearly 60% opposition, as well as a rival shareholder proposal to solicit buyout offers. That left the troubled 146-year-old conglomerate without a clear immediate direction.
But it could give Shimada, a former aircraft designer and Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) executive, leeway for his plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware.
It also allows him to hang onto equipment maker Toshiba Tec Corp, which was considered ""non core"" in the now-rejected spin-off. Shimada has praised some businesses at Toshiba Tec for marrying digital to hardware and sources say he didn't want to sell it.
It's unclear if Shimada will be able to appease the hedge funds that own around 30% of Toshiba and are impatient for a private equity buyout. But as Thursday's vote shows, they don't have enough support to completely call the shots.
The outcome of the vote gives Shimada ""carte blanche"" to show he can deliver, said veteran Japan analyst Jesper Koll of Monex Group.
""For the first time in over a decade, you've got a CEO at Toshiba who actually is a technologist, who understands technology, who has hands-on experience,"" he said.
Big manufacturers are increasingly pushing into higher-margin digital services. Shimada's former employer, Siemens, wants to expand its customer base through digital services that improve factories, buildings and train systems.
Shimada says he's the first Toshiba head to understand digital. He was brought in as chief strategy officer for digital in 2018 by then CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, also a company outsider, who wooed him over ramen noodles in Tokyo's Shimbashi district.
Kurumatani stepped down last year amid a governance scandal and shareholder opposition. Toshiba later said the former boss violated ethical standards. Shimada became the third CEO in about a year when he took over this month from Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains board chairman.
CONSTANT TURMOIL
Toshiba has been in turmoil since a 2015 accounting scandal and the later bankruptcy of U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Overseas investors injected $5.4 billion and saved it from delisting, but that brought on hedge funds as shareholders. 
Four years of dealing with foreign activist hedge funds - and their varied demands for buybacks, board reshuffles and a resumption of buyout talks - has left management distracted, sources say. 
The firm's stock market value has fallen to around $18 billion, half of an early 2000s peak.
Shimada says Toshiba can no longer sell just hardware and needs to add digital services to improve both products and margins.
He repeated that message ""over and over"" at internal meetings when he first joined, he told Reuters in an interview two years ago.
""I'm trying to show what digital transformation means,"" he said in the interview. 
Meanwhile, rival Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd has been transforming itself for a decade already, selling off low-growth businesses and investing in its digital and services platform. Last year it bought U.S. software firm GlobalLogic for $9.6 billion including debt.
Toshiba's operating profit margin was 3.42% in the last financial year, less than half of Hitachi's 9.38%, according to Refinitiv.
SCEPTICAL
Investors remain sceptical of the company's ability to mount a turnaround on its own.
While Toshiba is an ""incredible company with incredible technology inside"" it has become ""less than the sum of its parts,"" said Brian Heywood, CEO of Taiyo Pacific Partners, which doesn't own Toshiba shares. 
The company ""hasn't defined how its parts go together,"" Heywood said.
Shimada cites Toshiba Tec's ""Smart Receipt"" app, which works with its point-of-sales systems, as one digitalisation example.
The app replaces paper receipts with electronic ones and sends coupons to users' phones. Retailers get data for advertising and promotions.
Shimada declined to comment this month when asked about the classification, which was part of a plan since rejected, of Toshiba Tec as ""non core"". He did say the business was ""extremely good."" The company commands about half of the domestic market for point-of-sales systems.
He also sees potential for a cybersecurity subscription service based on quantum computing that protects users from advanced cyberattacks.

Shimada hasn't publicly stated his stance on a potential private equity buyout that hedge fund shareholders have been calling for.
If that happens, he could still pursue his strategy - provided existing management were allowed to stay on.

(Reuters) - The U.S. advertising market will grow in 2022 but only by half as much as it did in 2021, according to an industry forecast released on Monday that cited both last year's record growth from the COVID-19 recovery and the economic harm from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Media intelligence firm MAGNA, a unit of Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG), lowered its full-year growth forecast by one percentage point to 11.5% compared to its 12.6% forecast before the invasion little over a month ago.
The 11.5% growth represents $320 billion in 2022, MAGNA said, as compared with 25% growth in 2021. 
The strength of the advertising industry typically mirrors the economy, as brands may spend more to market products to consumers in a strong economy and cut spending during tougher times.
The assault on Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" is rekindling economic uncertainty with high oil and gas prices and concerns about the global supply chain, the report said. 
""It’s still very early to assess the full impact of the Ukraine crisis,"" said Vincent Letang, executive vice president of global market intelligence at MAGNA.

Political advertising for the U.S. midterm elections in November could be higher than previously expected. One reason may be that campaigns are raising more money to fund digital ads on top of local TV commercials in order to reach voters online, Letang said. 
MAGNA now expects political advertising to grow by 41% compared to the last U.S. midterms in 2018, up from its previous forecast of 31%.

Investing.com – Uber Inc (NYSE:UBER) stock recouped all its losses in the session and was up 0.8% at 11:10 ET Monday as traders turned their attention to Saturday’s news of the ride-hailing app securing a 30-month license to operate in London.
The ride-hailing service had been engaged in a dispute with regulators over the past five years over safety issues and had lost its license to operate twice over that period.
It was in 2019 when Uber lost its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time. A legal battle ensued and a year later, the company was granted an 18-month license. The U.S. company first lost its license in 2017.
Transport for London now finds Uber to be a fit and proper person and has granted a license with conditions, a Reuters report quoted the authority’s spokesperson as saying.
Uber had previously claimed that it has assuaged safety concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.
The firm also struck a deal with Britain's GMB union last year, allowing it to represent up to 70,000 drivers.
Earlier this month, Uber raised its current-quarter guidance, driven by a “significant” improvement in February demand for mobility.
The company is now expecting its basic operating income on an adjusted basis to come in between $130 million and $150 million in the first quarter. This range was earlier $100 million to $130 million.
Uber said it expects a sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA for both Mobility and Delivery segments.  
The company had, in February, reported its second operating profit for a quarter while its food delivery business delivered its maiden profit at a basic operating level. The company also reported the most active users in its history.
According to the company’s forecast then, revenue this quarter was seen at $26 billion.

AMSTERDAM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Brewing giants Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) said on Monday they would quit Russia, joining an exodus of Western companies as pressure grows on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international companies to turn their backs on the Russian market after the launch last month of what Moscow termed a ""special military operation"" against its neighbour.
For Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to Russia, the exit would result in a ""substantial non-cash impairment charge"" this year, it said without providing further details. 
The company holds a 27% share of the local market through its ownership of the country's biggest brewer, Baltika. 
""We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia, which we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment,"" Carlsberg said. ""Upon completion we will have no presence in Russia.""
The company's shares, which have fallen by roughly a quarter since the start of the invasion, traded 4.2% higher on Monday, heading for their best day since November 2020. 
Heineken, the third largest brewer in Russia, earlier said it was aiming for an ""orderly transfer"" of its local business, which accounts for just 2% of total sales, reducing its operations during a transition period to minimise the risk of nationalisation.
The Dutch brewer expects to book related charges of around 400 million euros ($438 million) and said it would guarantee the salaries of its 1,800 employees in Russia until the end of the year. 
""We have concluded that Heineken's ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it would not profit from any transfer of ownership.
Its shares were up 0.3% by 1423 GMT.
Carlsberg last year generated 10% of its total revenue and 6% of its operating profit in Russia, where it has eight breweries and 8,400 employees. It took full control of Baltika in 2008 but has faced sluggish sales amid a sanction-hit economy and regulations to curb alcohol abuse. 
""The announcement that Carlsberg will leave Russia should help to clear the air and removes the overhang risk,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note.
The Danish brewer's non-current assets in Russia stood at 19.2 billion Danish crowns ($2.83 billion) at the end of 2021, amounting to around 15% of total assets or 44% of its total equity, its annual report showed.
Russia's second largest brewer is a joint venture owned by Turkey's Anadolu Efes and Belgium's InBev.
InBev said earlier in March it would stop selling Bud beer in Russia and forego profits from the joint venture, which has 11 breweries and 3,500 employees in the country.

Cirina, who was head of Austria and the CEE countries at the insurer, has been proposed for the top job by a leading Generali investor in a power struggle which will be put to a shareholder vote on April 29.
""The decision has been taken due to violations of his duty of loyalty and material breach of other personal obligations under his contract of employment,"" Generali said in a statement.
There was no immediate comment from Cirina who presented his camp's alternative plans for the insurer at a news conference in Milan on Friday, alongside Claudio Costamagna, the rebel shareholder's candidate to chair the group.
Italian unions said on Monday they were concerned that cost-cutting targets for Generali proposed by the two men could present serious problems for the sustainability of employment at a company of national importance.
Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali, wants to replace Frenchman Donnet, who has been CEO since 2016, and install Cirina in his place.
The Generali board has proposed Donnet for a third term, with backing from the group's single biggest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
'AWAKENING THE LION'
Caltagirone's team set out their stall on Friday with a plan dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"", a reference to Generali's nickname ""The Lion of Trieste"", which features on its logo. They want to boost earnings growth, cut costs, and do bigger M&A deals.
The challengers aim to lift earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8% and would make the group a best-in-class according to analysts. The rebels also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Generali shares rose 4% to their highest level in more than a decade on Monday, as the shareholder battle stoked buying.

Berenberg said in a note that victory by a tight margin for the current management would be the best outcome for investors, adding that this would result in it over-delivering on Generali's growth rate target of 6-8% of its earnings per share.
""We believe the reelection of the existing management team is the most likely outcome, as this team has established a strong track record in the past six years,"" it added.

According to the report, negotiations between Coinbase and 2TM have been on since last year and an agreement could be announced late next month.
Brazil’s crypto unicorn 2TM would give Coinbase the leverage needed to secure a market leader position in Latin America. The holding company behind Mercado Bitcoin, Meubank, MB Digital Assets, Bitrust, Blockchain Academy, and MezaPro was valued at roughly $2.2 billion in the latest Series B funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank, according to Bloomberg.
The acquisition will enable 2TM, which has already purchased several companies in Brazil, to push for growth in other Latin American markets.
According to Estado, talks between the companies have also caught the attention of Binance Holdings. The Coinbase rival is also on the lookout for acquisitions in Brazil with the country’s cryptocurrency market expected to reach 120 billion reals ($25 billion).

Dutch brewer Heineken (OTC:HEINY) also announced on Monday it had decided to exit its Russian business at a cost of 400 million euros ($438 million).
""We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia, which we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment,"" Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said. ""Upon completion we will have no presence in Russia.""
Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to the Russian market, launched a strategic review of its Russian business this month but had kept its eight breweries in the country operating.

The decision to exit Russia would result in a ""substantial non-cash impairment charge"" this year, it said without providing further details.
Carlsberg had non-current assets in Russia worth 19.2 billion Danish crowns by the end of 2021, which amounts to around 15% of total assets or 44% of its total equity, its annual report showed.

JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur expects to see a better-than-expected outlook for the May quarter and in-line results for the prior quarter.
""We see sustained improvement in DRAM and NAND fundamentals for the remainder of the year and expect FY/CY22 numbers to be revised higher post the call with MU earnings power of $13-$14 exiting CY22 (Street at $12). We anticipate shares to start to inflect higher towards their historical 8-12x range as the market starts to discount the solid fundamental set up for the rest of CY22.

Similarly, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore expects to see upside for the February quarter, in addition to the in-line outlook for the ongoing quarter. He added that Micron may guide conservatively.
""We would expect upside around the February quarter results, given that pricing was modestly better in DRAM, and that a competitor had a supply issue in NAND with 2 weeks to go in Micron's quarter, which likely drove some upside volumes late in the quarter. In terms of the outlook, we would expect the company to guide around in-line with consensus, or slightly lower - our number is slightly lower - but to some degree we see that as Micron's normal conservatism, given what is still a fairly wide range of outcomes for 2q pricing across all markets,"" Moore said in a client note.
On the risk side, Moore is worried about the oversupplied DRAM market as well as much weaker China smartphone sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Commission advisers on Monday proposed an expansion of the bloc's sustainable finance rules to better grade activities such as gas-fired power plants that are not yet environmentally friendly. 
Whether and how to include gas in the European Union's flagship 'taxonomy', a list of green activities that will help the bloc reach its climate goals, has spurred intense lobbying over the last year.
After the Commission proposed defining gas as 'green' using more generous emissions thresholds than those originally suggested by the expert advisers, a number of European countries and politicians said they would oppose it.
To help solve the issue, the advisers proposed expanding the scope of the taxonomy using a traffic light system to include an intermediate, or 'amber', category for activities that were not yet sustainable, but which could become so over time.
They also backed creating a 'red' category for activities causing significant environmental harm that need to urgently transition or be wound down, as well as another for activities that have little direct impact on the environment.
""It's really important to be clear about what are these transitions that are needed, in order to make sure that the capital markets can engage and finance can flow for them,"" said Nancy Saich, Chief Climate Change Expert at the European Investment Bank and member of the expert advisory group. 
By broadening the role of the taxonomy, companies would be better able to access finance to fund their transition to a low-carbon economy, while investors would get more transparency about what they were funding at a portfolio level.

""One piece of a jigsaw does not give a full picture,"" said Sebastien Godinot, Senior Economist at the WWF European Policy Office.
""We need the taxonomy to contain different categories and cover all key sectors to clarify where we are now and accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy.""

1662,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 10:22AM ET</span>",Sea's Decision to Close India Operations Seen as a 'Clear Positive',"Singapore-based global consumer internet company Sea (SE) said its e-commerce arm Shopee will shut down its operations in India amid the company's poor growth outlook.
This is the second pullback for Shopee this month, just several weeks after it exited the market in France and after India banned Seas Free Fire app. The ban wiped off $16 billion of Seas market value in a single day, prompting some investors to offload the company's shares.
Shopee said the pullback comes as a result of global market uncertainties and that the company will do its best to make the process as smooth as possible.
A few weeks ago, Sea said it expects Shopee's revenue growth to decline to roughly 76% in 2022, after seeing an outstanding 157% growth last year, due to weaker engagements and online purchases.
Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Goodridge sees the decision as a clear positive for SE as we have struggled to make the underlying unit economics work in the India market.
""We view this as a positive announcement for two key reasons: 1) Management has continued to demonstrate a flexible capital allocation process, where now the risk return on entering India is no longer attractive; and 2) it should help to control expanding ecommerce losses ... we have always struggled to make the unit economics for Shopee India work “ this is due to the very competitive landscape, Shopee's very low Average Order Value, and relatively high logistics costs. In our note Sea Ltd: Shopee Poland + Shopee India = More Upside, we highlighted that for Shopee to win ~5% GMV market it would cost up to ~US$900m in annual EBITDA losses. Hence, SE's no longer pursuing this strategy is a clear positive, in our view,"" Goodridge said in a client note.
The analyst finds the current companys market valuation as attractive.
UBS analyst Navin Killa also reflected positively on SEs decision, saying it may signal an improving discipline in cash burn.
""We believe the exit should be viewed positively by the market: 1) this supports management's commentary during FY21 earnings call that the company would take a more calibrated approach towards investments especially on international opportunities ex-ASEAN and Taiwan (with Brazil as the key focus); and 2) it removes the potential of high cash burn from competing with an ultra-competitive Indian e-commerce market with global and local giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Flipkart and JioMart,"" Killa wrote in a memo.

Shares of the tech company rose as much as 2.2% to $3,366.63, trading at their highest since Jan. 4. They are now flat on the year after having dropped more than 18% earlier this month. 
Among the other major internet and technology stocks, both Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. are close to recouping their losses for the year with a 2% decline each, while  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) is almost 9% lower. Both Meta Platforms Inc. and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). have seen far sharper losses, dropping more than 30% as they struggle to recover from weak forecasts. The Nasdaq 100 Index has slumped about 9% in 2022. 
Amazon has reclaimed its longstanding title as a market leader after being a laggard in 2021. In early February, it reported fourth-quarter results that were much stronger than expected, easing concerns about its post-pandemic growth prospects and sparking the biggest single-day gain by a U.S. stock in market history. A month later, it announced a 20-for-1 stock split, spurring additional gains as Wall Street bet the move could lead to higher interest from retail investors.
“We’ve seen a shift back into these kinds of high-quality growth names, with strong balance sheets and market positions, and Amazon’s strength also reflects how strong the consumer continues to be,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.
Beyond those factors, major technology and internet stocks have staged a comeback over the past two weeks despite a surge in Treasury yields, signaling an improving earnings outlook is starting to overshadow concerns about a rising interest-rate environment and geopolitical tensions.
Amazon’s 2022 performance stands in contrast to other names in the e-commerce space. eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) has dropped nearly 13% this year, while both Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc. and Wayfair (NYSE:W) Inc. are down more than 30%.

Investing.com -- Shares of energy stocks have fallen Monday morning on new concerns regarding demand from China.
With China having a zero-COVID policy, officials in the country implemented a citywide lockdown in Shanghai, an essential financial and manufacturing hub, after a rise in COVID-19 infections.
Shanghai has started a two-stage lockdown to curb a further spread of the coronavirus.
The first phase is for five days, starting Monday, and is limited to Shanghai’s Pudong financial district and nearby neighborhoods.
The second stage is a five-day lockdown, starting Friday, that will target Shanghai's downtown area.
China is the world's number one oil importer, with the major manufacturing hub being home to around 26 million.

Investing.com – Nio ADRs (NYSE:NIO) traded 5.8% higher Monday after the EV-maker delivered the first batch of its smart electric flagship sedan ET7 to users.
The automaker has claimed a driving range of up to 621 miles from a 150 kWh battery pack for the ET7, a feature most users worry about - the distance an electric vehicle will run on a single charge.
This compares with Lucid Air’s 520 miles for the 19-inch wheel, the longest-range EV rated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) so far.
Nio's first model on the second-generation technology platform NT2.0 comes standard with over 100 configurations and is equipped with a brand-new software system called Banyan. According to reports, the vehicle’s specifications are not yet certified by the regulator Environmental Protection Agency.
The company rolled out the first batch of vehicles at its plant in Hefei. This will be followed by exports to Norway, Germany and then the rest of Europe.
The company is currently offering two variants of ET7, the regular model and the first edition, with pre-subsidy prices of RMB 448,000 ($70,400) and RMB 526,000 ($82,500), respectively. Customers who choose the battery rental service will see the starting price slashed by at least RMB 70,000, according to InsideEVs."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group China on Monday said that their Shanghai operations have not been affected by the city's lockdown to try to stem the spread of COVID-19. 
Both companies operate factories in the city as part of joint ventures with state-owned Chinese automaker SAIC Motor Corp. 
A GM spokesperson told Reuters that its manufacturing facilities were operating normally. 
The snap lockdown announced on Sunday splits China's most populous city roughly along the Huangpu River for nine days to allow for ""staggered"" coronavirus testing. 
GM's Shanghai factories sit to the east of the river in areas that have been locked down from Monday to Friday for authorities to carry out mass testing. 
The company did not immediately comment on what measures it had put in place to keep production lines running, but Shanghai has said that factories that put in ""closed-loop"" systems can continue production. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which also has a factory on the east side of the river, has suspended production for four days after it was unable to put in such a system, sources told Reuters on Monday.
Volkswagen Group China said its operations in Anting, Shanghai, were unaffected by the lockdown, adding that it is monitoring the situation day by day. 

Anting is in the west of Shanghai, where lockdown is scheduled to start on April 1. 
Volkswagen operations in the northeastern city of Changchun, however, remain suspended. Its production there has been halted since March 14 because of a COVID-19 lockdown.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, with news of a stock split by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) supporting a market that was otherwise burdened by rising bond yields and signs of an inflation-driven slowdown in consumer spending. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GM), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 156 points, or 0.5%, at 34,705 points. The broader S&P 500, however, was down less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
The most eye-catching early move was by Tesla stock, which gained 6.0% to its highest in over two months after the electric vehicle maker said it intends to split its stock, a move that typically makes it more attractive to small investors. To what extent that still holds in an age where electronic brokerages routinely offer fractional stocks isn't entirely clear. The news was, in any case, offset by the fact that Tesla's factory in Shanghai is set to remain shut this week due to rolling lockdowns imposed across the city of 25 million people. The factory currently produces just under 10,000 vehicles per week.
Over the last two weeks, stocks have made up more than all the losses they suffered in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - and then some. That's despite a sharp rise in bond yields that threatens to raise capital costs for the economy at large. A string of Federal Reserve officials last week hinted that they would have to accelerate their plans for raising interest rates in order to get inflation back under control.
Bond markets remained under pressure early Monday in New York, with short-dated yields continuing to rise, although longer-maturity yields eased on the back of growing confidence that the Fed won't fall any further behind the curve on inflation.
Inflation was behind one of the other main pieces of news from the weekend: the Japanese newspaper The Nikkei reported that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to cut production of its iPhone SE, AirPods and other hardware in response to weakening demand for products whose prices have always carried a substantial premium. Apple was, last week, reported to be looking at introducing subscription plans for hardware, another move that suggested that customers are starting to balk at high prices. 
Elsewhere, Poly (NYSE:POLY) stock rose 50% after HP (NYSE:HPQ) agreed to buy the maker of working-from-home apps in a deal worth $3.1 billion, including debt. 
Oil and gas stocks retreated as crude prices came off their recent highs in response to the news of Shanghai's lockdowns, which will ban private cars from the streets while they last. The lockdowns, while not as severe as those seen in China at the start of the pandemic, are emblematic of what is now a countrywide struggle with the less dangerous but more transmissible strains of COVID-19 that have developed since the first wave of the virus in Wuhan two years ago.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia and soaring energy costs are unlikely to get trillions of euros in state aid that businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic received because the impact is smaller, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager last week loosened state aid rules allowing firms to get up to 400,000 euros ($438,520) in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs after thousands of companies from airlines to automakers reported disruptions to their supply chains.
She told Reuters in an interview there was a big difference between the current situation caused by sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic when more businesses were hit by national lockdowns, and that would limit the amount of aid handed out this time.
""It's really early days, but I wouldn't think so,"" Vestager said, when asked whether European Union governments would end up again pumping trillions of euros into sanctions-hit companies.
""Because you don't have sort of this blanket state intervention in how the market works, you know, having the states coming in, the governments coming in and basically just telling everyone to hibernate,"" she said.
Vestager has so far approved more than 3 trillion euros ($3.29 trillion) in aid for pandemic-hit companies under relaxed rules adopted two years ago.
She reiterated that those rules will not be extended.

The analyst expects Ford to miss and GM to top the consensus analyst estimates for Q1E EPS, although he adds that its still too early to call the Q1 setup.
Michaeli believes both Ford and GM will be able to maintain their 2022 EBIT guidance, based on the recent pricing data points. However, the analyst sees a greater risk at Ford due to the carmakers high dependence on stronger Q2-Q4 production and Europe exposure.
Even though the NT space remains fluid, Citi believes that certain mid-term implications could benefit pickup trucks and reinforce the earnings power for LT, as well as boost its SoP potential.
Michaeli maintained GM as the top pick, slightly lowering the price target from $100 to $95. The analyst also maintained its Neutral rating on Ford, slashing the target to $18 from $23.
The slashed PT for Ford reflects the estimate changes and lower target multiples that reflect risk tied to a more back-half loaded 2022 outlook plus incremental risk in Europe.

Shares in HP (NYSE:HPQ), which expects the deal will position it for long-term growth, fell 1.4% in premarket trade. 
The company has offered $40 for each share of Poly, formerly known as Plantronics (NYSE:POLY), which represents a premium of about 53% to the stock's last closing price. Including debt, the deal is valued at $3.3 billion.
""The rise of the hybrid office creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the way work gets done,"" HP Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said.
With the global healthcare crisis boosting the need for hybrid work, the market has seen several acquisitions, including business software maker Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)'s $27.7-billion purchase of workplace messaging app Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc last year.

Poly, whose shares rose 49% in premarket trade, said it would be required to pay a fee of $66 million if the deal is terminated.

Tesla's share price fell nearly 38% from November highs to hit a multi-month low last month. Since the February 23 low, Tesla stock price has soared over 32% to return trading above the $1,000 handle.
Moreover, Tesla shares are up a further 6.5% in pre-open Monday on an announced stock split.
Sacconaghi noted that TSLA has been remarkably resilient amid a market pullback that hit growth stocks the most.
""Tesla's EPS estimates have climbed 30%, while traditional auto OEMs have fallen 8% - accordingly, on a relative basis, valuation have converged by ~ 40%. The same is true among other EV markers, where relative valuations have fallen by about 30% vs. traditional auto OEMs. So is the recent valuation change reflective of the broader market rotation, or are investors getting more comfortable with traditional auto OEMs future prospects and ability to compete in an EV world? The data supports the former, but there may be some modest fundamental compression in relative valuations as well,"" the analyst said in a client note.
Still, Tesla is valued at around $1.1 trillion by the market today, while Sacconaghi reminds investors that the14 largest traditional auto OEMs (who sell 99% of all cars, including 2% that are electric) have a collective market cap of $0.9T.
Hence, Tesla's market cap concentration (86% of the EV space, and 49% of the automotive space appears at odds with the fragmented and global nature of the auto market.
Net-net, Sacconaghi reiterated an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target on Tesla as risk/reward at current levels is not attractive.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) shares rose on Monday as Italy's biggest telecoms company confirmed CVC's interest in taking a stake in its enterprise service arm, while it is also weighing a takeover approach for the group by KKR.
The CVC move comes as newly-appointed TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to split TIM's service business from its network operations as part of a broader strategy to revamp the former phone monopoly.
TIM said CVC proposed setting up an entity including connectivity operations for big corporate clients as well cloud, cybersecurity and IoT services, in which the European private equity firm would take a minority stake, confirming what sources told Reuters on Saturday..
TIM added in statement that its talks with U.S. fund KKR to assess the ""attractiveness, actuality and deliverability"" of its 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) approach for the group as a whole were ongoing.
Shares in TIM were up 3% on Monday at 0.34 euro after the stock hit a record low of 0.22 earlier this month. The price remains well below the 0.505 euro price at which the KKR approach was pitched late last year.
BOARD MEETING
The TIM board will have a first look at the CVC proposal at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday and also assess the state of play with the KKR approach.
KKR submitted its non-binding takeover proposal for TIM in November, having already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network last year.
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group ""untapped value"".
TIM, which is grappling with fierce competition in its domestic market, was hit by multiple downgrades by rating agencies this month after it unveiled a record annual loss and a weak outlook. 
Last week KKR said it remained interested in taking over TIM but also wants to discuss the phone group's own plans to combine its fixed line assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber.
While TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) billed KKR's proposal as too low, state lender CDP is advocating a tie-up of TIM's fixed network assets with those of Open Fiber to avoid a costly duplication of investment to upgrade the national network.

CDP, which owns a 10% holding in TIM, controls a 60% stake in the smaller rival fiber optic firm.
Sources have also said a compromise with KKR could be possible, whereby TIM seeks to deepen existing cooperation with the U.S. fund, involving it in its plans to split off its fixed network infrastructure and merge it with that of Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9106 euros)

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A deal between EU countries and EU lawmakers that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be agreed next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.
EU countries and EU lawmakers are now thrashing out the details, with debate over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.
""There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we're lucky, it may be possible,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.
Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation.
Vestager said there would be no extension as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.
""Well, actually both I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,"" she said.
""And since both the prohibitions and the obligations are things that come from established case law, I don't think any of them are sort of big surprises.""

Asked whether the DMA would cover non-U.S. tech giants, Vestager said: ""It's likely but I don't know.""
Observers said booking.com and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) may fall under the new rules.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 07:51AM ET</span>",Analysis-U.S. mulls shaking up stock trading rules to aid small investors,"By Katanga Johnson and John McCrank
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's regulator is considering changes to stock market rules to increase competition for orders and improve deals for retail investors, according to its top official Gary Gensler and industry executives. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scrutinizing the practice of payment-for-order-flow (PFOF), in which wholesale market-markers pay brokers like TD Ameritrade, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets and E*Trade to route retail customer orders to them instead of to exchanges. The SEC review could lead to the biggest shake-up of U.S. equity market rules in over a decade.
Robinhood makes around 75% of its revenue from PFOF. The trading app and others say the practice on average gives retail investors a fractionally better deal than exchanges, allowing them to drop commissions and democratize investing.
Critics say payment for order flow can create conflicts of interest, and also encourages brokers to add video game-like bells and whistles to their apps and websites that prompt investors to trade more, which boosts the broker's profit but is rarely the best investment strategy. Britain, Canada and Australia have banned PFOF and Gensler suggested in August that the SEC could go that route. 
PFOF drew new scrutiny last year when an army of retail investors went on a buying spree of ""meme stocks"" like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that had shorted the shares. Many purchased the shares using commission-free brokers like Robinhood that accept PFOF from a few powerful market-makers.
The largest, Citadel Securities, says it controls 35% to 40% of all U.S. retail order flow. Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) controls about 25%, according to an analysis of SEC data by BestEx Research.
The SEC is exploring whether retail brokers are sending PFOF customer orders to the wholesaler paying them the most, rather than the venue that offers the best deal.
""When one party is paying a platform for the order flow, that can be in conflict with a retail customer getting best execution,"" SEC chair Gensler said in an interview. ""They're not getting order-by-order competition.""
Some brokers, like Fidelity, say they can get good stock prices for customers and offer free stock trading without accepting PFOF. 
A Robinhood spokeswoman pointed to a study by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors who found Robinhood customers enjoyed more than $8 billion in price improvements from 2020-2021 thanks to PFOF.
A spokesperson for TD Ameritrade said the current market structure delivers ""great outcomes"" for investors and the company supports efforts to make it even better. 
A PFOF ban is on the table, Gensler told Reuters, but he said the practice is also just a symptom of a broader problem: exchanges are not competing on an equal footing with the off-exchange market, where around 40%-50% of trading takes place.
The national benchmark for measuring the best deal is flawed because it does not include these off-exchange trades, he added. 
""Here's the focus around new market structure rules: How might we promote a more level playing field?,"" Gensler said. 
The SEC is also mulling making it easier for exchanges to compete with market-makers for orders by allowing exchanges to offer sub-penny pricing, and by changing the definition of ""best execution,"" said Gensler and other industry executives. 
Several executives said they doubted the SEC would actually ban PFOF. Virtu Financial CEO Doug Cifu said his firm would be one of many to challenge such a move in court.
""PFOF and rebates have really fostered incredible innovation and competition in the marketplace,"" Cifu told Reuters, adding that if the SEC bans the practice ""they are looking at a very long fight."" 
He and other industry executives said the SEC should enhance retail brokers' disclosures so small investors are better informed on the pros and cons of PFOF. Gensler said the SEC was also reviewing disclosures. 
""As long as it is transparent and disclosed, I don't see a conflict,"" said Kirsten Wegner, CEO of the Modern Markets Initiative which represents automated trading firms.
COMPETITIVE BOOST
Investor advocates support better disclosures and also want to boost exchanges' competitiveness to improve the reliability of the national pricing benchmark, known as the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). 
Current ""best execution"" rules require retail brokers to route customer orders to a venue offering the best price displayed on the exchange, or better, and market-makers typically improve on the best price by a fraction of a cent.
Exchanges cannot offer sub-penny quotes, but the SEC is considering allowing it. It is also mulling a rule, similar to one in Canada, requiring retail brokers to execute orders on an exchange unless the off-exchange price is significantly better, said Dave Lauer, CEO of financial platform Urvin Finance, and one other industry source with knowledge of the SEC's thinking.
Wholesalers provide a 15% improvement on the NBBO spread, but moving retail flow to exchanges would narrow NBBO spreads by 25%, according to research by Hitesh Mittal, CEO of BestEx Research. 
""Institutional investors and market makers would better compete with exchanges for retail flow by narrowing the bid offer spread,"" he said. 

Ty Gellasch, executive director of investor trade Healthy Markets who has also discussed the issue with the SEC, said he expects the agency to clarify that ""best execution"" requires brokers to obtain the best available price rather than a fractional price improvement. 
""I expect it will say to the industry: 'you have to give the customers the best prices,'"" he said.

Investing.com – Meituan stock (HK:3690) closed nearly 12% higher in Hong Kong trading Monday after its fourth-quarter revenue came in ahead of estimates.
The company followed its results with a positive commentary, saying it aimed to improve profitability by cutting back on the financial incentives that it provides to users.
“Despite obvious top-down challenges (Omicron, macro), Meituan management struck a confident tone on Friday’s calls, noting that activity levels tended to recover quickly after lockdowns ended (e.g., citing evidence in Shenzhen in recent days),” Bloomberg quoted Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu as writing in a note.
Meituan “pointed to plans for a meaty cut in food-delivery user incentives this year, and focusing on mid- and high-frequency users as drivers of business growth,” Zhu wrote in the note.
Meituan, whose services also include restaurant reviews and bike-sharing, said revenue rose to 49.52 billion yuan ($7.78 billion) in the final three months of 2021, up about 31%.
Heavy capex, including in its community e-commerce unit Meituan Select, more than doubled Meituan’s quarterly loss to 5.34 billion yuan with CEO Wang Xing telling analysts that he expects its operating loss to narrow in 2022.
Meituan is among the several Chinese tech platforms battling the government’s heightened scrutiny of their trade practices. Authorities have called upon food delivery firms to pay more to their drivers and cap the commission they charge restaurants.
According to Reuters, the company has committed to lowering the commission charged to some merchants.
Meituan's food delivery-related cost, which includes paying delivery riders, rose over 38% to 68.18 billion yuan.
Sales from food delivery, accounting for over half of Meituan's revenue, were up by more than a fifth and topped 26 billion yuan.

Revenue at the group, which owns U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork processor, grew 6.7% in 2021 to $27.29 billion, according to a company filing. 
Profit before biological fair value adjustments rose after low hog prices reduced product costs in China while higher sales and a reduction in COVID-19 related expenses in the U.S. outweighed an increase in raw material costs, the company said. 
WH Group reported a 1.3% rise in the sales of packaged meats, its core business, to 3.32 million tonnes in 2021.
Sales volume in China, however, dropped by 1.6% in a consumer market lacking growth momentum. 
Hog prices in China plunged last year as farmers rebuilt herds after an epidemic of African swine fever but COVID-19 outbreaks dampened demand. 
WH Group told reporters that Chinese hog prices would remain low in the first half of 2022 before rising in the second half. Most analysts expect prices to remain low this year.
Rising commodity prices and production costs would remain a challenge it said, with its import and export business also affected by the pandemic - one executive noted longer shipment cycles and customs processes and higher costs. 
WH Group's China business Shuanghui Development reported a 22.2% fall in net profit to 4.87 billion yuan ($764.69 million) on lower hog and meat prices, and said profit from frozen products and pork imports had dropped considerably. 
Shuanghui was recently forced to apologise after a local media investigation uncovered food safety issues at one of its plants.

WH Group last year removed executive director Wan Hongjian, chairman Wan Long's son, citing untrue allegations he made against the company.

(Reuters) - SpaceX has ended production of new Crew Dragon astronaut capsules, a company executive told Reuters, as Elon Musk's space transportation company heaps resources on its next-generation spaceship program. 
Capping the fleet at four Crew Dragons adds more urgency to the development of the astronaut capsule's eventual successor, Starship, SpaceX's moon and Mars rocket. Starship's debut launch has been delayed for months by engine development hurdles and regulatory reviews.
It also poses new challenges as the company learns how to maintain a fleet and quickly fix unexpected problems without holding up a busy schedule of astronaut missions. 
""We are finishing our final (capsule), but we still are manufacturing components, because we'll be refurbishing,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters, confirming the plan to end Crew Dragon manufacturing.
She added that SpaceX would retain the capability to build more capsules if a need arises in the future, but contended that ""fleet management is key.""
Musk's business model is underpinned by reusable spacecraft, so it was inevitable the company would cease production at some point. But the timing was not known, nor was his strategy of using the existing fleet for its full backlog of missions. 
Crew Dragon has flown five crews of government and private astronauts to space since 2020, when it flew its first pair of NASA astronauts and became the U.S. space agency's primary ride for getting humans to and from the International Space Station.
After each flight, the capsules undergo refurbishment at SpaceX facilities in Florida, which the company calls ""Dragonland.""
""There's lifetime cycle issues, where once you start using it the third, fourth, fifth time, you start finding different things,"" said retired NASA astronaut and former SpaceX executive Garrett Reisman, who now consults for the company on human spaceflight matters. 
""SpaceX is really good about identifying these issues quickly and then acting quickly to fix them,"" Reisman added, pointing to an investigation in 2021 in which SpaceX discovered and fixed within months a toilet leak aboard a Crew Dragon capsule that had flown humans twice. 
NASA has given SpaceX some $3.5 billion to help develop and subsequently use Crew Dragon for six flights to the space station. It added three more missions to fill in for delays with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's Starliner capsule.
SpaceX has flown four crews of astronauts to the space station under its NASA contract at roughly $255 million per flight. The company carried out a fully private mission last year with four passengers, including a billionaire entrepreneur who funded the flight, for a three-day trip in Earth orbit.
At least four more private astronaut missions on Crew Dragon are planned with Houston-based space station builder and spaceflight manager Axiom Space, with the first so-called Ax-1 mission scheduled for April carrying four entrepreneurs to the space station to conduct scientific research.
Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, has focused intensely in recent years on the company's hasty development of a re-usable Starship, the centerpiece of Musk's aim to eventually colonize Mars. 
Like Crew Dragon, SpaceX's workhorse reusable rocket, the Falcon 9, and its more powerful variant Falcon Heavy are also refurbished after each flight, and not every component is able to fly to space more than once.

""The goal is to get more and more like aircraft operations, where you can take the vehicle after it lands, fill it back up with gas and oxygen, and go again very rapidly,"" Reisman said.
""Starship, if it achieves its design objectives, would be able to affordably replace everything that Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon can do.""

Lavery downgraded shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) to Underweight from Neutral with a $29.00 per share price target, down from the prior $50.00.
The analyst is bearish on key fundamentals, while the growing competitive intensity and pessimism around the US McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) partnership have also contributed to Lavery moving to Underweight. He reminds investors that BYND is still burning cash with no clear path to positive EBITDA.
It remains committed to lowering prices below that of animal protein (despite current inflation) by 2024, which likely drives prices down more than it lifts volumes. A nationwide MCD launch the headline impact we had anticipated, as skepticism around its in-market performance likely overshadows the news itself (and an LTO looks more likely than a permanent item), Lavery said in a client note.
The lowered price target reflects lower 2022E and 2023E sales, in addition to the lowered EV/Sales multiple to reflect the company's growth, profitability, and balance sheet.
The analyst also shared key findings from Pipers survey, which showed that 31% of respondents said they would try plant-based meat if it were cheaper than animal meat.
With Beyond's historical ~45% repeat rate, this would imply ~15% volume lift. We would also expect a small lift in increased consumption by current users, but that plus the lift from new consumers would still not be enough to offset the large price cuts, resulting in a potentially large net sales decline, the analyst concludes.

(Reuters) - TPG Inc said on Monday its fourth-quarter after-tax distributable earnings rose 34% year-on-year, driven by strong asset sales across its portfolio of private equity, impact investment, growth equity, and real estate assets.
The performance of many private equity firms were boosted by a record-breaking year of deal-making in 2021, buoyed by buoyant public markets, the availability of cheap capital owing to low interest rates, and economic recovery from COVID-19 pandemic.
TPG's peers Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc all reported record fourth quarter earnings as the firms sold off assets for top dollar last year.
The Forth Worth, Texas-based firm said its after-tax distributable earnings, which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to $137 million from a $102 million a year earlier. 
Its after-tax distributable earnings slightly exceeded the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $133 million for the fourth quarter, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
TPG said it generated $7 billion from asset divestments across its portfolio in the quarter and spent $8 billion for new acquisitions, mostly in its private equity and real estate businesses. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, TPG reported a 46% drop in net income to $326 million, owing to a slowdown in revenue from capital allocation activities. TPG said it ended the quarter with $114 billion in assets under management and $28.4 billion in unspent capital. 
Buyout firms face a more challenging year in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates to combat inflation and is expected to begin unwinding its bond-buying program, thus ending the era of easy financing for leveraged buyouts. 
TPG said it still expects to capitalize on opportunities to invest in the current climate, particularly among growth-oriented companies that are shelving or postposting plans to go public amid a slowdown in stock market valuations.
""The IPO and SPAC markets are essentially shut down right now, particularly across the growth investing landscape, and we think it creates more opportunity for us because they are competitors to private equity as companies look for sources of capital,"" TPG Chief Executive Officer Jon Winkelried said in an interview.

""We're looking to be capital partners with really interesting strong companies but in the private markets.""
TPG made its stock market debut in January after raising $1.1 billion from an initial public offering that valued the firm at $9 billion.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - As Rio de Janeiro residents sheltered at home last year during the deadliest phase of Brazil's COVID-19 outbreak, police detective Gabriel Ferrando said he got a tip that something suspicious was upending local internet service.
Access had vanished across broad swaths of Morro da Formiga, or Ant Hill, a tough neighborhood on the city's north side. When Ferrando quizzed a technician from broadband provider TIM SA tasked with fixing the outage, the worker, whom he declined to name, said armed men had chased him away with a warning not to return.
Turns out a new internet provider had claimed this turf: a company whose investors at one time included an accused drug and arms trafficker with alleged ties to Brazil's notorious Red Command crime syndicate, according to Ferrando, court documents filed by authorities and business registration records viewed by Reuters. Using stolen equipment, some of it pilfered from TIM, the newcomers soon had their own internet service up and running, Ferrando said. Residents could sign up with the new firm, he said - or do without. 
TIM, a unit of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA, declined to comment, referring all inquiries to Brazil's telecom industry association Conexis. In a statement, the group called on the nation's law enforcement to act to protect legitimate operators.
Ferrando, a veteran of Rio's top organized crime unit, is trying to do just that. In a sealed report documenting months of investigation, he asked Rio state prosecutors in February to pursue charges against the purported pirates. The prosecutors' office did not respond to a request for comment. No charges have been filed. 
Morro da Formiga isn't the only community reporting troubles. Reuters interviewed nearly two dozen telecom industry executives, law enforcement officials, technicians, academics and internet customers in Brazil, and reviewed thousands of pages of court filings submitted by police.
The people and documents described an audacious takeover of internet service in dozens of neighborhoods in Brazil's major cities by companies associated with alleged criminals unafraid to use force and intimidation to push out rivals. The result, these sources said, is that tens of thousands of Brazilians now depend on unreliable, second-rate broadband networks estimated by industry and law enforcement officials to be generating millions of dollars annually for purported crooks.
Bootleg providers can be unresponsive when service crashes and impatient when a bill is missed, some customers told Reuters. In Rio's working-class Campo Grande neighborhood, a resident described how someone knocks on his door monthly to collect 35 reais ($6.80) - in cash.
There's ""pressure to pay on the day that they choose with no delay,"" said the customer, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. 
It's a reliable revenue stream made all the more lucrative by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced families online for school, work and shopping. In 2020 alone, the proportion of Brazilian households with an internet connection grew by more than 12 percentage points to 83%, according to the most recent data available from Cetic.br, an information technology organization.
Pirates are plundering equipment and infrastructure, too, much of it re-purposed for their makeshift networks, authorities and telecom executives said. Theft and destruction of telecommunications gear rose 34% in 2020 from 2019, representing about 1 billion reais ($194 million) in direct annual losses, according to Feninfra, an industry group whose members include installers and repair workers. It said that figure rose another 16% in the first half of 2021. 
THE ALLEGED SCHEME
Brazil's telecom industry is not alone in its struggles. Crime groups for years have controlled distribution of cooking gas, jugs of drinking water and other basics in many low-income urban neighborhoods.
But by building their own broadband networks, Brazil's criminals are raising their sophistication, according to more than 20 technicians, industry representatives and law enforcement officials interviewed by Reuters. They said the scheme typically works like this:
First, thieves steal or vandalize equipment belonging to traditional broadband operators. When repair teams arrive, they are menaced by armed men who warn them not to come back. Last year in Rio alone, no-go zones rose to 105 locations for  Oi  SA (OTC:OIBRQ), one of Brazil's largest internet providers. That figure has quadrupled since 2019, according to data supplied by the company.
Shortly after service is interrupted, telecom companies associated with organized crime groups set up their own networks, piggybacking on existing infrastructure. In some cases, these outfits are run directly by members of drug trafficking gangs including the Red Command or the Pure Third Command, one of its main rivals. Others are run by militias – a type of criminal outfit composed of retired and off-duty cops. In other cases, they are operated by businessmen who pay kickbacks to gangsters to clear out the competition.
Often the interlopers receive help from crooked employees of major providers who sell them expertise and pilfered gear, according to Rio state prosecutor Antonio Pessanha. He told Reuters he's investigating criminal activity in the telecom sector in and around Rio city, the state's capital.
In one recent case, an employee of Claro, the local unit of Mexico's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) SAB de CV, offered to sell company equipment to organized crime associates, according to a recorded phone call that Pessanha said his office obtained through a court-approved wiretap. He did not specify what criminal organization the people in the call were allegedly affiliated with, nor did he identify the Claro employee or the other participants. The investigation is ongoing, and Reuters was not provided access to the recording.
Claro declined to comment on the alleged incident. 
NEW PLAYER IN ANT HILL
In Morro da Formiga, detective Ferrando said he began receiving anonymous tips from some of its roughly 5,000 residents in the first half of 2021 who said broadband services provided by major operators had stopped working.
One company dominates there now, Ferrando said, a firm named JPConnect Servicos de Telecomunicacoes. It was established in 2019, according to corporate registration documents filed with the Rio government and seen by Reuters.
Those records show that until late last year JPConnect was part-owned by an individual named Paulo Cesar Souza dos Santos Jr., whom authorities allege is a member of Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, Rio's largest organized criminal group. In 2011, Rio state prosecutors indicted dos Santos for drug and weapons trafficking, according to court records viewed by Reuters. He was later acquitted. 
Dos Santos transferred his 50% stake in JPConnect in September 2021 to another investor, Alexandre Rodrigues de Almeida, according to the registration documents. 
In January, police officers searched JPConnect's headquarters in Morro da Formiga, according to Ferrando. He said the cops found equipment belonging to TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil (NYSE:VIV) SA, the local unit of Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) SA. All of those companies declined to comment on Ferrando's allegations.
The JPConnect investigation hasn't been previously reported. Authorities haven't filed charges in the case. Reuters could not reach officials at JPConnect. The company's registered telephone number is not functioning. 
Dos Santos and Almeida declined to comment through their lawyer. Their attorney, Eberthe Vieira de Souza Gomes, said JPConnect operates legally and had gained market share by offering a quality product. He said dos Santos has no connection to any criminal organization, pointing out that his client was acquitted of all charges related to his 2011 indictment. Reuters confirmed dos Santos' acquittal via Rio state court documents. Those documents did not specify the year of his acquittal.
TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil referred questions to Conexis, the telecom trade association. In an interview, Marcos Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), the group's president, described a litany of woes facing Brazil's industry generally, including vandalism, theft, threats to employees and hijacking of service areas by players with suspected ties to the underworld.
Authorities must ""inhibit this type of criminal action,"" Ferrari said.
In greater Rio there are several other broadband operators under investigation for allegedly rough tactics and links to purported criminals, authorities said.
Among them is Net&Com, which made headlines in March 2021 when Rio police raided its downtown headquarters as part of a broader probe into an alleged drug ring. Police have publicly stated that they are investigating the firm for allegedly paying criminals associated with the Red Command to help them take over the telecoms market in poor neighborhoods throughout metropolitan Rio.
More than three dozen people, including purported members of the Red Command, last year were charged with drug and weapons trafficking and conspiracy, according to court documents filed by Rio prosecutors and viewed by Reuters. They are currently on trial and have maintained their innocence.
In documents laying out the government's case, authorities alleged the ring also profited by accepting kickbacks from Net&Com to chase telecom competitors out of neighborhoods where the company now operates. Net&Com and its executives have not been charged.
Pedro Santiago, a lawyer for Net&Com, said the company was an upstanding operator that had been the ""victim of a witch hunt."" Santiago said he had reviewed many hours of police wiretaps and that these showed no link between the firm and any criminal elements.
Police dispute that characterization in court documents seen by Reuters, citing as evidence allegedly stolen equipment and conversations among co-conspirators mentioning the alleged role of Net&Com.

Pessanha, the Rio state prosecutor, said the investigation continues.
""The new gold for the criminal underworld,"" he said, ""is the internet.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nearly 60% of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shareholders voted last week against a plan to spin off its devices business, a breakdown of the vote showed.
A separate call from activist shareholder 3D Investment Partners for a private equity buyout was rejected by just short of 55% of shareholders who voted. Both proposals needed 50% of the vote to pass at last Thursday's extraordinary meeting.
With the two competing proposals both voted down, the Japanese conglomerate is left to seek alternatives, potentially focusing on new CEO Taro Shimada's plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware.

There was widespread opposition to the management-backed plan to spin off the devices business, including from Toshiba's three biggest shareholders and proxy shareholder advisory firms.
The proposal from 3D, Toshiba's second-biggest shareholder with a stake of more than 7%, had the backing of other activist shareholders but proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had advised against it.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 07:18AM ET</span>","Apple to cut iPhone, AirPods output - Nikkei","(Reuters) -Apple Inc is planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown caused by the Ukraine crisis and rising inflation, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, citing sources briefed on the matter.
The company plans to produce 20% fewer iPhone SEs - or about 2 million to 3 million units - next quarter than originally planned, the report said. It added that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also reduced 2022 orders for AirPods by more than 10 million units.
Apple, whose shares were down about 2% in premarket trading, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The news of weaker demand mirrors forecasts from analysts who have warned that COVID-19 lockdowns in Chinese cities and a surge in inflation due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand this year.
Apple, in particular, faces challenges from the lack of a design upgrade for the latest SE and a $30 increase in its price from the 2020 model, analysts have said. 
Ming-Chi Kuo at TF International Securities on Monday slashed his shipment estimate for iPhone SE this year to between 15 million and 20 million units, from 25 million to 30 million units previously.

""It looks very similar to the iPhone SE (2020), a second refurbishment of the iPhone 8, and it is even less likely to arouse consumer demand,"" Taiwan-based Isaiah Research analyst Eddie Han said, cutting his forecast sales for the model by 5 million units. 
Apple is expected to launch a brand new iPhone lineup later this year, but analysts say it was too early to forecast any impact on the upcoming range.

After nine straight sessions of gains, the stock fell 2% as of 6:36 a.m. in New York premarket trading, moving it further away from fully erasing its year-to-date drop. As of Friday’s close, the stock was down just 1.6% in 2022.
The Cupertino, California-based company plans to reduce output of iPhone SEs by about 20% next quarter compared with its original plan because of signs that consumer-electronics demand is being hurt by the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, Nikkei reported, citing unidentified people. The company told multiple suppliers it was lowering production orders by 2 million to 3 million units for the quarter, according to the report.
Apple this month updated its iPhone SE line for the first time since 2020 and added 5G network support, possibly in an effort to persuade consumers with older iPhones to upgrade and lure Android users.
The company also cut orders for its AirPod earphones by more than 10 million units for 2022, according to the Nikkei report. Since their 2016 launch, AirPods have become the most widely sold truly wireless earphones, helping Apple grab more than 25% global market share, according to research firm Counterpoint.
Shares of some Apple suppliers also fell, with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) Inc. down 2.4% in premarket and  Varta AG  (F:VAR1) declining 3.4% in Frankfurt after the Nikkei report.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) was 5% higher in premarket trading Monday, as the company initiated measures aimed at a stock split.
The company announced that its board has approved an increase in the number of authorized shares to enable a split in the form of a stock dividend.
While the stock dividend will be contingent on final board approval, the company will seek shareholder consent for the increase in its authorized share capital at its upcoming annual general meeting next month.
The stock closed 0.3% lower Friday at $1,010.64, giving the company a market cap of over $1 trillion.
Tesla’s equity base comprises 1.03 billion shares. Its shares are up over 63% in the last year compared to 7.8% gains in the Nasdaq Composite, a reflection of the rapid embrace of electric vehicles the world over.
Tesla last split its stock in August 2020 at a 5-for-1 ratio. The stock has more than doubled since then.
A split doesn’t change anything fundamentally for the stock, but does make it accessible to more retail investors who tend to buy stocks based on their absolute value, ignoring their real value."

The company has notified its workers and suppliers of the move, the people said. 
It initially attempted to create a closed loop to continue production and called workers in on Sunday, one of the sources said. However, it allowed them to leave that evening after it decided it did not have enough provisions for them, the source added. 
Tesla declined to comment on whether production had been suspended. In a statement to Reuters it said that it always strived to fulfil its epidemic prevention responsibilities and that it believed Shanghai's COVID-19 measures helped lay the foundation for the city's future development. 
Shanghai said on Sunday it would lock down the city in two stages to carry out COVID-19 testing over nine days. 
Authorities said they would divide Shanghai in two for the exercise, using the Huangpu River that passes through the city as a guide. 
The Tesla factory is in the Lingang district of Pudong new area, which is part of Shanghai's first lockdown stage. Its lockdown started early on Monday and is scheduled to last until Friday morning.
Tesla had already in mid-March suspended production at the Shanghai factory for two days after the city rolled out strict movement controls and carried out mass testing.

Its Shanghai factory produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub to Germany and Japan. It delivered 56,515 vehicles in February, including 33,315 for export, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
That amounts to an average of about 2,018 vehicles a day.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Bill Gates-backed Heliogen has secured funding from top Australian oil and gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum for a full-scale trial of its concentrated-solar-power (CSP) technology ahead of a planned push into Australia.
Aiming to invest $5 billion in new-energy products by 2030, Woodside has also agreed to buy a stake in Heliogen, the two companies said on Monday. They did not state the size of Woodside's planned stake or the price.
Technologies such as Heliogen's use mirrors to concentrate solar energy from a large area, creating intense heat for industrial processes or generating electricity.
Heliogen, now valued at $968 million, went public in January, positioning it to begin making mirrors and other equipment for its modules. Gates was an early investor in the company.
Woodside will fund Heliogen's first full-scale, 5 megawatt module at a site in the Mojave desert. The U.S. government is contributing $39 million to cover the undisclosed cost.
""As soon as we finish this first demonstration in California, we want a blitz in Australia as fast as possible,"" Heliogen founder and chief executive Bill Gross told Reuters in an interview, giving no timeframe for completing the trial.
Woodside could potentially use Heliogen's CSP for its own operations and to produce hydrogen for export, Gross said. It could also market the modules to Australian mining companies and other remote energy users.
""Our collaboration with Heliogen on this innovative technology supports our commitment to building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio,"" Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said.
Gross estimated a mine would need between 100 and 1,000 of the 5 megawatt modules.
""If we build it at that scale, it will be cheaper than the fossil fuel they (the mines) burn, and, of course, it'll have no CO2 emissions,"" he said.
Heliogen's system uses thousands of mirrors controlled by smart software to precisely reflect sunlight to a 2.5 metre-diameter receiver on a tower, generating temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees C (1,800 degrees F).

Air heated by the receiver is stored in rocks or sand in an insulated tank. The heat can be used in industries such as those making cement or steel or to drive a turbine to generate electricity, which can then be used to power an electrolyser to make hydrogen.
The system costs less than rival CSP technology as it is smaller and quicker to build, Gross said. Each mirror is as big as a flat-screen TV, rather than a tennis court.

(Reuters) -Canadian vaccine maker Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine, approved last month in Canada, is facing limited growth in the near-term after the World Health Organization said it would not review the vaccine because the company is partly owned by U.S.-Swiss tobacco company Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), health experts say.
The WHO said at a briefing this month and in a follow-up statement to Reuters that it has not accepted an application for the vaccine because of its 2005 public health treaty requiring no involvement with any company that produces or promotes tobacco-based products.
Canada, which has provided millions of dollars in development funding to the company and has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses, defended its authorization of the vaccine, saying it needs a domestic bio-manufacturing industry to prepare for future pandemics. 
Health Canada said it believes it is in compliance with the WHO tobacco treaty.
The WHO tobacco treaty ""does not preclude the Government of Canada from working with Medicago on vaccine development and procurement to ensure that a ready and effective supply of vaccines is available for its population,"" a Health Canada spokesperson told Reuters.
Experts say a WHO authorization is key because the vaccine can then be part of the COVAX global vaccine program for low- and middle-income countries. While much of the developed world has already been vaccinated, Africa is still in desperate need of vaccines. WHO's approval can also stand in for countries that do not have their own drug regulatory agencies. 
The company has also pitched the platform as easily adaptable for new vaccines should there be a next pandemic. It is developing flu vaccines on the platform as well.
""I think that the WHO standards are going to pose a barrier to the uptake of the vaccine,"" said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Medicago would now need to approach European and U.S. regulators as well as any other individual countries one by one to attain approvals, a more difficult but not impossible barrier to use, Adalja said.
GLOBAL CUSTOMER BASE 
Medicago said it is in discussions with other potential customers worldwide.
The company has started the filing process for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Medicago Chief Executive Officer Takashi Nagao said in an emailed statement. 
The company has also started an early-to-mid stage study of the shot in Japan, and plans to file for regulatory approval in the spring, Nagao said.
It said it has not received an official communication from the WHO, but believed the decision was linked to its minority shareholder and not the safety and efficacy profile of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Swiss-American tobacco giant Philip Morris owns a 21% stake in the Quebec company. Japan's Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a unit of Mitsubishi Chemical Holding Corp, owns the rest of Medicago. 
Canadian health group Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control this week called on Canada to demand that Medicago replace Philip Morris as a stakeholder due to its tobacco business. Philip Morris has had a stake in the company since 2008.
A Philip Morris spokesperson said that the WHO's position was in opposition to its own call to accelerate vaccinations around the world. 
""Emergency use authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine has absolutely nothing to do with tobacco control,"" the spokesperson said. ""WHO policies should focus on accelerating medical progress and innovation."" 

Medicago’s Covifenz is the only authorized COVID-19 vaccine that is plant-based. To make the vaccine, the company uses nicotiana benthamiana, a cousin of the tobacco plant, as small bioreactors, growing non-infectious virus like particles that mimic the coronavirus. It is given with a boosting compound from British drugmaker  Glaxosmithkline  (LON:GSK). 
The United States and Europe, which already have several vaccines cleared for use, may still want Medicago's shot because of its plant-based technology, which would be useful to create a vaccine against the next problematic pathogen, according to Prashant Yadav, lecturer and supply chain expert at Harvard Medical School.

Investing.com – Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stock traded 2.7% higher Monday in Frankfurt after reports that Singapore’s Temasek, a long-term investor, is calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann.
Temasek has had longstanding concerns about Bayer’s operating performance under Baumann and the company’s lack of succession planning, grievances the state investor has communicated to the company, Bloomberg said.
According to the report, among the options Temasek is considering ahead of the shareholder meeting next month are requesting a no-confidence vote in Baumann or voting against ratifying the performance of the management. Either step would significantly raise pressure on Bayer’s board to rejig the leadership.
Temasek’s activist-type approach is rare for the firm. It built a roughly 4% stake in the German company in 2018, helping Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) complete the controversial $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). The deal, championed by Baumann, has cost the company billions of dollars in litigation amid charges that Monsanto’s product Roundup causes cancer.
Swiss investor Alatus has already objected to ratifying the performance of Baumann and his management team at Bayer’s April 29 meeting, pointing to a significant loss in market value during his tenure. Bayer shares have lost 39% since the Monsanto deal closed but are up 29% so far this year, according to Bloomberg.
Alatus, whose letter has been posted on Bayer’s website, said the company has failed to lay out a strategy that produces long-term growth for the crop science and pharmaceutical divisions. It also called for allowing shareholders to vote on members of Bayer’s management team individually at the meeting, rather than collectively.
Investor frustration with leadership could also trigger Bayer to revisit calls to break itself up into agriculture, pharmaceutical, and consumer healthcare units."

(Reuters) -Britain's Ted Baker said on Monday it had rejected two unsolicited takeover proposals from private-equity firm Sycamore Partners Management as they significantly undervalued the fashion retailer.
The company said the back-to-back proposals from New York-based Sycamore failed to ""compensate shareholders for the significant upside that can be delivered by Ted Baker as a listed company"".
Takeover interest in British companies is at its highest in years as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain's exit from the European Union have led to a steep drop in valuations. 
Sycamore had raised its proposal for Ted Baker to 137.5 pence per share on March 22, valuing the retailer at 253.8 million pounds ($333.65 million), after its initial proposal of 130 pence per share was turned down by the British group.
The revised proposal represents a premium of nearly 40% over Ted Baker's closing price on March 17, when the Sycamore approach was first reported. 
Sycamore, which has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed company, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Ted Baker's shares were down 3.3% at 122 pence as of 0930 GMT after the upmarket retailer disclosed the proposals. 
""It’s unsurprising that management’s not keen to give up the reins after a few difficult years,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""We’re finally starting to see some green shoots from the group’s turnaround efforts now that formal occasions are back on the social calendar."" 
Ted Baker is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it aims to boost savings and strengthen its online presence.
The group had faced setbacks, including profit warnings, management changes and an accounting scandal, since founder Ray Kelvin stepped down in 2019 amid misconduct allegations, which he denies. 
The coronavirus crisis compounded difficulties, as lockdowns and restrictions hammered retail operations and forced the company to cut hundreds of jobs.

The group's shares, which traded as high as 30 pounds in 2015, have since crashed to trade at 1.26 pounds as of Friday's close.

Investing.com --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) shares fell 3.7% by mid-morning in London on Monday after the U.K. bank warned it would take a hit to earnings due to having issued too many structured notes.
The bank said it expects a net charge against earnings of 450 million pounds ($590 million), and a drop of nearly 30 basis points in its core tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength closely tracked by regulators and investors.
Barclays also said it would delay the launch of its 1 billion pound share buyback as a result. It had announced that plan on February 23rd.
Structured notes are complex debt products that banks often tailor to meet the specific needs of certain fixed-income clients. Because of their complexity, regulators, buyers and the banks' risk management departments all have an incentive to keep the amount of such debt under firm limits.
In 2019, Barclays had tried to limit its issuance to $5 billion, but ended up registering $20.8 billion in maximum aggregate offering terms as of August 2019.
A statement by Barclays didn't explain how the error had happened, nor why it has taken nearly three years to uncover it."

(Reuters) - AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron said the movie-theater chain would embark on more ""transformational"" deals to capitalize on the interest of retail investors following its bet on a troubled gold and silver mine operator. 
AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment for a 22% stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp about two weeks ago, an unusual deal for a company operating more than 900 theaters worldwide that raised eyebrows among market observers. 
AMC's investment called upon a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" it raised in 2021 by selling its shares in the open market, in part on the back of retail investors who turned it into a popular 'meme' stock. 
Aron said in a phone interview from a limousine in Los Angeles en route to the Academy Awards on Sunday that AMC's investment in Hycroft had done well from the start. AMC bought Hycroft shares at $1.07, and they were trading at $1.32 last week.
""I'd like to think there will be more third-party external M&A announcements going forward where AMC can reach for the stars and intriguing investments that have potentially attractive returns,"" Aron told Reuters. 
AMC's stock in mid-March had fallen to around $14 but rebounded to more than $20 following the Hycroft investment.
Hycroft, which was on the verge of bankruptcy prior to a cash infusion from AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott, said on Friday it had subsequently raised nearly $195 million through open-market stock sales as other investors followed Aron's lead.
Aron said he expects AMC's investment, which includes shares and warrants, to be ""lucrative."" The deal was disclosed March 15, the day after Aron's tour of the company's mining operations in Northern Nevada outside Winnemucca, not far from the site of the annual Burning Man arts and music festival. 
Some analysts questioned AMC's investment, expressing concern that the bet is far afield from the company's core competency and wondering whether the money could be better spent repaying the chain's debt, which exceeded $5 billion at the end of 2021.
""TRANSFORMATIONAL M&A""
Aron defended the bet on Hycroft in the Reuters interview, arguing that it drew on AMC's own experience skirting bankruptcy less than two years ago, and pointing out that it had the support of retail investors. 
""Transformational M&A is mandatory. Our shareholder base has given us capital to deploy with the clear expectation that we are ... going to do exciting things with the money they entrusted to us,"" Aron said.
He added that the nearly $28 million investment was small relative to AMC's total cash, and that the company would still strengthen and expand its core business. He cited AMC's recent acquisition of former Arclight and Pacific cinema locations, and said the company had plans to add more premium screens at existing theaters and retire some of its debt. 
Aron said Hycroft is a company with solid assets that faced a liquidity crisis that reminded him of AMC's dire straits not long ago. Sprott's involvement buoyed Aron's confidence, he said.
""While the Hycroft investment is pretty far from home, it does rely on a core competency of our company to understand balance sheets, and raising cash, and solving liquidity problems,"" Aron said. 
SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK
New deals will not necessarily be so out of the mainstream for AMC, Aron said, pointing to the company's recent decision to launch a co-branded credit card and its move to sell branded popcorn at retail establishments. 
The common denominator, he said, will be feedback from shareholders. He now tweets nearly once a day and follows about 2,500 AMC retail investors on the social-media website. 
Aron's tweets have been read more than 200 million times since April, he said. He added he has also hosted sneak previews of films for some of these investors, and expects to do perhaps a dozen more of them this year. On earnings calls, AMC now takes questions from retail investors in addition to securities analysts. 

That's a shift from the traditional conference calls and road shows that companies have relied upon for communicating with institutional shareholders. 
""What's different is not the need to communicate with shareholders. What's different is who the shareholders are,"" Aron said.

1713,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 04:18AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Strategists Say Stocks Can Defy Bond Selloff For Now,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors shouldn’t fret about U.S. treasury yield curves inverting just yet, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists said, as a global bond selloff gathered pace.
“Recessions don’t typically start ahead of the curve inverting, and the lead-lag could be very substantial, as long as 2 years,” the strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. “Further, over this timeframe equities tended to beat bonds handsomely,” they said, adding that the peak in equity markets historically takes place around a year after the inversion.
U.S. stocks are on course for their best month this year, braving the war in Ukraine and the prospect of more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation. While a spike in commodity prices has raised concerns about the economic outlook, exacerbating the steepest bond rout of the modern era, equities have so far remained largely immune to recession jitters. 
“Recessions only started on average 16 months after the inversion in the spread, and never before,” JPMorgan strategists said. As the 10-year-2-year curve “is not outright inverted at present, the clock has not started ticking yet,” and “equities still offer supportive risk-reward over the medium term,” according to the note.
A growing number of money managers are betting equity indexes have already largely priced in bearish bond moves, while all signs suggest the U.S. economy remains in decent health. Some contrarian buy signals are now emerging. Bank of America’s Bull & Bear Indicator is flashing buy on equities for the first time since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.
To be sure, not everyone is so sanguine.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists led by Michael Wilson said Monday that headwinds to growth from the Fed’s policy shift, high inflation and the war in Ukraine “are not priced.” The equity risk premium should be higher, they said, downgrading U.S. financials to neutral from overweight.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, as investors monitor developments in the war between Ukraine and Russia with peace talks set to take place in Turkey this week.
By 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4%.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators will meet in Turkey later Monday to kick off a fresh round of in-person peace talks amid optimism that the positions of the two sides are drawing nearer. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to his country on Sunday that his government would prioritize the ""territorial integrity"" of Ukraine, but hopes are rising that a compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region could be reached as part of a peace deal.
The war in Ukraine is now entering its second month and Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and risks being drawn into guerrilla warfare, something Moscow would be keen to avoid, given previous difficulties in Afghanistan.

The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe Monday, with most attention on the monthly U.S. employment report due at the end of the week as this could help markets get a sense of whether the Fed’s roadmap for rate hikes is realistic.
Oil prices slumped Monday on fears of reduced demand from China, the world’s largest crude importer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted the country’s officials to instigate a two-stage lockdown at its financial hub of Shanghai.
All firms and factories in Shanghai would suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely in a two-stage lockdown, closing half the city in turns, over nine days. Public transport, including ride-hailing services, will also be suspended.
