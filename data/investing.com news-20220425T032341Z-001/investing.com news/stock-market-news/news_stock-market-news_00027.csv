The Miami Herald publisher said Chatham's proposed deal, which needs a court confirmation and other regulatory approvals, would help it exit Chapter 11 protection in the third quarter.
McClatchy had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, burdened by heavy debt it took on when it bought newspaper chain Knight Ridder in 2006 and large pension obligations that eat into its profits.
It began soliciting proposals for the company in April and received offers from Chatham and Brigade Capital Management, both holders of the company's debt.

The Sacramento, California-based publisher said it would contribute about $1.4 billion in pension assets to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fund and expects it to assume the company's qualified pension plan.

The newspaper said Christian Senger, a former BMW manager who runs the recently founded Car.Software.Org unit, was to be replaced after clashes with the company and concern at software problems with the recent ID.3 and Golf 8 vehicles.
Senger was part of a network of external managers Chief Executive Herbert Diess had brought in to reform the company. Senger, after working on BMW’s i3 electric car, helped Volkswagen make its MEB electric car platform, a key pillar of its revival in the wake of a 2015 diesel cheating scandal. 
The software post is one of the most important in the development of new-generation electric vehicles, which are far more reliant on computer power than the combustion engine that have been Volkswagen's mainstay.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.
A management purge has already seen Andreas Renschler, a former Mercedes-Benz manager leave his post as head of the Traton Trucks unit, and Stefan Sommer, a former Chief Executive of auto supplier ZF, leave his post at VW.
Senger was also leaving his post as a member of the board of Volksagen's core VW brand, the newspaper said, although it added that chief executive Herbert Diess was hoping he would stay with the company.

Volkswagen's powerful staff council, led by Bernd Osterloh, have forced out cost-cutters at the company in the past. Wolfgang Bernhard, a former VW brand chief and Bernd Pischetsrieder, a former head of the Volkswagen Group, quit following clashes with labour leaders.

Primark closed all of its stores in March when the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe intensified, costing it about 650 million pounds in net sales a month. 
Across Europe 68,000 staff received furlough payments from governments, without which it said it would have been forced to make most redundant.
It has since reopened stores, including sites in Britain last month, where around 30,000 employees were furloughed.
""I can confirm that Primark does not intend to take advantage of support under the Job Retention Bonus announced by the Chancellor this week,"" a spokeswoman said on Sunday.
""The company removed its employees from government employment support schemes in the UK and Europe in line with the reopening of the majority of its stores. The company believes it should not be necessary therefore to apply for payment under the Bonus scheme on current circumstances.""

The bonus scheme, which could cost up to 9 billion pounds if employers brought back all 9 million people who have been on furlough, was announced on Wednesday and also applies retroactively.

Claure, in an interview with the newspaper, said WeWork has seen strong demand for its office spaces since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
The SoftBank-controlled company has also reduced its workforce by more than 8,000 people, renegotiated leases and sold off assets to reduce its cash burn and shed costs, FT said.
New York-based WeWork is currently in the middle of executing a five-year turnaround plan set out this year and is shaking up its top management ranks under Claure.
The plan included a target of reaching operating profitability by the end of next year and Claure told the FT that WeWork remains on track to meet it.
""Everybody thought WeWork was mission impossible,"" Claure, who is also a SoftBank executive, was quoted as saying by the FT. ""And now, a year from now, you are going to see WeWork to basically be a profitable venture with an incredible diversity of assets.""
WeWork told Reuters it did not have any further comment beyond the FT interview.

The company has gone through a tumultuous period since abandoning its initial public offering (IPO) in September. It was forced to push out co-founder Adam Neumann last year after SoftBank (T:9984) and other shareholders turned on him over his management style, his numerous conflicts of interest and his handling of the IPO.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Troubled hospital operator NMC Health's entity in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), NMC Healthcare LLC, is considering applying for restructuring and insolvency proceedings locally, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The move comes three months after NMC Health Plc , the London-listed holding company for the hospital group, went into administration in April after months of turmoil over its finances. 
The two sources told Reuters that NMC Healthcare LLC was looking at options to file under the jurisdiction of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), which has its own laws relating to insolvency and corporate restructuring.
Such a move would help create a framework for the recognition of debt claims while the administrators of NMC Health Plc finalise the scheme of arrangement with creditors, one of the sources said.
A third source said the ADGM move is an option to obtain protection from the court from any enforcement proceedings from creditors, similar to Chapter 11 in the United States.
A scheme of arrangement is a binding agreement about payment of all, or part of, a firm's debts over a period of time.
The administrators for NMC Health declined to comment. 
The ADGM Registration Authority does not comment on its regulatory operations or disclose its engagements with external entities publicly, it said in an email.
NMC Health is the largest private healthcare provider in the UAE, operating more than 200 facilities including hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.
NMC's operating entities were unaffected by the appointment of administrators in April and services continued.
That is unlikely to change as UAE authorities are keen to ensure hospital services in the Gulf state are not affected during the coronavirus pandemic, the second source said.
NMC's implosion this year amid allegations of fraud and the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debts has left some UAE banks and overseas lenders nursing heavy losses and prompted legal battles to try and recover money owed.

The troubles began in December when short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) raised concerns over the company's financial statements and were compounded by doubts over the size of stakes of major shareholders, including founder BR Shetty.

Zozo, Japan's biggest online fashion mall, will offer Onward body-size data on a million customers, the business daily reported, without citing sources.
Zozo and Onward were not immediately available for comment outside business hours on Sunday.
Apparel makers such as Onward are struggling with poor sales from pandemic-related store closures and weak consumer spending. Rival Renown Inc filed the bankruptcy protection in May. 
Onward, which sells clothes under brands such as Kumikyoku, depends heavily on sales at Japanese department stores, which mostly reopened by late May but are still grappling with a decline in customers amid lingering fears of infections.
Last year Zozo was taken over by Yahoo Japan Corp, now named Z Holdings Corp (T:4689), after Zozo made a costly foray into a bespoke fashion service that brought little new business and saddled it with massive costs. 
Zozo was also hit by the departure of many brands setting up their own e-commerce sites instead of depending on the company's infrastructure. Onward was one of the retailers that left the site in 2018.
The Nikkei said Onward plans to start selling 28 types of business clothing, such as jackets and dresses, from August by using Zozo's data, aiming to boost annual sales to 10 billion yen ($94 million) in five years.
Zozo was founded by a billionaire Yusaku Maezawa whose plans for a lunar flyby as the first private passenger on Elon Musk's SpaceX mission had helped spread Zozo's name globally.

The changes were initiated to improve ""workplace culture"", the company said. 
The group's chief creative officer, managing director of its Canadian studios and global head of human resources have resigned from their positions, effective immediately, the company said. 
""Departures come following the initiation of a rigorous review that the Company initiated in response to recent allegations and accusations of misconduct and inappropriate behavior,"" the company said in a statement.
Unisoft said last month it was investigating allegations of misconduct at the company with the support of specialized external consultants. 
According to media reports, Ubisoft earlier this week confirmed the departure of its vice president, Maxime Béland, following assault allegations. 
According to a Bloomberg report, two high-ranking Ubisoft executives were put on leave last month following allegations of misconduct.

(Reuters) - Mickey waved from a distance and visitors wore colorful face masks with mouse ears on Saturday as Florida's Walt  Disney  World opened to the public for the first time in four months amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the state.
Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) welcomed a limited number of guests to its two most popular parks at the sprawling Orlando complex, the world's most-visited theme park resort, with a host of safety measures designed to reassure visitors and reduce the chances of catching the sometimes deadly virus.
Executives felt confident they had a responsible plan for reopening in phases during the pandemic, said Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney's parks, experiences and products division.
""This is the new world that we're operating in, and I don't see that changing anytime soon,"" D'Amaro said in an interview on Saturday after he greeted guests and workers at the park. 
Disney's reopening of parks in Asia helped provide assurance about moving ahead in Florida, he added. Disneyland Shanghai opened in May, followed by the Disneyland parks in Hongkong and Tokyo in June and July, respectively.
""I feel really good about our environment,"" D'Amaro said. ""We're taking this seriously.""
Disney did not say how many people entered Walt Disney World on Saturday, but D'Amaro said he saw ""really good demand"" for reservations in the short term and into 2021.
At the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, the two parks that reopened Saturday, guests and employees wore face masks, underwent temperature screenings and were told to social distance everywhere from streets to rides. Plexiglass separated rows in lines, and ground markings indicated where people should stand.
Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios, the two other Walt Disney World parks, are scheduled to reopen on Wednesday.
The resort suspended parades, fireworks and other activities that draw crowds, as well as up-close encounters with Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and other characters. Instead, characters appeared on floats or on horseback.
'SO HAPPY TO BE BACK'
Some pictures online showed people close together waiting to get in. Disney employees, called cast members, began enforcing distancing requirements after about 30 minutes, Carlye Wisel, a journalist who writes about theme parks, said on Twitter.
Other videos showed people inside staying apart, cheering, taking selfies and enjoying the park without long lines. ""I'm so happy to be back!"" a fan who calls herself That Crazy Disney Lady said in a video posted on YouTube.
Florida has emerged as an epicenter of COVID-19 infections. Over the past two weeks, the state reported 109,000 new coronavirus cases, more than any other U.S. state.
Still, many Disney fans and workers were eager for Disney World to open its gates. The resort employs 77,000 people. 
Disney said it had trained employees to nudge guests who become lax about the rules. Plentiful signs and audio announcements every 10 minutes reminded visitors of the new measures.
""There is a shared responsibility here so guests are going to have to do their part,"" D'Amaro said.
Coronavirus shutdowns have devastated Disney's film, TV and theme park businesses. Having guests back at Walt Disney World is key to the company's financial recovery. About 75% of the parks unit's operating income comes from Orlando, Imperial Capital analyst David Miller estimates.
Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, approved Disney World's reopening plans in late May, before the current surge. 
About 750 stage performers were absent because of a dispute over coronavirus testing. The Actors Equity union wants Disney to provide regular testing of members who must perform without masks.
Disney has said it is following health experts' recommendations to focus on other safeguards. If employees seek tests on their own, Disney's health insurance will cover it, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Seven other unions reached agreement with Disney on conditions for returning to work.

Shanghai Disneyland has increased capacity from its original limit of 20%, or about 16,000 people a day, when it re-opened in May. Guest surveys showed ""exceptionally strong"" satisfaction with the Shanghai experience and the safety measures, D'Amaro said.

Ghosn, the ex-chairman of an automaking alliance of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) was arrested in Japan in late 2018 on charges of underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purpose - charges he denies. 
In late December, he made a dramatic escape from house arrest in Japan, where he was awaiting trial, and fled to Beirut, his childhood home.
Japan has asked the United States to extradite U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son Peter Taylor, who are accused of helping Ghosn flee and were arrested in May. 
Asked in an interview with Al Arabiya TV if he was trying to help the Taylors and others involved in his escape, Ghosn said: ""You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment on those people who you are singling out. 
""What I'm saying is that I am helping everyone who helped me; I'm helping them with my means, with my thinking, and in any way I can,"" he said. ""I am not talking about those people you mentioned specifically,"" he said, adding that he was talking about people who helped him ""in general"".
Ghosn has refused to discuss details of his escape from Japan, saying it would put in danger those who helped him.
A U.S. judge said on Friday that Michael and Peter Taylor posed too great of a flight risk to be released on bail given the ""spectacular"" allegations against them.
Ghosn told Al Arabiya he made ""the entire plan"" for his escape but he had needed information and assistance from people whom he was not ready to endanger by talking about the matter.
Earlier this month, an executive from a Turkish private jet operator, four pilots and two flight attendants appeared in court on charges of helping to smuggle Ghosn via Istanbul.

Ghosn also said Japan had yet to send his case file to Lebanon as requested by the Lebanese government. ""It has been six months and they haven't sent the file. Why haven't they sent the file?""

The blistering rally also puts Musk in reach of a payday potentially worth $1.8 billion, his second jackpot from the electric car maker in about two months.
The stock is up about 38% since the close on July 1, a day before the company reported its quarterly delivery numbers.

Tesla's solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark the first time in its history that it would report four consecutive quarters of profit.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government has petitioned a state court to stop any of the Chinese companies whose 59 apps it recently banned from obtaining an injunction to block the order, according to two sources and the legal filing.
India last month outlawed dozens of Chinese apps including ByteDance's popular video-sharing app TikTok,  Alibaba 's (N:BABA) UC Browser and Tencent's (HK:0700) messaging app WeChat, saying they posed a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity"".
Chinese firms have faced hostility since a border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers, with Delhi intensifying scrutiny of Chinese imports and any funding from China. 
Two sources with direct knowledge of the filing said the government had presented a so-called caveat in the High Court of the western state of Rajasthan, suggesting it expects one or more of the companies to challenge the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's ban.
Such caveats are typically filed to prevent a ruling in favour of companies without hearing the government, Indian lawyers said. The filing, which one of the sources said was presented on Friday, has not previously been reported.
""Let nothing be done till the applicants (government) are heard in the matter,"" said the court filing signed by Additional Solicitor General of India Rajdeepak Rastogi.
GUARDING CYBER SPACE
The order to ban the apps was passed to safeguard ""the interests of Indian mobile and Internet users and ensure safety and sovereignty of Indian Cyber Space,"" said the filing, which was seen by Reuters.
It was not immediately clear why the government approached the court in Rajasthan and whether there were plans to file similar petitions elsewhere. 
India's IT ministry and the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Indian courts do not comment on cases. 
Previously, China has expressed strong concern about the ban, which could hurt expansion plans and cost jobs, and said it may violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
None of the Chinese companies has yet mounted a legal challenge, with industry sources saying they were waiting for further clarity from the Indian government.
India's IT ministry recently asked the companies associated with the 59 apps to answer a detailed questionnaire within three weeks on their business structure and data storage practices, the industry sources told Reuters. 

The decision to ban the apps has jolted companies like ByteDance, which counted on India as an important growth market for TikTok and had plans to invest $1 billion in the country.

The move, announced on Friday, comes as share prices of EV makers including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Nio Inc (N:NIO) have surged in recent months.
Five-year-old Li Auto, formerly known as CHJ Automotive, is building Li ONE extended-range electric sport-utility vehicles in China's eastern city of Changzhou. 
Unlike rival Tesla and Nio's pure battery electric vehicles, Li ONE allows drivers to charge their cars with electricity or gasoline. Li Auto has 21 showrooms in China, the world's biggest auto market, and aims to operate 60 by the end of this year.
The Beijing-based company, led by chief executive Li Xiang, sold 9,666 vehicles in the first six months this year. China's overall electric vehicle market, however, fell for the twelfth straight month in June.

(Reuters) - Goya Foods Inc, the largest Hispanic-owned U.S. food company and a popular brand among Latino Americans, became the target of a boycott campaign on social media on Friday sparked by its CEO effusively praising President Donald Trump at the White House.
The hashtags #Goyaway and #BoycottGoya began trending on Twitter after Robert Unanue, chief executive officer of the New Jersey-based company, appeared with Trump on Thursday for the signing of an executive order creating an advisory panel aimed at spurring Hispanic prosperity.
""We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder, and that's what my grandfather did,"" said Unanue, the third generation of his family to run the business. ""We pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country that we will continue to prosper and to grow.""
The event at the White House came as Trump's re-election campaign sought to boost his standing among members of a key constituency who have often felt alienated by his policies and political rhetoric.
Reuters/Ipsos national polling shows only about a quarter of registered Hispanic voters chose Trump in a matchup with his Democratic rival, former vice president Joe Biden.
Among those in the forefront of calls for a boycott were two leading Hispanic politicians in the Democratic Party - former presidential candidate Julian Castro and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
Castro wrote on Twitter that Goya had been a staple of many Latino households for generations. 
""Now their CEO, Bob Unanue, is praising a president who villainizes and maliciously attacks Latinos for political gain,"" he said. ""Americans should think twice before buying their produces."" 
Ocasio-Cortez suggested to her 7.5 million followers on Twitter that they find homemade alternatives to Goya's popular Adobo seasoning.
United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led social action group, launched an online boycott petition that said Unanue had ""aligned the Goya brand with Trump's white supremacist agenda.""
""If Goya wants our business, they must respect and fight for our humanity,"" the group said. 
Unanue defended his comments, however, and said on Friday that the calls for a boycott of the company amounted to an attack on his freedom of speech.
""I'm not apologizing,"" he told Fox News. ""When you're called by the president of the United States, you're going to say, 'No, I'm sorry, I'm busy, no thank you?' I didn't say that to the Obamas and I didn't say that to President Trump.""
Separately on Fox News, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway decried the controversy. ""It's just a shame that people make everything so politicized, including food,"" she said.
Countering online calls for a boycott was the emergence of the #BuyGoya"" hashtag, which drew the likes of Hollywood actor James Woods, who praised Unanue for setting ""a good example in the fight against liberal terrorism.""
U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said on Twitter that his grandparents ate Goya black beans twice a day for nearly 90 years. ""And now the Left is trying to cancel Hispanic culture and silence free speech,"" the Texas Republican said.
Politically motivated calls for economic boycotts have become commonplace on social media in recent years, with mixed results. 
It was too soon to tell whether the anti-Goya campaign would generate enough support to damage the bottom line of a privately owned company that ranks among the leading distributors of packaged Latino foods in the United States, Europe and the Caribbean.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors await BlackRock earnings after blistering second quarter market rally,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will watch next week's earnings from BlackRock (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, for a snapshot of how the industry performed during the second quarter's dramatic rebound in global financial markets. 
Most expect numbers from industry bellwether BlackRock and other asset managers to reflect the sharp stock market rebound. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 20% in the second quarter after falling as much in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy. 
Since the performance of asset managers tends to be tied to how markets fare, investors see a range of risks ahead, including further acceleration of U.S. coronavirus cases and potential market volatility around the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
Still, ""just on a market level, the asset managers are inmuch better shape coming out of the second quarter than theywere coming out of the first quarter,"" said Macrae Sykes, global financial services sector analyst at Gabelli Funds.
BlackRock is scheduled to report on July 17, with T. Rowe Price (O:TROW), WisdomTree Investments (O:WETF) and Invesco (N:IVZ) among asset managers reporting in the following weeks. 
Analysts expect a strong recovery in the sector's assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter, driven by rising financial markets and improving risk appetite. Higher levels of AUM mean more fees and stronger margins and earnings, analysts said.
BlackRock's assets fell to $6.47 trillion at the end of the first-quarter, from $7.43 trillion at the end of 2019.

Improving fund flows are also likely to help second-quarter earnings for the group, analysts said. Fixed income flows reversed back into positive territory in April and stayed that way throughout the quarter while equity flows improved from March lows, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  recently raised their estimate for second-quarter earnings-per-share for traditional asset managers by 19%.
Most analysts expect BlackRock to show robust flows into its $2 trillion exchange-traded funds business, with strength in the fixed income and alternatives ETFs offsetting outflows from equities.
Investors will also look for details on BlackRock's role in the Federal Reserve's debt-buying efforts as the central bank sought to stabilize a corporate bond market roiled by economic fallout of the pandemic.
The firm's own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank's relief program. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.
BlackRock's shares are up about 9% year-to-date, outperforming a 3% decline in the S&P 500. The broader sector has not fared as well, with the Refinitiv U.S. Investment Management & Fund Operators Price Return Index <.TRXFLDUSPINVM> is down about 13% for the year.
Some investors worry asset managers could take a hit if a resurgent pandemic forces parts of the United States to halt or reverse the reopening of their economies. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week said the U.S. economy would shrink by 4.6% in 2020, from an earlier forecast of a 4.2% contraction. 
""We remain cautious with equity markets nearing post Covid-outbreak highs amid risk of a market correction should a second coronavirus wave impede the pace of the global economic recovery,"" analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note to clients about the sector.
The U.S. presidential election could also heighten market volatility. A victory by Democratic challenger Joe Biden could threaten Republican policies championed by President Donald Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.

A separate indication of the financial industry's health may come next week from several big Wall Street banks set to report earnings, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Morgan Stanley (N:MS).

18,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case on Tesla,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Shares of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) seem be be on an unstoppable rally, rising more than 140% over the last three months and around 500% over the last year and investors think that there could be more gains ahead even as short-sellers remain skeptical of the company and its unconventional CEO Elon Musk. The company is due to report its latest quarterly earnings on July 22 and if it posts a profit it would would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, paving the way for its addition to the S&P 500.
Yasin Ebrahim argues that short sellers look set to continue piling up losses, while Geoffrey Smith counters that Tesla shares simply do not justify their current valuation. This is Point/Counterpoint.
Tesla Puts $18 Billion Squeeze on Bears as 'Shortville' Burns
The eerie noises emanating from 'Shortville,' a fictional place inhabited by Tesla short sellers, are the sound of the bears being squeezed to the tune of $18 billion.
Traders betting against (shorting) Tesla are down $18.08 billion in year-to-date, mark-to-market losses, according to data from S3 Partners.
Unfortunately, the wreckage in Shortville will continue as Tesla, which has more than tripled this year, has many power ups ahead not least in China, the company's second biggest market.
Last year, Tesla rolled out its first factory, the Gigafactory 3, in China as part of efforts to build on growing demand in the country, which turned out sales of about 1.6 million last year, dwarfing the 330,000 sales in the U.S.
With locally-made Teslas rolling off the conveyor belt, averting the hefty 25% import duty, the company has not only been able to compete with local competitors such as NIO and Lixiang, but steal market share.
Sales of Chinese all-electric vehicles slumped 40% year-on-year to 67,000 units in June, while Tesla grew market share by 23%, the Chinese Passengers Car Association said Wednesday.
Tesla is also cooking up a million-mile battery at its Gigafactory in China that experts hail as a game charger.
""We believe that the China growth story is worth at least $400 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 (million mile battery remains an elusive goal now in the grasp in our opinion),"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.
The bears, however, have pointed to valuation as a source of comfort for their bearish bets.
Tesla's market cap at over $280 billion, is above that of Toyota, the leading automaker in terms of output, and General Motors (NYSE:GM), the leading automaker in the U.S., combined.
But expected earnings or other measures of valuation have no place in the Tesla story. ""With Tesla, it is always the story that drives the stock not the news, or the fundamentals,"" Professor at NYU Stern, Aswath Damodaran, also known as Dean of valuation, told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
The mounting losses suggests Damodaran is onto something. But only time will tell whether or not the bears get squeezed into submission.
For now, Musk is in the ascendancy, while the bears may have to settle for the limited-edition red satin short pants on offer from Tesla.


The bear case
More than any other stock in the world, Tesla has become completely divorced from reality in recent weeks.
This is not to say it doesn’t have an excellent product and a formidable brand, whose power is evident in how it has grabbed 15% of the market for electric vehicles in China since starting its factory in Shanghai.
No, this is all about valuations. There is no conceivable justification for the 60% rally in the share price in merely two weeks, which is chiefly the product of arcane activity in the options market, fueled by free money from the Fed and other central banks.
True, it delivered more cars in a supremely difficult quarter than seemed possible. But to add $108 billion of market cap to a company because it sold, what, $600 million of cars more than expected in a quarter? Without any indication of whether it turned a profit? Seriously?
Sure, its inclusion in the S&P 500, if and when it happens, will expand the number of forced buyers of the stock. But that does not a value proposition make. Ask Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) or Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG).
As Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this week, the price is being sustained by “the power of hope” - a supreme euphemism coined by an analyst whose real thoughts about today’s buyers, if committed to paper, would alienate clients forever. Even at $1,400, they noted, the stock implies a tenfold expansion of production over the next decade, and an EBITDA margin of 20%.
“We’re not saying these are assumptions are not possible, but they are a very big leap ahead from what the company has proven to date and implies a level of commercial success in a global EV market at less than 2% penetration today,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts said.
To achieve that kind of growth, the company will need free and unfettered access to the Chinese market, which, together with Europe, will still account for 72% of global EV sales by 2030, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
But it is hopelessly naïve to think that the promise of a few thousand local jobs will protect Tesla from the whirlwind of Chinese retaliation as we progress beyond what Henry Kissinger calls “the foothills of a new Cold War”. It is almost as naïve to think that the French and German governments are going to stand by and let Tesla satisfy all the demand for EVs in Europe.
Nor is ‘Level 5 autonomy’ – the stage where steering wheels and brake pedals become obsolete – anything more than a pipe dream for now. Elon Musk’s boasts this week of it coming in the near future are hollow. People have already died proving that Tesla’s Autopilot is a misnomer. Should Musk succeed in persuading the NHTSA that he has achieved Level 5, the consequence could be a death toll that dwarfs that of the 737 MAX.
Tesla still faces a mountain of execution risk before it can justify its current valuation. The supply of greater fools to sell to is elastic, but not infinite."
19,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>","Amazon.com bans, then un-bans TikTok app from employee mobile devices","By Echo Wang and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - In the span of a few hours on Friday, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) banned and then unbanned the TikTok video sharing app from employee mobile devices, calling the move a mistake. 
The news generated widespread attention for the Chinese-owned social media platform coming the same week U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is ""certainly looking at"" banning TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government. 
It was not immediately clear what led to the initial ban by Amazon. One person familiar with the matter said senior Amazon executives were unaware of the request to delete TikTok from employee devices. The ban was reversed after TikTok and Amazon representatives discussed the matter, according to an email sent to TikTok employees.
Earlier this week,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) sent a note to employees who had installed TikTok on company-owned mobile devices telling them to remove the app immediately. 
""Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,"" Wells Fargo said in a statement. 
""We have not been contacted by Wells Fargo, but as with any organization that has concerns, we are open to engaging with them constructively and letting them know about the actions we have taken to protect data security for our users,"" a TikTok spokesman told Reuters in a statement. 
The attention underscores the hotseat that TikTok's owner, China-based ByteDance, has found itself in over recent days. 
The Chinese ownership of TikTok, among the fastest growing digital platforms ever, has come under heavy scrutiny on issues including their handling of user data. India banned TikTok and other Chinese apps in June.
The company has said user data is stored in the United States with a backup copy in Singapore. One person familiar with the matter said TikTok's user data is primarily stored in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud in its Virginia-based data center.
TikTok declined to comment. Google could not immediately be reached for comment.
That did not stop Pompeo from floating a possible ban of TikTok in the United States. Asked if Americans should download it, he told Fox News: ""Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.""
On Friday, the Republican National Committee asked its members via email not to download TikTok. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday also reiterated its guidance from December to stop downloading the app.
A person familiar with the matter said the DNC has been advising campaign staff for months not to use TikTok on their personal devices and to use a separate phone and account if they use the platform for campaign work because of the amount of data it tracks. A spokesman for the DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Two Republican senators in March introduced a bill aimed at banning federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones, citing national security concerns around the collection and sharing of data on U.S. users with China's government.
Last year the United States Navy banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices, saying the app represented a ""cybersecurity threat.""
Last November, the U.S. government launched a national security review of TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly, Reuters first reported last year.
SECURITY CONCERNS
To address concerns over its Chinese ownership, ByteDance has taken steps to shift its center of power away from China, Reuters previously reported. It is also looking to make changes to TikTok's corporate structure for the same reasons, a company spokesperson said this week.
But concerns persist. Last month, when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released to developers a test version of its iOS operating system with new privacy features, developers showed images of TikTok's app triggering notifications that it was copying data from users' clipboards, where data is temporarily stored while copying and pasting from one app to another. 
TikTok said the notifications were caused by an anti-spam feature but that it would end the practice.
Apple has not restricted TikTok use by employees, one of them said.
Some U.S. semiconductor companies have been reluctant to consider a ban on TikTok because ByteDance is a customer, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some firms providing security services to big companies have added TikTok to their lists of banned apps on managed devices.

According to Apple's website, Universal Clipboard allows users to copy text, images, photos, and videos on one Apple device and then paste the content onto another Apple device. 
According to the lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court by Adam Bauer, LinkedIn reads the Clipboard information without notifying the user.
LinkedIn did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
According to media reports from last week, 53 apps including TikTok and LinkedIn were reported to be reading users' Universal Clipboard content, after Apple's latest privacy feature started alerting users whenever the clipboard was accessed with a banner saying ""pasted from Messages."" 
""These ""reads"" are interpreted by Apple's Universal Clipboard as a ""paste"" command,"" Bauer's lawsuit alleged.
A LinkedIn executive had said on Twitter last week that the company released a new version of its app to end this practice.
Developers and testers of Apple's operating system iOS 14 found that LinkedIn's application on iPhones and iPads ""secretly"" read users' clipboard ""a lot,"" according to the complaint. 
The lawsuit seeks to certify the complaint as class action based on alleged violation of the law or social norms, under California laws. 

According to the complaint, LinkedIn has not only been spying on its users, it has been spying on their nearby computers and other devices, and it has been circumventing Apple's Universal Clipboard timeout.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>","Hedge fund success shaped by launch size, strong first-year returns: data","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Starting a hedge fund with more capital and scoring top first-year returns point to higher chances of survival in the often risky business,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said in research released on Friday.
Goldman, which has helped launch and finance thousands of hedge funds, said almost all newcomers survive their first year but that only 62% of all funds remain in business after five years.
The ""break even point after which less than half of managers ... remain up and running seems to lie somewhere between 6 and 7 years,"" said Goldman's Hedge Fund Survivorship 2020 report released to clients.
2020 has been extra tough for hedge funds battling gyrating markets during the coronavirus outbreak. Liquidations hit their highest quarterly level since 2015, the data show.
Americas-based managers tend to launch funds with slightly more money, averaging $230 million, than those in Europe, with $200 million, and Asia, with $98 million. But the survival rate is lower in the Americas, at 53%, compared with 64% in Europe and 62% in Asia.
Nearly three-quarters of the funds that launched with $1 billion or more in assets are still in business, with assets reaching an average of $2.9 billion, the data show. Among the smallest funds that start with less than $25 million, only 40% are still in business, Goldman said, putting their average lifespan at 36 months.
Strong returns in the early years often translate into strong foundations for the business, the report said, with the industry's largest managers scoring an average of 18% in their first year. Smaller funds returned 9% to 11%.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is considering imposing a ban on political ads on its social network in the days leading up to the Nov. 3 elections in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the company's thinking. 
The potential ban is only being discussed and has not been finalized, the report added. (https://bloom.bg/2ZY7F6X)
A Facebook spokesman said the company had no comment on the report.
The social media company has been under fire for its policy of exempting politicians' ads and speech from fact-checking. Last year, smaller rival  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) banned political ads, but Facebook has maintained that it does not want to stifle political speech.
Republican President Donald Trump's campaign and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month Biden's campaign published an open letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg calling for the company to fact-check politicians' ads in the two weeks ahead of the election. 
In a Twitter post on Friday, Biden's digital director Rob Flaherty pointed to the issue of misinformation in unpaid content on the site.
""Requisite reminder that Facebook's problems are 80% about unpaid content and so anything they do about paid content is an attempt to distract you,"" he tweeted. 
Facebook has drawn heat from employees and lawmakers in recent weeks over its decisions not to act on inflammatory posts by the president. 

More than 900 advertisers have signed on to an ad boycott on Facebook, organized by civil rights groups to pressure the world's largest social media network to take concrete steps to block hate speech and misinformation, in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday and the Nasdaq posted its sixth record closing high in seven days as a positive analysis on  Gilead Sciences Inc 's antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 soothed investor worries over a record rise in coronavirus cases in the United States.
The United States registered the largest single-day increase in new COVID-19 infections globally for the second day in a row on Thursday, forcing Americans to take new precautions. Several states have already backpedaled on reopening plans.
Gilead's (O:GILD) remdesivir significantly improved clinical recovery and reduced the risk of death in COVID-19 patients, additional data from a late-stage study showed. The drugmaker's shares climbed as it said the finding required confirmation in clinical trials.
""That kind of dampened some of the concern that's been building over the past few days around the increased virus cases in the southern states,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis.
Although the Nasdaq recorded another record closing high, it underperformed the Dow and S&P 500, in a reversal of the recent trend.
""We're seeing I think some rotation from winners into the laggards here today. And we've seen that gap widen quite a bit between the leaders and laggards over the last week, so I think it makes sense there's a little profit-taking in that trade especially heading into earnings season,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 368.66 points, or 1.43%, to 26,074.75, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 32.87 points, or 1.04%, to 3,184.92 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 69.69 points, or 0.66%, to 10,617.44.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) rose ahead of their financial results next week, which would mark the onset of the second-quarter earnings season.
Overall profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen the most in the second quarter since the financial crisis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A slate of economic data, including a record monthly payrolls addition, has pointed to a revival in business activity in June, fueling the U.S. stock market's stimulus-driven rally.
The S&P 500 is up more than 40% from its March bottom.
Carnival Corp (N:CCL) jumped after the cruise line operator said it was planning to resume operations in a phased manner and would operate with a smaller fleet on its return.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) rose after Goldman Sachs hiked its price target on the video streaming service's shares.

Investing.com -- You still can’t go on a cruise, but that doesn’t matter to investors.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) shares rose 10.8% on Friday after the cruise operator said it was cutting capacity but indicated that demand for 2021 is growing. CCL is down about 68% in 2020. They closed at $16.16.
Cruises have been halted since mid-March, but Carnival’s AIDA line out of Germany will resume trips with three ships in August, the start of a gradual return to operations.Despite substantially reduced spending on marketing, the company continues to see demand for new bookings for 2021, Carnival said in a statement. For the most recent booking period, the first three weeks in June 2020, almost 60% of 2021 bookings were new bookings.
The company sold one ship in June and is accelerating the removal of 13 ships, representing 9% of current capacity.
The company has reduced ship operating expenses by transitioning ships into paused status, reduced administrative expenses and non-newbuild capital expenditures by $1.3 billion for 2020 and expects to reduce its newbuild capital expenditures by over $600 million for 2020. Carnival has raised over $10 billion through a series of financing transactions.
""We have already reduced operating costs by over $7 billion on an annualized basis and reduced capital expenditures also by more than $5 billion over the next 18 months, said Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald. “We have secured over $10 billion of additional liquidity to sustain another full year with additional flexibility remaining.”
 Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises closed up 9.9% on Friday, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings rose 7.9%.
Carnival has four buy ratings, 12 holds and four sells, with an average price target of $16.51. The highest price target of $30 is almost twice where it is trading today."

Investing.com – The Dow notched a weekly gain thanks to a strong finish on Friday, as a record daily surge in cases was cast aside by positive reports about a potential Covid-19 vaccine.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.44%, or 369 points. The S&P 500 rose 1.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.66% to a close at a record high.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) released data on Friday showing its antiviral drug, remdesivir, cut the risk of death for severely sick coronavirus patients by 62% compared with standard care alone, sending its shares 2.2% higher.
Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX), up 7.2%, also delivered positive news in the race of a vaccine, with CEO Ugur Sahin reportedly claiming the company could have a treatment ready for approval by December, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The promising update on a vaccine helped ease investor jitters over the rapid spread of coronavirus, which infected a record 60,565 people in the U.S. on Thursday.
Energy and financials, both of which had been under pressure this week, jumped more than 2%, pushing the broader market higher.
The rise in financials was underpinned by a swing higher in bank stocks ahead of earnings next week.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), all of which are set to report their second-quarter results on Tuesday, were up more than 2%. 
Renewed action on the reopening trade - bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening - also benefited airlines and cruise lines, with the latter benefiting from a surge in cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK).
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) jumped 10.8% on Friday after the cruise operator said it was cutting capacity and indicated that demand for 2021 is growing.
Tech joined the rally late-on after cutting gains.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the so-called Fab 5, making up about 40% of the Nasdaq Index, ended higher.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended the day up 10.8% to end above $1,500 for the first time ever."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Meat lobby groups have asked the government of Paraná, Brazil's largest chicken producing and exporting state, to reconsider local regulations aimed at increasing spacing between food plant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.
The meat lobby argues that the minimum 1.5-meter (5 feet) distancing required under state norms would reduce output by as much as 43%, Brazil's animal protein association ABPA and two local trade groups said in the joint letter sent on July 2. 
The average worker distance at pork and poultry facilities is 0.85 centimeters (.33 inches), the letter said.
Federal rules passed on June 19 dealing with operation of Brazilian slaughterhouses amid the pandemic should prevail over the state norms, the meat lobby's letter said. Federal rules require only one meter of physical distancing, which labor representatives in three southern states told Reuters is insufficient. 
According to the industry, one meter of distancing would already represent an 18% output drop. 
Responding to the companies' stance, Paraná's Chief Labor Prosecutor Margaret de Carvalho requested ""an urgent meeting"" with the governor on Thursday, according to a separate letter seen by Reuters.
She defended the continued enforcement of local rules, as meatpackers became hotbeds for the novel coronavirus.
""Some 16 slaughterhouses have had or still have outbreaks, with six units recording more than 100 cases each,"" Carvalho's letter said.
In a statement on Friday, ABPA, which represents meat producers, including  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) and BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS), reiterated the position expressed in the July 2 letter.
""The harmonization of standards will guarantee legal security for producers,"" ABPA said, emphasizing the need to keep jobs and maintain food supplies. 

Santa Catarina, Brazil's largest pork-producing state, also mulled revoking its own, more protective rules for slaughterhouse operation during the pandemic, a move criticized by local labor representatives.

The move follows an FCA investigation that found these vehicles were equipped with certain clips that may loosen and disengage over time, and in case of a driver-side air bag deployment the clips could act as projectiles.

Fiat Chrysler said none of the potential injuries involved occupants of front-passenger or rear seats and that the air bags were not supplied by Takata.

41,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",Hot-Spot States’ Test Plans Highlight Continued Supply Problems,"(Bloomberg) -- States told the Department of Health and Human Services that they need new machinery, more personnel and more testing supplies in submissions Friday detailing how they plan to build out screening for Covid-19.
The plans highlight the ongoing supply-chain challenges that labs in states with surging case counts face in procuring key supplies like chemicals, rapid diagnostics and protective equipment for personnel, showing how an influx of about $11 billion in funds distributed to states in May may not be enough to solve these persistent problems.
Covid cases are surging across the U.S. and testing capacity has again been a key bottleneck, with test-takers complaining about long lines and waits of a week or more for results, while labs warn of shortages of key supplies. Mass testing is essential to identify positive patients so they can be isolated and their contacts notified of their exposure risk. Delayed results set back those efforts, allowing the virus to continue on a path of explosive spread.
In three states shouldering some of the heaviest caseloads, their testing woes demonstrate that while testing has improved since the virus’s early days, U.S. capacity remains severely strained.
In Florida, which is witnessing record deaths and hospitalizations, the health department planned to invest in more diagnostic testing equipment, but at the time of the filing was still awaiting delivery of many items. Filings were due May 30 and underwent federal review in June.
Texas, Arizona
Texas’s submission describes how such machinery can make a major difference for a lab. One new platform in Laredo, for instance, “will increase testing capacity there by 50%,” while new equipment for Lubbock and Tyler labs “will increase testing throughput from 100 per day to 650 per day and from 50 per day to 500 per day, respectively.”
Key testing chemicals called reagents had become easier to access, but what’s available doesn’t always work on the equipment that labs have, the state said.
In Arizona, where a surge has filled hospital intensive-care units with Covid patients, facilities don’t have enough rapid tests for patients, which they say is “hampering their ability to most effectively triage patients” and maximize protective equipment for providers, according to its plan. Arizona is working with the federal government to use machinery already in state labs more effectively, including by getting “test kits which are in short supply and backordered.”
“At this time, the supply of collection materials and testing supplies are adequate to meet current response efforts in Arizona,” Arizona’s HHS submission said. But “the current supply of materials, particularly swabs, is anticipated to be insufficient for the fall and winter season, due to the need for concurrent influenza and Covid-19 testing.” The state health department is looking at ways to manufacture swabs and evaluate other types of swabs and preservatives.
States set their own testing targets in partnership with the federal government, and in the submissions were required to detail the number of tests needed, estimates of laboratory and testing capacity and how they’ll use the resources.
Shifting Needs
The $11 billion was distributed according to a formula that reflected the burden of Covid-19 as well as population-based estimates, officials said in May. But the brunt of the pandemic has shifted significantly since then, from the northeast to Sun Belt states, raising questions about whether additional funding may be required.
New York received about $750 million, more than any other state, and New York City got roughly $850 million. New Jersey got $650 million, California about $600 million, Los Angeles County nearly $337 million, Massachusetts about $400 million and Texas nearly $568 million.
The shortfalls in U.S. testing highlight the Trump administration’s failure to execute a cohesive national strategy, even as the country reopened and Americans increasingly going back to work, eating out and gathering socially clamored for the screenings.
The burden instead shifted to states, which were provided over 36 million swabs and 27 million tubes of transport media in the last two months, according to Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir’s office, but have continued to face supply limitations. The Trump administration is now ramping up screenings in Louisiana, Texas and Florida through temporary sites offering free tests as part of an effort to “assist local leadership to reduce community spread,” Giroir said in a statement.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Most sustainable equity funds performed well during the second-quarter comeback rally of U.S. stocks, researcher  Morningstar  said in a report, gaining an edge on rival funds by owning companies with lower risk levels.
The results bolster an investment approach that is gaining popularity with clients and asset managers, even as it draws scrutiny from the Trump administration on concerns the approach does not prioritize returns. 
Sustainable funds use a range of investment strategies focused on various factors, including environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters.
For the three months ended June 30, among 212 sustainable stock funds, 56% ranked in the top half of their categories, Chicago-based Morningstar (O:MORN) said in a report sent by a representative on Friday. That continued their outperformance record from the first quarter and left 72% of sustainable equity funds in the top halves of their Morningstar categories for the year. 
Morningstar analyst Jon Hale wrote that the funds' better relative performances reflect their tendency to own companies with stronger environmental, social or governance criteria, and lower risk levels for those areas. 
He wrote that ""basing investment decisions only on the financial health of a business no longer captures the essence of the 21st-century corporation, if it ever did. Investors that use ESG insights are able to construct a more holistic view of a company.""
The performance was also noteworthy, Hale wrote, because the funds tend to underweight energy stocks such as oil companies. Energy was the top-performing sector during the market rally that made the second quarter the best for the S&P 500 since 1998.
All 26 index funds built with environmental, social or governance criteria outperformed their conventional counterparts for the year to date. The Vanguard ESG US Stock ETF (Z:ESGV), for example, had a total return of 0.23% for the period, beating 93 percent of peers.

By Noel Randewich and Chuck Mikolajczak
(Reuters) - Wall Street's most controversial stock may be about to go mainstream. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc appears on the verge of joining the S&P 500, a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk that would unleash a flood of new demand for the electric car maker's shares, which have already surged 500% over the past year. 
Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced last week, have analysts increasingly confident the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla's first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500. 
With a market capitalization of about $250 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index's existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index.
(For a graphic on Tesla potentially in the S&P 500: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkanyyvm/VokA0-tesla-in-the-s-amp-p-500.png) 
While analysts and investors have recently become more confident of Tesla's addition, a S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman declined to comment about specific changes to the index.
Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, had to look back to the dot-com era to recall a comparable situation. In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo's market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion.
(For a graphic on Yahoo's 1999 S&P 500 debut: https://tmsnrt.rs/3iOlA8o) 
""The lesson learned from Yahoo was that when you have an up and coming issue that may possibly go into the index, you should already own a little of it,"" said Silverblatt. ""If you had to get into that stock, you were paying a heck of a premium compared to owning it a week earlier.""
Funds that attempt to identically track the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index's performance.
Ivan Cajic, head of index & ETF research at Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) estimates index managers would need to own roughly 25 million shares of Tesla stock, currently worth $34 billion.
""You have all the index funds that have no choice but to include it,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""That is one reason why it has been so strong here, in anticipation of that."" 
Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets.
""Even if you don't like Tesla and you think it's overvalued, the fact that it is going into the index would mean trillions of dollars would have some kind of position,"" said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago. ""As part of their benchmark, portfolio managers would not be able to ignore it.""
Up 43% in just the past eight sessions, Tesla is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market's purest play bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla's Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers. 
(For a graphic on As Tesla rallies, short bets hit record levels: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgoddbpq/Yfifp-as-tesla-rallies-short-sellers-risk-more.png) 
However, short sellers are betting $19 billion that Tesla's shares will fall, the largest short level on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners. 
Bears point to looming competition from Porsche, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla's corporate governance under Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges. 

Traders betting Tesla could be added to the S&P 500 have almost certainly contributed to the recent rally. However, Bianco warned that the stock could reverse if Tesla is not added to the S&P 500.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Apple supplier Foxconn to invest $1 billion in India, sources say","By Sankalp Phartiyal and Yimou Lee
NEW DELHI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn (TW:2317) plans to invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in southern India where the Taiwanese contract manufacturer assembles Apple (O:AAPL) iPhones, two sources said.
The move, the scale of which has not previously been reported, is part of a quiet and gradual production shift by Apple away from China as it navigates disruptions from a trade war between Beijing and Washington and the coronavirus crisis.
""There's a strong request from Apple to its clients to move part of the iPhone production out of China,"" one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Foxconn said it does not comment on matters related to customers, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
Foxconn's planned investment in the Sriperumbur plant, where Apple's iPhone XR is made some 50 km west of Chennai, will take place over the course of three years, the second source said.
Some of Apple's other iPhones models, made by Foxconn in China, will be made at the plant, said both sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private and details have yet to be finalised.
Taipei-headquartered Foxconn will add some 6,000 jobs at the Sriperumbur plant in Tamil Nadu state under the plan, one of the sources said. It also operates a separate plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where it makes smartphones for China's  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810), among others.
Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way last month said it would ramp up its investment in India, without giving details.
STATUS SYMBOL
Apple accounts for about 1% of smartphone sales in India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market, where its pricey iPhones are often seen as a status symbol.
Building more phones in India will also help Apple save on import taxes that further push up its prices.
Apple assembles a few models through Taiwan's  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231) in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru. Wistron is also set to open a new plant, where it plans to make more Apple devices, Reuters previously reported.
""With India's labour cheaper compared with China, and the gradual expansion of its supplier base here, Apple will be able to use the country as an export hub,"" Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint said.
India is also working to boost electronics manufacturing by firms such as Foxconn and last month launched a $6.65 billion plan, offering five global smartphone makers incentives to establish or expand domestic production.
Having Apple widen its local presence is likely to be a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship ""Make In India"" drive, aimed at creating new jobs.

South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) has already said it will make smartphones for export from its plant outside New Delhi.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. companies seeking capital during pandemic test bank market's new normal,"By Daniela Guzman
NEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lenders for high-quality US companies are taking different refinancing avenues as they seek to extend maturities on billions of US dollars in loans at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has made liquidity a top priority.
Corporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.
“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.
As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.
The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.
In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.
The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started. 
The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.
Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.
Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.
    B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans. 
After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount. 
As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged. 
The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.

“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.""

53,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>","Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reduces share count, suggesting possible buybacks","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has reduced its share count by 1.2% since April 23, a regulatory filing shows, suggesting that Chairman Warren Buffett might have become more aggressive in repurchasing its significantly underperforming stock. 
The reduction in the conglomerate's outstanding shares was noted in a Wednesday filing concerning Buffett's $2.9 billion donation of Berkshire stock to five nonprofits, part of his pledge to give away nearly all his fortune. If Berkshire repurchased those shares, it might have conducted roughly $4.9 billion to $5.9 billion of buybacks, depending on the price, over 2-1/2 months, analysts said.""It implies relatively strong buyback activity,"" said James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire. ""There is certainly capacity.""
He said buybacks might have totaled $5.3 billion, based on Berkshire's average share price from April 23 to July 7.Since bottoming on March 23, Berkshire's share price had through Thursday risen 12%, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 41% gain.
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buybacks could help Buffett reduce Berkshire's cash hoard, which totaled $137.2 billion as of March 31.
It has been 4-1/2 years since the legendary billionaire completed a major acquisition for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, though Berkshire did agree last Sunday to pay $4 billion for some gas assets from Dominion Energy Inc. Buffett's buyback appetite had been relatively muted since July 2018, when a policy change let him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger repurchase stock when they thought its price was below Berkshire's intrinsic value. 
The old policy allowed buybacks only at prices up to 1.2 times book value. Shanahan estimated Berkshire's current multiple at 1.1. Berkshire's previous buybacks under the current policy totaled about $8 billion, including $1.7 billion from January to March as the coronavirus pandemic drove down the price. Wednesday's filing said Buffett owned the equivalent of 248,741 Class A shares, a 15.54% stake, following his donations. 
That suggests Berkshire had the equivalent of just over 1.6 million Class A shares outstanding, down roughly 19,000 from April 23. Some investors believe Berkshire's cash has hurt its stock price.
Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor who has published several books about Berkshire, said impatience may explain why some investors sold Buffett their stock. ""Berkshire's stalwart quality shareholders do not sell, so we are seeing a voluntary purging of the shorter-term, lower quality shareholders,"" he said. 

Buffett was asked at Berkshire's May 2 annual meeting why he had not repurchased more stock. He said the price had not fallen to ""where it really feels way better to us than other things, including the option value of money, to step up in a big, big way.""

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lonza expects EPA approval 'very soon' to make COVID-killing claims for surface disinfectants,"By Siddharth Cavale and Richa Naidu
(Reuters) - Lonza Group AG is in the “last step” of discussions with U.S. regulators for approval to claim that its formulation is effective in killing the novel Coronavirus on surfaces, an executive at the pharmaceutical and chemical giant told Reuters. 
Earlier this week,  Reckitt Benckiser  Group Plc (LON:RB) became the first company to win the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s approval to market two of its Lysol disinfectant sprays as household COVID-19 killers.
Reuters previously reported that Reckitt had procured a strain of the virus from an independent lab, for testing. The EPA’s approval allows Reckitt to claim that Lysol can kill the novel coronavirus, or the SARS-CoV-2, on surfaces. 
Ernesto Lippert, Lonza’s vice president of strategic development and advocacy, told Reuters Thursday that it, too, obtained a strain of SARS-CoV-2 and had tested a range of its formulations in approved EPA labs. He said data shows that the products could indeed kill SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. 
“We are probably be going to be the second one after Reckitt Benckiser to have a range of our products with the actual claim against SARS-CoV-2,” Lippert said, adding that Lonza is in the “last step” of the process and that “EPA’s approval is going to be very soon.” 
Reuters could not independently verify Lonza’s discussions with the EPA or the timing on a possible decision by the agency.
An EPA spokesperson said on Friday Lonza was one of several companies to have submitted laboratory data against SARS-CoV-2, but declined to elaborate on the approval timeline.
Lonza is one of a few big chemical companies, along with U.S.-based Stepan Co and Pilot Chemicals, which own chemical formulations that go into many household products. The formulations typically have been pre-tested and EPA- approved for use against a variety of pathogens. Lonza’s current clients include 3M (NYSE:MMM) and the maker of Pine Glo kitchen and bathroom cleaner. 
The EPA in March issued new guidelines, allowing hundreds of smaller companies to quickly gain regulatory approval without subjecting their products to time-consuming testing. 
Applicants with data showing their products are effective against “non-enveloped” viruses won expedited approval to market their products as potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2. The EPA considers “non-enveloped” viruses to be harder-to-kill than even SARS-CoV-2, which is an “enveloped” virus. 
That easing of the rules coupled with the licensing means companies can go through an accelerated EPA vetting process than the previous time frame of six months to one year for approval.
Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in a statement late March that the move would allow the EPA to better protect public health by assuring the availability of surface disinfectants to use against the novel coronavirus.
“Supplemental registration is by far the easiest and quickest mechanism to get a product into the market,"" said regulatory consultant Kevin Kutcel. ""You just send a notification to the EPA and you can immediately get into the marketplace very, very quickly.” 
Lonza’s Lippert said the company had a more than 110% spike in supplemental registrations of its formulations in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of the year. It also is currently reviewing 62 applications to license its formulas, most of which already are EPA-approved as effective against “non-enveloped” viruses. 
“Normally regulators are pretty dogmatic about these things - they insist on all the testing and are pretty rigid,” said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble’s surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ""But now the situation out there is pretty desperate.” 
Consumer demand for cleaning and disinfecting products continues to soar. 
“The Pope couldn’t have bought a bottle of Lysol last week if he wanted to, and now because of the EPA’s approval [of Lysol] it’ll be even harder,” said Josh Bloom, director of chemical and pharmaceutical sciences at consumer advocacy group American Council of Science and Health (ACSH). 
Over the past five months, the EPA has approved nearly 750 products that license formulations as potentially effective against COVID, according to a list compiled by the American Chemistry Council trade group. 
In late February, the list had only about 100 products, almost all from Lysol and Clorox (NYSE:CLX). By June, the ACC list was comprised mostly of other brands licensing formulations from primary registrants Lonza, Pilot and Stepan, according to a Reuters analysis. 

Stepan and Pilot were not immediately available to comment.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Friday two Massachusetts men pose too great of a risk of flight to be released on bail given ""spectacular"" allegations that they helped orchestrate former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn's escape from Japan.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell said U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, had also failed to show they would likely succeed in fighting the charges underlying Japan's recent request for their extradition.
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, after being charged with engaging in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.
Cabell cited allegations that the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, ""used his skills and experience to plan and execute a most intricate, sophisticated, and deceptive scheme"" to smuggle Ghosn out of Japan in a box on Dec. 29, 2019.
He said the Taylors also appeared to have ""substantial resources"" they could exploit to potentially flee, including about $860,000 that Ghosn appears to have wired to a company co-managed by Peter Taylor two months before the escape. 
The Taylors had argued that the charges against them were fatally flawed, as Japanese penal code does not make it a criminal offense to help someone ""bail jump"" or escape unless that person is in custody.
But Cabell said that argument ignored other ""unambiguous"" language in the penal code that allows people to face charges if they enable someone's escape, ""without regard to whether the criminal was or was not in confinement.""

A lawyer for the Taylors did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They are expected to try again to seek their release on bail during a hearing before a different judge, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, on June 28.

Unilever is also considering excluding its stake in a PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. venture that makes Lipton bottled drinks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Removing these assets from the sale could reduce the eventual proceeds by as much as several billion pounds and make the portfolio less attractive to some potential bidders, the people said. The remaining parts of the business could fetch about 4 billion pounds ($5 billion) to 5 billion pounds, according to the people.
Details on the sale process could be announced as soon as this month, the people said. Unilever is scheduled to announce its half-year results on July 23, according to its website.
Shifting Tastes
Unilever has been seeking to reshape its portfolio as consumers’ tastes change. Deliberations are ongoing, and details of the potential divestment are still subject to change, the people said. A representative for Unilever declined to comment.
Sales in Unilever’s tea business declined by a low-single digit percentage in the first quarter of this year, mainly due to especially weak demand in India and restaurant closures globally. Tea demand has suffered in recent years amid a shift to artisan coffee, though in some markets it’s become associated with trends toward healthier living.
Unilever said in January it’s starting a strategic review of the tea business that could result in a partial or full sale. While a bidding process has yet to formally kick off, major buyout firms from KKR & Co. to Cinven are already considering making offers for the assets, Bloomberg News reported last month.
The division has also attracted preliminary interest from Advent International, Bain Capital, Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc., Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Swiss investment firm Jacobs Holding AG, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.

The $6.1 billion UBS O’Connor fund gained 11.5% through the end of June, according to a person with knowledge of returns who declined to be identified as the data isn’t public. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment on performance. Funds that follow a similar approach lost 5.1% over the period, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.
Their relative-value trades offer a glimpse into survival strategies of hedge funds that rode the first half’s roller-coaster crisis markets. The UBS team paired securities of the same company up against one another, like shorting the stock of an airline while buying its credit. That paid off as the Federal Reserve dove into corporate bonds and stoked a rally that’s lifted the credit of the riskiest companies which are foundering in an uneven stock recovery.
“We aggressively grossed up risk across all our credit strategies as the Fed embarked on its monetary policy support program,” Kevin Russell, the New York-based chief investment officer of the UBS O’Connor fund, said in a phone interview. “Trades in credit versus equity in distressed corporates was a significant driver of performance,” he said, without detailing returns.

The gains stand out in a first half that saw hedge funds overall plunge a record 7.9% on an asset-weighted basis, according to HFR data released Wednesday.
Despite industry losses, the likes of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management have been touting the virtues of diversifying into hedge funds as an alternative to fixed income with dwindling yields.
O’Connor is UBS AM’s direct investing hedge fund business, and became available to outside investors in June 2000. Returns last year were 9%, according to the person with knowledge of the fund, outperforming peers in an HFR index.
Election Risks
After the market’s turbulent first half, the team is assessing risks stemming from the U.S. election. The November vote topped worries in a survey of money managers last month by RBC Capital Markets.
Russell, who ran  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). global equity trading desk until 2015, sees the possibility of a Democratic sweep and a regime of higher taxes knocking 10% to 15% off S&P 500 earnings.
“The U.S. election is a very obvious and large risk that’s standing out there,” he said. “That’ll be a big story, probably in September, and that’s what we’re focused on.”
More recently, Russell has been grabbing bonds going cheap on the new-issue market, where the riskiest U.S. companies have borrowed more than ever in June.
“Routinely we see individual bonds that look very attractive relative to other bonds, and usually it’s just a function of the liquidity and issuance, and it’s been a big source of our returns,” he said.

By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 67 points or 0.3% at 25,773 points. The S&P 500 was up less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite, which retreated on Thursday from the record highs posted earlier in the week, was down another 0.2%. 
Concerns about the relentless rise in new coronavirus cases was held in check partly by an announcement from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) that preliminary results from tests of its experimental drug Remdesivir associated it with a 62% drop in mortality in Covid-19 patients. While that's still not a silver bullet, it adds to the body of evidence showing progress by the healthcare sector in researching treatments for the coronavirus. Gilead stock opened up 2.3% but is still well below the highs it posted in the spring on the initial hopes for remdesivir.
Among the biggest fallers was Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock, which fell 6.5% in response to a downgrade from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to 'sell' from 'neutral'. Citi analysts expressed concern about upward pressure on the company's operating costs.
Another stock in the red - albeit only modestly - was Boeing (NYSE:BA), which fell 0.2% on the back of a report that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is seeking to cancel part of an order for 737 MAX airplanes. American Airlines stock was up 1.2%.
In the absence of economic data Friday, sentiment was largely driven again by developments with the pandemic. The U.S. recorded a new high of over 63,000 new cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins, with rising death and hospitalization rates also recorded in California, Texas and Florida. In addition, the state of Nevada reimposed limits on indoor dining and bars, clouding the outlook for the hospitality and entertainment sector in Las Vegas. The state of Kentucky also imposed a requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces. 
""There are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,"" the U.S.'s top doctor Anthony Fauci told CNN. The Financial Times quoted Fauci as saying that hadn't briefed President Donald Trump in two months.   
The virus is also casting a shadow over oil prices, which fell to a two-week low after the International Energy Agency warned it could derail the expected recovery in fuel demand in the second half of this year. U.S. crude futures subsequently recovered to be up 0.2% at $39.67 a barrel."

Investing.com --   Tech is finally taking time off its seemingly unstoppable rise, except for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The streaming entertainment service is up 2.6% on Friday, to about $520, thanks to a price target boost from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Goldman increased its price target to $670, a market high, versus its previous target of $540, CNBC reported citing the analyst note. NFLX could jump by more than 30% over the next year, and should expect another large number of subscribers in the second quarter when it reports next week, even after a big jump in numbers in the first quarter. 
Goldman forecast a net addition of at least 12.5 million subscribers. In the first quarter, the company added 15.77 million net subscribers.
“While the thesis ‘if you haven’t subscribed by now, you never will’ is an easy rhetorical, it fails to capture the reality of Netflix’s earlier stage markets and a dramatically changing world that is pushing changes into every corner of consumer behavior,” the note said.
Shares of Netflix are up almost 60% in 2020. The company has 22 buy ratings, nine holds and four sells, with an average price target of $481.87, according to data compiled by Investing.com.

The Academy, a think tank established in 1994 as a sister body to the older Pontifical Academy of Sciences, holds regular international symposiums on subjects of social concern such as human trafficking, modern slavery and debt relief.
They are attended by world luminaries in their fields and produce reports which the pope can use to guide him on non-religious issues.
As a member, Draghi, who during his tenure as ECB president was widely credited with saving the euro, will play key roles in choosing topics for conferences and deciding who to invite. 
The Academy held a conference in February that brought together more than 25 government officials, religious authorities and economists, including Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
The February conference, on the theme of new forms of solidarity, facilitated talks between Georgieva and Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman on the Latin American country’s debt crisis.
Stiglitz is also one of the Academy's more than 20 members.
The symposiums are held in the Casina Pio IV, a building nestled in the Vatican Gardens that was built in 1561 as a summer residence for Pope Pius IV.

Draghi, an Italian who once headed the Bank of Italy, stepped down from the ECB last October after an eight-year mandate.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - AliExpress Russia, an e-commerce venture between Chinese online shopping giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Russian partners, said it was aiming for annual turnover of $10 billion by 2022-2023, up from what analysts estimate is about $6 billion now.
Chief Executive Dmitry Sergeev, who did not give details on current turnover, told Reuters the company could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in three to four years, although he called the existing shareholding structure ""optimal"".
""We are completely localising business and are building a separate company here,"" Sergeev said in an interview, adding that this meant improving the Russian language search function and expanding the network of local sellers.
He said AliExpress Russia wanted to increase the share of Russian sellers on the platform to 50% by 2022-2023, adding that purchases from China now dominated business. He also said the firm aimed for 50 million customers a year.
The venture between Alibaba, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, mobile operator Megafon and internet firm Mail.Ru is one of several players expanding in Russia's 2 trillion rouble ($28 billion) e-commerce market.
Experts from Moscow's Higher School of Economics estimated the volume of goods shipped to Russians from abroad was worth $6.5 billion in 2019. A Russian Postal Service official said more than 90% of foreign shipments arrived from China, much of it driven by online orders via AliExpress Russia. 
Sergeev said AliExpress Russia would invest in logistics in its effort to cut delivery times from China to 10 days from as long as 20 days now, saying this could be achieved with local Russian partners.
""I believe the value of owning the entire logistics infrastructure is overestimated,"" he said, adding that there were a range of possible partners.
He did not rule out mergers and acquisitions, saying smaller players were likely to lose out as the marketed consolidated.

The company said the finding requires confirmation in prospective clinical trials.
Gilead said it analyzed data from 312 patients treated in a late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity as in the study. 
Findings from the analysis of its late-stage study showed that 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59.0% of patients receiving standard of care, the company said. 
The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6% at Day 14, compared with 12.5% among patients not on remdesivir.

Gilead shares were up nearly 2% at $76.14 in trading before the bell.

Values declined 0.9% compared with the first three months of the year as the country locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, on a yearly basis, prices rose across Wales and all regions of England. Scotland bucked this trend with a 0.8% slide, its first decline in seven years.
On Wednesday, the government temporarily lifted a sales tax levied against the first 500,000 pounds ($630,000) of house prices. The move is aimed at reviving activity in the market, although analysts have questioned how effective it will be.
“Whilst low mortgage costs, quantitative easing by the Bank of England, and government measures to lessen the impact of Covid-19 should soften the blow, on balance further price falls seem most likely in the second half of the year,” said Paul Smith, economics director at IHS.
The stamp duty break, which came into effect immediately and remains until March 2021, could provide a much-needed boost to the market for expensive homes in London and southeast England. Those two regions have traditionally had the highest house prices in the country. The house price-to-earnings ratio remains at historically high levels at 6.18%, against 6.20% for the first quarter of 2020.

Yanlian China Hedged Fund Index, which tracks 50 Chinese investment funds with hedging strategies, generated an annualized return of 11.5% over the past five years, compared with an annualized loss of 4% for the CSI300 (CSI300) benchmark. 
""I have witnessed several cycles of bull and bear markets,"" said Liu Wencai, founder of Shanghai-based risk-management consultancy D-Union, which launched the index. 
""In every bull market, people rush in, only to be trapped when the market turns bearish,"" said Liu, who describes China's current bull as a liquidity-driven ""water buffalo"". 
The CSI300 jumped to five-year highs this week, also boosted by government support, capital reform hopes and signs of economic recovery. BofA said investors poured the most cash into China funds since July 2015.
However, fears are growing of a repeat of the 2015-16 bubble that saw the benchmark Shanghai index (SSEC) fall more than 40% from its peak in just a few weeks. 
A growing number of long-only mutual funds have started restricting inflows.
The Yanlian index, which tracks 20 mutual funds, and 30 private funds, could potentially provide a tool for investors seeking relatively stable returns in a low-yield environment.
The funds tracked by the index use derivatives such as stock index futures or options to hedge risks and iron out excessive fluctuations. 
It could also help overseas investors navigate China's crowded fund market as regulators are expected soon to allow qualified foreign institutions to directly invest in local private securities funds.
Another impetus for risk-hedging is China's ongoing campaign to bar asset managers from guaranteeing to protect investors' principal. 

""More and more people are paying attention to the concept of risk-hedging,"" said Li Lu, professor of finance at the Shanghai International Studies University. ""More and more funds with hedging strategies are being born in China.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, amid continuing concerns about the growth of coronavirus cases and its impact on the prospects for economic recovery ahead of the upcoming earnings season.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 5 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract fell 55 points, or 0.2%.
More than 3 million Americans have already been infected by Covid-19, with three of the country's four most populous - Texas, California and Florida - posting record daily levels of related deaths.
Top U.S. pandemics expert Anthony Fauci, speaking earlier this week on a podcast hosted by The Wall Street Journal, said that new Covid-19 cases were seeing “exponential growth.” 
“It went from an average of about 20,000 to 40,000 and 50,000. That’s doubling. If you continue doubling, two times 50 is 100,” Fauci said. “Any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down.”
U.S. equity markets have posted strong gains since the depths of March, helped by better-than-expected economic data and extraordinary fiscal and monetary aid from the U.S. authorities.
However, the recent surge in infections has raised doubts over the sustainability of those gains, as states start to reintroduce social distancing measures.
“I wouldn’t paint myself as a bear, but the risks between here and year-end are completely to the downside,” said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) head of equity research Savita Subramanian Thursday.
The new earnings season starts in earnest next week. Investors will be watching bank earnings, in particular, for signs that the business shutdowns and massive job losses because of Covid-19 have begun to erode credit quality, which could leave banks holding a rising number of bad loans.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) starts the ball rolling on Tuesday.
Oil prices weakened Friday, as the International Energy Agency warned that the recovery could be derailed by the resurgence of coronavirus - although it lifted its outlook for global oil demand this year marginally.
“The large, and in some countries, accelerating number of Covid-19 cases is a disturbing reminder that the pandemic is not under control and the risk to our market outlook is almost certainly to the downside,” the IEA said. 
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $39.04 a barrel, on track for a weekly loss of around 3%. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $41.84, set to drop around 2%.

The luxury group said on Friday it was not yet possible to accurately estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely hit the whole industry this year but said it had the resources to cope with uncertainties.
Net sales grew 2.3% to 2.158 billion euros ($2.44 billion) last year, thanks primarily to the 7% increase in comparable sales in the directly managed store and e-commerce network.
Overall 2019 revenues, including licences, rose by 9% to 4.157 billion euros.
Earnings before tax declined around 12% to 175 million euros and net earnings totalled 124 million euros.

A Johannesburg index of producers has surged more than 90% this year, even as the broader South African equities benchmark remains in the red for 2020. The sector rose another 3.2% to an all-time high on Friday.
“Gold mining stocks are essentially leveraged plays on the gold price,” said Seleho Tsatsi, an analyst at Anchor Capital in Johannesburg. “Relatively small moves in the gold price result in big swings in profitability for the gold miners, because these businesses have big fixed-cost bases.”
Gold has advanced 19% this year, driving it within reach of the all-time high price of $1,921 an ounce reached in September 2011. Vast amounts of global stimulus to shield economies from the ravages of Covid-19 haved pushed real yields below zero and made bullion more attractive. The rand price of gold has risen 44%, as the currency weakened against the dollar, improving the profit margins for local producers.
Johannesburg’s five best-performing stocks are all from the sector, with  Drdgold  (JO:DRDJ) closing in on a fourfold gain for 2020.  Pan African Resources  PLC (LON:PAFR) has climbed 99%, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY). 94%, Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI) Ltd. 90% and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd (JO:ANGJ) 72%.
Their breakneck ascent has activated at least one warning that the gains may be overdone. The 14-day relative strength index for the gold stocks gauge is at 73, above the level of 70 that suggests to some technical analysts that the securities are overbought. Even so, there could be further upside.
“Really aggressive central bank action, not just from the U.S. but central banks around the world following the pandemic this year, is probably the biggest driver of gold prices at the moment,” Tsatsi said. “As long as that continues, which it appears as if it will in the short-term, it should be supportive to gold prices.""

The move comes at a time when auto manufacturers and EV battery makers are joining forces in pursuit of an electric future. CATL, based in Ningde, said last year it would develop batteries with Honda and also supply batteries to Tesla (O:TSLA), Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
Honda and CATL said in a statement they would develop battery technologies and research a battery recycling business. Honda will launch its first EV with CATL's battery in China in 2022 and will expand the partnership with stable EV battery supply globally in the future.
Honda has struck a number of partnerships to make electric cars, including a joint venture with China's GAC (SS:601238) under which the Japanese automaker began selling its first all-battery EV, the Everus VE-1 SUV crossover, in China last year. 
It has also tied up with Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd's (T:6501) auto parts subsidiary to develop, produce and sell motors to be used in petrol hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric cars. 
For the North American market, Honda has partnered with General Motors Co (N:GM) to develop two new EVs. The two are also working to develop hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology.
CATL is building a battery plant in Germany and is considering expanding to North America. It has an office in Yokohama near Tokyo. Its Shenzhen-listed shares closed at about 200 yuan ($28.54) on Friday.

Carney, who until recently was the governor of the Bank of England, has championed a framework from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which helps companies figure out what information to share.
While the TCFD is currently voluntary, Carney has floated the idea of making it compulsory and is keen to see greater adoption to help investors make more informed decisions when assessing climate-related risks.
Ahead of the next round of U.N. climate talks in Scotland next year - COP26 - Carney and David Schwimmer, the chief executive of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) , have written to a number of stock exchanges to urge them to help.
In jointly signed letters to an unspecified number of exchanges, dated July 8, the pair asked them to support a new initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (UN SSE (LON:SSE)) set to launch in September.
The initiative, to be chaired by the LSE, aims to draw up best practice reporting guidance on climate disclosures, which can be used by companies wherever they are listed, to ensure globally consistent disclosures in line with TCFD.
""Ensuring that every professional financial decision takes the risks and opportunities of climate change into account is a core objective of COP 26,"" said the letter, seen by Reuters.
""The work of stock exchanges in supporting the widespread adoption of TCFD reporting is critical in this regard.""
Jack Ehnes, chief executive of U.S. pension scheme CalSTRS, also backed the move.
""Institutional investors like CalSTRS need globally consistent high quality climate and sustainability data to inform investment decisions. 

""Exchanges can play a critical role to improve the data and reinforce global standards.""

MEERUT/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India re-opened for business in June after months of lockdown but for thousands of small entrepreneurs in the town of Meerut, near Delhi, the blow has been devastating.
Businesses from textiles to sports goods and furniture are shuttered or working at a bare minimum, and cows roam streets that would be normally packed with workers and vehicles. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's programme to help small businesses back on their feet through $40 billion of government-guaranteed loans is too little and may not be enough to save the many companies that form the backbone of India's economy, nearly three dozen entrepreneuers Reuters spoke to across the country said. 
Some said their business was so hamstrung by the pandemic that taking on new debt made little sense. They would rather the government had helped them by cutting the goods and service tax or waive off the interest on loans. 
Others said that despite Modi's promise to open up the credit lines, it was not easy convincing bankers to lend because of the death throes their businesses were in.
Ashok, whose near 10 million rupees ($133,000) annual turnover company based in Meerut made steel furniture for hotels and schools, said he had fired eight of his 10 workers and was thinking of shutting down the operation. 
""It would be better for me to close the unit than to run from pillar to post to get a loan,"" said Ashok, who did not want to give his full name. 
He said his banker told him his creditworthiness is low as his business is struggling. 
The Finance Ministry, which has made the loan support scheme the centerpiece of the rescue effort, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the problems faced by businesmen.
Small businesses that account for nearly one-quarter of India’s $2.9 trillion economy and employ more than 500 million workers are the worst affected by the pandemic. 
Nearly 35% of the 650 million small businesses across the country could shut down soon in the absence of government support, the Consortium of Indian Associations said in a letter to Modi's office seen by Reuters.
DOLE OUT LOANS
Bankers said there is government pressure to dole out loans, but businesses are not coming forward as demand remains tepid. 
Till now, lenders have paid out 561 billion rupees, barely 19% of the sum earmarked, and approved loans worth 1,145 billion rupees since the third week of May, according to government data.
Businesses say that the lenders are either asking for increased paperwork or the ones in desperate needs are being deemed ineligible. 
""I was asked to provide a collateral and also buy an insurance for getting this loan whereas it is supposed to be collateral free,"" said an entrepreneur in Modi's home state of Gujarat. 
But two bankers said that securing money from the government even in a fully-backed sovereign guarantee scheme is not easy.
""The experience is unpleasant,"" said the former corporate head of a state-owned bank. 
""You lend to most of these businesses only because government has directed but when it comes to getting back the money, one has to spend considerable resources and time which makes little sense,"" he added.
Businesses have been pushed to the wall as their suppliers have not paid and orders have trickled to zero while fixed costs including electricity, wages, installments for earlier bank loans have drained their funds. 
""We have not got a single rupee relief from the government,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, a garment manufacturer in Meerut who is running his factories at 25% of the production capacity.
Rastogi has incurred a loss of 3.5 million rupees in the last two months and believes he may have to close down his business in the next three months.
About 25% small factories out of over 10,000 textile units in Meerut could shut down and default on bank loans in the next few months, said Anurag Agarwal, chairman of the Meerut chapter of Indian Industry Association. 
Rastogi is making last ditch efforts to remain in business.
""Otherwise, I will sell the factory at any price to save some money for my retirement.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co is planning to reopen its Orlando-based Walt Disney World theme park on July 11, ending the longest shutdown of the company's highly profitable U.S. theme park division in its history. 
Yet investors remain wary that a reopening that includes attendance limits and strict social distancing rules will boost the company's shares, especially as record numbers of coronavirus cases limit the appeal of traveling to Florida. Instead, they point to the company's already-high valuation as a result of the outsized success of its Disney Plus streaming platform as limiting any benefit from the resumption of its U.S. park operations. 
""Disney has become the ultimate hold. You don't want to add to it here because it's unclear how long it will be until park revenue comes back to a normalized level, but you don't want to sell it"" because it remains more attractive than other media companies, said David Mazza, a managing direction at Direxion. 
Disney did not respond to a request for comment.
Shares of the company are down 8.3% over the last month, compared with a 2.3% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time, and have fallen 19.1% since the beginning of January. Despite those declines, Disney trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 43.8, just below its 52-week high of 47.8. Its P/E fell to a 52-week low of 14 on March 23 after beginning the year near 22. 
Much of the gains in valuation have come from renewed investor attention to Disney Plus, which has attracted more than 50 million subscribers since launching in November. That growth, however, will likely not make up for the hit from the decline in the parks division. 
""The economic recession plus the need for social distancing, new health precautions, the lack of travel and crowd aversion are likely to make this business less profitable until there is a widely available vaccine,"" analysts at UBS noted. They project that earnings before interest and taxes in the parks division will fall by approximately $500 million in this fiscal year and $200 million the next, compared with a $6.8 billion gain in fiscal 2019. 
Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Funds, said his firm has been reducing its position in Disney because the shares look over-valued at a time when its parks division will be limited and its ESPN and ABC segments are suffering from severe cutbacks in professional sports. 
""A lot of the benefit you'd get from the return to full speed of parks and the return to full speed to professional sports is going to get ruined by a P/E contraction"" once investor euphoria over the launch of its streaming business wears off, Smead said. ""The next 10 years are spectacularly in their favor in terms of demographics, but the expansion of the earnings ratio at the same time that COVID is crushing a significant part of their business doesn't make sense."" 
Chris Marangi, a portfolio manager of Gabelli Funds, said investors are likely waiting for a larger margin of safety before taking bigger positions in the company, given its high valuation. Its parks division will likely not return to more normalized levels of revenue until at least 2022, he said, giving the company a short-term hit to earnings but building up longer-term demand once a vaccine relieves Disney of instituting capacity caps. 
Disney has reopened its Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland parks, and on June 24 announced it was delaying a reopening of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California indefinitely. The company's Tokyo parks opened July 1. 
""As we look out, Disney is the best-positioned media company for the next decade given their franchises and the success of Disney Plus in particular, but the near-term is going to be challenged,"" Marangi said.

Rome has been threatening to revoke the toll road licence held by Atlantia's Autostrade per l'Italia unit since a bridge it operated in the port city of Genoa collapsed in August 2018, killing 43 people.
The government has brought to a head the two-year long dispute saying it wants a solution by the end of the week after rejecting previous proposals by Autostrade to reach a compromise.
Atlantia declined to comment on the board meetings.
To put a stop to proceedings to revoke the concession, Autostrade must submit a new proposal by the weekend detailing steps that include lowering tariffs and paying compensation to meet indications received from the government at a meeting on Thursday.
The Benetton family owns 30% of Atlantia which in turns owns 88% of Autostrade, the rest being in the hands of Chinese fund Silk Road and Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG). 
Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, a partner in the ruling coalition, wants the Benettons to loosen their grip on Autostrade after calling for the group to be stripped of its concession. 
The ruling centre-left PD party has said it would favour a settlement to avoid legal disputes dragging on.
Two sources familiar with the matter have said the Benettons were ready to lower Atlantia's stake in Autostrade below 50% through a capital increase that new shareholders could subscribe to.
Sources have previously said the government had drafted a plan under which infrastructure fund F2i and state lender CDP would split a majority stake in Autostrade. 
By 0845 shares in Atlantia were up 3.4%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurer Admiral (L:ADML) has restarted sales of travel insurance to new customers now Britons are once more allowed to go on holiday, but rivals  Aviva  (L:AV),  Direct Line  (L:DLGD) and LV= are yet to follow. 
Major travel insurers in Britain said in mid March they would only offer cover for existing customers after several countries, including the United States, banned visitors from other countries due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Following months of lockdown, the UK government changed its guidelines to remove quarantine for travellers returning from more than 50 countries. The changes take effect on Friday. 
Admiral said on its website it would provide travel insurance for new customers, including for medical expenses and repatriation related to COVID-19. But it said the insurance would not cover cancellation due to the virus.
Admiral started selling the cover to new customers from July 7, a spokesperson said by email.
Aviva, Direct Line and Allianz-owned (DE:ALVG) LV= said they were not yet reinstating travel insurance for new customers.
""Direct Line will resume the sale of new travel insurance policies once we are confident that we can provide cover that meets the needs of our customers,"" a spokesperson said by email.
 Saga  (L:SAGA) and Staysure said they had not stopped providing travel insurance for new customers during the lockdown, but also said their policies would not cover cancellation due to COVID-19.
Saga added in an emailed statement that providing cancellation cover was a priority and it was working on it with its partners.
Travel insurers will pay a record 275 million pounds ($346 million) in claims related to the pandemic this year, according to the Association of British Insurers.

84,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 05:34AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Carlsberg's Reassuringly Sober Outlook,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) doesn’t give guidance right now, but if it did, it would be – if not the best in the world, then at least pretty decent.
The Danish brewer’s stock rose 4.7% on Friday in response to an early update on its first-half performance, which included the key messages that its Chinese business was rebounding “strongly” and that Europe, too, had seen “improved performance” toward the end of the second quarter.  The benchmark STOXX 600 was up 0.3%, on course for a modest loss of 0.3% for the week.
The group also said it’s putting its share buyback program under review, to balance the need for cash to pay for acquisitions and dividends.
Normally, that would be taken as a negative, but the mere fact that it isn’t being suspended outright makes the news more encouraging than it would otherwise be, as does the reassurance that the dividend will still be paid.
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) stock is now only 2% below its post-pandemic high and, at 20 times trailing earnings, a rare example of a stock trading at a multiple that can be justified without magical thinking or advanced degrees in finance.
A yield of 2.4% on Thursday’s closing price is one of the better illustrations of the argument that “dividends are the new coupons”, given the reliability of the company’s cash flows and the low debt level (net debt is just 1.25 times EBITDA and it has no maturities until late 2022). Its recent acquisition of Marston’s brewing business at a knockdown price is also a sign that, even if management is withholding cash from shareholders, it’s using it to exploit such growth opportunities as can still be found in brewing.
The historical numbers are, naturally, not pretty: according to the group’s preliminary estimates, sales volumes fell 7.7% and revenue fell 11.6% in the first half of the year as the world shut its bars and restaurants. That also compressed margins, forcing the company to rely on supermarket and convenience store sales.
There may be further compression in the second half if it spends all the marketing dollars that it saved during the first six months.
Moreover, Carlsberg isn’t celebrating the end of the pandemic just yet. This is hardly surprising, given the weight in its sales mix of Russia, which is one of many emerging markets struggling to bring the coronavirus under control.
“Although government lockdowns are gradually being lifted, the sales development across our regions in the coming months continues to be volatile and uncertain, not least during the important summer months,” the company said Friday.
The smart money is still on that being at the more optimistic end of the guidance spectrum in the upcoming earnings season."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks and oil prices were faltering on Friday as record-setting new coronavirus cases in several U.S. states led to worries that more lockdowns may be necessary, making a quick economic recovery unlikely.
The upcoming second-quarter earnings season, expected to be the worst for Europe and the United States since the 2008/09 financial crisis, added to the woes, pushing investors to chase safe-haven assets, such as U.S. Treasuries and the yen.
European stocks declined 0.3%, taking cues from Asia, where China ended its rally. Shares in China fell 1.8% from a five-year high, as state media discouraged retail investors from chasing the market higher.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3%. Australian stocks declined by 0.6% as an extension of loan-payment deferrals hit the banking sector. Japanese stocks were down by 1.1%.
The e-mini futures for the S&P 500 erased early gains to trade down 0.6%.
More than 60,500 new coronavirus infections were reported across the United States on Thursday, the largest single-day tally of cases by any country since the virus emerged late last year in China.
Graphic: Stocks, oil and coronavirus cases https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/nmovajrmzpa/Pasted%20image%201594367152428.png
""The sharp increase in confirmed cases has led to growing concerns that a return to broad lockdowns lies ahead,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. ""While lockdowns can slow down virus spread effectively, they come at very high economic cost.""
Some Asian cities that had appeared to have contained the disease, such as Tokyo, Hong Kong and Melbourne, have also seen a spike in cases, prompting investors to take shelter in safe-haven assets.
In the currency market, the yen rose 0.4% against the dollar and 0.5% versus the euro. U.S. Treasury yields dipped to their lowest levels since late April.
Gold was the only safe haven that didn't join the rush-for-safety party, sliding 0.3%, a day after hitting an eight-year high.
While economic data continued to improve, with the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits dropping to a near four-month low last week, investors remained cautious. A record 32.9 million people were still collecting unemployment checks.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.39% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.56%, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.53% to its fifth record closing high in six days.
In other moves, the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which are often traded as a liquid proxy for risk because of their close ties to China's economy, both fell against the greenback.
The Aussie also fell as local officials use lockdowns and border restrictions to contain a sudden increase in coronavirus cases.
U.S. crude oil fell 2% to $38.81 a barrel and Brent crude fell 1.7% to $41.63 per barrel amid concern about a long-term decline in global energy demand.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, amid worries the global economic recovery might fade as coronavirus cases increase.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.3%. 
French industrial production showed a strong rebound in May, data showed earlier Friday, climbing 19.6% from April, as lockdowns were eased and factories reopened.
This follows on from German and Spanish industrial production figures also bouncing earlier this week, posting a 7.8% and a 14.7% increase in May, respectively.
However, these are May figures, and the worry is that the resurgence of coronavirus cases around the world since then, particularly in the U.S., will put this nascent recovery at risk.
EU leaders are set to get together next week to discuss, among other things, the proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund for economies hit hardest by Covid-19.
There remain fundamental disagreements over key aspects, meaning the plan could still be watered down or fail.
The European Central Bank is also scheduled to meet next week, but little new is expected after the June meeting increased the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program.
“They have deserved it. After all the excitement since March, next week’s meeting should give the ECB some time to reflect and take stock. It will not be the moment to decide on any new action,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
In corporate news, Dufry AG (SIX:DUFN) stock fell 5.8% after the Swiss duty free operator said it was cutting personnel expenses by 20% to 30% this year to combat the hit to sales caused by the pandemic. More positively, Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) A/S A (CSE:CARLa) shares rose 4.7% after the brewer said it had seen signs of a sharp rebound in demand due to restocking at the end of the second quarter.
Fast fashion group Boohoo.com  (LON:BOOH) shares rose another 6.5% as the shock of revelations about its supply chain last weekend dissipated.
Oil prices weakened Friday, heading for a weekly decline after the steep losses seen during the previous session, as the International Energy Agency also warned that the continuing spread of the coronavirus could derail the recovery in demand.
Oil inventories also remain bloated, with the U.S. oil stocks rising by nearly 6 million barrels last week.
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $39.09 a barrel, on track for a weekly loss of around 3%. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $41.88, set to drop around 2%.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,804.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1279, largely flat on the day."

Ho, who died at age 98 on May 26, presided over the transformation of once-sleepy Macau into the world's biggest casino center, outpacing the United States' Las Vegas strip. 
Shielded from challengers by a four-decade monopoly on gambling, Ho grew his operations into one of the world's most lucrative gaming businesses through his flagship firm SJM Holdings (HK:0880), valued at about $6 billion.
His privately held company Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, or STDM, has stakes in everything from luxury hotels to helicopters and horse racing.
At Ho's one-hour funeral ceremony, black suited guests, including many local tycoons, donned face masks.
Among Ho's pallbearers were Hong Kong's top leader, Carrie Lam, and senior members of China's top political consultative body (CPPCC), Edmund Ho and Tung Chee-hwa. 
White flower wreaths from well wishers filled the funeral parlour, including condolences from Chinese president Xi Jinping, the South China Morning Post reported.
Ho's death comes as Macau faces a critical juncture, with officials warning that the special administrative region is too dependent on gambling and faces acute challenges as it reels from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Succession plans for Ho, who had four wives and 17 known children, had been in place since 2012, when he was forced to restructure his business after a legal battle within the family over his fortune.
His family remains a huge part of in Macau's gambling industry. His daughter Daisy is chairman of SJM, while his fourth wife, Angela Leong, is a co-chair. His daughter Pansy is co-chair of MGM Resorts (N:MGM) Macau unit (HK:2282), while his son Lawrence runs Melco Resorts and Entertainment (O:MLCO)

89,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",Pandemic-proofing: Insurance may never be the same again,"By Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Insurers are creating products for a world where virus outbreaks could become the new normal after many businesses were left out in the cold during the COVID-19 crisis.
While new pandemic-proof policies might not be cheap, they offer businesses from restaurants to film production companies to e-commerce retailers ways of insuring against disruptions and losses if another virus strikes.
The providers include big insurers and brokers adding new products to existing coverage, as well as niche players that see an opportunity in filling the void left by mainstream firms that categorize virus outbreaks like wars or nuclear explosions. 
Tech firm Machine Cover, for example, aims to offer policies next year that would give relief during lockdowns. Using apps and other data sources, the Boston-based company measures traffic levels around businesses such as restaurants, department stores, hairdressers and car dealers.
If traffic drops below a certain level, it pays out, whatever the reason.
""This is the type of coverage which ... businesses thought they had paid for when they bought their current business interruption policies before the coronavirus pandemic,"" the company's founder Inder-Jeet Gujral told Reuters.
""I believe this will be a major opportunity because post-COVID, it would be as irresponsible to not buy insurance against pandemics as it would be to not buy insurance against fire."" 
The company is backed by insurer Hiscox and individual investors, mostly from the insurance and private equity world.
Restaurants in Florida's Miami-Dade County, where Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Monday ordered dining to shut down soon after reopening, are now reeling, said Andrew Giambarba, a broker for Insurance Office of America in Doral, Florida.
""It's been like they made it to the ninth round of the fight and were holding on when this punch came out of nowhere,"" said Giambarba, whose clients include restaurants that did not get payouts under their business interruption coverage.
""Every niche that is dealing with insurance that is affected by business interruption needs every new product they can have.""
FILLING THE VOID
Pandemic exemptions have helped some insurers emerge relatively unscathed and the sector has largely resisted pressure to provide more virus cover. Indeed, some insurers that paid out for event cancellations and other losses have removed pandemics from their coverage.
British risk managers association Airmic said last week that the pandemic had contributed to a lack of adequate insurance at an affordable price and most of its members were looking at other ways to reduce risk.
To help fill the void in a locked-down world, Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley Plc (L:BEZG), started selling a contingency policy last month to insure organisers of streamed music, cultural and business events against technical glitches.
""These events are completely reliant on the technology working and a failure can be financially crippling,"" said Mark Symons, contingency underwriter at Beazley.
Marsh, the world's biggest insurance broker, has teamed up with AXA XL, part of France's AXA (PA:AXAF), and data firm Arity, which is part of Allstate (NYSE:ALL), to help businesses such as U.S. supermarket chains, restaurants and e-commerce retailers cope with the challenges of social distancing.
With home deliveries surging, firms have hired individual drivers to meet demand, but commercial auto liability insurance for ""gig"" contractors with their own vehicles is hard to find.
Marsh and its partners devised a policy based on usage with a price-by-mile insurance, which can be cheaper than typical commercial auto cover as delivering a pizza doesn't have the same risks as driving people around.
""Even when the pandemic is over, we believe last-mile delivery will continue to grow,"" said Robert Bauer, head of Marsh's U.S. sharing economy and mobility practice. 
A report by consultants Capgemini showed that demand for usage-based insurance has skyrocketed since COVID-19 first broke out and more than 50% of the customers it surveyed wanted it. 
However, only half of the insurers interviewed by Capgemini for its World Insurance Report said they offered it. 
BESPOKE COVER
Since businesses are only now learning how outbreaks can affect them, some new products are effectively custom-made.
Elite Risk Insurance in Newport Beach, California, has been offering ""COVID outbreak relapse coverage"" since May for businesses forced to shut down a second time, its founder Jeff Kleid said.
The policies are crafted around specific businesses and only pay out when certain conditions are met, Kleid said. 
For film and television production companies that could be when a cast member contracts the virus, forcing them to stop shooting. Another client, which raises livestock for restaurants, is covered for a scenario in which it would be impossible to get animal feed.
Such policies do not come cheap. A $1 million policy could cost between about $80,000 to $100,000 depending on the terms.
""The insurance ... is costly because it covers a risk that does not have a historical basis for calculating the price,"" Kleid says.
And in March, when COVID-19 ravaged northern Italy, Generali's (MI:GASI) Europ Assistance offered medical help, financial support and teleconsultations for sufferers when discharged from hospital, on top of regular health insurance.
It sold 1.5 million policies in just two weeks and now has 3 million customers in Europe and United States.
Some insurers are also working on changes to employee compensation and health insurance schemes. With millions of workers not expected to return to offices anytime soon, some large insurers in Asia are preparing coverage to account for that, according to people familiar with those efforts.
At least one Japanese insurer has started work on a product to cover employees for injury while working at home, they said.

""Working from home will be the new normal for years to come. That would make the scope of the employee compensation scheme meaningless if a person suffers an injury while at home,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior executive at a European insurer.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 03:31AM ET</span>",Russia's Nornickel fights cover-up accusations over Arctic oil spill,"By Andrew Osborn and Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pressure is mounting on Russian mining company Norilsk Nickel over an Arctic oil spill that has wiped about 17% off its share price, left it with a hefty compensation bill and exposed it to accusations of covering up the full extent of the damage. 
Nornickel (MM:GMKN), as it is better known, denies the cover-up allegations by green campaigners, a regional governor and a former official at Russia's environmental watchdog, who have spoken out publicly and, in some cases, published tests, photographs and witness accounts to support their allegations.
Their evidence, which Reuters has been unable to verify, shows diesel has spread into a lake and, according to witnesses, into a river that feeds into the Arctic Ocean.
Nornickel, citing official tests and satellite images, denies pollution has spread into either body of water. 
It says it has contained the leak, from a power station near the industrial city of Norilsk on May 29, and that it has recovered 90% of the diesel by using containment booms and pumps. 
It also denies hiding the extent of the damage, saying the vast number of companies, regulators and others officials involved in the clean-up operation guarantees full transparency.
""We cannot imagine how it would be possible to hide anything in such conditions,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""An investigation into the incident is being carried out by regulatory and monitoring agencies.""
Reuters has no independent evidence to support the allegations that Nornickel has suppressed information. 
Nornickel's shares fell 5% in one day in Moscow on Monday after Russia's environmental watchdog demanded over $2 billion in damages. Nornickel said on Wednesday it disputed the size of the claim and the methodology used for its calculation. 
President Vladimir Putin in June chided Vladimir Potanin, the billionaire boss of Norilsk, for not replacing the source of the spill, a fuel tank, in timely fashion and said significant damage had been caused to the fragile Arctic environment.
Potanin told Putin Nornickel would spare no expense to restore the environment and was committed to fund programs that would increase the deer population and maintain rare fish stocks. Nornickel has said publicly it is also committed to a federal investigation into the incident, takes full responsibility for what happened, and wants to avoid a repeat. 
At the market close on Thursday, Nornickel's shares were almost 17.3% lower than at the May 29 opening.
CALLS FOR MORE INFORMATION
The spill was caused by the failure of a reserve fuel tank at the power station, owned by NTEK, a subsidiary of Nornickel. About 21,000 tonnes of diesel leaked into rivers and subsoil near Norilsk. Nornickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel and palladium, blamed melting permafrost driven by climate change for eroding the tank's foundations. 
Federal investigators have blamed the poor state of the fuel tank, and have detained three of the power station's managers and charged Norilsk's mayor with criminal negligence.
Environmental groups and some Russian officials are worried by what they regard as a lack of information about how far the pollution has spread towards the Arctic Ocean.
""It's obvious that a cover-up is under way,"" said Vasily Ryabinin, who quit as an official at state environmental regulator Rosprirodnadzor in Norilsk after the spill.
""Most of the fuel got into the lake before they set up the containment booms,"" he said.
Ryabinin cited as evidence photographs he took on June 4 which appear to show riverbanks beyond the booms towards the lake stained with diesel and says he was obstructed from carrying out a proper inspection of the site on the day of the accident by the power station's security guards and police.
Ryabinin said he and his boss at Rosprirodnadzor were turned back even though his boss was carrying the required identity documents. Rosprirodnadzor later removed him from the case and he then resigned, judging that his employer was complicit in environmental damage. 
Rosprirodnadzor did not respond when asked about the circumstances of his departure and his assertions. His former boss, Andrei Konoplyov, declined to comment. 
Alexander Uss, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region where the leak occurred, also expressed concern after inspecting the accident site and talking with company officials.
He said NTEK had first said that a car caught fire at the site and then changed its version of events to say the fuel tank may have leaked but that there was no ecological damage. Two days passed, he said, before the real picture became clear. 
""There was clearly disinformation (from Nornickel) that you cannot describe as anything else other than a desire to hide what happened or the scale of what happened,"" he told state television in June.
Declaring a state of emergency in the area on June 3, Putin criticized what he called a bungled and delayed response.
""Why did authorities find out about what happened only two days later?,"" Putin, visibly irritated, asked Sergei Lipin, the head of NTEK. ""What, are we going to find out about emergency situations from social media now? Is everything alright with your health?""
Lipin defended NTEK's handling of the accident to Putin, saying it had passed on information about the accident according to its standard plan for fuel spills. He did not comment on Uss's assertion that NTEK had altered its version of events. 
U.S. OFFER OF HELP REJECTED 
Despite the concerns about Russia's worst oil spill since 1994, Moscow has turned down a U.S. offer to help with the clean-up, saying it can manage on its own.
Some environmental campaigners say they doubt Nornickel's assertions that it has been able to recover 90% of the leaked diesel, citing similar clean-ups in the past around the world. 
Nornickel said it stood by its estimate, but that precise data would be available only when the fuel was separated from the collected water. 
Nornickel acts as the main employer and benefactor in the Siberian Arctic city over 2,350 km (1,460 miles) from Moscow. It has appointed a senior executive to the new role of senior vice president for environmental protection and pledged a thorough clean-up.
The tests, photographs and eyewitness accounts cited by Ryabinin, Uss and environmental groups suggest diesel has reached Pyasino Lake, around 20 km (12 miles) north of the spill site. Nornickel, citing official tests, denies that. 
Photographs taken by Ryabinin, and posted online, show banks of the River Ambarnaya beyond the containment booms - the stretch that flows into Lake Pyasino - stained with diesel fuel.
Separately, Moscow hydrogeologist Georgy Kavanosyan tested Pyasina river samples on a trip there in June. In a video posted online, he showed, using technical equipment, how it contained more than double the normal concentration of toxic oil products. 

A spokeswoman for Rosprirodnadzor shared data with Reuters that did not detect critical pollution levels there on June 30. Norilsk has cited the same data to show it is hiding nothing.

Vietnam, Indonesia and South Korea are the only countries in the world to show growth in domestic air travel in July compared with the same month last year, while China and the U.S. dominate in the number of flights operated, Cirium said in a report Friday.
There are 413,538 domestic flights in the U.S. scheduled for this month, down 46% from a year earlier. China has 378,434, though capacity is higher there, according to the report.
The figures “reveal a fragile but cautiously resurgent market, as the air travel attempts to recover from the worst collapse in its history,” Cirium’s director of market development Alistair Rivers said.
India, the third-biggest domestic market after the U.S. and China, is showing signs of a recovery with scheduled domestic flights down just 4% from July 2019.
Aircraft are being brought out of storage to meet the growing demand, with 59% of the global fleet back in service, according to Cirium. At the height of the coronavirus crisis, almost two-thirds of the world’s 26,300 passenger jets were in storage."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Friday, with investors looking for more fiscal stimulus amid worries the global economic recovery might fade as coronavirus cases increase.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower. CAC 40 futures in France were down 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
Finance ministers from the euro area met virtually Thursday, resulting in Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe being elected as the Eurogroup’s new chair. However, there has been disappointment that little fresh emerged about the proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund for economies hit hardest by Covid-19.
The markets will now have to wait for the get together of the European Union leaders, on July 17-18, for any further news about the fund, potentially a groundbreaking program funded by joint debt. 
There remain fundamental disagreements over key aspects, meaning the plan could still be watered down or fail.
The European Central Bank is also scheduled to meet next week, but little new is expected after the June meeting increased the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program.
“They have deserved it. After all the excitement since March, next week’s meeting should give the ECB some time to reflect and take stock. It will not be the moment to decide on any new action,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Meanwhile, worries are mounting that the resurgence in coronavirus cases, particularly in the U.S., could derail an economic recovery.
There were more than 60,500 new Covid-19 infections reported across the United States on Thursday, the second straight day that new cases have topped 60,000.. 
Earlier this week the European Commission stressed the euro-zone economy is still on course for its biggest contraction ever, down 8.7% this year - a forecast predicated on the assumption there wasn’t a second wave of infections causing more lockdowns. 
Oil prices weakened Friday, heading for a weekly decline after the steep losses seen during the previous session, amid worries the nascent economic recovery in the U.S., and elsewhere, is being quashed as Covid-19 infections rise and cities shut back down.
Oil inventories also remain bloated, with the U.S. crude oil stocks rising by nearly 6 million barrels last week.
At 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $39 a barrel, on track for a weekly loss of around 3%. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.3% to $41.81, set to drop around 2%.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,801.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1269, down 0.1%.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s main iPhone chipmaker reported sales of NT$120.88 billion ($4.1 billion) for June on Friday. That likely means TSMC’s revenue grew about 29% to NT$310.7 billion last quarter, based on previously reported figures, beating the NT$308.8 billion analysts expect on average.
TSMC, a barometer for the industry thanks to its heft in the global supply chain, had previously lowered its 2020 revenue outlook to reflect potentially the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression. But it said at the time it still expects robust demand for the semiconductors in datacenters hosting an unprecedented surge in online activity during the pandemic. Executives forecast revenue growth of about 30% in the June quarter while sticking to a goal of $15 billion to $16 billion for capital spending in 2020, up from last year’s $14.9 billion.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Sales of Asian contract chipmakers TSMC, SMIC and others may beat consensus in 2H despite the longer-than-expected Covid-19 pandemic, due to rising semiconductor demand for cloud processing and video conferencing amid social-distancing requirements.
- Charles Shum, analyst
In the longer term, the chipmaker will still have to contend with uncertainty as Covid-19 spreads across the globe, particularly as signs emerge of a second wave. TSMC however is considered relatively more resistant to a downturn thanks to a commanding position in the production of high-end chips needed for everything from datacenters and gaming to video streaming.
It’s also the primary producer of cutting-edge chips for Huawei, but the Trump administration’s ban on the use of American chipmaking gear for the Chinese company threaten a business relationship that accounts for about 14% of TSMC’s revenue."

Investing.com – Asian stock markets were mostly down on Friday, with investor hopes of a quick economic recovery dashed after the U.S. reported a record number of cases.
With states such as Florida, California and Texas reporting record numbers, over 60,000 new cases were reported in the country on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong re-imposed tightened social distancing measures on Thursday to curb a new outbreak of cases in the city. Other cities currently under a second lockdown include Melbourne and Beijing.
“Coronavirus anxiety dominated market sentiment in a day where major economic releases were scarce... That left the focus on the high frequency data and daily COVID-19 news,” Kishti Sen, an economist at ANZ Research, said in a note.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.36% by 11:12 PM ET (4:12 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.66%. Seoul’s mayor Won Soon Park was found dead in a suspected suicide after his daughter reported him missing on Thursday.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  on Thursday said new staffing restrictions imposed on plants producing car parts in the Mexican state of Chihuahua were ""not sustainable,"" the latest sign U.S. automakers are still reeling from coronavirus lockdowns in Mexico.
Mexico is a key part of a wider international supply chain crucial to U.S. carmakers, many of which operate factories across the border in Mexico due to lower labor costs. 
Chihuahua, where the state government has limited employee attendance to 50% in plants, is home to a Ford (N:F) engine plant and many auto parts producers.
U.S. ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau on Thursday said the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker may have to shut some U.S. car plants as early as next week if they fail to receive Mexico-produced engines.
Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford's Americas and International Markets Group, said the company had ""several suppliers"" operating under restrictions imposed by Chihuahua state.
""With our U.S. plants running at 100%, that is not sustainable,"" Galhotra said in an emailed statement. 
""While we do not expect any impact to production next week, we are continuing to work with government officials on ways to safely and constructively resume remaining production,"" he said.
Mexico's federal government has given automakers, mining firms and builders, with activities deemed essential, the green light to restart work, though some states have implemented their own restrictions as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.
Landau said a senior Ford executive told him on Wednesday night about the company's concern over parts produced in Chihuahua state.
""They're saying that they're going to start shutting down factories in the United States as of next week if they don't get that rolling,"" Landau said, in a talk organized by the Atlantic Council.
Alejandra de la Vega, Chihuahua's minister of innovation and economic development, said she was in ""constant contact"" with Ford and spoke with a company executive Thursday morning, but did not specify what was discussed.
De la Vega said Chihuahua had created a traffic light system to allow different sectors to gradually reopen from lockdowns, but added it was a ""balancing act"" to protect both public health and the economy.
In May, when Mexico signaled it would delay the reopening of its factories, Mexican officials said their U.S. counterparts pushed for a speedy return, arguing that U.S. plants on American soil could not operate without them.

The sector has already announced thousands of job losses due the coronavirus pandemic as wary shoppers stay away from the high street, and the next stage of the Brexit process poses a further challenge.
Britain left the EU in January and is currently in a standstill transition period with the bloc to give the two sides time to fix a new relationship in everything from trade to security.
Last week's round of talks was cut short, with both sides saying that, while they wanted an agreement, they had yet to overcome the gulf in positions that could see Britain leaving the transition period without a trade deal.
Four-fifths of UK food imports come from the EU and EU imports also play a major role in supply chains for fashion, homeware, and other retail sectors.
In May, the UK government published its new tariff schedule, which would apply from Jan. 1 2021 if a deal was not agreed.
Under the schedule, 85% of foods imported from the EU will face tariffs of more than 5%, including 48% on beef mince and 16% on cucumbers. The average tariff on food imported from the EU would be over 20%.
Given the highly competitive nature of retail, the industry could not absorb all these increased costs, meaning the public would face higher prices, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
“Many UK shoppers experienced disruption in the run up to (coronavirus) lockdown; without a deal, the public may face an even bigger challenge at the end of the transition period,"" said Andrew Opie, the BRC's director of food and sustainability.
""With the clock ticking down to 31st December, the government must put consumers first and agree a deal that avoids tariffs and minimises the impact of non-tariff barriers.""

UK retailers, already struggling with high rents, business taxes, tight margins and online competition, were particularly hammered by the lockdown and data shows shoppers are reluctant to enter stores even as restrictions ease.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Thursday it has hired Flagstar Bank's Kristy Fercho to run its mortgage division following the retirement of 23-year veteran Michael DeVito from the company.
Fercho will oversee home lending operations of the largest mortgage lender in the United States during a time of uncertainty in the industry. She had run Flagstar's mortgage business for the past three years. 
Wells Fargo has pared back some mortgage offerings and raised requirements for certain kinds of loans during the coronavirus-fueled economic downturn. As of last month, the bank had received forbearance requests for roughly 13% of its mortgage balances, it has said.
Since taking over as chief executive late last year, Charles Scharf has shaken up leadership at the bank and installed a slew of former colleagues in top positions. In the wake of racial tensions across the United States, Scharf has also pledged to diversify the bank's leadership team.
""She has been an inspiring and vocal leader across the mortgage industry while driving transformational growth at Flagstar,” said Mike Weinbach, new CEO of Consumer Lending at Wells Fargo, referring to Fercho, who is Black. 
DeVito, who ran the mortgage division for two years, will retire later this summer. 

Separately, Wells Fargo's former chief operational risk officer, Mark Weintraub, has left the bank following a broad overhaul of its risk management structure, according to sources familiar with the matter. In his role, Weintraub helped oversee the bank's efforts to address the Federal Reserve's consent order requiring Wells Fargo to improve its risk controls following wide ranging consumer abuses.

A proxy solicitor polls large shareholders on how they plan to vote on hotly contested corporate matters like mergers or proxy fights. Hiring one signals that Cannae and Senator are taking next steps to prepare for a potential fight with CoreLogic.
The source said the two firms tapped D.F. King two days after CoreLogic rejected their unsolicited $7 billion takeover bid.
Last month Cannae and Senator, which jointly hold an economic interest of roughly 15% in CoreLogic, proposed to buy the company, valued at $5.3 billion, for $65 a share. The stock has since risen past the offer price and closed at $67.54 on Thursday.
This week, Cannae and Senator said they stillhope to engage with the company but also said they could call a special meeting as soon as July 28 to replace the current board. CoreLogic said it ""is open to all viable paths to increasing shareholder value"" and that it is ""willing to meet with Senator and Cannae."" 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has said that it was sure it could arrange financing for the deal.
D.F. King has worked with Xerox (NYSE:XRX) in a hostile bid for HP (NYSE:HPQ), which was canceled because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mantle Ridge in its investment in Aramark where the investment firm gained control of the board, and the Rice Brothers in their successful proxy contest at natural gas producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday firmly rejected President Donald Trump's arguments for sweeping presidential immunity and ruled that a New York prosecutor can obtain his financial records but prevented - at least for now - Democratic-led House of Representatives committees from getting similar documents.
The twin 7-2 rulings authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts mark another milestone in Trump's tumultuous presidency and in the short term prevent details of his finances from becoming public because lower courts must resolve lingering issues. 
The businessman-turned politician, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has fought tenaciously to keep his tax returns and other elements of his finances secret - and the rulings spare him of any major revelation at a sensitive time. But looking further ahead, Trump faces possible future criminal prosecution in his native New York, perhaps after he leaves office.
The Supreme Court emphasized that there are limits to the powers of the presidency and stoutly reaffirmed the principle that not even the president is above the law - a message delivered 3-1/2 years into a presidency in which Trump has repeatedly skirted the norms of American political conduct. 
Trump's two Supreme Court appointees, conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined Roberts and the four liberal justices in both rulings, spurning Trump's arguments that the Constitution gave him absolute immunity from any criminal proceedings as a sitting president.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, and the three House committees all issued subpoenas to third parties for the records, not to the Republican president himself. Trump sued to block enforcement of the subpoenas. 
The court in the New York case ruled that the subpoena to Trump's long-term accounting firm, Mazars LLP, for tax returns and other financial records to be turned over to a grand jury as part of Vance's criminal investigation can be enforced. 
The justices rebuffed Trump's broad arguments on expansive presidential powers in a showdown with Congress as he tried to block subpoenas by lawmakers to Mazars and two banks -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Capital One - for his financial records. In doing so, the court also faulted the broad arguments made by the House and sent the litigation back to lower courts, delaying the final outcome.
Trump portrayed himself as a victim, calling the subpoenas a ""pure witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"" in comments to reporters. On Twitter, he wrote, ""This is all a political prosecution ... and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!""
Trump's argument that he was immune from any criminal process ""runs up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that Presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process,"" Roberts wrote.
""We affirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need,"" Roberts added.
Roberts rejected the suggestion that the decision would subject future presidents to harassment by local prosecutors, noting that the court in 1997 rejected a similar argument made by President Bill Clinton when he faced a civil lawsuit brought by a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances - litigation the court refused to delay.
The court in 1974, Roberts noted, also ruled that President Richard Nixon must turn over audio tapes in the Watergate scandal that eventually drove him to resign.
'HE IS HIDING'
Unlike other recent presidents, Trump has refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the Trump Organization. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will continue to investigate Trump and seek to enforce the subpoenas.
""Congress's constitutional responsibility to uncover the truth continues, specifically related to the President's Russia connection that he is hiding,"" Pelosi said, referring to the possibility that Trump's financial records could show such an entanglement.
Roberts said lawmakers will need to further explain the need for the records at the lower court, which would then assess the burden placed on the president.
Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal lawyer, said he would ""raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.""
Vance's investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with the president, pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - relationships he has denied.
Trump argued that Congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that such disclosure would compromise his and his family's privacy and distract him from his duties. In the Vance investigation, Trump's lawyers argued before a lower court that law enforcement officials would not have the power to investigate him even if he shot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue.
The House Oversight Committee issued its subpoenas after Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, told Congress Trump had inflated and deflated certain assets on financial statements between 2011 and 2013 in part to reduce his real estate taxes.
The House Financial Services Committee is examining possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether Trump's dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow dropped on Thursday as investors worried about another round of business shutdowns to contain a surge in coronavirus cases and began to shift their focus to earnings, while the Nasdaq hit another record closing high.
The United States saw more than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, setting a single-day global record while Florida and Texas reported a record one-day increase in deaths.
Investors also began to turn their focus to the second-quarter earnings season, which shifts into higher gear next week. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a more than 40% decline in year-over-year earnings, which would be the biggest quarterly profit drop since the 2008 financial crisis, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) shares dropped after it reported a quarterly loss compared with a profit a year earlier, hurt by non-cash impairment charges of $2 billion as COVID-19 disrupted business at its Boots UK division. Its stock closed 7.8% lower.
""We're heading into earnings season, and you're seeing some troubling trends,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
""I expect a lot of confusing numbers and guidance. COVID is certainly not behind us in any way, shape or form, so maybe the V gets elongated some,"" he said.
The Nasdaq registered its fifth record closing high in six days, helped by gains in Amazon.com (O:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Nvidia (O:NVDA), Apple Inc (O:AAPL). Also, Tesla (O:TSLA) extended recent gains, ending up 2.1%.

107,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>","China’s ‘Too Fast, Too Sudden’ Bond Rout at Mercy of Stock Rally","(Bloomberg) -- A brutal selloff that’s made China’s government bonds one of the world’s worst performers is showing no signs of ending any time soon.
That’s because the chances of significant monetary easing from the country’s central bank are becoming even more remote, as the roaring stock market increases government concerns over the risk of an equity bubble. Beijing will want to avoid the kind of debt-fueled stock binge that ended chaotically five years ago, which was partly encouraged by cheap and plentiful money in the financial system.
China’s 10-year government bond yield rose the most since late 2016 on July 6, helping make the notes the world’s third-worst performer the past week. The rout comes at a time when the debt is already under pressure from a surge in issuance and Beijing’s cautious approach to liquidity. Sovereign notes are now the cheapest relative to equities in two years.
“The stock rally and bond tumble exceeded my expectations -- they were too fast, too sudden, and the past week feels like half a year,” said Ji Tianhe, a strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA in Beijing. He forecasts that the 10-year yield will continue climbing and match last year’s high of around 3.4% in coming months. “The central bank will refrain from major easing due to the advance in equities,” he said.
With further issuance on the horizon, the declining trend looks set to continue. The notes should be avoided for now, say analysts from BNP Paribas and ANZ Bank China Co. The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds has jumped more than 20 basis points the past week, the worst five-day performance since December 2016.
Here’s a look at the factors challenging the bond market:
Stock Rally
The tumble in debt mirrors a rally in equities. Stock trading turnover has soared, margin debt has grown at the fastest pace since 2015 and online trading platforms have struggled to keep up. Bullish articles in state-run media spurred the mood.
The advance makes it even harder for the People’s Bank of China to ease -- lower funding costs also make it cheaper for investors to load up on debt and buy stocks. Loose monetary policy was one driver behind the 2015 bubble, the bursting of which wiped out $5 trillion of equity value.
“The rally in equities has disrupted China’s monetary policy. Now Beijing can’t send out a strong easing signal as that will create a stock bubble,” said Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at ANZ. “We won’t likely see any major easing measures over the next month, and that will be bad news for bonds.”
PBOC Caution
The central bank has repeatedly disappointed the market by not loosening its monetary policy aggressively. It has refrained from cutting the amount of cash lenders need to set aside as reserves, despite Beijing signaling last month that such an easing measure could be used. The PBOC in the past two days maintained a neutral position after draining cash from the financial system for eight straight sessions, exacerbating concerns over a liquidity shortage.
Still, analysts see an inflection point when the spike in government yields begin to hurt the economy, which may trigger action from the central bank. Collateral damage from the slumping sovereign-bond market is already roiling the credit market, where companies are shelving plans to sell debt as borrowing costs surge. They canceled about $11 billion worth of deals in June alone, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“The 10-year yield will fluctuate above 3% for a while,” said Chen Qi, chief strategist at private fund management company Shanghai Silver Leaf Investment Co. She added that while the PBOC will maintain an easing bias, the era of very loose monetary policy has passed.
Spike in Issuance
By the end of July, the central government intends to sell 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion) of so-called special notes, with the proceeds put toward fighting the virus outbreak. Banks will have the incentive to preserve cash to buy these higher-yielding securities, meaning China’s sovereign notes will suffer from the issuance increase. More debt is expected to hit the market in August and September, as regional authorities unleash their own launches delayed by the special bonds, meaning pressure on sovereign notes should persist throughout the third quarter.

108,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 04:34PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 10,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  The market keeps showing a whole heaping lot of love for tech, with the Nasdaq hitting a record for a second day running.
The Dow Jones, on the other hand, fell 1.4%, dragged down by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW).
Coronavirus infections and deaths keep coming, with top U.S. pandemics expert Anthony Fauci, speaking on a podcast hosted by The Wall Street Journal, saying that new Covid-19 cases were seeing “exponential growth.” 
“It went from an average of about 20,000 to 40,000 and 50,000. That’s doubling. If you continue doubling, two times 50 is 100,” Fauci said. “Any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down. It’s not for me to say because each state is different.”
Data shows that more than 3 million Americans have already been infected by Covid-19, with a death toll exceeding 133,000. On Wednesday, the United States reported a daily record of more than 60,000 cases. 
Walgreens and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) dropped as retailers suffered from a weak quarter. Banks are up next week.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Biden bashes Wall Street
Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden ripped rival Donald Trump and Wall Street as he started rolling out his economic plans, if elected. The federal government would spend $400 billion on manufacturing and $300 billion on research and development under an economic plan, the former Vice President said, according to USA Today. 
“It’s time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes,” Biden said. “The days of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) paying nothing in federal income tax will be over.”
Biden has an “incredibly stable and unusually large” lead over Trump, according to the polling website FiveThirtyEight. Of course, the media also thought Hillary Clinton was bound to win four years ago. 
2. Oil finally slides
Eyes are on oil after prices slumped as much as 3% on Thursday, the most in over two weeks, finally seeming to acknowledge that the nascent economic recovery in the U.S. is being quashed as infections rise and cities shut back down. 
“The virus spread is not plateauing as many populous states (Texas and Florida) are still seeing significant increases in hospitalizations,” said Ed Moya, senior market strategist at New York-based OANDA said in a note on oil.   
U.S. gasoline demand was falling in areas where lockdowns were being reinstated, Lachlan Shaw, head of commodity research at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), was quoted saying by Reuters, although demand for fuels continued to recover in the economically-crucial East Coast. 
3. Banks Ahead!
Banks were in the red Thursday ahead of earnings reports that kick off next week. The S&P 500 Financials was down 1% as parts of the U.S. close back down amid growing coronavirus infections across the country.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) dropped 2.8% and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell 2.1%
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell 1.4% after DA Davidson downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. DA Davidson upgraded JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., but shares nonetheless fell 2.2%. 
Investors will be watching bank earnings for signs that the business shutdowns and massive job losses because of Covid-19 have begun to erode credit quality, which could leave banks holding a rising number of bad loans.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 04:26PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to weigh FTC authority to seek ill-gotten gains,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Thursday to decide whether the Federal Trade Commission can continue to require scam artists and firms that engaged in deceptive business practices to return money improperly obtained from consumers.
The justices will hear the FTC's appeal of a lower court's 2019 ruling that the agency could demand that alleged scam artists stop their behavior using a preliminary injunction but could not clawback any ill-gotten gains in a case involving a company called Credit Bureau Center LLC. 
The court also took up a companion case involving a company called AMG Capital Management that appealed a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed the FTC's authority to recoup ill-gotten gains.
In appealing a ruling by the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the Credit Bureau Center case, the FTC in court papers described the challenge to its practice of demanding return of ill-gotten gains as potentially ""eliminating one of its most important and effective enforcement tools.""
In the case at issue, consumers responded to ads for apartments on the advertising website Craigslist, only to find the homes did not exist or were not for rent. But in the process they were required to click a link for a free credit score from company, which also used the names MyScore and eFreeScore. This turned out to be a credit monitoring service costing $29.94 per month.
A federal judge ordered the credit monitoring website owner to pay $5.2 million in restitution.
The Supreme Court's consideration of the legal disputes comes at a time when the United States is awash in scams, with some taking advantage of fears about the spread of the coronavirus to bilk unsuspecting consumers. Robocalls inundate landlines touting phony medical devices and other deceptive offers. Since they often originate overseas, U.S. law enforcement has difficulty in combating the scam artists.

The cases will be heard together in the court's next term, which starts in October.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",Top U.S. market's audit watchdog gives gloomy forecast for quality bookkeeping at U.S.-listed Chinese firms,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An official with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) accounting oversight arm on Thursday said it sees ""no prospects"" of being able to properly do its job overseeing disclosures and preventing accounting fraud in China, amid ongoing consideration by the Trump administration of how to stave off the possible investor risk.
The comments by William Duhnke, chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), comes as the latest in a series of statements in response to pressure from the White House and lawmakers to reduce the perceived risks Chinese companies pose to U.S. investors. 
""I have been actively engaged with the (Big Four accounting firms) about how, in the absence of access, do we make sure staff can ensure audit quality of U.S.-listed Chinese companies,"" said Duhnke, who sat on a virtual SEC panel on the topic with other U.S. regulatory authorities.
""We must trust and verify, but we have no ability to verify in China, and no prospects to do so on the horizon.""
The SEC has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, and its accounting arm is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.
The PCAOB, which was set up by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is overseen by the SEC, is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation’s listed companies. Its problems with Chinese audit quality have been festering since 2011, when scores of Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges were accused of accounting irregularities.
Chinese authorities have long resisted audit papers leaving China, making it hard for U.S. regulators to check the quality of audits of Chinese companies.
But a bill passed by the U.S. Senate which, if signed by President Donald Trump, would require U.S.-listed foreign companies to disclose levels of government control. It would also require that Chinese companies comply with U.S. oversight of their audits or potentially face being delisted.
Chinese firms accounted for about a third, or some $279 billion, of funds raised globally via IPOs in the past five years. About half of that was offshore of China, mostly through New York and Hong Kong floats.[nL4N2DL03X]

Amy McGarrity, the chief investment officer at the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado said that investors should have access to ""ample"" disclosures, but was worried restricting listing of Chinese companies could harm U.S. capital markets and force investors to private markets.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday refused to grant immediate bail to a Massachusetts father and son who are trying to avoid extradition to Japan, after being accused of helping smuggle former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn out of that country.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston said Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor, who have been detained since their May 20 arrests, have yet to show they deserve freedom, in part because a magistrate judge also weighing bail has yet to rule.
The Taylors said bail was warranted because they might contract COVID-19 at the suburban Norfolk County Correctional Center, where 36 inmates and staff have tested positive. Michael Taylor, a Special Forces veteran, is missing part of one lung.
Talwani also said the Taylors have not shown it likely there was no probable cause to detain them, after they argued that the offenses described in Japan's extradition requests would not support their extradition.
""Petitioners have not demonstrated here the high probability of success necessary to establish special circumstances justifying release on bail in an extradition case while these legal issues are being resolved,"" Talwani wrote.
Lawyers for the Taylors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ghosn escaped in late December to his childhood home of Beirut via Istanbul from Japan, where he had been under house arrest on financial crimes charges. He was transported in a large black box to an awaiting private jet.
Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan.
At a Wednesday hearing, federal prosecutor Stephen Hassink called the Taylors an ""extraordinary flight risk.""
Lawyers for the Taylors disagree, and have said their clients will abide by all reasonable bail conditions.

On Tuesday, the magistrate judge, Donald Cabell, refused to quash the Taylors' arrest warrants. He has yet to explain why. Another hearing before Talwani is scheduled for July 28.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at a record high for the second straight day Thursday as investors continued to seek refuge in megacap tech stocks at a time when the spread of the coronavirus threatens a V shape recovery.

As the outbreak continues to hit key hotspots including Texas, Florida and California, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said states should opt to pause reopening measures rather than revert to a complete shut down.
""Rather than think in terms of reverting back down to a complete shutdown, I would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process,"" Fauci said.
But that did little quash investor jitters of looming shutdowns that threatened to undo the economic progress seen recently.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by about 100,000 to 1.31 million in the week ended July 3, beating forecasts for a decline to 1.3 million.
Continuing claims fell 698,000 to 18.06 million, extending a trend of downside momentum that is ""encouraging,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""Continuing claims are down 2.5 million over the past 4 weeks.""
Energy led the selloff, paced by a decline oil prices as the pause of reopening measures in pockets of the U.S. offset signs of a recovery in gasoline demand seen a day earlier.

(Reuters) - Electric vehicle maker Fisker Inc is in talks to go public through a sale to a so-called blank-check acquisition company, modeled after a successful deal earlier this year by peer  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Nikola shares are up more than 60% since it went public last month through such a deal, as investors place bets on which startup will be the next Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). Earlier this month, autonomous vehicle technology company Velodyne Lidar agreed to be bought by blank-check company  Graf Industrial Corp  (N:GRAF) for $1.6 billion, fuelling a rally in the latter's shares.
 Spartan Energy Acquisition  Corp (N:SPAQ_u), which is backed by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO), is leading a bidding war among blank-check companies for Fisker, and could clinch a deal for close to $2 billion as early as next week, the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity as the deal talks are confidential. Fisker and Spartan declined to comment.
Spartan's shares rallied on the news and were up 35% at $15.25 in early afternoon trading in New York on Thursday. 
Henrik Fisker, a one-time Aston-Martin designer, launched the eponymous Los Angeles-based company in 2016, and plans to begin selling the Fisker Ocean luxury electric SUV in 2022 at a starting price of $37,500.
His previous automotive venture, Fisker Automotive, filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after burning through $1.4 billion in private investments and taxpayer-funded loans. Once billed as a rival to Tesla, it ended up making fewer than 2,000 cars. 
Fisker Automotive was bought out of bankruptcy in 2014 by a Chinese auto parts maker and renamed Karma Automotive. 
Spartan raised $552 million in a initial public offering in 2018, saying it would focus on an acquisition in the North American energy industry. It would use these funds and borrowed money to fund the deal with Fisker.

Tesla's shares have risen 500% over the past year, as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV, pushing the company's market capitalization past Toyota Motors Corp (T:7203) as the world's most valuable automaker.

118,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",Wall Street Is Loving That a Bank-Bailout Critic Tapped PPP Loan,"(Bloomberg) -- The Washington advocacy group Better Markets has spent a decade fighting big banks and railing against the government’s 2008 financial industry bailout. Now it has taken one of its own.
The organization received between $150,000 and $350,000 in loans from a key U.S. coronavirus relief program, according to data released by the Small Business Administration earlier this week. While that pales in comparison to the $700 billion taxpayer rescue banks got at the height of the credit crunch, Better Markets’ adversaries haven’t been able to hide their amusement.
“Apparently Better Markets didn’t enter this crisis as well capitalized as our nation’s largest banks,” quipped Bank Policy Institute President Greg Baer.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and other members of Baer’s trade association have long been castigated by Better Markets.
The circumstances of Better Markets’ loan are dramatically different than what prompted the lifeline for banks. Wall Street played a starring role in causing the 2008 meltdown by packaging subprime mortgages into securities that triggered staggering losses, prompting Congress to approve the bailout to head off a collapse of the global financial system.
Better Markets -- like millions of other loan recipients -- was the victim of a health crisis and used its funds to save more than a dozen jobs, according to Dennis Kelleher, the group’s president. In an interview, he said it’s “ironic” that Wall Street would be “chuckling about a small nonprofit” getting aid, considering that financial firms have benefited significantly from Federal Reserve actions that have kept markets functioning during the pandemic.
“These guys are getting everything they want from the Trump administration and their regulators,” Kelleher said. “Yet they get angered by the mere slightest opposition.”
Bank lobbyists and others who have clashed with Better Markets have expressed their glee in emails fired off to each other -– and the press -- that note the loan won’t even be big enough to cover Kelleher’s annual compensation, which is roughly $400,000, according to public filings. Also making the rounds is a recent interview Kelleher gave in which he stressed that the government Paycheck Protection Program loans should be given to “Main Street small businesses in need.”
Bankers say that hardly describes Better Markets, which is located on Washington’s K Street lobbying corridor. It was co-founded and funded by Atlanta hedge fund manager Michael Masters, who is chairman of the nonprofit’s board.
A number of think tanks, lobbying groups and nonprofits tapped the aid program, a list that includes Americans for Tax Reform Foundation and Citizens Against Government Waste. As of Wednesday night, almost 4.9 million loans had been approved totaling $521.1 billion, according to the SBA.
Since its founding in 2010, Better Markets has become Wall Street’s leading antagonist in the regulatory arena, where deep-pocketed banks with legions of lobbyists have few opponents equipped to argue esoteric policy points. Small tweaks in rules can often provide profit windfalls, and financial firms routinely use the complexity to their advantage.
Kelleher also has a knack for getting under bankers’ skins, peppering his public comments with phrases like “too-big-to-jail banks” and “financial industry predators.”
The forgivable SBA loan, Kelleher said, helped keep Better Markets’ 15 workers employed. Before the PPP program was announced, he was drawing up plans for layoffs because the group’s fundraising had completely dried up. Virtually all of it is done in person, which has been impossible since the coronavirus hit, Kelleher said.
“Our entire annual budget is less than the pay raise that Goldman’s CEO got this year,” he said.

Investing.com – Wall Street moved pared some losses on Thursday, as tech rebounded from intraday lows though weakness in stocks tied to the progress of the economy kept the broader market in the red. 
The S&P 500 lost 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.44% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.27%.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by about 100,000 to 1.31 million in the week ended July 3, beating forecasts for a decline to 1.3 million.
Continuing claims fell 698,000 to 18.06 million, extending a trend of downside momentum that is ""encouraging,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""Continuing claims are down 2.5 million over the past 4 weeks.""
Despite the backdrop of resilience seen in the labor market, investors have cooled expectations for a V-shape economic recovery, as several states have paused, or rolled back reopening measures to contain a surge in cases in Covid-19 hotspots including Texas, California, and Florida.
Stocks tied to the progress of the reopening, and ultimately the economy, continue to come under pressure.  
Airlines and cruise stocks retreated, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Carnival (NYSE:CCL), both down more than 4%, among the notable decliners.
In tech, the so-called Fab 5, continued to hold onto slender gains. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), all which collectively make up about 40% of the Nasdaq, traded above the flatline.
Financials were not far behind, falling 2% just days ahead of quarterly results from banks. The second-quarter earnings reports for a slew of Wall Street banks are likely to underscore a rough quarter amid rising loan loss provisions and weaker profit from lending activity weighed down by near-zero interest rates.
Elsewhere, AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) rallied as rumors swirled the company had hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to explore a sale."
121,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Ousted U.S. prosecutor says Barr urged him to resign-testimony,"By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Geoffrey Berman, the former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan who was ousted last month, told lawmakers on Thursday that U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr strongly pressed him to resign, according to a copy of his written congressional testimony. 
Berman, who departed as his office continued a probe into President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani, was warned by Barr that if he did not leave and was fired, it would ""not be good for my resume or future job prospects,"" Berman said.
Berman said Barr also repeatedly urged him to take another job, either in the Justice Department running its civil division or possibly as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Berman said Barr told him he wanted to appoint current SEC chairman Jay Clayton to replace Berman as Manhattan-based U.S. attorney.
Berman said he told Barr he regarded Clayton as an ""unqualified choice"" for the prosecutor job because he had never served as a federal prosecutor and ""had no criminal experience.""
Berman said he initially issued a news release saying he had ""no intention of resigning and that I intended to ensure that our Office's important cases continue unimpeached.""
However, he ultimately agreed to leave. 
Berman was scheduled to meet behind closed doors on Thursday with the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee following his June 20 firing.
Barr is scheduled to appear before the panel on July 28. 
Democrats have accused Barr of improperly meddling in a number of criminal and antitrust investigations to protect Trump and his allies. Barr has defended his actions. 
Last month, career prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told lawmakers on the panel that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia faced political pressure to scale back its sentencing recommendation for Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone.

Court papers filed in Stone's case indicate that the Justice Department said Stone should report to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, next Tuesday. That could pave the way for a possible presidential pardon or sentence commutation after Stone was found guilty of obstruction as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>","U.S. Supreme Court to weigh shareholder suit over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac","By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear an appeal by President Donald Trump's administration seeking to avoid a lawsuit by shareholders of mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) relating to the government rescue of the companies following the 2008 housing crisis.
The justices will review a 2019 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders in the two companies could pursue a challenge to the 2012 agreement between the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Treasury Department. The deal eliminated dividend payouts to various shareholders and required the companies to pay the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to their quarterly net worth each quarter.
The court also took up a related appeal brought by the shareholders that challenges the constitutional structure of the agency. 
The Supreme Court in a similar case concerning the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ruled on June 29 that such a structure is unconstitutional, deciding that the president should be able to fire the director at any time.
The cases will be heard together in the court's next term, which starts in October.
In 2016, Fannie and Freddie shareholders Patrick Collins, Marcus Liotta and William Hitchcock sued in a federal court in Texas saying that the 2012 agreement, sometimes referred to as the ""net worth sweep,"" exceeded FHFA's authority and that the structure of the agency was unconstitutional.
The government in 2008 seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both private enterprises set up by Congress, at the height of the financial crisis as they teetered on the brink of insolvency. The government took a majority stake in each and they were placed under the supervision of the FHFA, which was created at the same time.

The FHFA is headed by a director who is appointed to a five-year term by the president subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

The $6.8 billion ProShares UltraPro QQQ, which seeks investment results that correspond to three times the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, has already lost almost $500 million in the span, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts the exchange-traded fund on pace for its largest weekly withdrawals since TQQQ started trading in February 2010.
The megacap tech trade has ruled stocks for months, with investors piling into companies with rock-solid balance sheets and that benefit from the stay-at-home economy. The Nasdaq 100, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is headed for an annual gain that ranks with its best of the last two decades, raising some concern whether the big-tech rally can continue.
“The outflows here look like classic profit-taking from an ETF that has been in money printing machine mode for about three months straight,” said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “These traders know not to push their luck, which is the key to not losing your shirt with exotic ETFs.”
The outflows may not persist, though. With more states slowing or reversing reopening measures, demand for the companies that can withstand another economic setback has been rising again. As of Thursday afternoon, the Nasdaq 100 was outperforming the other major equity benchmarks.

Rome has been threatening to revoke the business licence of Atlantia's motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia following the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge in Genoa that was run by the motorway operator.
Speaking after a Rome meeting between senior government officials and Autostrade chiefs, the source, asking not to be named, said the government had asked the company for better offers over tariffs, compensation and penalties for maintenance failings.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia earlier this week denied an emergency request to reconsider its decision, which came after the court found fault with an environmental permit for the 570,000 barrel-per-day Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL).
Dakota Access, controlled by  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP, asked the court in a filing late on Wednesday to decide on its request by July 14 so it could appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court for D.C. if denied. The lower court is holding a hearing on Thursday to discuss the schedule.
DAPL was ordered to shut and be emptied by Aug. 5 while an environmental review of the line was being completed. A portion of the pipeline runs under South Dakota's Lake Oahe, a drinking water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which long opposed the pipeline.
Dakota Access said shutting the line would cost companies and state economies billions of dollars and result in the loss of thousands of jobs.
Energy Transfer and Dakota Access say they would lose $2.8 million to $3.5 million each day the line is idled in 2020 and as much as $1.4 billion for the whole of next year. 
Purging the line, which runs 1,172 miles from the Bakken shale region in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, would take about three months and cost roughly $27 million, it said.

The company told Reuters on Wednesday it had not yet taken measures to empty the line.

Investing.com --  Mohawk Industries  Inc (NYSE:MHK). fell 25%, and is down 30% since July 1, when Robbins LLP said it was investigating the company for fabricating revenue.
The flooring company misled investors by saying it was seeing growing demand that never materialized, according to the shareholder rights law firm, alleging Mohawk may have violated the Securities Exchange Act and executives may have breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders.
Robbins said that starting in 2017, Mohawk started highlighting sales growth. Last July, “after repeatedly reporting financial results that missed analysts' estimates and the company's guidance range, Mohawk revealed sales in its Flooring NA segment were down 7% because ""lower demand"" for certain conventional flooring products had created excess inventory that impacted Mohawk's sales and margins,” Robbins wrote in a statement.
“It appears that Mohawk had been channel stuffing by causing its distributors to take on surpluses of Conventional Flooring Products that were greater than demand to make Mohawk's sales growth and financial performance appear better than they were,” Robbins wrote.
According to The Motley Fool, the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a lawsuit claiming accounting fraud at Mohawk in January, which includes testimony from a former Mohawk employee who claims the company has used fictitious sales to artificially boost revenue since 2017.
Sales for the first quarter fell 6% compared to a year earlier, with revenue down in all three of its main segments.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is cautious about adding more flights to its schedule due to spikes in coronavirus cases through the southeast and southwest of the United States, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in an employee memo on Thursday.
United Airlines (O:UAL) flagged this week a hit on bookings from new outbreaks and quarantine restrictions and said it was sending notifications of potential furloughs to about 45% of its frontline employees.
U.S. airline shares (DJUSAR).lost 5% in morning trade, with Delta down 5.8%.
""The continued growth of the virus through the Sun Belt, coupled with quarantine restrictions being implemented in large markets in the northern part of the country, give us renewed caution about further schedule additions at this time,"" Bastian said.
His comments raised questions as to whether Delta may pull back some of its summer flying. It has added 1,000 flights in July and another 1,000 this August, but had already said it was unlikely to add many more for the rest of the year.
Its July schedule is still only about 30% of what it would normally fly.
Atlanta-based Delta is among U.S. carriers that have boosted liquidity and cut costs to stem a daily cash burn, but they need revenue to recover and will need to shrink in size as they wait for demand to return.
Bastian again warned the recovery ""is likely to be lengthy and slow"" and encouraged employees to sign up for early exit packages by a July 13 deadline to minimize involuntary furloughs in the fall.

Delta is due to report second-quarter results on July 14.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's high street faces more than 5,000 job cuts after two of its biggest names said that customers were unlikely to return to their old shopping habits after the coronavirus crisis, in the latest blow to the country's ailing economy.
Health and beauty chain Boots and department store John Lewis on Thursday joined other retailers in warning that they had to close stores to survive after customers moved online and remained wary of returning to town centres.
Boots, owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA), announced 4,000 cuts in a blow to British finance minister Rishi Sunak, who announced his latest plan to save jobs on Wednesday, while John Lewis said it could lose 1,300. 
Thousands of job losses have already been announced by the menswear shop TM Lewin, department stores Harrods and Debenhams, fashion stores Oasis, Warehouse, and Arcadia, and the DIY outfit  Travis Perkins  (L:TPK) since the coronavirus outbreak.
John Lewis, known as middle England's favourite department store, said it proposed to close eight stores as online would make up to 70% of sales this year and next, from 40% pre-crisis.
""We believe closures are necessary to help us secure the sustainability of the Partnership,"" said Sharon White, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership. 
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government stood ready to help after Boots also said it had decided to close 48 optician stores after its UK shopper numbers plunged 85% in April at the height of the lockdown. 
The world's sixth-biggest economy shrank by 25% in March and April and could be heading for its biggest fall in 300 years in 2020, with an unemployment rate on course to more than double to about 10%, according to official projections.
That fear of what could lie ahead has put an intolerable strain on retailers, already battling high rents, business rate taxes, tight margins and a rapid shift online. 
Since the outbreak, many have failed to pay their rent, in turn hitting commercial property owners such as Intu which has called in administrators due to high debts. 
Julie Palmer, partner and restructuring expert at Begbies Traynor, said many businesses would implement drastic change. 

""Investment will be poured into parts of the business that are strengthening and pulled from areas that are unsuitable for these modern ways of trading,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has made it even harder for senior-care centers in the United States to find or afford standard liability insurance, with rates soaring by as much as 300%, insurance brokers said.
Residential care communities like nursing homes and assisted-living facilities had already faced escalating prices and a dearth of insurance providers for years. Outbreaks of the novel coronavirus and a related respiratory disease called COVID-19 in such centers only exacerbated the problem. 
""It was already on an upward trajectory but COVID accelerated it,"" Deepa Desai, who heads insurance broker Aon Plc's (N:AON) healthcare practice, said about rates.
Senior care facilities need general and professional liability insurance, which protect against everything from slip-and-fall incidents to staff-member mistakes that harm patients.
Senior-care providers with expiring policies have struggled to find insurers that will offer coverage in recent months, as some imposed moratoriums on new business deals and others jacked up prices to unaffordable levels, brokers said. 
For instance, insurance company Chubb Ltd (BN:CB) imposed a moratorium on new senior-community clients in March, two sources familiar with the matter said. Chubb recently ended the moratorium but is being highly selective about terms and clients it accepts, they said. A Chubb spokesman declined to comment.
Senior-care communities who can renew policies are paying far more for less coverage, industry sources said. Some insurers are adding exclusions not just for the novel coronavirus, but for communicable diseases at large. Exclusions for costs related to class-action lawsuits are also cropping up.
On June 19, families of three patients who died from COVID-19 at Summit Manor sued the Columbia, Kentucky-based nursing home, saying it failed to protect residents. A spokeswoman for Signature HealthCare, which owns the facility, declined comment.
To mitigate those risks, insurers are requiring customers to answer ""COVID-19 questionnaires"" that ask about previous outbreaks, visitation procedures and preparations for a second wave, said Joanne Wankmiller, national senior care practice leader for Marsh, insurance brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (N:MMC).
Church Mutual Insurance Co's five-page questionnaire asks about personal protective gear supplies.
""We have concerns about new shortages being able to emerge again,"" said Jim Ketterson, the company's senior living director.
It is not yet clear how higher insurance rates are impacting the U.S. senior care industry, but pandemic-related expenses have already pushed some entities into the red.
Hallworth House, a Providence, Rhode Island-based nursing home, said last month that it would close in August after losing more than $1.3 million during the past two years. The pandemic sickened more than half of its 51 residents and 20 staff members in recent months, and 12 residents died.
The industry is also experiencing lower revenue, as the pandemic keeps prospective customers away.
Nursing home occupancy fell nearly 6 percentage points to 79% in April from 85% in February, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care. That is partly because of state and local lockdowns and fewer referrals for care by some insurance plans due to federal restrictions.
The senior-care industry is lobbying for broad federal immunity from lawsuits and also pinning its hopes on efforts in at least 21 states to grant various forms of immunity, including to nursing homes and health care providers.
In the meantime, some senior care companies are thinking about creating insurance cooperatives to offset surging rates, said Barbara Duffy, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises senior communities on insurance.

""These staggering bills could bring the profession to a breaking point,"" Duffy said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), the largest airline group in Latin America, said Thursday it had secured an additional $1.3 billion for its financing proposal before a New York bankruptcy court, while adding its unit in Brazil to the debt restructuring process.
LATAM (SN:LTM) filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in May, aiming to reorder $18 billion in debt. It was the world's largest airline to date to seek an emergency reorganization due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
On Thursday, it said it had secured an additional $1.3 billion in funding from Oaktree Capital Management L.P. and its affiliates, enough to meet the company´s financing requirements amid the crisis. The company had already secured $900 million for the process from shareholders Cueto Group and Qatar Airways. ""Combined ... it is hoped that financial support will not be required from governments,"" the company said in a statement early on Thursday.
The company said the proposal still required approval from the U.S. court. LATAM also announced it would add its unit in Brazil to the bankruptcy protection process in the United States, calling the move a ""natural step in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic."" 
The airline's affiliates in Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and the United States joined the Chapter 11 process following the company´s initial bankruptcy announcement May. ""LATAM Airlines Brazil will continue to operate passenger and cargo flights normally, as LATAM Airlines group and its affiliates have done since they entered Chapter 11,"" the statement said.
Three of Latin America's largest airlines - LATAM,  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) - are now in Chapter 11, as governments have avoided potential bailout packages. 
Analysts expect a changed post-crisis landscape in the region with fewer competitors and higher ticket prices.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday on the back of the latest weekly jobless claims data which showed another clear but only incremental improvement in the labor market. 
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 126 points, or less than 0.5%, at 25,941 points. The S&P 500 was up down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite, which hit another record high on Wednesday, added another 0.5%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial and continuing clalims both ground lower according to its latest data, while the previous week's numbers were also revised down. Initial claims at 1.314 million were below analysts' expectations - a rare positive surprise from an indicator that has overshot in most weeks since the pandemic erupted - while continuing claims fell nearly 700,000 to 18.06 million. That appears to reflect an increased pace of hiring.
The data weren't enough to shake off concern about the increasing momentum of the Covid-19 pandemic, in which the U.S. recorded a new daily record of 62,000 new infections on Wednesday. Deaths also rose to over 900, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
There were also further indications that the upcoming second-quarter earnings season is going to be a tough one for U.S. stocks. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) stock fell 7.0% after the pharmacy chain wrote down its U.K. assets by $2 billion and announced over 4,000 job cuts at its Boots operations. while Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock fell 19.3% after saying it will close 200 locations in a quarterly update that also disappointed on top and bottom lines. Sales fell by 49% from a year earlier while the company's net loss only narrowed by 16%.
The pressure on United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock also continued in the wake of United's announcement that it may furlough some 45% of its workforce by October due to the drop in demand for air travel. United stock fell 3.9% while Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 1.8%.
Various tech stocks continued to outperform, however, sauced by activity in the options market. Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) rose 12.8% to a two-month high after busy trade in August 2020 calls at $20 on Wednesday, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which briefly rallied above $1,400 earlier this week as options traders covered short call positions, rose 1.4%.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) issued a note this week with a fair value of $780 for the stock, arguing that it was being sustained by ""the power of hope"" rather than fundamentals."

The San Francisco-based firm, which has around $150 million across its absolute return fund and solutions business, was one of a handful of players to take advantage of volatility in corporate dividends sparked by the Covid-19 crisis.
The trade added 15% to quarterly performance, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg News. Positions in S&P 500 Index skew, or differences in implied volatility among options contracts, also contributed to gains.
“The regime shift in volatility of volatility (higher) and trading liquidity (lower) makes this a good environment for our strategies,” according to the letter. “Ultimately it is the activity of the end users of derivatives, and the corresponding price impact and dislocations, that creates the opportunity set.”
The firm aims to launch a commingled fund in the fourth quarter, the letter stated. A representative of QVR declined to comment.
As firms slashed dividends earlier this year in response to the mounting health crisis, banks including BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and Natixis SA dumped futures contracts, providing buying opportunities for hedge funds. Others that profited from the trade include Ovata Capital Management, Oasis Management Co., York Capital Management and AM Squared Ltd.

TOULOUSE, Reuters (Reuters) - The French government backed union calls to avoid compulsory job cuts at Airbus on Thursday as several hundred workers marched from the company's headquarters to Toulouse-Blagnac airport.
Airbus (PA:AIR) plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs because of a drop in demand due to coronavirus crisis, which has sharply lowered air travel and damaged airline finances.
French Junior Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher urged Airbus to avoid compulsory redundancies, echoing a demand from unions in France and Germany where it has its biggest plants.
""There should be no forced departures, which means everyone should be able to choose and be helped; that is our line,"" she told Radio Classique.
The number of workers demonstrating in Toulouse, where Airbus is a major employer, was far lower than the thousands who marched alongside a runway and held a brief strike on Tuesday, witnesses told Reuters.
Aerospace is responsible for 40% of industrial employment in the Occitanie region, with 110,000 people across 1,100 large and small suppliers. Airbus itself employs 27,000 people there.
Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon told demonstrators that France must keep its aerospace expertise, but acknowledged that the rising demand which had powered Airbus production to record levels in recent years would not come back any time soon.

""We have to say frankly air traffic won't double,"" he said, referring to a trend that Airbus forecasters have repeatedly predicted happening every 15 years. He added the industry's salvation lay in designing a new generation of greener planes.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",A space odyssey: Britain rockets into unknown with OneWeb,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Britain is betting that satellite operator OneWeb will help it boldly go into a post-Brexit era. But it faces formidable challenges to complete a working constellation and rebuild a collapsed venture that has proved a money pit for investors.
The British government and Indian telecoms conglomerate Bharti Enterprises said last week they would together put up $1 billion to buy OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy after its biggest backer, SoftBank Group, declined to provide fresh funding.
The deal offers a new lease of life for the venture, which was founded by U.S. entrepreneur Greg Wyler with the vision of providing ""internet everywhere for everyone"" via 648 low Earth orbit satellites. 
OneWeb, which began as WorldVu in 2012, has 74 satellites already in orbit, as it ramped up launches immediately before collapsing in late March.
Britain is looking at adding positioning technology to new satellites to complement and add resilience to the American GPS system, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, after the country exited the EU's Galileo network as a result of Brexit. 
That secondary payload could be built in Britain, the sources said. The idea of providing internet services for remote regions is also attractive to the government. 
Additional investment, potentially running to more than $1 billion - on top of the $1 billion British/Bharti commitment - would be needed to complete a constellation that can offer continuous service worldwide, the sources said.
The satellites, which have a lifespan of about five years and are assembled in a highly automated factory run with Airbus, cost in the region of $1 million each, the sources said. 
The rocket launches have run to around $70 million apiece, the sources said, carrying 34 satellites into orbit each time.
With a smaller number of launches pushing the number of satellites towards 200, OneWeb could begin providing coverage at the poles, with the military and oil and gas industry seen as potential customers in the Arctic, according to the sources. 
The British government declined to comment beyond its July 3 statement https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-to-acquire-cutting-edge-satellite-network announcing the deal. Bharti also declined to comment beyond its statement https://www.bharti.com/press-release-2020-2021-uk-government-consortium-led-by-bharti-wins-bid-for-oneweb.html then.
OneWeb declined to comment.
""Getting the future commercialization right for OneWeb will be absolutely key,"" said Campbell Macfarlane, former president of OneWeb's enterprise division who left following the bankruptcy. He said it could prove ""a very shrewd investment for the UK government"". 
OneWeb has secured radio spectrum and regulatory approvals needed to operate its satellites and ground infrastructure and offer services around the world, documents filed with a bankruptcy court in New York show. 
""This is the best beachfront property there ever was in space,"" one of the sources said of the spectrum. 
""OneWeb's birthing is going to be enormously painful, but in the long run it can be very valuable."" 
GRAND VISION
Providing universal internet service via satellite has been a dream of numerous tech tycoons and companies over the years, including a failed Bill Gates-backed venture called Teledesic in the 1990s.
Wyler originally brought his idea for what would become OneWeb to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2013. Only a year later, he left Google to team up with Elon Musk's SpaceX. 
That partnership ended too and OneWeb went it alone.
Musk and SpaceX are now building a rival constellation, Starlink, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is also developing a space internet business - Project Kuiper. 
OneWeb's parade of influential backers included Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Airbus, Virgin Group and eventually Japanese investor SoftBank, which pumped roughly $2 billion into the effort.
Wyler formed a tight bond with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who feted him on-stage in Tokyo in 2017 as part of his broader vision, with OneWeb aligning with SoftBank's corporate philosophy of ""information revolution - happiness for everyone"". 
However the economics of universal internet service were daunting: it would be hard to charge consumers enough to defray the cost of launching and operating the satellites. 
OneWeb was forced to step back from this grand idea and instead focus on a commercial customer base for such services, like airlines and cruise lines, willing to pay a premium.
The venture was hampered by costly contracts involving its own investors, four sources said. 
In 2015 it signed a long launch contract with Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF), locking in prices even as SpaceX was shaking up market pricing in the industry. 
Arianespace declined to comment. Airbus did not respond to requests for comment. 
Wyler himself was sidelined from day-to-day management as business pressures mounted, and the company cycled through three CEOs.
Wyler did not respond to a request for comment.
SoftBank was facing its own hard reckoning: a disastrous investment in office-sharing startup WeWork was cooling investor attitudes to money-losing ventures. 
The coronavirus outbreak further undermined the business model of many of its biggest investments and hammered OneWeb's biggest potential customers. 
With SoftBank's share price tumbling, the conglomerate pulled out of funding talks, collapsing the venture.
SoftBank declined to comment.
HOLLOWED OUT 
The acquisition of OneWeb, which is British and U.S.-based, is subject to approval from regulators including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). 
Its new owners will need to rebuild the company's workforce after 90% of its staff were let go following the Chapter 11 filing. 
Former OneWeb engineers that helped build and run the system have been hired by rival companies as competition for talent in the space industry heats up. A commercial team - vital if the company is to effectively sell its capacity and achieve profitability - will also need to be reconstituted. 
It was unclear if Chief Executive Adrian Steckel, who the bankruptcy filings show was paid a $2.25 million retention payment on March 25, two days before OneWeb filed for Chapter 11, and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Whayne, who was paid $1 million on the same day, will continue to run the company after a takeover. 

Steckel and Whayne did not respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading and underwriting revenue could provide some comfort for big Wall Street banks that begin reporting results next week, although second-quarter profits likely plunged because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on lending.
Analysts expect capital markets-centered banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) to report net income declines of 15% to 40% compared with the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), which have substantial lending businesses, are expected to report drops of 60% to 84%.
 Wells Fargo  & Co, (N:WFC) which does not have a major capital markets business, may even swing to a loss, according to estimates.
""For those that have it, robust trading revenues and investment banking fees should provide some offset,"" said analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
The six biggest U.S. banks by assets begin announcing results on Tuesday. Goldberg expects them to report $31.7 billion in provisions to cover expected loan losses. That is six times more than their provision expense of $4.8 billion a year ago.
Conditions have been much better in capital markets. Companies have hired Wall Street banks to raise money from stock and bond issues, while corporate bonds have benefited from actions the U.S. Federal Reserve took to reduce credit risk.
Banks are also benefiting from wide spreads between buying and selling prices, according to analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, while changing opinions about the future of the economy have driven high trading volume and volatility.

All of that suggests underwriting and trading revenue will improve. KBW predicts fixed-income trading revenue will be up 65% from a year earlier for the biggest banks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Analysts kept faith that Argentina would be able strike a debt deal with its creditors on Thursday, after the most prominent group of funds had dismissed the government's ""final"" offer as only a good starting point.
The Ad Hoc and Exchange bondholder groups, which between them own almost a third of the $65 billion of debt Argentina wants to restructure, said that though they didn't accept the latest proposal, it did provide a basis for ""constructive engagement"".
Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Guzman, who has led the negotiations, responded by saying there was ""clearly"" no room to improve the country's ""maximum effort"", but followers of the long-running saga weren't giving up hope.
""I think they are getting closer to a deal and I think they will reach it,"" said North Asset Management's Peter Kisler, who holds Argentina bonds but is not part of any of creditor group.
""The creditors are trying to extract as much as they can. It doesn't cost them anything to push for more especially as there is bit of time left,"" he added, referring to Argentina's latest offer being on the table until at least early August. 
Bond prices have risen from around 20 cents on the dollar as negotiations have continued in recent months, but as they approach 50 cent on the dollar it could be time to think about potentially cashing in, Kisler said.
""They could go to 60 cents maybe but the risk-reward gets more difficult once you get above that (50 cents) level.""
Another of the bond groups, the Argentina Creditor Committee, which includes funds such as Greylock Capital and GMO is still to give its view, but most focus remains on the Ad Hoc and Exchange groups which contain the likes of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, Pimco and Ashmore.
Carlos de Sousa, Lead EM Economist, Oxford Economics told Reuters that bondholders still had concerns about a potential ""Pac-Man"" strategy where the government would try to gobble up bonds in successive restructurings rather than in one clean swoop.
""The discussion is not only about a few more cents on the dollar. That said, our debt sustainability analysis supports Argentina’s statements that the new offer is the country’s maximum effort,"" de Sousa said.

""In the sense that, Argentina would risk falling again on an unsustainable debt path within a decade if they offer significantly more.""

157,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Mixed; Dow Futures Down 73 Points,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday, amid cautious trading ahead of the release of key employment data while coronavirus cases continue to soar.
At 7:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, Nasdaq Futures rose 32 points, or 0.3%, after the Nasdaq Composite cash index posted a fresh record closing high Wednesday. The Dow Futures contract fell 73 points, or 0.3%.
U.S. equity markets have posted strong gains since the depths of March, helped by better-than-expected economic data and extraordinary fiscal and monetary aid from the U.S. authorities to combat the impact from the coronavirus outbreak.
However, the recent surge of coronavirus cases has created doubts over the likelihood of a prompt economic recovery. On Wednesday, the U.S. registered a new daily record of fresh cases, over 62,000, with populous states Texas and California  offering up their largest one-day increases.
Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Wednesday that this could cause the U.S. economy to recover more slowly than expected and demand for the Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending program, which aims to support small and mid-sized businesses, could grow over time.
With this in mind, focus will turn to the weekly initial jobless claims number, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to be 1.4 million, about even with the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 18.9 million, slightly down from earlier.
Jobs trends had been positive as states and cities came back from Covid lockdowns, but some areas have now been forced to slow down or reverse reopenings.
In corporate news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is likely to be in the spotlight after it reported disappointing first-quarter earnings after the close on Wednesday, stating that it now plans to close roughly 200 stores in the next two years. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also disappointed with its fiscal third-quarter earnings.
On the flip side, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) said its June sales rose 11% from a year ago, with e-commerce sales increasing 86%.
Oil prices stagnated Thursday, despite U.S. government data showing Wednesday that gasoline stockpiles fell by much more than expected as demand climbed to its highest level since late March.
Prices have been held in a narrow band over the past two weeks as concern about the pandemic globally tempers hopes for a recovery in fuel demand.
At 7:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $40.82 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract was flat at $43.30.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,816.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1325, largely flat."

The Germany-based cruise line said it has introduced a variety of coronavirus preventive measures to complement existing health and hygiene standards, as it restarts operations. 
Cruise operators have suspended most of their operations since March as the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak has forced several countries to mandate lockdowns and travel restrictions.
Earlier this week, rivals  Royal Caribbean  Group (N:RCL) and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) had announced a joint task force to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the pandemic.

Popular for being James Bond's carmaker of choice, the firm has had a difficult time since it floated in 2018 as sales disappointed and it burnt through cash, prompting it to seek fresh investment from billionaire Lawrence Stroll.
Since then it has announced job cuts, is replacing its boss and has picked a new finance chief among a series of changes as it also responds to the coronavirus pandemic.
The DBX vehicle is the company’s first foray into the lucrative sport utility vehicle market, a late entrant compared to many rivals such as Volkswagen-owned (DE:VOWG_p) Bentley and BMW’s (DE:BMWG) Rolls-Royce.
""The DBX has become the car that will drive Aston Martin into a bold new era,"" said Aston's Chief Creative Officer Marek Reichman. 
Deliveries of the model will start later this month. 
Work at the firm's new St Athan factory in Wales, where the model is being built, had to stop in March as lockdown saw the economy grind to a halt. 

Output restarted in May with safety measures in place but the firm has yet to set a restart date for its English factory in Gaydon, where sports cars are built.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fast Retailing Co (T:9983), owner of casual clothing brand Uniqlo, lowered its outlook for the year as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on its global fashion business. 
But it also reported a strong rebound in Uniqlo's domestic same-store sales for June and said business in China was recovering faster than previously expected, suggesting it may weather the crisis better than many global peers.
Store closures and weak consumer spending around the world has brought a halt to years of growth at the company, now Asia's biggest fashion retailer and the world's No. 3 after Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb). 
It forecast operating profit of 130 billion yen ($1.21 billion) for the year through August, down 50% from a year earlier rather than a previously expected 44%, following a surprise loss of 4 billion yen in the March-May quarter.
It also forecast annual sales to fall 13 percent to 1.99 billion yen, ending 16 straight years of growth.
""We have seen a large decline in both revenue and profit across the business,"" CFO Takeshi Okazaki told reporters.
The company said markets such as South Korea, the United States and several others including Indonesia had been particularly hard-hit, while adding that its two key markets, Japan and China, were recovering faster than expected.
Uniqlo's domestic same-store sales, including online purchases, rose 26% in June from a year earlier, after falling 57% in April and 18% in May.
Okazaki said items such as stretchy jogging pants and oversized t-shirts proved popular in the past quarter in Japan.
Analysts have said Uniqlo's focus on practical, everyday wear rather than more trendy styles may work to its advantage as more consumers are spending time at home.
Fast Retailing also depends heavily on Asian economies, especially China, where Uniqlo's mix of affordable basics and occasionally trendy items proved a massive hit among the burgeoning middle class. 
Its struggle to gain market share in the United States, previously considered a major weakness, has spared it from a bigger hit from the virus outbreak.
Of Uniqlo’s 2,260 stores globally, just 51 are in the United States, which has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections in the world. 
Okazaki said the company was not retreating from the U.S. market, although it would step up its ""scrap and build"" strategy of concentrating on profitable locations and shutting down low-performing stores. 

He declined to comment when asked whether it would consider buying Brooks Brothers, which on Wednesday joined a list of U.S. brands that have filed for bankruptcy.

164,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boohoo Bounces but the Damage Is Real,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- How much damage have the revelations about  Boohoo .com’s supply chain done?
Only last week, it appeared that nothing could stop the U.K.-based fast fashion house. Its stock had risen by over one-third in the first half of the year in the belief that its online-only distribution model and strong balance sheet positioned it perfectly for the post-pandemic world. After seizing the moment to raise 200 million pounds in fresh capital, it was ready, willing and able to go out and add to its brand portfolio by sweeping up rivals who had succumbed to the recession on the high street.
Then the Sunday Times dropped the bombshell about conditions in a Leicester factory that was part of its supply chain.  The report exposed how vulnerable workers, overwhelmingly with South Asian origins, were packed into ill-ventilated workshops and forced to work for as little as half the national legal minimum. The stock gave up all of its 2020 gains in three days.
The response to the revelations says a lot about how Covid-19 has changed perceptions of governance risk. Investors have turned a blind eye to lax enforcement of conditions in the industry’s supply chain for years, fully aware that business goes where labor is cheapest, especially where the budget end of the market – Boohoo’s niche - is concerned.
But the calculation is transformed when it becomes clear that the conditions required for profitability (and Boohoo’s margins are some of the best in the business) are also perfect for spreading the coronavirus and economic disaster.
Labour Behind the Label,  a pressure group that campaigns for workers' right, said last week it had received reports of ""workers being forced to come into work while sick with COVID-19, workers wishing to isolate being denied pay, (and) factories operating illegally throughout lockdown.”
While there’s no proven link between the practices outlined in the Sunday Times report and the local outbreak of Covid-19 that forced the government to exclude Leicester from the broad lifting of lockdown restrictions last weekend, it’s clear that such a link can’t be ruled out.
Boohoo has since said that the company documented in the report wasn’t on its official list of suppliers – a claim that’s impossible to verify externally as Boohoo never published that list.  It’s also said it will spend 10 million pounds on a review of how its clothes are made.
It does, at least, appear to have convinced its biggest investors that it can ride this one out. Jupiter Fund Management, its largest independent shareholder, has now raised its stake to over 10% from 9.6% last week.  By contrast, much of the selling, it can be assumed, was triggered by stop loss orders placed by the retail investors with shorter-term investment horizons who had jumped onto a rare ‘safe bet’ in the past three months.
Boohoo (LON:BOOH) shares were up 27% by mid-morning in London but were still below where they started the year.
Whatever the outcome of Boohoo’s investigation, it would appear likely that the company will have to spend more on at least monitoring its supply chain in the future, even though the role of its Leicester factories is set to shrink as it broadens its portfolio through acquisitions.
But the conditions that previously only directly affected the unfortunates in the factories now have a clear, if indirect, impact on the lives and livelihoods of thousands of others. As long as law enforcement can’t afford to look away, neither can investors."
165,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",Rooftop revolution: Coronavirus chill upends solar power industry,"By Nichola Groom, Isla Binnie and Nina Chestney
LOS ANGELES/MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - The booming rooftop solar panel industry nosedived overnight when the coronavirus forced homeowners to rein in spending and keep their distance from would-be installers.
Now, in their struggle to survive, companies on both sides of the Atlantic are turning to online marketing rather than knocking on doors, using drones to inspect roofs, arranging digital permits and coming up with attractive new financing plans, according to interviews with 12 executives.
At stake is the future of a key driver of the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy: solar power was the second-fastest growing renewable source after wind in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency.
And rooftop installations, which generate electricity used by homes or businesses rather than feeding into the grid, made up more than 40% of the market before COVID-19 struck.
Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie has slashed its rooftop solar installation forecasts for Europe and the United States by a whopping 30% this year, while lifting its forecast by 3% in Asia, where China provides strong government support.
Joana Palau, 42, a council worker on the Spanish island of Ibiza, was one of the few in her neighbourhood who pressed ahead with a plan to install 12 solar panels on her farmhouse in June: ""If I had not been working and did not have the stability of a salary every month, I definitely wouldn't have done it.""
By contrast, large-scale solar installations that power the grid have fared relatively well. Wood Mackenzie trimmed its forecast by less than 10% for Europe and barely touched its U.S. outlook as rock-bottom prices, subsidies and government mandates helped insulate larger projects from the pandemic.
'RADICAL SHIFT'
In the United States, the third biggest rooftop solar market after China and Japan, about 80% of the 100,000 job losses in the solar sector so far have been at rooftop installers, the Solar Energy Industries Association said.
Many of the staff who were not laid off, however, began to focus on one of the industry's most persistent challenges: how to cut the cost of identifying homeowners with suitable roofs, and then persuading them to buy panels, executives said.
Quickly, companies made sales appointments virtual.
Leading U.S. installers SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) Corp, Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR) Inc and Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) Inc said that reassured potential clients worried about the virus. It also cut the cost of acquiring customers, which Wood Mackenzie puts at nearly $4,000, or 22% of the average $18,000 cost of a U.S. system.
Normally reliant on door-to-door visits, an effective but expensive sales tactic, Vivint trained hundreds of salespeople to canvass by phone as its sales slumped 60% following state lockdowns, Chief Executive David Bywater said.
By early May, sales were down only 30%.
""It was a radical shift,"" said Bywater, adding that it had hastened Vivint's plan to diversify sales strategies and cut costs: ""I hope we never lose that and we accelerate that.""
In fact, the strategy was so successful that larger rival Sunrun announced on July 7 that it had agreed to buy Vivint in an all-stock deal valued at $3.2 billion, saving $90 million a year and creating a solar player with half a million customers.
Sunrun bought Vivint because of its focus on direct selling, a model Sunrun Chief Executive Lynn Jurich said had become even more durable during the COVID-19 pandemic: ""Both companies are delivering above where we expected.""
'GAME CHANGING'
Rival SunPower has also seen a massive shift to digital sales, with about three-quarters of consultations now happening via video chat, up from a 10th previously. 
Chief Executive Tom Werner said he expected half of its sales would be digital from now on. He said it was harder to close deals in virtual chats but that was offset by cutting out travel time between appointments.
""Ideally, you have the day when solar is like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), so you can buy and be fulfilled in a very efficient process,"" he said.
Sunrun, meanwhile, had to pull its salespeople out of stores such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) during lockdowns, outlets that had been bringing in nearly a third of its sales.
Within two weeks, Sunrun had moved its field sales team online and launched a promotion offering six months of home solar power for $6. While initial online commitments were lower, the percentage of customers following through was higher.
Sunrun said innovations like virtual sales and automating permits to avoid physical processing by authorities will trim about $2,000 off the cost of an array over the next year or so.
EmPower Solar https://www.empower-solar.com, a rooftop installer based in Long Island, spent New York's lockdown on ""game changing initiatives"" such as digitising sales and paperwork, and using satellite imagery and drones to inspect roofs, said Chief Executive David Schieren. 
He said, however, that it was harder to build rapport with potential customers without face-to-face contact.
'ROOFTOP REVOLUTION'
In Europe, rooftop solar firms developed more enticing finance plans as the pandemic made clients wary about spending.
SotySolar https://sotysolar.es in Gijon in northern Spain accelerated the roll-out of a ""Netflix-style"" subscription model. It installs panels and charges a monthly fee though homeowners can buy them or end their contract when they like, said co-founder Daniel Fernandez.
""We have been thinking about doing this for a while but we brought it forward because of this situation,"" he said, adding that he expected to triple installations with the offer.
In Barcelona, renewable energy utility Holaluz has accelerated an initiative to install panels free for people with available roof space - and use them to generate power for all its customers. It aims to extend the plan to apartment blocks and commercial buildings.
Holaluz expects to boost clients to one million and carry out 50,000 rooftop solar installations by 2023. It estimates fewer than 10,000 Spanish homes currently have panels.
""This is the rooftop revolution,"" said co-founder Carlota Pi. ""We have spent so much time at home, we have become much more conscious of the value you can create by transforming your roof into a source of energy generation.""
Nevertheless, despite such innovations, the industry will take time to bounce back, according to industry groups.
In Italy, one of Europe's biggest rooftop solar markets, one in five companies fear they may close due to COVID-19, according to a survey in May by Italian solar trade group Italia Solare.
In Spain, solar association UNEF, for example, has slashed its forecast for rooftop installations this year by a third.
Nevertheless, European firms are hoping moves by the European Union and governments in Spain, Germany and elsewhere to pursue ""green"" post-pandemic economic recoveries will help.
""The sector looks set to undergo a quick recovery,"" said Michael Schmela, head of market intelligence at industry association SolarPower Europe in Brussels.
In the United States, residential installations are not expected to return to previously forecast levels until 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie - and some say going online won't work for all, especially in some rural communities.

""It's a totally different culture,"" said Benjamin Mayer, vice president of marketing for SunBug Solar https://sunbugsolar.com, which sells in the countryside of western Massachusetts. ""If you are going to get traction in that community, you need to be there for a decade.""

The commitments also included selling Alstom's Coradia Polyvalent - a range of regional trains - and divesting a Bombardier commuter trains division and the production facilities attached to that at its Hennigsdorf site in Germany.
Alstom's bid in February of up to 6.2 billion euros ($7.0 billion) for Montreal-based Bombardier's rail business has faced scrutiny from EU antitrust authorities, which have been expected to demand concessions to approve the deal.
By buying Bombardier's train division, Alstom is seeking to create the world's second largest train manufacturer to compete more effectively with Chinese leader CRRC Corp (SS:601766). Last year, EU regulators blocked Alstom's attempt to merge rail assets with  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn).
Alstom said it would sell its Reichshoffen factory in France, confirming a report by Reuters on Wednesday. The site in Eastern France has around 800 employees and produces mostly regional trains.
French unions, which are due to be updated on the concessions on Thursday, were still hoping to keep the site, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The EU is due to decide whether or not to pursue a deeper enquiry on July 16, following its preliminary review of the deal.
Alstom said other concessions included providing access to some products within Bombardier's train control systems and signalling units - one of the areas where the combined companies would have a large market share.

Alstom's shares were up 0.3% at 43.05 euros by 0828 GMT.

Finance ministers from the euro area are due to meet virtually Thursday, ahead of a summit of their leaders on July 17-18, looking to advance discussions over the bloc’s multi-year budget and a proposed 750 billion euro ($851 billion) recovery fund.
The need for agreement on the recovery fund is becoming more apparent. Although Europe as a whole appears to have done a good job of containing the Covid-19 virus, the European Commission revised its economic forecasts for this year downward to show a contraction of 8.7% in the euro zone.
Additionally, there are now over 12 million global cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with a number of countries re-imposing lockdowns to curb fresh outbreaks.
The U.S. has posted its largest number of daily new infections since the outbreak began, and investors will be wary of what the new earnings season will deliver when it begins in earnest next week.
Oil prices stagnated Thursday, despite U.S. government data showing Wednesday that gasoline stockpiles fell by much more than expected as demand climbed to its highest level since late March.
Prices have been held in a narrow band over the past two weeks as concern about the pandemic globally tempers hopes for a recovery in fuel demand.

Bettina Bauer, managing director of Gilead in Germany, told WirtschaftsWoche the U.S. drugmaker can increase its worldwide monthly production from currently 190,000 treatment cycles to 2 million treatment cycles in December.
Bauer said she was in talks with the German government about increasing supply.
Gilead has faced criticism after the company allocated nearly all of its supply of remdesivir to the United States over the next three months, stirring concerns about availability elsewhere.
Germany has only a few hundred doses of remdesivir and has urged Gilead to increase production of the drug, which is the only treatment granted a conditional marketing authorisation by the European Union for use in COVID-19 patients, in Europe. 
""According to our information, more of the product is also available in Germany than is currently needed by emergency patients,"" Bauer told WirtschaftsWoche.
Bauer also defended the remdesivir's price of $2,340 per patient for wealthier nations, saying that increasing production of the drug due to the COVID-19 pandemic will cost it an estimated $1 billion this year.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields held their ground on Thursday with investors' main focus expected to be any new developments on the European Union's recovery fund, which aims to help the region's economy recover from the coronavirus crisis.
Hopes are high that the 750 billion euro ($851.70 billion)fund will be approved at a European Union summit late next week. Designed to mostly offer grants to countries worst hit by the coronavirus, it has been one of the main drivers of a drop in Southern European borrowing costs led by Italy in the past few weeks. 
On Wednesday, European Council President Charles Michel said the EU needed to reach an agreement quickly on the fund but much negotiation was still needed.
Euro zone finance ministers will meet at 1300 GMT to select their new leader, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will give a joint news conference in Berlin at 1830 GMT.
""We don't anticipate a fast agreement (little in the EU moves quickly), but would be cautious around putting too much weight on negative-sounding headlines, which are almost certain to be seen,"" Mizuho analysts told clients.
""Instead, we stick to our expectation for a slow but inexorable grind towards a consensus relatively close to the Franco-German proposal,"" they said, referring to an initial proposal which offered 500 billion euros in grants before the EU added 250 billion euros in loans to its plan. 
On Thursday, Germany's 10-year yield was unchanged at -0.44%, close to one-week lows, while Italian 10-year yields were also unchanged at 1.28%.
On the data front, German exports rebounded 9% in May in another sign of recovering demand spurred by the lifting of lockdown measures, but rose less than the 13.8% expected in a Reuters poll. 
In the primary market, Ireland is due to sell between 1 and 1.5 billion euros via the sale of 7, 10 and 30-year bonds.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Ant Group listing would be fillip for Hong Kong's flagging IPO market,"By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - An initial public offering from Alibaba's (HK:9988) Ant Group by year-end would give equity capital markets in Hong Kong a timely boost after a new security law cast in doubt the city's future as a global financial centre, analysts said on Thursday.
With new deals worth $4.17 billion in the first half, Hong Kong's exchange accounted for 7.6% of the global IPO market, though down from a share of 11%, and deals worth $7.91 billion, in the same period last year, Refinitiv data showed.
The fall in value ranked Hong Kong as the fourth most active exchange after the Nasdaq, mainland China's new Star Market and the Shanghai stock market.
A listing by Ant Group, the fintech arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant, would add diversity and reinforce Hong Kong's reputation as a global financial centre, said Hao Hong, head of research at Bocom International.
""Hong Kong investors don't have that much opportunity to invest in these Chinese tech companies,"" Hong told Reuters.
""Seventy percent of the Hong Kong market is finance and property. That isn't to say they are not good companies, but it isn't that representative of where the economy is going in the future.""
Aequitas Research analyst Ke Yan, who publishes on the SmartKarma platform, said an Ant listing would ""make Hong Kong equity market the top choice for access to leading Chinese tech and media companies.""
The comments followed a Reuters report on Wednesday that cited two sources with direct knowledge as saying that Ant planned a Hong Kong float as soon as this year, and targeted a valuation of more than $200 billion. 
The company denied the report. 
The sources said Ant was considering listing 5% to 10% of its stock, in what would be the world's largest IPO this year, based on the estimated valuation. 
Ant's listing would also bring a lucrative payday for investment banks in Hong Kong.
Alibaba's $12.9-billion secondary listing in Hong Kong last year generated almost $32 million in fees for banks, the company's U.S. filings showed. 
Equity capital markets deals make up almost 40% of the regional investment banking wallet, versus 25% globally, a Reuters calculation from Refinitiv data shows.
Mandates to lead Ant's deal will be coveted, not just for the fees generated, but also for the prestige that accompanies a high-profile transaction.
Alibaba is known to be close to  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and CICC which sponsored the secondary listing last year.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) was ranked number one in the Asia Pacific ECM league tables in the first half, Refinitiv shows, ahead of Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM).

Hong Kong's new security law took effect last week.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",China's market euphoria trumps political risk in Hong Kong,"By Samuel Shen and Noah Sin
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors in China's soaring stock market are increasingly turning to Hong Kong for bargains, egging on an investment boom on the back of large tech listings and shaking off fears of political risks in the bruised financial hub.
The country's blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) hit five-year-highs in recent sessions on a state-endorsed rally and a retail trading frenzy.
But Chinese investors and brokerages say they are increasingly drawn by Hong Kong shares, whose gains have been more modest.
""Elephants are dancing (in mainland China), but in Hong Kong, many stocks are lying on the floor,"" Shen Weizheng, senior advisor at brokerage Direct Access, said during an online pitch to mainland investors on Wednesday.
""Buy more Hong Kong stocks. You don't lose money buying bargains."" 
Mainland-listed A-shares are on average 35% more expensive than their Hong Kong-listed peers, also called ""H-shares"" (HSCE), widening from 23% just a month ago (HSCAHPI). Share prices of the same company often differ vastly in the two markets.
A growing number of U.S-listed Chinese internet companies, including NetEase (HK:9999) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com (HK:9618), have chosen to float in Hong Kong through secondary listings amid heightened Sino-U.S. tensions.
New York-listed  Alibaba  (HK:9988) (N:BABA), which completed its Hong Kong listing last year, could get the greenlight to enter the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) next month.
""Capital is flowing into the city. The more intense the rivalry between the U.S. and China, the more unique Hong Kong will be as a centre to welcome back leading Chinese companies listed in the U.S.,"" said Hao Hong, managing director at BOCOM International.
With many more Chinese listings in the pipeline, ""such investment opportunities can last for at least two years, potentially generating annualised returns of 20%,"" said Richard Li, general manager of Shanghai-based Regan Fund Management Co, which has been actively investing in such listings.
GROWING POWER
The surge in investment from the mainland comes as Hong Kong becomes increasingly isolated from traditional western trading partners due to Beijing's growing political reach into the financial hub.
China's new National Security Law for Hong Kong, effective last week, is the latest flash point between Beijing and Washington, adding to other points of tension such as trade and tech supremacy.
Mainland interest in Hong Kong stocks, however, has only gone up.
Southbound turnover under the cross-border Stock Connect hit record levels on Monday. Net mainland purchases of Hong Kong stocks under connect totaled HK$300 billion ($38.71 billion) during the first six months, exceeding last year's total. 
Accelerating Chinese inflows also help strengthen the Hong Kong dollar .
""Stock valuation in Hong Kong is still attractive, so it's natural for abundant mainland money to spill over,"" said Hong Kong-based online brokerage Futu (O:FUTU). The brokerage, which mainly serves wealthy Chinese, witnessed a surge in trading volume on its platform this year. 
Mainland money is largely behind the 230% surge this year in Hong Kong-listed shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (HK:0981), which is expected to command lofty valuations when it lists on Shanghai's STAR Market.
For Hong Kong stocks such as SMIC, ""what's happening in the China market is changing the companies' narratives,"" Liu Youpu, partner at Shanghai-based hedge fund house Aifanzhe Investment Management Co said.
""We expect to see growing pricing power by mainland investors in the Hong Kong market.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher Thursday, with investors hopeful of more government help to sustain the economic recovery while remaining wary of the mounting coronavirus cases ahead of the new earnings season.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher. CAC 40 futures in France were up 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Finance ministers from the euro area are due to meet virtually Thursday, ahead of a summit of their leaders on July 17-18, and there will be discussions over the bloc’s multi-year budget as well as a proposed 750 ($851 billion) euro recovery fund for economies hit hardest by Covid-19.
There is a degree of optimism within the market that a deal will be struck between the mainly northern European nations that want the funds to be made available primarily as loans, i.e. to be repaid, and those hardest hit, and more fiscally challenged, further south that seek grants.
On Wednesday the U.K. government detailed its latest pandemic economic rescue plan, with a sticker price of 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) aimed at getting consumers to support businesses as they reopen after three months of lockdown.
The need for this new injection of stimulus is becoming more apparent. Although Europe as a whole appears to have done a good job of containing the Covid-19 virus, the European Commission revised its economic forecasts for this year downward to show a contraction of 8.7% in the euro zone.  There are now over 12 million global cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with a number of countries re-imposing lockdowns to curb fresh outbreaks.
The U.S., the world’s economic engine, has posted its largest number of daily new infections since the outbreak began, and investors will be wary of what the new earnings season will deliver when it begins in earnest next week.
Oil prices stagnated Thursday, despite U.S. government data showing Wednesday that gasoline stockpiles fell by much more than expected as demand climbed to its highest level since late March.
Prices have been held in a narrow band over the past two weeks as concerns about a spike in coronavirus cases globally tempers optimism about a recovery in fuel demand.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $40.77 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $43.20.

Ford has been seeking to recover from a slump in sales unprecedented for a major global automaker in China, with sales sinking 26% last year after a 37% drop in 2018.
Company sources have previously said those sales were hurt by an aging model lineup, a breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers, as well as missteps by past management teams.
China sales for the second quarter climbed to 158,589 units, Ford said in a statement, attributing the rise to a stronger vehicle lineup including new sport-utility vehicles and locally-made luxury Lincoln cars and ""strong demand following the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions"".
By contrast, rival General Motors (N:GM) said its sales in China for the quarter declined 5.3% to 713,600 units. 
Industry-wide vehicle wholesale sales rose 4.4% in April and 14.5% in May and are expected to grow 11% in June, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers has said.
In China, Ford makes cars through its joint ventures with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000625) and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550).
In the United States, where sales have been hit by lockdowns and travel restrictions, Ford's sales plunged 33% during the quarter.

180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 01:18AM ET</span>",Four Big Perks Aimed at Rescuing the U.K. Economy From Virus Damage,"(Bloomberg) -- A big tax break on your next home purchase, a discounted summer vacation, incentives to hire young people and half off meals for you and the whole family.
Those are some of the main takeaways for consumers in the U.K. government’s latest pandemic economic rescue plan, which was released Wednesday by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.
The chancellor, a former financial analyst, is making these surgical moves to try to avoid massive job losses and prevent an already terrible economic situation from becoming even worse.
And while Sunak has already offered up billions in support for corporations, worries are running high that consumers are losing confidence in the country’s recovery even as it reopens for business in stages after three months of lockdown. The package didn’t include incentives for investors such as capital-gains tax cuts.
Here are the main items:
Splitting the Bill
This August, British people will essentially get a big coupon that’s good for dining out on Mondays through Wednesdays.
The U.K. government will pick up half the bill for meals and non-alcoholic drinks in restaurants, cafes and pubs on those three days of the week, up to £10 per person. Restaurants have to register to participate in the program.
Tax Breaks for Your Holiday
The state will also help people save money when they stay in hotels or campsites, go to theme parks and enjoy other leisurely pursuits. Consumers will only have to pay a 5% value-added tax on such activities, instead of 20%, from July 15 to Jan. 12, 2021.
About 80% of the U.K.’s hospitality industry was shut down from April to this past Saturday, with 1.4 million workers furloughed.
Helping You Buy a House
The Treasury is giving tax breaks to people who purchase homes that are worth up to £500,000. The change saves the average buyer £4,500 pounds, and nearly nine out of 10 people buying a primary residence this year won’t pay stamp duty at all, Sunak said. The new rule went into effect Wednesday and will last until March 2021.
The upshot is that homeowners contemplating a move up the property ladder will now get a big break. Previously, they had to pay a 2% tax on properties valued between £125,000 and £250,000, and 5% on homes between £250,001 and £925,000. (First-time homebuyers were exempt on homes up to £300,000.)
In addition, there’s £2 billion allocated for homeowners who want to make drafty residences more energy efficient with better insulation and weather-stripping.
Jobs for Young People
It’s been rough for young people looking for work in the battered retail and restaurant industries. Now the Treasury is putting £2 billion toward funding jobs at small- and medium-sized companies for those aged 16 to 24.
“We cannot lose this generation,” Sunak said in Parliament on Wednesday.
The Treasury will directly pay employers to hire younger workers, helping to fund wages for six months for 25 hours a week.
The grant will cover a salary at the minimum wage, so employers can’t expect to be reimbursed for more than that. The minimum wage ranges from £4.55 per hour for 16-year-olds to £8.20 an hour for 24-year-olds. A grant for the latter might total £6,500, Sunak said. Employers are expected to provide training and support to help the new hires find permanent work."

With state government approval, the world's biggest iron ore miner in May destroyed two sacred caves in the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia as part of a mine expansion.
Rio's response to blowing up the caves was ""far from adequate"", 35 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and human rights groups said in a letter requesting the miner be suspended from the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB). 
Netherlands-based CHRB is a public benchmark of corporate human rights performance. It lists Rio as the highest ranked extractives company globally on human rights issues, with a score in the second highest possible band. 
""We are calling on the Benchmark to ensure that the company's human rights ranking reflects the reality for people here on the ground,"" said Wayne Bergmann, a Kimberley Aboriginal leader and chief executive of Aboriginal charitable trust KRED. 
Rio apologised for the distress it caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and launched an independent investigation into how the destruction occurred.
Thursday's letter disputed Rio's explanation of the incident as a ""misunderstanding"", saying that the indigenous land owners had brought to Rio's attention on several occasions the archaeological and ethnographic significance of the site. 
Rio declined to comment on the letter.
Large miners are coming under increasing scrutiny for their relationships with traditional owners and heritage sites. BHP Group (AX:BHP) last month won approval to disturb 40 cultural sites, while  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG) in May lost a bid to appeal in an indigenous land case.

184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>","After $9 Billion Credit Hit, Banks Seek Trade Finance Overhaul","(Bloomberg) -- When Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) issued a payment guarantee for a $76.5 million fuel purchase from a Singapore trader in March, they unwittingly became the latest victims in a series of trade finance scandals that have led to more than $9 billion in potential losses for global lenders.
At the same time that Hin Leong Trading Pte. was pledging the fuel to back the loan, it allegedly agreed to sell the same cargo to another trader, who sought letters of credit from three banks including Credit Agricole.
This line of credit merry-go-round was among many allegedly fraudulent tools used by Hin Leong, one of Singapore’s biggest oil traders before its spectacular collapse in April that left 23 banks on the hook for $3.5 billion, according to a report from court-appointed managers.
For banks financing the opaque world of commodities trading in Singapore, Hin Leong isn’t an isolated case. The trading hub has seen a clutch of failures in the past year with lenders struggling to reclaim loans, alleging they were tricked by forged documents and by traders pledging cargoes to multiple banks. The two latest lawsuits show lenders including HSBC and CIMB of Malaysia exposed to about $640 million in potential losses.
“It’s tumbling down like a house of cards - everybody is caught in the whirlwind,” said Robson Lee, a corporate finance law partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP’s Singapore office.
In a June 25 statement, Hin Leong founder Lim Oon Kuin said he was unfit to respond to the allegations in the report from the judicial managers. HSBC and Credit Agricole declined to comment.
Fight Back
Rather than flee the $18 trillion trade finance business, most banks are now taking steps to fight back. Singapore lenders are considering a central database to track collateral, according to a person familiar with the matter, while banks including ABN Amro Bank NV are stepping up vigilance.  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and HSBC, two of the biggest players in the space, are turning to technology such as blockchain to limit fraud.
The losses are mounting, with Hin Leong just the latest case of trade finance gone awry:
Banks and other creditors face about $9.26 billion in potential losses from these and other failures over the last six years, all of them involving some form of alleged fraud, forgery, multiple cargo pledges or questionable accounting, based on a Bloomberg News tally.
Hin Leong’s financing scheme was among the biggest and most elaborate, a new report shows.
Some 60 letters of credit amounting to $1.5 billion were used to finance cargo that either didn’t exist or was pledged to multiple buyers, according to an investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the court-appointed managers. In all, 273 letters of credit were spread among 23 banks, which have low chances of recovery with assets worth 7% of liabilities.
“The company fabricated documents on a massive scale,” PwC wrote in the June report, adding that the company’s transgressions were routine and pervasive, misleading banks into extending credit.
In the world of trade finance, exporters and importers rely on credit lines to protect themselves against risks such as currency fluctuations, non-payment and political instability. When it works, the short-term financing provides a relatively safe way for banks to generate a quick profit as the lending covers sea voyages lasting just a few weeks.
100% Illegal
The financing doesn’t work when the same barrels of oil or other commodities are used to get financing from multiple lenders, or when the cargo used to back the loans doesn’t exist.“Double financing is 100% illegal because a borrower is wrongly representing to different banks that it has security over the same goods,” said Baldev Bhinder, a commodities specialist and managing director of BlackStone & Gold Llc, a Singapore law firm. “But banks have challenges in on-boarding a live transaction quickly.”
One of the reasons so many firms have duped the banks is there is little transparency in the trading process, said Kelvin Tan, a former deputy director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state’s central bank. As a result, banks can’t determine if the oil backing a loan is being pledged to another lender at the same time.
“The reason double, or multiple pledging is a common problem in commodity trade finance is because there is no central database of such collateral,” said Tan, chief investment officer of GTR Ventures, a trade finance technology firm. “This blow-up is exposing a structural flaw amongst not only banks, but also the ecosystem.”
Paper Work
Banks have also suffered from old-school documentation. Transaction documents can run into the hundreds of pages, making copies and forgeries easier.“The nature of this business means it’s almost impossible for the banks to verify whether the goods pledged to them belong to them or if it’s even there,” said John Khaw, co-founder of Lucidity, a fintech startup that focuses on trade finance technology.
The banks also have to understand the risks of this sector, said Bhinder.
Margins on trade finance can be razor thin, as low as 0.25%, putting a premium on volume. Staff turnover is also high, meaning bankers signing off on financing often lack expertise, said Clara Hang, former head of trade finance at Singapore’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. As a result, big borrowers like Hin Leong, with revenue of $20 billion last year, face less scrutiny, she said.
“They place too much trust in the company,” said Hang, founder of trade finance start-up eFundsme Global Pte.
Recent Cases:
In the wake of all these scandals, a few banks have eased up on trade finance. Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) halted fresh funding to oil trading firms in Asia, while ABN Amro now considers the sector high risk.
“Unfortunately, fraud tends to emerge in times of stress,” ABN Chief Risk Officer Tanja Cuppen said on a recent conference call. “We have taken lessons from these cases and have taken measures to prevent this from happening again.”
Traders of everything from zinc to oil and rubber are feeling the pinch as banks heighten scrutiny. Several firms interviewed have said their bankers were pulling back from short-term financing or asking for more secured collateral. Financing costs have jumped, and in some cases the banks are refusing to issue letters of credit, according to the traders, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly.
Even with the failures, most banks are sticking with the sector, betting that tighter controls, increased transparency and new technology will help avoid losses in an otherwise lucrative business.
Lenders in Singapore set up a working group to raise standards for trade finance, according to a statement last week. One of the measures being considered is the central registry for cargo, according to the person familiar with the plans who declined to be identified as the matter is private.
DBS Moves
DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, is eliminating manual workflows and has digitized key trade financing services including letters of credit, import bills, and shipping guarantees, according to John Laurens, head of global transaction services, in a presentation Monday to reporters in Hong Kong.
The bank has adopted blockchain technology for trade finance, including a dedicated platform for Chinese corporate clients that offers almost-instant verification of suppliers’ credentials, Laurens said. The platform is integrated with various Chinese government databases that can validate and verify the authenticity of the transactions by suppliers.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which runs $4 trillion in daily trade flows, is using artificial intelligence to review transactions and documentation, said Kanika Thakur, head of Asia-Pacific trade finance.
DBS joined ING, HSBC and several other banks in a new Singapore-based blockchain network known as Contour. The group claims the network, replacing a 400-year-old system of paper transactions, can cut the processing time for letters of credit to 24 hours, from as long as 10 days.
“The delays and archaic processes that have marred the trade finance sector can no longer happen, and effective solutions are vital to keeping the sector alive,” Contour CEO Carl Wegner said in a statement.
For ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk, whose predecessor banks have been financing shipping since the 18th century, there will always be a few deals that falter.
“In that case, you will leave with a loss, but in and of itself, that’s not a reason now to leave the trading commodity space,” he said.

185,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>",‘No Way I Can Lose’: Inside China’s Stock-Market Frenzy,"(Bloomberg) -- Like millions of amateur investors across China, Min Hang has become infatuated with the country’s surging stock market.
“There’s no way I can lose,” said the 36-year-old, who works at a technology startup and opened her first trading account in Beijing on Tuesday. “Right now, I’m feeling invincible.”
Five years after China’s last big equity boom ended in tears, signs of euphoria among the nation’s investing masses are popping up everywhere. Turnover has soared, margin debt has risen at the fastest pace since 2015 and online trading platforms are struggling to keep up. Over the past eight days alone, Chinese stocks have added more than $1 trillion of value -- far outpacing gains in every other market worldwide.
While it would be easy to dismiss as a replay of this year’s Robinhood rally in the U.S., China’s budding equity mania could in many ways be more consequential. Unlike in most major markets, the nation’s individual investors account for the lion’s share of local stock trading and have been prone to extreme swings in sentiment that can have ripple effects on the economy and monetary policy.
For now, indicators of market overheating are still comfortably below levels reached during the height of equity bubbles in 2007 and 2015. The risk is that breakneck gains -- stoked in recent days by bullish articles in state-run media -- could eventually result in a destabilizing crash.
There are key differences between now and the start of the melt-up in 2014 for investors to consider, including a lower starting point for equity valuations. And while more traders are taking on debt to buy shares, leverage in the stock market is about 50% of what it was at its peak five years ago. Some investors say they are more cautious this year because of what happened before.
Regulators are keeping a close eye. The China Securities Regulatory Commission on Wednesday cracked down on hundreds of illegal margin financing platforms, some of which it said had provided leverage as high as 10 times. Stocks extended gains Thursday, with the CSI 300 Index adding 0.8% in morning trade.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts this week raised their target for the gauge by 29% to a level above its 2015 closing peak, citing factors including “rising retail investor account openings”.
Leo Li, a 28-year-old freelance screenwriter in the southern city of Kunming, says he’s “pretty much all-in” on stocks but isn’t borrowing to maximize returns -- yet.
“With leverage, it only makes sense to add it when you can be 100% certain of gains,” said Li, adding that his family sold property last year to buy stocks. “That usually happens when the old grannies start rushing in during the mid-to late stage of a rally. We are not there yet, but when the time comes I will be ready.”
In 2014, encouraging words by state media helped revive interest in what had been a dull equity market. The result was a debt-fueled speculative bubble that burst five years ago, wiping out $5 trillion of value. The fall-out triggered regulatory clampdowns on speculative and insider trading.
Tim Zhao said he learned his lesson in 2015 after losing an “astronomical” figure in the stock crash. He is back in the market for a rally he sees lasting as long as five years. “Everything is different this time,” said the 44-year-old from his office in Beijing, where he runs a movie equipment business. “It’s a lot more complicated.”
He started to build positions in February after stocks plunged at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak, focusing on chipmakers and health-care names. He declined to say how much he has invested this time around, but said he won’t be using leverage. “I want to make money, but I’m not desperate,” he said.
Others don’t see a repeat of 2015.
“Regulators will keep things in check to maintain a slow bull market,” said Roger Lin, a 45-year-old entrepreneur who runs a trading company in the southeast port city of Xiamen. He invested about 200,000 yuan in the market at the start of the year and added another 50,000 yuan last week, using part of a three-year credit loan.
“I’m confident that I’ll be able to exit just before the market slump,” he said. “You can do that as long as you’re not too greedy.”

186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>","As Asian Deals Disappear, India Becomes Unlikely M&A Hotspot","(Bloomberg) -- Mukesh Ambani’s ambitious courtship of international investors has helped turn India into a rare bright spot for dealmaking in 2020, a shift that bankers say is likely to continue as the battle for the country’s digital economy heats up.
Thanks in large part to $15 billion of investments in Ambani’s technology venture from the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Silver Lake Partners, India accounts for more than 12% of announced deals in the Asia Pacific region so far this year, the highest ratio since at least 1998. The country’s tally has jumped 18% from a year ago to $55.3 billion, defying an 18% slide for the region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
With half a billion Internet users and growing, India is witnessing pitched battles in everything from e-commerce and content streaming to messaging and digital payments -- similar to the early days of China’s digital boom. The sector’s importance has only increased this year as the Covid-19 pandemic pushed India to impose the world’s biggest lockdown in late March.
“India has become one of the busiest markets for M&A in Asia,” said Kerwin Clayton, co-head of M&A for Asia Pacific at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. “Global companies and investment funds are pondering more options to enter India, in a similar way to what happened with China a decade or so ago.”

Billionaire Ambani’s Jio Platforms Ltd., which houses movie, music apps and India’s biggest wireless carrier, is front and center in the surge of activity. The latest to join Jio’s list of investors is an arm of computer chip giant  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., propelling its valuation to $65 billion.
“There was significant deal activity in the tech space already but nothing of the speed and quantum we witnessed in Jio Platforms,” said Aalok Shah, managing director at Rothschild & Co. “Jio Platforms is a unique opportunity which attracted significant investor interest.”
The health care and infrastructure sectors are also going to see a surge in investment, Shah said. Sectors such as industrials and travel that have borne the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic will be hit with divestment, and distressed asset sales will take place, he said.
The pandemic has also put pressure on the country’s long-suffering financial sector. Indian companies, including banks, are more likely to raise funds in the markets to boslter their buffers, according to Srinivas Balasubramaniam, a senior partner at KPMG India. ICICI Bank Ltd. said Wednesday that it plans to raise as much as 150 billion rupees ($2 billion), while Axis Bank Ltd. announced plans last week to raise as much as $2 billion.
“A consolidation of financial services will start once the capital raising is done and dusted,” Balasubramaniam said. “The current economic slowdown coupled with the pandemic is likely to see the central bank force the hand of banks that have large subsidiaries and regulate them to dilute their stakes.”

China Factor
Recent political tensions between India and China have cast a heavy pall over dealmaking prospects between the neighboring countries. Even before their worst military clashes in 45 years, the Indian government drew China’s ire with its move in April to tighten foreign investment rules on countries it shares a border with.
Chinese companies pledged to invest about $579 million in Indian companies in the first six months of this year, down from $1.5 billion for the same period in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Even as both countries have agreed to deescalate tensions on their disputed border, bankers are expecting further slowdown of Chinese investments for the rest of the year. Yet some are taking the long view.
“There could be delays in new investments or existing investments being topped up this fiscal year,” Balasubramaniam said, adding that the onset of winter will help limit further clashes over territory. “Chinese investments will likely pick up momentum late next year given the current border standoff.”

In the meantime, global investors including private equity firms are driving transactions with India.
KKR & Co. said last week it will acquire a controlling stake in J.B. Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd., while  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) plans to purchase a 20% stake in Indian billionaire Ajay Piramal’s pharmaceutical business.
The country’s antitrust regulator recently approved Facebook’s $5.7 billion investment in Jio, paving the way for a slew of smaller investments in the digital services business.
“We are already witnessing an increased momentum in deal activity and it is likely to accelerate over the next six months,” Rothschild’s Shah said.

(Reuters) - Most ride-hail workers in Seattle are part-time drivers whose earnings are roughly in line with the city's median, a study of data provided by Uber and  Lyft  showed, defying some perceptions of drivers working full-time for little pay. 
The Cornell University study, published on Monday, comes as lawmakers in several U.S. cities and states debate the future of the gig economy and whether workers should be treated as employees rather than independent contractors.
The study examined 14,000 drivers during one week in October 2019 and showed that 75% of Seattle drivers work fewer than 20 hours per week, with only 5% working full-time. The authors say it was the first time real-world data directly provided by  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and Lyft Inc (O:LYFT) has been analyzed. 
The median driver earned roughly $23.30 per hour after expenses and including tips, compared with Seattle's median of roughly $25.50. But 8% of drivers earned less than Seattle's minimum wage of about $16, with that share significantly larger among those who drive only occasionally. 
The companies paid to cover the university's research-associated costs, but did not influence the study's methodology or outcome, Louis Hyman, a Cornell professor and the lead author, said in an interview on Wednesday.
Hyman said the findings surprised him, as he expected most drivers to be seriously underpaid, but added policymakers might consider an earnings floor to address those making below minimum wage.
The Cornell study has been criticized by two researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York's New School, who also analyzed the Seattle ride-hailing market.
Using city data and a driver survey, the researchers found drivers net only about $9.70 an hour, with a third of all drivers working more than 32 hours per week. The researchers said Cornell wrongly included tips and excluded some of the time drivers spend waiting for a trip request.

Hyman responded that the other researchers wrongly calculated tax rates and said his study was based on comprehensive real-world data as opposed to a sample-sized survey.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","TikTok's ad launch faces challenges from U.S. ban threat, hoaxes","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - TikTok’s launch on Wednesday of a new platform to court small business advertisers is fraught with challenges, especially after the Trump administration's threat this week to impose a ban on China-based social media apps.
The new self-service ad platform, which lets companies purchase ads without needing to speak with a sales team, is key to TikTok’s ability to turn its red hot short video sharing app into a viable advertising business. 
But the possible ban floated by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo late on Monday, and new questions about the Chinese-owned company’s ability to control hate speech and misinformation, cloud the launch, ad buyers said.
“The trust issues are there because it’s a new app,” said an executive at a major ad agency, adding TikTok needs to make clear to advertisers what it will do “if the chance is more than zero,” that ads could show up next to harmful content.
The launch coincides with an international backlash against hate speech and misinformation that has proliferated on other services including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), prompting an unprecedented advertising boycott of some of these social media platforms. 
In recent months, the debunked “PizzaGate” conspiracy theory about a child sex ring run out of a Washington pizza parlor by Democratic elites resurfaced on TikTok for a new generation of users, the New York Times reported.
TikTok said it is committed to protecting brands from appearing next to objectionable content through content moderation technology and human moderators. It also said it has never provided user data to the Chinese government and would not do so if asked, when asked about Pompeo's statements.
These issues, along with confusion over TikTok’s benefit for smaller advertisers will need to be resolved if TikTok wants to attract more advertisers, ad agency executives said.
Wednesday’s global launch of the self-serve ad platform, which had previously been in beta testing, will include a music library and video-editing tools to help brands make ads that match the style of TikTok videos. 
The app said it will also provide $100 million in free ad credits globally, which small businesses can apply for as they have been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Our users want to identify with brands, and people identify with their local businesses and local restaurants,” said Blake Chandlee, TikTok's vice president of global business solutions, in an interview with Reuters.
Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, booked $5.6 billion in revenue during its first quarter, with the bulk coming from ads sold on the China-based version of TikTok called Douyin rather than TikTok itself, Reuters reported previously.
TikTok will also face stiff competition from other rivals that appeal to younger audiences such as Snapchat, which has also appealed to small businesses with ""direct response"" ads that are favored by smaller companies. 
Local and smaller businesses favor direct response advertising that encourage sales or website visits. These types of ads can be difficult for social media platforms to develop, said Darren D’Altorio, head of social media at ad agency Wpromote, which counts Instacart and Samsung (KS:005930) as clients.
“I don’t think TikTok is there yet with respect to direct response,” he said.

Snapchat shares surged 9% on Tuesday, long after news of the potential U.S. ban on Chinese apps broke.

Australia’s second-largest pension fund aims to almost halve carbon emissions across its investments within a decade as it joins global peers in mitigating the risks of climate change.
First State Super said it will advocate for Australia’s economy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and replicate the target in its portfolio. The A$120 billion ($83 billion) fund will reduce emissions in its stock holdings by 30% by 2023, divest from thermal coal producers from October and continue to review its energy portfolio to avoid owning so-called stranded assets.
“Divestment from thermal coal mining is an important first step, but we recognize there is more to do,” Chief Executive Officer Deanne Stewart said in a statement. “It is essential that as a responsible owner, super funds set strong, ambitious and transparent targets to deliver the kind of action we need now to prepare for a more prosperous and sustainable future.”
The action plan comes after months of pressure on Australia’s pension funds -- custodians of the world’s fourth-largest pot of retirement savings at A$2.7 trillion -- to follow firms like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Europe’s Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP in cutting exposure to high-emitting companies. Those calls gained traction after the nation’s deadly wildfires heightened concerns about the impact of climate change.

190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Energy Transfer Vows to Keep Pipeline Open After Court Order,"(Bloomberg) -- Two days after a judge ordered the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline to shut by early August, its owner  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP is continuing to schedule shipments and has made no moves to take it offline.
The Dallas-based company run by billionaire Kelcy Warren said Wednesday that it’s not currently emptying the pipeline and, in fact, is accepting requests for shipments next month. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had ordered the pipeline to be drained by Aug. 5 while a more robust environmental review is conducted.
“We are not shutting in the line,” Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in an email when asked if the company had begun emptying it. Judge James E. Boasberg “we believe exceeded his authority and does not have the jurisdiction to shut down the pipeline or stop the flow of crude oil.”
It’s the latest sign that Energy Transfer is preparing for yet another battle over Dakota Access, which four years ago drew months of on-the-ground protests from environmental groups and tribes opposed to the project’s route across Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri River just a half-mile from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the Dakotas.
Later on Wednesday, Energy Transfer pressed Boasberg to freeze his “literally unprecedented” decision until an appeals court can weigh in. The company took aim at both the impacts of the judge’s shutdown order, and his underlying conclusion that federal approval for Dakota Access violated environmental law.
“Energy Transfer is playing a very dangerous game,” said Earthjustice lawyer Jan Hasselman, who represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against Dakota Access. “They don’t get to ignore a federal court order just because they disagree with it.”
Energy Transfer’s strategy likely reflects optimism the ruling will be reversed on appeal or at least temporarily blocked by a higher court.
In Washington, energy lobbyists have mused that the shutdown order would be difficult to enforce, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
Height Securities LLC also predicts the unprecedented ruling to shut down Dakota Access because of a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act is unlikely to withstand review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a research note for clients.
“The D.C. Circuit case law appears weighted in favor of ET,” especially since cases Boasberg used to justify the decision to shut down Dakota Access did not involve active, operating pipelines, Height analyst Josh Price said in the note.
When asked whether Energy Transfer plans to defy Boasberg’s decision if it remains in effect Aug. 5, Granado reiterated that the company doesn’t think he has the authority to shut the line. She later said Energy Transfer’s decision to refrain from emptying the pipeline isn’t meant as an act of defiance, rather the company “is seeking appropriate relief from that order through the established legal process.”
Prices for Bakken crude, produced in North Dakota, rose after the news that Energy Transfer planned to keep the line in service. The discount for Bakken at Clearbrook, Minnesota, narrowed 60 cents to $2.15 a barrel against benchmark oil futures in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Energy Transfer has multiple routine options for fighting the order in court. It’s asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to suspend the decision, and it’s pursuing an appeal. If those efforts fail, it can ask the U.S. Supreme Court to step in.
If Energy Transfer opts to bypass those traditional routes and instead simply refuses to shut down the pipeline, the district court could hold the company in contempt. An outright violation of a court order could result in fines or jail time.

(Reuters) - U.S stocks rose on Wednesday and the Nasdaq hit a record closing high, supported by technology shares as early signs of an economic rebound offset concern about further lockdowns due to a jump in coronavirus cases across the country.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) provided the biggest boosts to the Dow and S&P 500, with the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) up 1.6% and leading sector gains. The Nasdaq outpaced the other two major indexes, ending 1.4% higher, led by Amazon.com (O:AMZN), its fourth record closing high this month.
The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases surpassed 3 million, affecting nearly one of every 100 Americans. California, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas broke their previous daily record highs for new infections.
Investors have been weighing a string of upbeat economic data including record job additions and a rebound in the service sector in June, against the surge in U.S. coronavirus cases recently, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% from its March closing low.
""The market continues to ignore the potential consequences of these spikes in new coronavirus cases,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
""It's overbought,"" he said. ""While I don't expect this market to crash... I think investors at this juncture are playing with fire,"" he said, noting the rise in safe-haven gold prices.  [GOL/]
Adding to the optimistic tone late in the session, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard told CNBC in an interview that U.S. unemployment will likely decline to below 8% ""maybe even 7%"" by the end of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 177.1 points, or 0.68%, to 26,067.28, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 24.62 points, or 0.78%, to 3,169.94 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 148.61 points, or 1.44%, to 10,492.50.
Markets also appeared to be in a wait-and-watch mode before the beginning of the second-quarter earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from the big Wall Street banks.
Quarterly earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to decline nearly 44% year-on-year, the steepest drop since the 2008 financial crisis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) jumped 4.4% after the company said it submitted the marketing application for its experimental Alzheimer's disease therapy, aducanumab.
Allstate Corp (N:ALL) shares fell 4.8% as the U.S. insurer said it would buy National General Holdings Corp (O:NGHC) for about $4 billion, scaling up its auto insurance business. National General shares surged 65.8%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.40 billion shares, compared with the 12.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) deliveries rose 50% in June compared with May and reached their highest level since the coronavirus crisis spread to Europe in March, but the accelerating recovery failed to prevent first-half deliveries from sliding to a 16-year low.
Figures released by the European planemaker late on Wednesday underscored a collapse in aerospace industry fortunes since early this year, hours after Airbus workers facing job cuts staged their first strike in 12 years.
Deliveries rose to 36 aircraft in June from 24 in May and a low of 14 in April. For the first half, deliveries fell by 49% to 196 planes compared with 389 in the same period last year.
Airbus has said it faces an average 40% drop in business over the next two years, forcing it to cut 15,000 jobs, or 11%, of its workforce. Unions oppose compulsory cuts.
Facing a slump in demand, planemakers have been urging airlines to take planes that have already been built in return for agreement to defer others due at later dates.
Some aircraft, however, are going straight into storage because travel demand is recovering slowly, experts say.
June's figures suggested negotiations were partially paying off as Airbus handed over three wide-body A350-900 aircraft for European airlines despite a glut of large jets.
But deliveries of many other wide-body aircraft at Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) remain hampered by weak demand for long-haul travel as a result of the crisis.
Sources said last month that Airbus had sent out dozens of default notices to airlines in a bid to keep deliveries moving.
With airlines focusing on survival, Airbus posted no orders for a second month. 

Gross orders so far this year remained at 365 jets, but net orders adjusted for cancellations slipped by one unit to 298, after lessor Avolon cancelled one of 10 A330neos it has ordered.

193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Virus Spurs Emerging Market Investors to Seek Returns in ESG,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market investors may have identified the rare animal that offers a path to sustainable post-pandemic returns. Now they just need to find it.
The worst crisis since World War II is prompting some fund managers to rethink their strategies in a world with $13 trillion of sub-zero yielding debt and an increasing view that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely. Seeking opportunities in ESG, investments in countries and companies that are improving environmental, social and governance standards, are becoming crucial more than ever as investors navigate the pandemic-stoked market volatility.
“This is a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen and we cannot just go back to our old textbooks anymore that say ‘go buy the dip’,” said Thu Ha Chow, a money manager at Loomis Sayles Investment Asia Pte, who has been investing since Enron’s collapse. “The social and governance elements are going to be more important, but they can be harder to find in emerging markets.”
The conundrum lies in the scarcity of such true assets and the difficulty of identifying them in developing economies.
While ESG-focused developing stocks and bonds have trounced returns of traditional peers as the pandemic raged, they’re a minority across the $28 trillion emerging-market universe. Just $11 billion of the $84 billion raised in bonds this year whose proceeds are applied to projects aimed at helping society came from developing-nation borrowers.
The coronavirus has splintered the world economy, exposing social responsibility and governance fault lines across continents. The fallout has been worse in less developed nations, which typically dedicate about 5% to 6% of GDP to health spending. That’s less than half the 14% average of wealthier countries.
As Brazil and India overtake the likes of Italy and Spain as pandemic centers, funds are scrutinizing the shelf life of their investments as emerging markets face their first annual contraction in six decades.
“We cannot just go back to our old textbooks anymore that say ‘go buy the dip’” -- Thu Ha Chow, Loomis Sayles
The pandemic has “put focus on the critical need to build resilience in healthcare, food and water security, and across supply chains,” Ingrid Kukuljan, head of international impact investing at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) in London, wrote in a note. “We will increasingly see governments transfer funds to the private sector to address these pressing needs, which has proven true during this crisis.”
While such bets have paid off -- a gauge of ESG stocks has gained 3.8% in the past year compared with a 1.1% rise in a broader EM index -- the lack of good research into such assets is hampering the market, money managers say.

Companies and governments in many emerging markets are not legally obliged to disclose as much ESG information as they are in developed nations. This has led to worries that lower standards, or greenwashing by companies that don’t have measurable rules could prove disastrous for investors.
Vale SA’s dam collapse in south-eastern Brazil a year ago unleashed 9.7 million cubic meters of mining sludge that buried part of a town and killed 270 people. The catastrophe wiped out a quarter of the miner’s market value at one point, and has scarred the company’s reputation.
“You need to have your own proprietary fundamental research,” said Claire Peck, an investment specialist in London at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, with $1.9 trillion in assets. “You have to be more research intensive as an investor because of that lack of transparency and also lack of coverage by major ESG providers.”
That analysis has to include not only the social aspects of the investment, but the long-term viability of the financial model.

“There are a lot of solar tech companies for example, but if you look at some of them historically, they have been either frauds or haven’t met their cost of capital,” said Peck. “A business that doesn’t consider the environment is not sustainable, nor is a solar company that cannot meet its cost of capital.”
But doing the research independently adds to the expense, especially as ESG standards stipulated by index providers are constantly changing.
S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is reviewing its sustainability benchmarks to include factors such as flexible work arrangements and a firm’s governance structures for handling sudden risks from medical issues. MSCI Inc. expects its ESG offerings to eventually gain more of a following than traditional benchmarks.
While ESG may be a good long-term bet, the volatility in today’s markets means investors have to be cautious.
“We are looking at some of these longer term trends but also realizing that in the near term, markets are more likely going to be driven by a tweet or the latest development with Covid,” said Karan Talwar, investment specialist in Hong Kong at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management. “Our focus has always been to focus on idiosyncrasies and not paint EM with a broad brush.”
Technology Bridge
One solution to long-term investment gains may lie in stocks and debt of technology assets that are linked to ESG, funds say.
About one billion people in emerging markets already use mobile technology for health care services, according to Loomis Sales. By 2025, 75% of people in such markets may have access to smartphones, fueling a jump not just in ESG, but in industries from education to logistics.
That’s a trend that already existed. Technology and finance stocks tend to make up the biggest weightings in benchmarks such as the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index, accounting for more than a third of the gauge.
“Some of the trends that were happening anyway in markets and in portfolios were strengthened by Covid,” said Andrew Gillan, a money manager at Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) PLC, whose Asia Pacific equity fund has beaten 95% of peers in the last five years. “The winners continue to win in IT, e-commerce.”
Chinese tech behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is one company that is channeling more efforts into ESG, while at the same time benefiting from a move to online economies.
“We clearly can see that the way we do business is changing and becoming more digital,” said Adrian Zuercher, co-head of global asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong. “EM markets which have relied more on natural resources and traditional manufacturing business will face a more uncertain future.”

194,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",Carlos Ghosn's accused smugglers unlikely to win quick bail,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said she is unlikely to quickly release a Massachusetts father and son being held on charges they helped smuggle former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn out of Japan.
At a Wednesday hearing in Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said she was ""anticipating"" denying expedited bail to Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor, who are being housed at the suburban Norfolk County Correctional Center, but would revisit the matter in late July.
The Taylors, who were arrested on May 20, have argued they should be freed because of defects in their arrest warrants and requests they be extradited to Japan.
They have also said 36 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at their jail, and Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, faced an elevated risk because part of his left lung had been removed.
Ghosn had been under house arrest in Japan on financial crimes charges until late December, when he was smuggled in a large black box to a private jet and flown to Beirut, his childhood home.
Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Prosecutors on Tuesday said Ghosn wired $862,500 to a company co-managed by Peter Taylor two months before the escape.
At Wednesday's hearing, federal prosecutor Stephen Hassink said the Taylors' multiple property and familial ties to Lebanon justified their detention.
""These two defendants present probably the greatest risk not only of fleeing, but also being successful in that flight that I've certainly seen in my time arguing for detention,"" Hassink said.
Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for the Taylors, countered that jail was too great a health risk.

""I am not going to be the Dr. Fauci telling Mr. Hassink what the risks are"" of incarceration, Lowell said, referring to top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. ""What we do know is that prisons have been incubators.""

195,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",EU lawmakers back Michaud as executive director of banking watchdog,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Wednesday gave the green light to appointing Francois-Louis Michaud as executive director of the European Union's banking watchdog, overturning a recommendation to reject him.
The parliament's economic affairs committee had narrowly voted last week in favour of rejecting Michaud, with members saying they wanted to see more women appointed to top jobs in the bloc's regulatory bodies.
But in a rare move against a committee, full parliament endorsed the appointment of Michaud, a senior European Central Bank official, as executive director of the European Banking Authority (EBA) by 343 votes to 296, with 56 abstentions.
Green Party lawmaker Sven Giegold said the vote was a blow for gender balance.
Michaud had told a hearing in the economic affairs committee last month that he was fully aware of the need for a better gender balance at EBA, and that he was willing to commit to appointing more female staff at the Paris-based agency.
Michaud was the second candidate for the post after the first candidate, Irish central banker Gerry Cross, was rejected, partly because of a past role with banking lobby AFME.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Nonprofits urge Johnson & Johnson to halt sales of Baby Powder globally,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - More than 170 nonprofit groups on Wednesday called for Johnson & Johnson to stop selling its talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder world-wide, citing concerns that it contains cancer-causing asbestos, according to a statement from advocacy group Black Women for Wellness. 
The groups, which include educational institutions such as Emory University and activist groups such as Greenpeace, among others, also want the company to recall existing inventory in North America. 
Janette Robinson Flint, the executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that J&J's choice to continue marketing baby powder in international markets, often to Black and Brown consumers, contradicts a statement it issued in June committing to fighting racial inequality. 
Johnson & Johnson said in May it would stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, saying demand had fallen in the wake of what it called “misinformation” about the product’s safety amid a barrage of legal challenges.
However, J&J said it would continue to sell its talc-based products in other markets around the world.
“Decades of independent scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,"" J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We continue to offer this product in many other regions around the world where there is higher consumer demand.”
J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters here https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc.
The U.S. drugmaker faces thousands of lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. 

The company said in May that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Federal judge throws out GM's racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday threw out a racketeering lawsuit General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) had filed against smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, saying the No. 1 U.S. automaker's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA's alleged violations.
GM officials said in statement they ""strongly disagree"" with the order by U.S. District Court Judge Paul Borman, whom the automaker had sought to have removed from the case, and would appeal.
""There is more than enough evidence from the guilty pleas of former FCA executives to conclude that the company engaged in racketeering, our complaint was timely and showed in detail how their multi-million dollar bribes caused direct harm to GM,"" GM said in a statement. 
The Detroit company added that Borman's decision ""would let wrongdoers off the hook.""
GM filed the racketeering lawsuit against FCA last November, alleging its rival bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM was seeking ""substantial damages"" that one analyst said could have totaled at least $6 billion. FCA had called the case meritless and asked Borman to dismiss it. 
On Wednesday, Borman dismissed the lawsuit ""with prejudice,"" meaning GM cannot refile the complaint.
""The direct victims of defendants' alleged bribery scheme are FCA's workers,"" Borman wrote of FCA. ""GM's high labor costs were not an injury proximately caused by FCA's bribes, and any competitive injury that GM suffered as a result of FCA's advantage in labor costs is an indirect injury.""
""The dismissal of GM's complaint with prejudice earlier today vindicates our position,"" FCA said in a statement.

On Monday, the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied GM's petition to remove Borman from the case, but said the two automakers' chief executives didn't have to meet to try to settle the case as Borman had ordered. In calling for that, Borman had called the lawsuit ""a waste of time and resources.""

201,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 9,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks turned higher shortly before the close, once again thanks to the tech sector, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) closing at a record.
Coronavirus infections continue to hit records across the U.S., prompting mayors and governors to rollback reopening plans. The U.S. has reported more than 3 million cases of the virus, and more than 131,000 dead.
On Thursday, Walgreens reports earnings. The pharmacy retailer has had to contend with big competition in both the traditional space and with online sales, and its shares have underperformed. Investors do seem interested in biotech, judging from the line-up of new stock debuts this week. And more data on unemployment could give investors some direction.
A big wave of corporate earnings is scheduled to come out next week and the week.
Here are three things that could affect stock markets tomorrow:
1. Walgreens Earnings Could Boost Underperforming Shares
The next two weeks of July will see the bulk of the big company earnings reports, many of them weighed down by the effects of business shut downs during the second quarter. But some consumer-oriented companies felt it less than others.
On Thursday, pharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) is scheduled to report, and analysts tracked by Investing.com expect profit of $1.22 a share on revenue of $34.4 billion.
Walgreens faces stiff competition in the pharmacy sector, going up against  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) as well as e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Investors have worried about Walgreens' ability to compete, pushing its shares down 28% so far this year.
2. Investors Focus on Biotech
 Enzo Biochem Inc  (NYSE:ENZ) jumped 25% in trading on Wednesday after word of the FDA's authorization for emergency use of its Covid-19 test system. That puts the spotlight on this week's IPO calendar, which features three biotech companies. Inventiva, which is listing 7.5 million shares at a range of $14, makes a hepatitis treatment. Nkarta, a cancer drug maker, is listing 10 million shares at up to $16 each, and Poseida, which makes gene therapies, is also listing 10 million shares at up to $16.
It has been a busy calendar for initial public offerings despite the market's zigs and zags this year. Renaissance Capital counted 38 IPOs in the second quarter, raising more than $15 billion in total. That is down from 62 IPOs in the second quarter of last year, when  Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER)r debuted. Healthcare was the most active sector in the three months ending in June.
3. More Unemployment Data Due Out
Also on Thursday, the weekly reading on unemployment comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Initial jobless claims are expected to be 1.4 million, which would be about even with the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 18.9 million, slightly down from earlier.
Jobs trends have been positive as states and cities come back from Covid lockdowns, but some areas have been forced to slow down or reverse reopenings and unemployment remains elevated, at more than 11%.

Investing.com – The Dow rallied as late-buying swept through Wall Street Wednesday, led by tech as investors continue to shrug off rising Covid-19 cases.   
The S&P 500 gained 0.79%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.44% to close at a record high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.69%.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped three million weeks after reaching two million, driven by the rapid spread of the virus in Florida, California and Texas.
The resurgence of the virus has reined in the paced of the economic recovery seen in the previous weeks as some states pause or roll back reopening plans, prompting investors to pull their bets on sectors tied to the progress of the economy.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) pared intraday to end higher after announcing it would cull 36,000 workers, or nearly half of its workforce, when Cares Act funding runs out on Oct. 1.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) also ended above the flatline. 
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, however, calmed some fears about the threat the surge in coronavirus cases poses to the economy and the rapid pace of rehiring seen over the past two months.
U.S. unemployment will likely fall to below 8%, or maybe even 7% by the end of the year, Bullard said in an interview on CNBC, estimating that most employees would be recalled to their jobs in the next 90 days.
A surge in tech stocks powered the broader market higher.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed at all-time highs as Wall Street continued to back the stock on signs of a strong rebound in sales.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Jeriel Ong raised his price target on Apple to $400 from $380, and maintained a buy rating on the stock, citing ""prospects of a V-shaped recovery in Apple sales,"" and App Store revenue strength.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), surged 7% as investors cheered signs that the company is taking steps to boost sales. The social media company posted a job listing for a new team, codenamed Gryphon, that would focus on building a subscription platform.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cut losses to end up 1% as the social media giant appeared to take measures to address recent criticism on its handling over hate speech on its platform.  The social media giant suspended a disinformation network tied to the staff of Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro and removed pages connected to U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone.
Earlier on Wednesday, an audit commissioned by Facebook had found its decisions were causing significant setbacks for civil rights.
In the face of rallying tech stocks, some have warned the sector is running too hot.
""The fact that the NASDAQ continues to press to new highs as broad participation weakens further is a clear and present divergence that needs to be repaired in the weeks ahead. If not, it would point to a bigger correction ahead, in our opinion,""  warned Janney Montgomery Scott's Director of Research, Dan Wantrobski. 
Energy stocks were pushed higher as oil prices rebounded from session lows, shrugging off data showing a surprise weekly build in crude inventories.
Oil stockpiles rose 5.65 million barrels for the week ending July 4, the government agency said Wednesday. Analysts followed by Investing.com had forecast a draw of 3.1 million barrels. Inventories fell 7.1 million barrels the previous week.
In earnings news, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) swung to a loss and reported that sales slumped 62% in the second quarter, as store closures weighed on growth, sending its shares down more than 8.3%.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell about 1.7%, posting back-to-back losses for the first time in three weeks. Tesla bears are starting to cave in the short term after the stock doubled in the past three months, but continue to tout bumpy road ahead for the electric automaker.
""While we still believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued, we see nothing to prevent the shares moving higher in the coming weeks,"" Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note. Tesla could run into trouble, with negative data points expected to arrive in the fourth quarter, Johnson added."
203,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Airbus Sales Drought Worsens With Third Month of Zero Jet Orders,"(Bloomberg) -- Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) failed to secure any aircraft orders for a third month this year, as the collapse in global air travel battered demand for new jetliners.
The European planemaker attracted zero purchases in June, according to a company statement Wednesday. The manufacturer suffered one cancellation, a spokesman confirmed, bringing total net orders to 298 aircraft so far this year.
The tally marks a worsening of the order crunch for Airbus, which had previously managed to avoid losing business by agreeing to defer deliveries as airlines sought to rein in capacity in anticipation of years of sluggish demand. The company handed over 36 aircraft in the month, an improvement on May’s 24 deliveries.
Airbus last week announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs at its jetliner arm after lowering build rates by one-third in April amid the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of the Toulouse, France-based company have slumped 50% this year.
Aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd. said Tuesday it had scrapped a commitment for one A330neo due in 2022, as well as pushing back the arrival of three A320neo-series narrow-bodies. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. took a bigger hit, with Avolon exiting contracts for 27 737 Max planes on top of 75 earlier cancellations.
Boeing has also suffered far more pain overall, with 602 orders lost through May as the grounding of the Max for more than a year allows buyers to walk away without incurring penalties. Boeing’s best-selling jet was banned from the skies in March 2019 after two deadly crashes.
Airbus’s handovers of new jets have been sustained by the adoption of a process that delegates some pre-delivery checks to the manufacturer’s own engineers, overcoming issues with travel curbs.
Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa says Airbus may deliver 603 aircraft this year, falling to 355 in 2021 and 416 in 2022 as the impact of deferrals kicks in. That in turn may force further cuts of around 30% of production, he estimates.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>","Warren Buffett donates $2.9 billion to Gates Foundation, family charities","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has donated roughly $2.9 billion of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) stock to four family charities and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the latest but not largest contribution in his plan to give away his fortune.
In a statement on Wednesday, Berkshire said Buffett's 15th annual donation comprised 15.97 million Class B shares of Berkshire.
It boosted his donations to the charities to more than $37.4 billion since Buffett, who turns 90 on Aug. 30, began giving his Berkshire shares away in 2006. 
Four-fifths of the donations go to the Gates Foundation. The rest goes to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.
Buffett's largest donation was $3.61 billion in 2019, when Berkshire's stock price was higher.
Though Buffett has donated 48% of his Berkshire shares, he still owns 15.5% of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate and controls 31% of its voting power.
Forbes magazine said on Tuesday that Buffett was still worth $71.4 billion, ranking seventh worldwide.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos ranked first at $178.1 billion, while  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates was second.
Gates, a longtime Buffett friend, ended his 16-year run on Berkshire's board this year to focus on his foundation.
Berkshire stock has significantly lagged broader markets in 2019 and 2020.
This is in part because Buffett has not found attractive major acquisitions and financing opportunities for his $440 billion conglomerate, even during the coronavirus pandemic.
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.

It also owns dozens of stocks, including more than $93 billion of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) based on regulatory filings.

Investing.com – The Dow swung between gains and losses on Wednesday as investors continued to back tech while sectors tied to the progress of the economy faltered amid rising Covid-19 cases.   
The S&P 500 gained 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.71% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped three million weeks after reaching two million, driven by the rapid spread of the virus in Florida, California and Texas.
The resurgence of the virus has reined in the paced of the economic recovery seen in the previous weeks as some states pause or roll back reopening plans, prompting investors to pull their bets on sectors tied to the progress of the economy.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) pared intraday and moved into the green losses after announcing it would cull 36,000 workers, or nearly half of its workforce, when Cares Act funding runs out on Oct. 1.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) also traded above the flatline. 
But the resilience in tech continued to prop up the broader market.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit all-time highs as Wall Street continued to back the stock on signs of a strong rebound in sales.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Jeriel Ong raised his price target on Apple to $400 from $380, and maintained a buy rating on the stock, citing ""prospects of a V-shaped recovery in Apple sales,"" and App Store revenue strength.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), surged 6% as investors cheered signs that the company is taking steps to boost sales. The social media company posted a job listing for a new team, codenamed Gryphon, that would focus on building a subscription platform.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), however, turned positive despite ongoing headline risk in the wake an audit commissioned by the social media company found its decisions were causing significant setbacks for civil rights.
But some have warned the tech-heavy rally is running too hot.
""The fact that the NASDAQ continues to press to new highs as broad participation weakens further is a clear and present divergence that needs to be repaired in the weeks ahead. If not, it would point to a bigger correction ahead, in our opinion,""  warned Janney Montgomery Scott's Director of Research, Dan Wantrobski.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","'Weaponized' Facebook fails to protect civil rights, audit says","By Supantha Mukherjee and Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s decisions to allow controversial posts by President Donald Trump established a ""terrible precedent"" that could allow the platform to be ""weaponized to suppress voting,"" an external civil rights audit found on Wednesday.
The report, which Facebook commissioned two years ago, said the social network has not done enough to protect users from discrimination, falsehoods and incitement to violence, adding to pressure on the company in the midst of an advertiser boycott.
The findings come as more than 900 advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc, have joined a boycott started by major U.S. civil rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, to pressure Facebook to take concrete steps to block hate speech.
""Many in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression,"" the auditors wrote.
Facebook has taken a hands-off approach to political speech compared to rivals, notably leaving untouched posts by Trump in recent weeks which were flagged by its rival  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) for falsehoods and incitement of violence.
One Trump tweet, labeled by Twitter as violating its policy against ""glorifying violence,"" said: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""
The auditors expressed ""significant concern"" about the company's steadfast commitment to protect a particular definition of free expression, even where that has meant allowing harmful and divisive rhetoric that amplifies hate speech and threatens civil rights.
By declining to hold politicians to the same rules as everyone else, Facebook created a ""hierarchy of speech"" that ""privileges certain voices"" over others, they wrote.
Racial justice group Color Of Change, which pushed for Facebook to have an audit and helped organize the advertising boycott, said the report correctly assessed the company's approach as ""incremental and counterproductive.""
Muslim Advocates, which also pushed for the audit, said Wednesday it confirmed Facebook enables anti-Muslim violence.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of not fact-checking political ads in a speech at Georgetown University last year where he cited protests against the Vietnam War.
""Allowing the Trump posts to remain establishes a terrible precedent that may lead other politicians and non-politicians to spread false information about legal voting methods, which would effectively allow the platform to be weaponized to suppress voting,"" the auditors said. 
Facebook commissioned the audit in 2018 as part of its response to a range of criticism over issues such as data privacy, voter suppression, incitement of violence and a lack of transparency in political advertising. The audit was led by Laura Murphy, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union's legislative office.
The company did not immediately indicate specific steps it would take in response to the findings but issued a statement attributed to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg describing the audit as a ""really important process for our company.""
""The audit looked at a wide range of civil rights issues, including our policies against hate. There are no quick fixes to these issues — nor should there be,"" Sandberg said. ""What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go.""
She said Facebook would hire a civil rights leader, as previously discussed with ad boycott leaders, but stopped short of their demand that the role be an executive-level position.

Organizers of the advertising boycott met for more than an hour via video conference with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sandberg on Tuesday. After the meeting, activists said they saw ""no commitment to action"" from the company.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Explainer: What 1.1 million foreign students contribute to the U.S. economy,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday that foreign university students will have to leave the country if their classes are all taught online - clouding the future of tens of thousands of enrollees and potentially straining budgets at schools struggling to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic.
About 1.1 million foreign students attended U.S. higher education institutions in the 2018-19 school year, according to a report https://www.iie.org/Why-IIE/Announcements/2019/11/Number-of-International-Students-in-the-United-States-Hits-All-Time-High issued by the State Department and the Institute of International Education (IIE), and they made up 5.5% of the entire U.S. higher education enrollment.
Most U.S. universities have not decided yet whether they will have all online classes, in-person teaching, or some sort of hybrid when classes start again in the fall. 
The immigration order is likely to affect just a fraction of the total number of students. Nevertheless, two top universities went to court on Wednesday to try to stop it.
Foreign students' financial contributions are keenly felt in some schools and communities, where they pay higher tuition bills than some local students, and support real estate markets and local jobs. 
JOBS AND REAL ESTATE 
Foreign students contributed $44.7 billion to the U.S. economy during 2018, the IIE report says, citing the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
They supported https://www.nafsa.org/policy-and-advocacy/policy-resources/nafsa-international-student-economic-value-tool-v2#main-content around 460,000 jobs in the United States in the 2018-19 academic year, estimates NAFSA, an international education advocacy group. The majority of these jobs are in higher education itself, but accommodation, retail, transportation, and health insurance also benefit, it concludes. 
The financial support for these 1.1 million students comes mostly from overseas too, the IIE report says - 57% of foreign students say their primary funding comes from their own personal or family sources, and another 5% from foreign governments, foreign universities, or overseas sponsors. 
China was the largest contributor to the foreign student body in the United States, followed by India and Saudi Arabia, the reports says. 
Chinese real estate purchases hit $30 billion in the twelve months ended March 2018, the National Association of Realtors reports https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-profile-of-international-activity-in-u-s-residential-real-estate-07-17-2019.pdf, but fell to $13.4 billion in the next 12 months, in part because of US-China frictions. About 10% of Chinese purchases were made for student use, the realtor group said, the highest portion for any international buyers. 
REVENUES THAT BENEFIT U.S. STUDENTS 
Foreign students in the United States often pay more to attend school than local students, including paying ""out-of-state"" tuition at publicly-funded state schools and additional charges aimed at oversees entrants. 
These charges brought in more than $10 million in extra annual revenue at Purdue University, a dean told https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/08/some-public-universities-are-charging-differentiated-tuition-rates-or-raising-fees the Institute of Higher Education in 2015. 
Big schools that are household names are likely to have a long waiting list of possible enrollees, available to take the place of any international student, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of government and public affairs for the American Council on Education, which represents schools in Washington, D.C. 

However, he said, ""it’s no secret that many international students pay full tuition, and that this is a source of revenue that enables schools to offer student aid and other discounts to other students.""

210,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rulings due Thursday on Trump financial records cases,"By Lawrence Hurley and Jan Wolfe
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is due on Thursday to rule on President Donald Trump's bid to block his financial records from being obtained by Democratic-led House of Representatives committees and a New York prosecutor.
The court announced on Wednesday that it will issue on Thursday the final rulings of its current term, which began last October. They include three cases focused on Trump's efforts to block subpoenas issued to third parties - not the Republican president himself - to hand over his financial records, which he has fought hard to keep secret through his entire presidency.
Two of the cases involve subpoenas issued by Democratic lawmakers seeking the president's financial records from his longtime accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Capital One. 
The third involves subpoenas issued to Mazars for financial records including nearly a decade of Trump's tax returns to be turned over to a grand jury in New York City as part of a criminal investigation by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat.
It is part of a criminal investigation that began in 2018 into Trump and the Trump Organization spurred by disclosures of hush payments made to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with him. Those women are pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump and his aides have denied the relationships.
Trump, unlike other recent presidents, has refused to release his tax returns and other financial records that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the Trump Organization.

One other ruling is due on Thursday. It involves a case in which a Native American tribe member is challenging his rape conviction by arguing that the location where the crime was committed should have been considered a tribal reservation outside the reach of state criminal law. The ruling could lead to a huge swathe of Oklahoma being recognized as a tribal reservation.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office and the New York field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining whether Wirecard played a role in the alleged conspiracy by serving as both a payment processor and an offshore merchant bank, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The authorities are also considering the possible role of several former or current top Wirecard executives, according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/38FTl6V)
Wirecard filed for insolvency last month, owing creditors 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU secures potential COVID-19 drugs from Roche, Germany's Merck","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has struck deals with drugmakers Roche (S:ROG) and Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) to secure supplies of experimental treatments for COVID-19, a Commission source told Reuters on Wednesday.
The deals cover Roche's arthritis drug RoActemra and Merck's multiple sclerosis drug Rebif - both seen as potential COVID-19 therapies - and will secure supplies for any of the 27 European Union member states wanting to buy them, the source said.
The deals follow requests from EU states in May to acquire the two drugs and come as governments around the world jostle for access to potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, even before their efficacy is proven.
The source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic, did not disclose the terms of the deals. 
Later on Wednesday, Merck said it had been asked by the Commission to be prepared to supply Rebif to EU states ""upon request if and when the indication for COVID-19 treatment is adjudicated.""
Roche also confirmed talks with the EU.
""In ongoing discussions with the European Commission, Roche has committed to meeting the supply needs for eligible patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia in the EU, and around the globe, in an equitable and sustainable manner,"" the Swiss company said in a statement. 
A Commission spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.
Roche is doing a late-stage, 330-patient trial of RoActemra, known as Actemra in some markets, in COVID-19 patents after the anti-inflammatory drug used against rheumatoid arthritis was deployed in China in patients suffering from a severe immune system reaction. Roche said it would share data as soon as possible.
The medicine is also being tested on COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead's (O:GILD) antiviral remdesivir, the only drug so far authorised by the EU for use against COVID-19. Patients are still being recruited, Roche said.
In early June, an Italian trial of Actemra in patients with early-stage COVID-19 showed it failed to help them.
Rebif was developed by Swiss biotech firm Serono before Merck bought the company.
Both drugs target proteins in the body associated with inflammation, and there is some hope they may help severely ill COVID-19 patients suffering from a so-called cytokine storm, an immune system reaction that in can lead to organ failure.
The companies said in letters to the Commission that they could meet demand from EU countries, the source said, declining to name the EU states that had expressed interest in the drugs.
EU countries will now have to agree with the companies on the supplies needed, the source added.
Brussels is also in talks with Gilead to obtain doses of remdesivir for member states and boost its production capacity. It also wants to reserve supplies of vaccines being developed by Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Sanofi (PA:SASY).
In June, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands said they had secured 400 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN).

Concerns over remdesivir's availability were ignited after Gilead pledged almost all its output to the United States.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk approaches a $1.8 billion bonanza,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's blistering stock rally is putting Chief Executive Elon Musk in reach of a payday potentially worth $1.8 billion, his second jackpot from the electric car maker in about two months.
Fueled by stronger-than-expected car deliveries, shares of Tesla have surged over 40% in the past seven sessions, elevating the company's market capitalization to $259 billion. More important for Musk's personal finances, Tesla's six-month average market capitalization has reached a record $138 billion.
Hitting a six-month average market capitalization of $150 billion would trigger the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his 2018 pay package. In early May, Musk's first tranche vested after Tesla's six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion.
(Graphic: Elon Musk's big payday, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxrgbrvx/Pasted%20image%201594224350697.png)
Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla's financial growth that are also required in order to vest the approaching options tranche.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,397, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the upcoming tranche for a combined profit of over $3.5 billion, or $1.8 billion per tranche.
Musk's first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla's stock price.
Tesla has surged 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan.
Tesla last week reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy.
The solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla, and a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500 index.
Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary, only the options in his pay package. A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.

When Tesla unveiled Musk’s pay package, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and also sold shares in secondary offers, including a $2 billion stock sale in February.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants face a reckoning over how Hong Kong's security law will reshape their businesses, with their suspension of processing government requests for user data a stop-gap measure as they weigh options, people close to the industry say.
While Hong Kong is not a significant market for firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter, they have used it as a perch to reach deep-pocketed advertisers in mainland China, where many of their services are blocked. But the companies are now in the cross hairs of a national security law that gives China authority to demand that they turn over user data or censor content seen to violate the law - even when posted from abroad.
""These companies have to totally reassess the liability of having a presence in Hong Kong,"" Charles Mok, a legislator who represents the technology industry in Hong Kong, told Reuters.
If they refuse to cooperate with government requests, he said, authorities ""could go after them and take them to court and fine them, or imprison their principals in Hong Kong"".
Facebook, Google and Twitter have suspended processing government requests for user data in Hong Kong, they said on Monday, following China's imposition of the new national security law on the semi-autonomous city.
Facebook, which started operating in Hong Kong in 2010, last year opened a big new office in the city.
It sells more than $5 billion a year worth of ad space to Chinese businesses and government agencies looking to promote messages abroad, Reuters reported in January. That makes China Facebook's biggest country for revenue after the United States. 
The U.S. internet firms are no strangers to governments demands regarding content and user information, and generally say they are bound by local laws.
The companies have often used a technique known as ""geo-blocking"" to restrict content in a particular country without removing it altogether.
But the sweeping language of Hong Kong's new law could mean such measures won't be enough. Authorities will no longer need to get court orders before requesting assistance or information, analysts said.
Requests for data about overseas users would put the companies in an especially tough spot.
""It's a global law ... if they comply with national security law in Hong Kong then there is the problem that they may violate laws in other countries,"" said Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of Hong Kong's Information Technology Federation.
CONTENT QUESTION
While the U.S. social media services are blocked in mainland China, they have operated freely in Hong Kong.
Other U.S. internet platforms are also rich with content that is banned in mainland China and may now be judged illegal in Hong Kong.
U.S. video streaming site Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), for example, carries ""Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower"", a 2017 documentary on activist Joshua Wong whose books were removed from Hong Kong public libraries last week. 
""Ten Years"", a 2015 film that has been criticised by Chinese state media for portraying a dystopian future Hong Kong under Chinese Communist Party control, is also available on its platform. 
Netflix declined to comment.
Google's YouTube is a popular platform for critics of Beijing. New York-based fugitive tycoon Guo Wengui has regularly voiced support for Hong Kong protesters in his videos. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
None of these companies has yet said how they will handle requests from Hong Kong to block or remove content, and the risk of being caught in political crossfire looms large. 
""The foreign content players have to rethink what they display in Hong Kong,"" said Duncan Clark, chairman at consultancy BDA China. 

""The downside is very big if they get U.S. senators on their backs for accommodating. Any move they make will be heavily scrutinized.""

225,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Bayer puts part of Roundup settlement on hold,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) has agreed to delay part of a proposed settlement of allegations that its widely used weedkiller Roundup caused cancer after a U.S. judge questioned its plan to deal with future claims.
The German company said on Wednesday that lawyers representing those preparing a class action had withdrawn a request for court approval of the $1.25 billion scheme, part of a broader $10.9 billion agreement to settle close to 100,000 U.S. lawsuits related to Roundup.
The move would give the parties more time to address questions raised by Federal District Court Judge Vince Chhabria of the Northern District of California who presides over the federal Roundup litigation, Bayer said in a statement.
""Bayer remains strongly committed to a resolution that simultaneously addresses both the current litigation on reasonable terms and a viable solution to manage and resolve potential future litigation"", it added.
It declined to comment on the impact of the withdrawal on the timetable for the rest of the settlement.
Bayer is seeking to end legal disputes it inherited with its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Bayer shares were down 1.2% by 1307 GMT.
On Tuesday, Bayer (De:BAYGn) shares had fallen more than 6% after Chhabria said that the court was inclined to oppose the part of the proposed settlement that deals with future claims. The case was due to be considered again on July 24.
Bayer had planned to create an independent panel of scientific experts to help assess whether glyphosate caused cancer.
But in a filing published on July 6, Chhabria had questioned the idea of delegating the decision from judges and juries to a panel of scientists.
Chhabria also questioned whether potential claimants would want to remain bound by a ruling reached by the proposed scientific panel if research is still ongoing. 
Regulators including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency, have determined glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic, supporting Bayer's claim that the active ingredient in its Roundup product is safe for agricultural use.

However, in 2015, the World Health Organization's cancer research arm determined the herbicide to be a ""probable carcinogen"", and since 2018, three consecutive U.S. juries, who listened to scientific evidence from both sides during trials, found that Roundup causes cancer.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets bounced back from Tuesday’s losses to open higher on Wednesday, as White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow repeated that the economy will not be shut down again to throttle the recent surge in coronavirus cases.
Kudlow also told CNBC that ""Every piece of data shows a V-shaped recovery"" in the economy, contradicting Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who had warned in more than one appearance earlier in the week that the recovery was in danger of stalling due to the surge in infections.
Kudlow’s commentary on the state of the virus hasn't been foolproof - he famously said that the U.S. had contained it ""pretty close to airtight"" back in March - but his comments were partially vindicated by another 2.2% weekly rise in mortgage applications, further fleshing out the picture of relative health from the housing market.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 123 points, or 0.5%, at 26,014 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. All three indices had registered heavy losses on Tuesday, snapping a five-day winning streak.
Among individual stocks, insurance group Allstate's (NYSE:ALL) stock fell 2.6% to a new three-month low after it agreed to pay $4 billion in cash for smaller rival National General  (NASDAQ:NGHC), a premium of over 60% to Tuesday's closing price that made National General stock the biggest gainer in early trading. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) also rose 4.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it is in talks with creditors to avoid having to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The movie theater operator's performance was kept in check by the WSJ's observation that the debt restructuring being proposed by its biggest creditor is opposed by a group of other bondholders.
At the other end of the spectrum, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) stock fell 7.3% after it reported that sales fell 62% in the three months through June, forcing it to cut some 15% of staff.
Alternative energy vehicle stocks were again in the spotlight, with hydrogen-powered truck venture Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock rising 24% and Chinese battery-powered car maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) rising another 14%. to an all-time high after its better-than-expected sales figures for the second quarter. 
Elsewhere, Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) stock rose 1.9% to its highest in seven weeks as the spot price of gold rose above $1,800 for the first time since 2001. By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), gold was up 1.0% at $1,813.41 a troy ounce.

229,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Retailers Face Unpredictable Back-to-School Shopping Season,"(Bloomberg) -- Parents don’t know when -- or if -- their children will go back to school. This is a big headache for the retailers who rely on them for summer sales of clothes and supplies.
Just over a quarter of parents are unsure when they’ll do their back-to-school shopping this year, according to a new survey from consultancy Deloitte LLP. When they do shop, virtual classes due to the Covid-19 outbreak mean that 40% of parents expect to buy fewer traditional school supplies.
That also means that students at all levels, not just in college, need personal computers. As a result, technology spending for K-12 is expected to rise 28%. That’s expected to underpin a back-to-school season that inches up from last year’s levels, with Deloitte estimating total spending of more than $28 billion.
The trends will likely vary widely depending on local state and county conditions, meaning the 2020 back-to-school season will look a lot different from those of past years. Retailers must stay nimble and provide products “in the right place at the right time,” said Jean-Emmanuel Biondi, a principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP.
Back-to-school spending and summer sales have taken on increased importance for retailers as competition has intensified for the billions that families spend annually on everything from backpacks and tablets to notebooks and shoes. Safety equipment like hand sanitizers and wet wipes are also part of the shopping list this year. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s creation of its mid-summer Prime sale has sparked discounts across the industry.
But uncertainty around the start of classes may change that this year. Forty percent of parents expect to start school shopping four to six weeks before the fall semester begins, Deloitte’s survey found. But many aren’t sure when that will be. So some communities will likely see back-to-school shopping peak at the regular time: late July to early August. For others, the timeline will shift toward the end of August.
Retailers have acknowledged the challenge. Kohl’s Corp., for example, is closely monitoring the landscape. The company is “really making sure we’re ready to respond as we see where the customer goes and what the demands are,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said in an interview last month.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. has created designated sections for teachers and virtual learning tools on its website. The world’s largest retailer is also touting its contactless delivery and ordering options for back-to-school shopping.
High Anxiety
Safety is a key variable: Two-thirds of surveyed parents said they were anxious about sending their child to school amid a pandemic. Stores face a similar dynamic, with nearly one half of shoppers saying they’ll seek options like buying online with in-store pickup. That’s up from 36% in 2019.
This change in consumer behavior could provide a lasting boost to e-commerce. “They might not go back in the stores,” said Rod Sides, Deloitte vice chairman. “That move to digital might be permanent.”
The Deloitte survey took place from May 29-June 5 and polled 1,200 parents with at least one child in grade school in the U.S.

230,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Goldman Warns Investors to Hedge for U.S. Elections Delay,"(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is telling investors to prepare for volatility around the November U.S. election, as the coronavirus adds a “major complication” to tabulating results, with a recommendation to extend hedges out to December expirations.
“Delayed primary results, a precedent for extended vote-counting, and a slightly inverted term structure lead us to prefer December hedges to November hedges,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note dated July 7. “Given the several-week delay in finalizing the results of the 2000 presidential election (in addition to the contentious 1876 election), the elevated volumes of mail-in ballots used in recent primary elections, and potential for increased mail in ballots this November, we see heightened risk that election-related volatility could extend beyond Election Day.”
Current market pricing implies that Democratic challenger Joe Biden will capture the White House, and Democrats will gain control the Senate and retain a majority in the House of Representatives, Kostin said. The current probabilities equal 62% for Biden, 61% for the Senate and 85% for the House, compared with 43% for the White House, 30% for the Senate and 61% for the House in late February, according to Goldman.
That sort of “blue wave” -- with Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House -- or a “red wave” -- with Donald Trump winning re-election, and Republicans retaining the Senate and winning the House -- would be “slightly positive” for stocks, UBS Wealth Management strategists led by Solita Marcelli wrote in a note dated July 6.
The Democrats would focus on economic growth, while Republicans would extend tax cuts, Marcelli said. The status quo of a Trump victory, with the Senate under Republican control and the House in Democratic hands, would be largely neutral. A Biden victory, with a Republican Senate majority, would be neutral to slightly negative, as an expected increase in regulation might hurt growth, but there likely would be constraints on tax hikes, according to the note.
“Most investors should not make major changes to their portfolios in the lead-up to the election, but it is not too early to start incrementally preparing for potential outcomes,” Marcelli recommended.
The UBS strategists cited several potential differences between the candidates: A re-elected Trump “would focus on deregulation, an ‘America first’ approach to international trade, and tax reductions (which may consist of making permanent and perhaps expanding the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act),” they said. Biden “would seek to increase spending on climate change mitigation, expand access to federally funded health care, and raise taxes on corporations and high-income earners.”
With Covid-19 still spreading in many areas of the U.S. and social tensions turning into protests around the country, Trump’s approval ratings have flagged and investors have started to consider more strongly the potential for a Biden victory. A recent RBC Capital Markets survey said investors were more worried about the election than a second wave of coronavirus cases. Trump’s re-election odds stopped moving in tandem with the stock market after the U.S. protests against police brutality and racism.

Unions said up to 8,000 workers were expected to join the action scheduled to last 1.5 hours in Toulouse, France, where employees were preparing to march alongside one of the runways at Toulouse-Blagnac airport overlooked by Airbus headquarters.
The airport was due to remain open.
""Airbus has a real responsibility to get to grips with its restructuring which is excessive and gives a terrible example to suppliers,"" said Jean-Francois Knepper, who represents the Force Ouvriere union.
In Germany, the IG Metall union urged Airbus to avoid forced redundancies at the planemaker or its Premium AEROTEC unit.
Unions have called a wider day of action in French plants on Thursday.
Asked to comment on the protests, Airbus referred back to a statement last week by CEO Guillaume Faury that it was facing the ""gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced"" and was committed to limiting the social impact of its reorganisation.
Airbus has said a third of the 15,000 jobs are set to go in France included 3,378 in the southwestern city of Toulouse where it assembles wide-body jets and some smaller A320s.
Europe's largest aerospace group has historically enjoyed stable labour relations with its unions and strikes are rare. Workers staged a similar protest during a smaller restructuring exercise in 2008, when Airbus avoided compulsory layoffs.

Facing the industry's worst crisis over the impact of worldwide lockdowns, Airbus has refused to rule out forced redundancies this time round but sketched out concessions in return for extensions in furlough schemes and research aid.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Wednesday, rebounding after Tuesday’s losses, but gains are likely to be limited as investors cautiously await the upcoming earrings season while coronavirus cases still mount.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 33 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract rose 10 points, or 0.1%. 
Overnight, U.S. stocks fell, halting a five-day winning streak by the benchmark S&P 500 index, its longest this year. The run has been driven by better-than-expected economic data and extraordinary fiscal and monetary aid from the U.S. authorities.
The second-quarter earnings season begins in earnest next week, and the news isn't likely to be good given the impact of the coronavirus-inspired shutdown during most of this period.
Market data provider Refinitiv predicts earnings from the S&P 500 companies to fall 43% year-on-year in the second quarter. Given the fall in earnings in the year’s opening quarter, this would mean the first earnings recession since the global financial crisis.
Meanwhile the news surrounding the coronavirus continues to be worrying, with the U.S. posting over 60,000 new cases of Covid-19 for the first time and the total topping 3 million. Cases are rising in 41 out of 50 states, with California, Hawaii, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas all beating their previous daily record highs for new cases on Tuesday.
""It will be important to watch the number of U.S. deaths in coming weeks and whether greater questions will be asked about the extent of necessary restrictions,"" said NAB economist Tapas Strickland, in a Reuters report.
In corporate news, retailer Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) is likely to be in focus after reporting a 62% fall in sales in its most recent quarter after the closing bell Tuesday. 
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reports fiscal first-quarter earnings after the close on Wednesday, and these are likely to be adversely affected by store closures because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Oil prices are drifting, despite worries about a smaller than expected decline in U.S. crude oil production in 2020 and a rise in U.S. crude oil stockpiles last week. 
Prices have been held in a narrow range over the past two weeks as concerns about a spike in coronavirus cases globally tempers optimism about a recovery in fuel demand.
The Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventory report is due at 10:30 AM ET. 
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $40.53 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $43.06.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,815.25/oz, climbing above the $1800 level for the first time since November 2011, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1283, up 0.1%.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Cannabis firms see jump in insurance costs to protect leaders as investors sue,"By Shariq Khan and Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian and U.S. cannabis companies are facing a spike in already high costs of insurance to protect top executives from personal liability, following a slew of lawsuits by disgruntled investors alleging fraud and misinformation, with more such action expected.
Some of the biggest cannabis companies, including Medmen Enterprises,  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC), CannTrust Holdings (OTC:CNTTQ), Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc and Columbia Care (OTC:CCHWF), have faced shareholder litigation, accusing leaders of false claims, failing to act in the interest of all shareholders and attempts to defraud investors. 
The lawsuits are yet another sign of souring sentiment against an industry that has failed to deliver on promises of boundless growth. And the rising costs are another headwind for companies already shuttering operations and cutting jobs due to slower-than-expected demand.
""More frequently we’re seeing prospective investors and board members requiring (directors' and officers') coverage in place prior to engaging with a company in order to ensure adequate protection in the event of...litigation,"" said Charles Grodecki, senior vice president at insurance brokerage AmWINS Brokerage of the Carolinas. 
""With claims starting to roll in, we’re beginning to see higher entry-level premiums.""  
Cannabis companies generated a lot of investor excitement in recent years as the drug was legalized for recreational use in Canada and 11 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia. Marijuana is authorized for medical use in many more. 
But investors have faced losses as well as coronavirus-driven market downturns, and they are increasingly likely to target companies and executives who have not delivered on big promises, like cannabis firms, said Ian Stewart, partner at law firm Wilson Elser.
That could drive rates and deductibles higher, with the industry already paying well above what non-cannabis companies pay for similar insurance products.
""We expect a flurry of cases holding directors personally liable,"" Stewart said. 
Avis Bulbulyan of cannabis consultancy Siva Enterprises, estimates a 50% spike in litigation.
A spokeswoman for Canopy declined to comment. Medmen, CannTrust, Aphria and Columbia Care did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF has lost 61% over the past year, while the S&P 500 index is up 6%.
RISING PREMIUMS
Entry-level premiums for directors & officers (D&O) insurance for public companies have more than doubled to $250,000 for $1 million cover over the past year or so, on top of as much as $1 million firms must pay before the coverage kicks in, known as retention, according to AmWINS.
Some insurers have also added exclusionary language specific to cannabis and have raised retention levels, leaving some companies unable to renew policies or forced to choose lower limits with inadequate coverage, said Katie Verry, vice president at broker CRC Insurance Services.
Most major insurers do not offer cannabis D&O policies because cannabis is not legal under U.S. federal law and the nascent industry has increased risks. 
There are even fewer insurers now, said Kirk Miller, executive producer at cannabis risk-management firm Nine Point Strategies. Insurance market Lloyd's of London and the insurance regulator of Bermuda have prohibited insurers from underwriting cannabis coverage in the United States. 
""With both Lloyd's and (insurers from) Bermuda pulling out of the U.S. cannabis market, coupled with the 25+ security class-action lawsuits over the last two-and-a-half years... underwriters' appetite for cannabis is narrowing,"" he said. 
The heavy demand and a dearth of suppliers has kept prices extremely high.
A cannabis D&O policy is about three to seven times more expensive than a company in a decade-old industry, even in Canada where marijuana is federally legal, said Richard McGee, director at cannabis-focused underwriter Next Wave Insurance Canada.
Most of the lawsuits have not yet been heard in court. But a determination of intentional wrongdoing or fraud could remove legal protections against personal liability and trigger insurance exemptions, leaving companies and executives' assets exposed.
In May, law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres named Columbia Care's founders as defendants in a lawsuit on behalf of a group of investors, accusing them of aiding and abetting in fraud.

Sarmad Khojasteh, a partner at the firm, noted by email that laws in Florida and New York do not shield corporate officers from personal liability for negligence or misconduct. Columbia Care did not respond to a request for comment.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",AXA's fund arm sets 33% gender diversity target on company boards,"LONDON (Reuters) - AXA Investment Managers will set a 33% target for gender diversity on listed company boards in developed markets and may vote against companies which fail to meet this mark.
The asset management unit of French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) said on Wednesday it will also introduce a target to have at least one woman on listed company boards in Japan and in emerging markets, or 10% for larger boards.
Britain's finance ministry also has a target of 33% of women in senior management in financial firms, but said last month the pace of hiring women to top jobs was too slow.
The developed market target represents an expansion of AXA IM's existing gender diversity policy and will be introduced next year, it said, adding that the new targets for Japan and emerging markets will be introduced this year.
Yo Takatsuki, head of ESG research and active ownership at AXA IM, said the targets were in line with holding boards of directors ""accountable to best governance standards"".
Gender-diverse boards led to higher profitability and avoided issues of group think, Takatsuki said.
AXA IM can vote against approving a company's report and accounts or the chair of its nomination committee if it decides that not enough has been done to reach its target.
The fund manager said it had voted against 230 resolutions due to gender diversity issues at 186 shareholder meetings in the year to May. It opposed resolutions due to the issue at 245 companies in 2019, compared with 45 in 2018.

Nokia, battling with China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb), is trying to strengthen its 5G slate and looking especially to deployment by U.S. telecom companies for growth.
Overnight, JP Morgan downgraded Nokia to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"", citing a potential loss of business with Verizon. 
""We believe that there is a real risk Verizon will depend less on Nokia as their primary RAN (radio access network) supplier going forward,"" JPM said in a note, adding there were signs Verizon was using Samsung (KS:005930). 
""Consider the JPM report on the Verizon-Nokia situation is based on some facts. So far, Verizon ran some tests with its vendor for its 5G RAN and I've heard that Samsung did better than Nokia,"" said a Seoul-based analyst, who declined to be named. 
Nokia said it continued to work with Verizon in 5G.
""Nokia is proud to serve Verizon, and we are committed to continuing to help them build the best, most reliable and highest performing network,"" Nokia spokesman said. 
Nokia, which axed its dividend after a profit warning last October, has been trying to rein in costs and address delays in shipments as it attempts to keep up with rivals in 5G.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","Big economies face surging debt, have time to put house in order, Barclays says","By Dhara Ranasinghe and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Major developed economies face a surge in debt as the coronavirus crisis sparks massive fiscal stimulus, but they have time to get their houses in order,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said on Wednesday. 
In a new report on debt in developed markets, the British bank added that policymakers won't be able to ignore worsening fiscal profiles for long.
The ratio of debt to gross domestic product for G20 countries is set to rise above World War Two levels in the coming year. Barclays expects the U.S. ratio to rise almost 30 percentage points over the next two years; the euro area's is likely to grow to around 100% in 2020 from about 85% in 2019.
Barclays said the United States is seeing the greatest fiscal deterioration but is ""least likely to face a reckoning"" on its debt levels.
That is because the world's biggest economy enjoys the benefits of having the reserve currency and a large and liquid bond market that's less prone to volatility, Barclays said. 
But the euro zone remains vulnerable, as a monetary union without a fiscal union. 
Italy's debt burden is rising sharply, but its debt trajectory is likely to stabilise at high levels rather than end up on ""unsustainable exponential path"", Barclays said. It expects the country's debt/GDP ratio to reach 165%. 
""The key contributor is the structurally low core interest rates and the ECB's commitment to putting a cap on Italian spreads,"" Barclays said, referring to the European Central Bank's asset-purchase scheme. 
Barclays also said the bar for a new euro zone debt crisis was high versus 2010-12, noting a sharp fall in financing costs. It estimates average nominal yields on sovereign debt have fallen to below 2% from 3.75% in 2010.
But while borrowing costs in the eurozone have fallen broadly, the diverging economic trends between Southern and Northern Europe and its unique monetary system means Europe has to carve out a separate way to reduce overall debt.
Barclays expects redistributing money and credit and pursuing a policy of financial repression by putting a ceiling on bond yields will be the most relevant channels to reduce debt to income levels in highly indebted nations.
For Italy, ""an evolution of partial fiscal transfers and debt mutualisation into a permanent one over time would provide protection in case of more permanent macro shocks in the interest rate environment,"" it said. 
In Britain, Barclays expects debt management to come under greater scrutiny in a post-Brexit environment.

""A belief that the gilt market will passively accept higher borrowings and less fiscal transparency may be an assumption that a future government does not have the luxury of making,"" Barclays said.

242,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","Gold’s Rally to $1,800 Sees ETF Inflows Exceed Full-Year Record","(Bloomberg) -- Gold’s allure is only getting stronger as 2020 unfolds. Spot prices reached $1,800 an ounce and year-to-date inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds have topped the record full-year total set in 2009.
Investors have favored havens this year as the coronavirus pandemic rips through economies, spurring sustained inflows into gold-backed ETFs as central banks and governments unleash vast stimulus programs. States across the U.S. recorded new highs in cases and deaths on Tuesday, and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said the resurgence of the virus may be threatening the pace of America’s recovery.
“A massive investor response to Covid-19 has pushed ETF holdings to record levels, the impact of which has outweighed the decline in jewelry demand and absorbed increases in recycling,” said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Further inflows are expected “as investors respond to elevated risks and low yields,” he said in a note.
Holdings in gold-backed ETFs rose to 3,234.6 tons on Tuesday, according to initial data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up 655.6 tons so far in 2020, topping the rise in tonnage terms seen in 2009. The total has risen each month this year.
Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,798.55 an ounce at 9:36 a.m. in London, after climbing above $1,800 to reach the highest since November 2011. In other precious metals, silver and platinum were higher while palladium was little changed.
Bullion prices and holdings are widely expected to extend gains, with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). saying the metal could reach a record $2,000 in the next 12 months and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. recommending investors stick with bullion.
“Short-term price risks remain skewed to the upside as long as the virus does not come under control,” said Carsten Menke, head of Next Generation Research at Julius Baer Group (OTC:JBAXY) Ltd.
“The near unprecedented fiscal and monetary peacetime response to Covid-19 supplies gold with two substantial bullish inputs: liquidity and debt,” HSBC’s Steel said. “Low interest rates, monetary accommodation including balance-sheet expansion and heavy fiscal spending globally for the foreseeable future will cement and extend gold’s rally.”
More Fed support may be on the way. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said that policy makers would likely turn to additional forward guidance and asset purchases if the economy needs more aid. “There is more that we can do,” he told CNN International.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",Boohoo to review British supply chain after factory allegations,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Online fashion retailer  Boohoo  has commissioned an independent review of its supply chain in Britain focused on areas including compliance with minimum wages and coronavirus rules after a damaging media report about working conditions.
Boohoo (L:BOOH) shares have lost about a third of their value since The Sunday Times reported that workers in a factory in Leicester, central England, who were making clothes destined for Boohoo were paid as little as 3.50 pounds ($4.39) an hour.
Meanwhile, Labour Behind the Label, which campaigns for workers' right, said last week it had received reports of ""workers being forced to come into work while sick with COVID-19, workers wishing to isolate being denied pay, (and) factories operating illegally throughout lockdown"".
Factory conditions in Asia of suppliers to British fast fashion retailers have been in the spotlight for more than a decade, but in recent years the exploitation of low-paid workers in factories in Britain has also come to light.
Shares in Boohoo were down 10% at 0723 GMT on Wednesday after retailers  Next  (L:NXT), Zalando (DE:ZALG) and Amazon (O:AMZN) delisted its products from their websites.
""We are deeply shocked by the recent allegations about the Leicester garment industry,"" CEO John Lyttle said on Wednesday after announcing the review.
This will focus on supplier compliance with minimum wage regulations, compliance with COVID-19 regulations, working hours and record keeping and right to work documentation and contracts of employment, Boohoo said.
The review is being led by senior lawyer Alison Levitt with the board represented by Brian Small, senior independent director of Boohoo, which sells own-brand clothing, shoes and accessories targeted at 16 to 40-year-olds.
""We wish to reiterate how seriously we are taking these matters and we will not hesitate to terminate any relationships where non-compliance with our Code of Conduct is found,"" said Lyttle.
Boohoo has grown rapidly since it was founded by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane in Manchester in 2006 and at Friday's market close its market value was nearly 5 billion pounds, more than double that of Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Britain's largest clothing retailer by sales value.
The firm said it was also accelerating its independent third party supply chain review with ethical audit and compliance specialists, Verisio and Bureau Veritas, and would invest 10 million pounds to tackle the problem.

ZURICH/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) wants to raise its China securities joint venture stake to 100% and increase its market share after getting the regulatory green light to take a majority holding, the head of its Asia business said.
Switzerland's second-largest bank is also looking to hire more staff and invest in China, the world's second-biggest economy, as its most significant business opportunity in the world, its APAC boss Helman Sitohang told Reuters.
China has gained in relevance for Credit Suisse and other international banks after Beijing fast-tracked the opening of its financial markets to foreigner investors.
After gaining 51% control of its securities joint venture in June and appointing Janice Hu as chairwoman, Credit Suisse aims to take on full ownership from Founder Securities as it seeks to build out its private and investment banking businesses.
Credit Suisse has placed great faith in Hu, a ""veteran investment banker"" who has been with it for almost two decades, to grow its business in China, where the timing of it gaining full ownership of the venture is in the hands of regulators.
The bank did not disclose the value of the joint venture.
While it does not break down its business by individual markets, Asia-Pacific accounted for roughly one-fifth of its overall pre-tax income in 2019, with Greater China its most important market in the region.
The bank ranks first in M&A revenues in Asia, excluding Japan, with a 12.4% market share for the first half of 2020, and first in investment banking revenues, with a 8.3% share, Dealogic says. 
In Asia-Pacific Credit Suisse not only competes with larger Zurich rival UBS (S:UBSG), but also with other Swiss private banks including Geneva-based Pictet and listed lender  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) for wealth management business. Meanwhile in investment banking,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) are both major competitors, while Chinese investment bank CITIC Securities counts as a key rival in Asia.
China is producing the most new billionaires and Credit Suisse last month hired a new head of wealth management for onshore China, Jing Wang, from China Merchants Bank.
This followed two senior appointments this year for prime sales, and Credit Suisse is now looking to fill other key positions for its Chinese business over the next few months. ""We will continue to invest across our platforms in China and closely integrate our onshore operations with our businesses in Hong Kong and across the region. There will be more hires, some of which we will announce shortly,"" Sitohang said. 
""It is clearly about tactical hiring: We want to capture opportunities. We know exactly where these are, where we see the potential to improve, and that is what we are focused on,"" the 54-year-old Singaporean native said from his office in Singapore.
HONG KONG HUB 
Hong Kong's future as a global financial centre has been under scrutiny after the mainland Chinese government last month introduced tough new national security laws for the city.
Some analysts suggest investors could shift money to other offshore hubs, like Singapore, to cushion the impact of the growing political and economic uncertainty.
Sitohang reiterated Credit Suisse's commitment to Hong Kong and said it had not registered any outflows.
""Hong Kong has been an important hub for Credit Suisse for decades ... (and) there will be no changes to our presence,"" Sitohang said, adding that it was an ""integral part of our footprint for China overall"".
As well as its role in the largest equity capital markets deal in Hong Kong last year with  Alibaba 's (N:BABA) secondary listing, Sitohang said Credit Suisse did another recently for Netease, (O:NTES) which was about $2.8 billion, as well as ""a couple of large bond deals"".
Credit Suisse has increased the money it manages in the Asia-Pacific region by around a quarter over the last three years to 220 billion Swiss francs ($233 billion) at the end of 2019 before a drop to 197 billion francs in the first quarter due to the coronavirus crisis.
Although ties to  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) -- from whose chairman Credit Suisse is seeking to recoup a more than half-billion dollar loan along with five other banks -- increased the Swiss bank's first quarter provisioning for loan losses, Sitohang is not put off. Credit Suisse would stick by its strategy of acting as a ""bank for entrepreneurs"", managing both the private wealth of rising business people as well as benefiting from their corporate activities through its investment bank, he said.

Germany's No. 2 lender was thrust into turmoil on Friday when chief executive Martin Zielke and supervisory board chairman Stefan Schmittmann said they would step down to give the bank a fresh start.
That followed a public campaign for change by a top investor, the U.S. private equity firm Cerberus.
A top priority for the board is to identify a new chair before moving forward with a CEO search and restructuring, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But some obvious candidates for the seat have taken themselves out of the running, the people said.
The board is expected to rubber-stamp a recommendation to accept the resignation of CEO Martin Zielke, they added.
Amid the leadership void, the bank has put on the back burner a debate about turnaround plans that would see 10,000 job cuts and 500 branch closures, the people said. That would be roughly every fourth job and half of its branches.
Employee representatives have been pushing back on plans to cut jobs.
Stefan Wittmann, a union representative who sits on Commerzbank's supervisory board, told Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday that the bank cannot discuss strategy until the personnel questions are cleared up.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog fined Grant Thornton 3 million pounds ($3.77 million) on Wednesday for ethics failures in relation to its audit of Conviviality, the alcohol retailer which collapsed in 2018.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the fine was reduced to 1.95 million pounds for admissions and early disposal in relation to the audit for the year ending 30 April, 2014.
Grant Thornton was fined 650,000 pounds by the FRC in December 2019 for errors in an audit of a company that the regulator declined to name. It is also being investigated for its audit of British cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.
The watchdog said Grant Thornton had agreed to a package of measures aimed at improving the quality of future audits as a result of the Conviviality action, including the creation of an ethics board.
The firm's failures in ethics were repeated and over three years, resulting in numerous breaches of standards and requirements by the firm’s partners and staff, the FRC said.
Grant Thornton had provided an unqualified or clean audit opinion to Conviviality in circumstances where the threats to independence were such that it should have resigned from the engagement, the FRC said.
Grant Thornton said it accepted there were previously shortcomings in its processes and procedures at the time, but it was confident that such a situation should not arise again.
The watchdog imposed a severe reprimand for misconduct on Natasha Toy, a former senior manager at Grant Thornton.
Toy had been on the team auditing Conviviality, but was then seconded by Conviviality to help prepare its financial statements, contrary to standards for maintaining independence.
Toy had then sought to remove a four and a half hour time entry from the audit file.
The FRC said it recognised Toy's hitherto unblemished disciplinary record, her genuine contrition, and exceptional level of cooperation in the investigation.
Kevin Engel, Grant Thornton's former audit engagement partner who had instructed Toy to delete the hours from the audit file, was banned permanently from signing audit opinions, the FRC said. The ban reflects that Engel has been the subject of previous enforcement action by the FRC.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Wednesday, with investors wary of chasing recent gains ahead of the second-quarter earnings season, while the European Central Bank signals it could now be on hold for some time. 
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.5%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%. 
In an interview with the Financial Times, published Wednesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde signaled the central bank may keep policy unchanged for some time after it almost doubled the size of its pandemic purchase program to 1.35 trillion euro ($1.52 trillion) last month.
There was some positive economic news to digest, as the French economy, the euro zone's second biggest, is set to rebound 19% in the third quarter and a further 3% in the fourth quarter, according to estimates from the INSEE statistics agency Wednesday. 
That said, over the course of the year, INSEE estimated that the economy was set to contract 9%, France's worst recession since modern records began in 1948. 
Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases keep on increasing globally. There are almost 11.8 million COVID-19 cases globally as of July 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data, including - as of Tuesday - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a vocal skeptic of the pandemic.
This has translated into caution on global equity markets. After several days of rallying, much of Wall Street turned lower on Tuesday. Asian markets and now Europe have largely followed suit, with an eye on what is likely to be a dismal earnings season.
“It’s not unusual for stocks to take a breather at this point,” Susan Schmidt, a portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, told Bloomberg. 
“We could see ourselves in a bit of a trading range in the next couple of weeks,” she added.
In corporate news, HSBC (LON:HSBA) stock dropped 3.4%, as the U.S. contemplates measures to sanction banks in Hong Kong after the passing of a new national security law in the city.
 Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) stock slumped 6.8% while facing a backlash from retailers following a report about dire working conditions in an English factory that supplied the popular brand.
On the flip side, Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) stock climbed 5.4% after it reported a smaller second-quarter loss than expected, driven by organic sales growth of 3% in June and successful cost cuts.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, amid worries about a smaller than expected decline in U.S. crude oil production in 2020 and a rise in U.S. crude oil stockpiles. Government data are due later Wednesday. 
At 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $40.58 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $43.05.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",AirAsia in trading halt after auditor flags 'going concern' doubts,"By Jamie Freed and A. Ananthalakshmi
(Reuters) - Shares in Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) were halted on Wednesday after its auditor said there were material uncertainties that cast doubt on the budget carrier's ability to continue as a going concern.
In an unqualified audit opinion on the airline's earnings results for 2019, Ernst & Young PLT said the financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which is dependent upon a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of fundraising efforts.
In response, the airline said in a statement that Malaysia's stock exchange had granted it 12 months relief from being classified as a financially distressed firm - a classification that would require it to submit a business improvement plan.
Malaysia has also extended the relief to other companies who may face a hit to business from the pandemic.
Like airlines around the world, AirAsia has been hit hard by the coronavirus which has decimated travel demand. It posted a first-quarter loss of 803.3 million ringgit ($188 million), its biggest loss for the quarter since its listing in November 2004.
The company said last month it was evaluating proposals for raising capital to strengthen its equity base and liquidity.
AirAsia management has guided that an equity raising via a placement or rights issue looks imminent, Affin Hwang Capital analyst Isaac Chow wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
AirAsia did not comment on the fund raising efforts.
The trading halt is due to be lifted from 2.30 p.m. local time (0630 GMT) on Wednesday, a release to the exchange said.
Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told Reuters in June that the ministry had not provided financial aid to any of the country's airlines and that the airlines have said they ""can do okay, on their own.""
AirAsia said on Monday there were ongoing deliberations for joint ventures and collaborations that might result in additional third-party investments in specific segments of the group's business.
It has also sought payment deferrals from suppliers and lenders and halted all deliveries of Airbus SE (PA:AIR) jets this year as it seeks to cut costs.
AirAsia's shares have halved in value so far this year, giving it a market capitalisation of around $670 million.
Elsewhere in the region,  Thai Airways  International PCL (BK:THAI) and  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) have entered bankruptcy protection due to their inability to pay creditors.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>","As insurers face hefty pandemic losses, newcomers see chance to step in","By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Commercial insurers are facing hefty claims from the coronavirus crisis but are also seeing a steep rise in premiums – tempting companies and industry veterans to raise capital, launch new businesses or expand into new lines.
New insurance ventures sprang up after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The industry is hoping to replicate that process as premiums increase because of the fallout from pandemic.
Convex, a Bermuda and London-based insurer, for example, is launching cover for one of the areas worst hit by the current crisis – event cancellation.
A lot of firms are reducing the amounts of business they do in certain types of insurance, creating space for new entrants, said Convex deputy chief executive Paul Brand. 
John Cavanagh, former head of broker Willis Re and a founder of insurance venture capital firm Beat Capital, is seeking to raise funds in the ""low hundreds of millions of pounds"" from long-term investors for new insurance projects.
“We think the market is presenting sufficient opportunity for us to go out and raise capital - we might have a good five-year run,"" he said.
Cavanagh, who has worked in the industry for 45 years, said 2020 was only the fifth ""hard market"" he had seen, referring to a market in which premiums are rising sharply, rather than staying steady or falling.
Investors' appetite for higher returns when central banks are putting in trillions of dollars in stimulus is attracting them to insurance.
Broker Hyperion estimates around $16 billion in capital has already been raised by insurers this year, compared with $9 billion over the same period last year.
While some of it is defensive, designed to replace lost capital as a result of claims, insurers are also banking on rising prices to recoup some coronavirus-related losses. 
U.S. property reinsurance rates rose by as much as 30% at during renewals in June and July, Willis Re said.
Lloyd's of London insurers Beazley (L:BEZG),  Hiscox  (L:HSX) and Lancashire (L:LRE) are among those to raise equity.
Industry veterans Ed Noonan and Jeff Consolino were drafted in to run insurer StarStone U.S. in a restructuring by parent Enstar (O:ESGR) which includes $610 million in investment from SkyKnight Capital, Dragoneer and Aquiline.
Other veterans are working with private equity firms to raise capital for new insurance ventures, finance industry sources said. One banker estimated the amount to be raised by insurance companies old and new at $20-25 billion.
Insurance rates have often have started to rise before a big crisis, which has then accelerated the trend, industry sources said. 
For an interactive graphic on index of property catastrophe reinsurances rates (Copy) Index of property catastrophe reinsurances rates , click https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/xegvbmbrzpq/index.html
In 2020, steep losses in 2017 and 2018 due to hurricanes and rising litigation awards in recent years had boosted property and casualty insurance rates even before the pandemic struck.
Tatsuhiko Hoshina, the founder and former CEO of Tokio Millennium Re, which launched in 2000, said 2020 was ""probably the greatest opportunity"" for investors in insurance since the period after the 9/11 attacks.
Insurers who specialize in taking over policies closed to new customers and managing them more efficiently also see opportunities.
Tom Booth, chief executive of legacy insurer Darag, highlighted event cancellation, directors' and officers' insurance and business interruption as among the hard-hit sectors which insurers might look to offload.
Insurance hubs Bermuda and London are tipped to attract most of the new businesses. But Brian Schneider, senior director at Fitch Ratings, said new insurers could struggle to get their licenses fast enough to compete with the old hands.
The fact that the pandemic is still unfolding also makes it difficult to judge the losses, with some investors likely awaiting ""greater clarity"", said Michael Butt, chairman of  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS).
The influx of new businesses could also soften the hard market, making it challenging for newcomers to survive.
Out of eight insurers launched in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew, six have since been bought by bigger companies.

""These companies need to be fleet-footed. Risk is protean, it changes all the time,"" said Michael Millette, managing partner of insurance asset manager Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Structured Capital Management.

Investing.com – HSBC (HK:0005) saw its shares fall almost 3% on Wednesday as the U.S. contemplates measures to sanction banks in the city, as well as de-pegging the USD from the Hong Kong dollar.
HSBC shares fell 2.72% to HK$37.60 ($4.851) by 12:53 AM ET (5:53 AM GMT), after recording a 3.1% drop earlier in the day.
Several top advisors to U.S. President Donald Trump have put a proposal on his desk to decouple the dollar and the Hong Kong dollar after the enaction of national security laws in Hong Kong earlier in the month. Although the proposal has yet to reach Trump, it is said to be facing opposition from some parts of the Trump administration who fear that it would hurt Hong Kong banks as well as the U.S., not China.
The Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the greenback has been in place since 1983.
Should the U.S. decide to remove the peg, HSBC would feel the impact more than other banks in the city such as Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). The city’s largest note-issuing bank would face a higher risk if U.S. measures limited its ability to purchase dollars. Although headquartered in London, the bank derives more than 75% of its pre-tax income from Hong Kong.
The bank’s Asia-Pacific CEO Peter Wong expressed support for the laws in June.
Meanwhile, sanctions against entities enacting the laws that were passed by the U.S. Senate at the end of June are also up for Trump's review."

HSBC was specifically mentioned as a potential target after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo last month singled out Peter Wong, the bank’s Asia Pacific chief executive officer, for signing a petition supporting “Beijing’s disastrous decision to destroy Hong Kong’s autonomy,” Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar.
HSBC fell as much as 3.1% in Hong Kong, the most in more than three weeks, making it the biggest drag on the benchmark Hang Seng Index. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman declined to comment on the U.S. report.
London-based HSBC is walking a political tightrope in its attempts to further push into the world’s most populous nation. The bank last month endorsed China’s new security law and is now drawing further criticism from politicians in the U.S. and the U.K.
In a statement on its official WeChat account last month, the bank pledged to continue to invest and support the Chinese economy after speculation in local media that its massive restructuring plan would mean an exit from China.
Some top advisers to President Donald Trump want the U.S. to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar as the administration considers options to punish China for recent moves to chip away at Hong Kong’s political freedoms, according to people familiar with the matter. HSBC is also the largest note-issuing bank in Hong Kong, putting it at more risk than Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. and BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd.
Standard Chartered fell 1.7% as of 10:54 a.m. and BOC Hong Kong lost 1.2%.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Wednesday morning, halting their rally earlier in the week, with investor hopes for a quick economic recovery dimmed by continuous spikes in COVID-19 cases.
Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro became the latest high-profile figure to contract the virus, and Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic warned on Tuesday that the spike in the number of cases has made business owners “nervous again” and that ""there is a real sense this might go on longer than we have planned for.”
There are almost 11.8 million COVID-19 cases globally as of July 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.06% by 10:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT) with the city dealing with a third wave of COVID-19 cases. It reported 14 new cases on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a proposal to decouple the HKD from the dollar is making its way to U.S. President Donald Trump’s desk for review.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.31% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.28%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.27%, with Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura refuting on Wednesday the need to declare a new state of emergency, despite the rising number of cases in the country.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.50%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 slid 0.52%, with Melbourne re-imposing lockdown measures to curb a rise of cases in Australia’s second largest city.
“The second wave of infection will see Victorian economic activity fall sharply and it will continue to lag the rest of Australia,” NAB economist Kaixin Owyong told Reuters.
Other investors struck a more positive note, with the U.S. earnings seasons about to start.
“It’s not unusual for stocks to take a breather at this point,” Susan Schmidt, a portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, told Bloomberg.
“We could see ourselves in a bit of a trading range in the next couple of weeks,” before U.S. earnings season ramps up, she added."
261,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>",U.S. says Ghosn wired money to man who helped him flee Japan,"(Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co chairman, wired $862,500 last year to a company managed by one of the two men who later helped him escape from Japan, U.S. prosecutors said in a Tuesday court filing. 
The disclosure came less than a day after the men, Michael Taylor and his son Peter Taylor, who are trying to avoid extradition to Japan in connection with Ghosn's escape, petitioned a U.S. judge to release them on bail. 
Lawyers for the Taylors said they have been held for more than six weeks at the Norfolk County Correctional Center in Massachusetts, where 36 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19, based on flawed arrest warrants and extradition requests. 
""Neither is a risk of flight and there are undoubtedly conditions under which they can be released,"" the lawyers wrote.
Ghosn fled last December to Beirut from Japan, where he had been under house arrest on charges of financial crimes he has denied, by being smuggled in a box to a private jet.
Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan.
Tuesday's filing in Massachusetts federal court shows wire transfers last October of $540,000 and $322,500 from a bank account in Paris to Promote Fox LLC, a company managed by Peter Taylor and a brother.
The filing does not say how much the Taylors were paid, but prosecutors said it reflects ""additional evidence"" that they have the resources to flee, and should remain detained as ""flight risks.""
Michael Taylor is a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and private security specialist.
In a ruling on Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell rejected the Taylors' bid to quash their arrest warrants, with a written order to follow. He has not ruled on their bail requests.

A lawyer for the Taylors declined to comment on the wire transfers.

262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 10:09PM ET</span>","New Melbourne Lockdown Could Hurt Airport, Hospital Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- A six-week lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne is likely to affect sales and profits for some of Australia’s biggest firms as the nation battles a growing coronavirus outbreak in Victoria state, according to analysts.
Victoria’s government said from midnight Wednesday people in the nation’s second-most populous city must stay home except for work, essential services, medical treatment or school -- returning to curbs that were lifted weeks ago across the country. The re-imposed shutdown could cost the economy A$1 billion ($695 million) a week, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday.
“Since March, the majority of Victorians will have spent more time in lockdown than not when restrictions next ease in August,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote. “The consumer response will be important to watch.”
The Mistakes That Pushed an Australian City Back Into Lockdown
Sydney Airport and Transurban Group are among the stocks most affected, according to RBC Capital Markets. Along with the closure of the shared border between New South Wales and Victoria, the curbs will delay a revival of domestic travel for the airport, the analysts wrote. For toll operator Transurban, the stay-at-home measures could result in a 25-30% decline in Melbourne traffic during this half of the year from the same period in 2019.
Victoria’s daily coronavirus infection count reached a new state record of 191 on Tuesday, taking the national tally to 8,755 cases with 106 deaths, the latter putting it on par with Maine, one of the least-affected U.S. states.
The lockdown could also hamper an earnings recovery for private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care Ltd., J.P. Morgan analysts said. The rise in virus cases has already prompted Melbournians to cancel surgeries, making it unclear whether the company’s Victoria operations could rebound this quarter. The state government is also likely to announce limits for elective surgeries in the coming days, the analysts added.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG downgraded Coca-Cola Amatil (OTC:CCLAY) Ltd. to neutral amid uncertainty around operating performance. The broker said the short-term impact of the Victoria lockdown was “concerning” given that half of the company’s sales come from shops that aren’t grocery stores, and the state represents about a fifth of national beverage consumption.

Florida's coronavirus cases have soared in the last month, with the state's daily count topping 10,000 three times in the last week. The death rate from COVID-19 rose nearly 19% in the last week from the week prior, bringing the state’s death toll to more than 3,800.
Some workers have signed a petition asking Disney to delay Walt Disney World's reopening. The resort, home to the world's most-visited theme parks, was closed to guests in March.
In a statement on Tuesday, Disney's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Pamela Hymel, said new requirements from temperature checks, to face coverings and extra sanitation would enable guests to enjoy Disney World ""responsibly.""

""While COVID-19, and the risk of contracting it, is present in public places, there are many important ways that we can all help promote each other’s safety,"" Hymel said.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has reached settlement agreements in more than 90% of the wrongful death claims filed in federal court after the 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia that killed all 189 people on board, a court filing on Tuesday said.
The fatal crash, followed within five months by another 737 MAX jetliner in Ethiopia, led to the worldwide grounding of the best-selling model and a corporate crisis that has included hundreds of lawsuits alleging the jet was unsafe and separate probes by the Justice Department and U.S. lawmakers. 
Boeing has been racing to clear a number of remaining hurdles to win U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly the MAX again commercially, potentially later this year.
In a filing in federal court in Chicago, Boeing said claims relating to 171 of the 189 people on board the crashed jet have been fully or partially settled. That includes 140 of the 150 claims filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
The company did not disclose how much it paid victims' families or estates. In 2019, Reuters reported that some Lion Air cases had been settled for at least $1.2 million per claim.
A Boeing spokesman said the company remains committed to resolving the remaining cases.
""We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all those onboard Lion Air Flight 610,"" the spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said by email. 
""We are pleased to have made significant progress in recent months in resolving cases brought by the victims' families on terms that we believe fairly compensate them.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The largest U.S. air carriers have all signed letters of intent on federal loans to help them weather the novel coronavirus, with United Airlines warning employees on Tuesday that a surge in outbreaks was hitting bookings, threatening a travel rebound and jobs.
United employees should expect to receive as soon as this week notices about potential furloughs effective Oct. 1, the airline said in a regulatory filing. It expects travel demand to remain depressed until a widely accepted COVID-19 treatment or vaccine is found, with no straight line to an industry recovery.
U.S. airline shares closed 5% lower on Tuesday, with United down 7.6%.
While travel had picked up in some areas over the past two months from pandemic-driven lows in April, United has seen reservations for travel within the coming month slide after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said they would require people arriving from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days.
The slump was most pronounced at United's Newark hub, where near-term net bookings were just about 16% of year-ago levels as of July 1. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the bookings trend was likely much broader than the New York area. 
Andrew Nocella, United's chief commercial officer, told employees at a virtual town hall meeting on Tuesday that its network would be slightly more impacted than other U.S. domestic airlines, sources said after the meeting.
It is among U.S. airlines encouraging employees to accept voluntary departure packages to help prevent tens of thousands of job losses in the fall but said not enough workers have signed up ahead of a July 15 deadline to apply.
U.S. airlines have drastically reduced their flight capacity and rushed to shore up capital while warning that tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk as the industry braces for a slow recovery.
United sees domestic load factors at around 50% in July versus around 80% normally, with international loads around 30%, and will continue to adjust its capacity based on demand.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said last week it may scale back the number of flights it had planned for August. 
United and Delta were among U.S. carriers - along with Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) - that the U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday had signed letters regarding the terms of a $25 billion loan package under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Last week, the department said it had agreed on the terms for government loans under the CARES Act with five other airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
U.S. airlines have already received $25 billion in payroll aid under the CARES Act to protect jobs through September and have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the loan, which would include the issue of warrants and restrictions on executive compensation and share buybacks. 

U.S. unions representing aviation workers have separately asked lawmakers to extend the payroll aid package through March as Congress considers a new round of spending to address coronavirus-related issues and jobs.

(Reuters) - Property data and analytics company CoreLogic rejected an unsolicited $7 billion takeover offer from two investment firms on Tuesday, saying it expected to earn more this year and would buy back more of its stock.
A consortium of  Cannae  Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) Inc and Senator Investment Group last month proposed to buy the company for $65 per share. CoreLogic shares ended trading on Tuesday at $68.67.
""Given CoreLogic’s strong momentum, increasing margins, accelerating growth, and multi-faceted value-creation model, we are unanimous in our belief that CoreLogic will be able to deliver significantly more value to shareholders than this opportunistic proposal,"" CoreLogic chairman Paul Folino said.
CoreLogic noted that Cannae and Senator purchased some shares for more than $68, calling it a sign the investment firms know it is worth more.
CoreLogic raised its full-year 2020 revenue forecast to between $1.84 billion and $1.88 billion from between $1.69 billion and $1.73 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $1.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The new financial guidance reflected market share gains and major new business wins as well as the latest estimates of housing market activity, the company said.
CoreLogic said it had boosted its share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. It also said it adopted a short-term shareholder rights plan which, if implemented, would prevent investors from acquiring 10% or more of its common stock, or 20% in the case of certain passive investors.
Cannae and Senator, which jointly hold an economic interest of roughly 15% in CoreLogic, said they would call a special meeting as early as July 28 to replace the company's board if it did not engage in sale talks. CoreLogic said it was open to meeting with Cannae and Senator.
CoreLogic also said the acquisition offer raised ""serious regulatory concerns"" about overleaps with other companies in which Cannae chairman Bill Foley is involved.
Cannae and Senator said they were willing to provide a ""hell or high water"" commitment to take any action needed to secure regulatory approval.

The company also said it would cut about 700 positions, or roughly 15% of its workforce, in non-retail, non-manufacturing segments that would help it save $100 million annually.
Met with temporary closure of its own stores as well as partner outlets, Levi introduced curbside pickup and started fulfilling online orders at its stores as customers turned to online shopping to avoid contact with people. 
The company reported a 25% increase in its online business in the second quarter ended May 24, with a month-over-month rise of nearly 80% in May.
Levi added that weekly sales performance in company-operated stores was improving sequentially, as productivity in the final week of June reached 80% compared to a year earlier.
Still, Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the early trends.
The company also expects its margins for the rest of the year to be under pressure as it tries to offload excess inventory that remained unsold during the lockdowns.
Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which have lost about a quarter of their value since the start of the year, fell 4% in extended trading.
Net revenue in the second quarter fell 62% to $497.5 million, but beat analysts' expectations of $485.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Levi reported net loss attributable to the company of $363.5 million compared with a profit of $28.2 million, a year earlier, largely due to $242 million in restructuring charges and inventory costs.
On an adjusted basis, the company posted a loss of 48 cents per share, narrower than expectations.

Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) fell 2.5% in after-hours trading.

Cases are rising in 41 out of 50 states, and the U.S. leads the world with about 3 million infected and133,000 killed. Brazil has the second greatest number of infections and deaths, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the virus as insignificant, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSE:EWZ) dropped more than 2%.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. might ban Chinese social media apps such as the popular TikTok, driving shares of rivals Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) higher. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) rose 6.8% on news it is preparing to launch its Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime rival this month.  
Airlines were among the most battered stocks for the day, with United Airlines warning that weaker demand would lead to job cuts in the coming months, sending its shares 7.5% lower. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were all lower. Banks were also down ahead of earnings season, which begins next week. 
Here are three things that might move markets tomorrow:
1. Mexico in the House
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is scheduled to visit his U.S. counterpart on July 8. Amlo, as he is better known, is flying economy to Washington for a two-day summit, The Guardian reported. This will be the Mexican leader’s first foreign trip since taking power in 2018 to commemorate the start of a new free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada.  
The visit comes ahead of the November U.S. presidential election. The visit to Donald Trump, “the most anti-Mexican president in recent memory,” according to Slate, has been met with criticism in Mexico. The trip has been called unnecessary and ill-timed, and an endorsement of Trump that is undeserved.  
2. Has Coronavirus Reality Finally Hit the Market? 
After several days of rallying, much of Wall Street turned lower on Tuesday, wiping out Monday’s gains. Even tech couldn’t save the day, with Nasdaq down 0.9%. The S&P dropped 1.1%. The Dow was down 1.5%, lower for the first time in three days. 
Stocks have seen massive gains since March, with several hitting records, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which closed down on Tuesday. Cities and states across the U.S. have been reversing reopenings to try to prevent the spread of Covid-19, threatening to stunt the recovery that had been starting to show legs.
3. Slow Summer Days
Crude oil inventories are expected to have dropped by more than 3 million barrels when the weekly number is released on July 8. U.S. inventories dropped a surprising 7 million barrels last week ahead of the long July 4 holiday weekend.
 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY)reports earnings after the close on Wednesday. Fiscal first quarter earnings are likely to be affected by store closures because of the coronavirus pandemic, though InvestorPlace points to positive actions taken by the company during the challenging times, including the postponement of $150 million in capital expenditures, suspension of a share repurchase plan and executive salary reductions. BBBY is down more than 34% since the start of 2020.

The S&P 500 lost 1.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.86% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.51%.
Rising cases in 41 out of 50 states have forced pockets of the U.S. to pump the brakes or reverse reopening measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has infected about 3 million and killed 133,000 nationwide.

(Reuters) - Central bank firepower helped stock market bulls finish the first half of 2020 on a high. Now the rally hinges on follow-through in the third-quarter from economic data, company earnings and the coronavirus newsflow.
With central bank and government stimulus approaching $20 trillion, world stocks' 35% collapse between Feb. 20 and March 23 - the swiftest and deepest sell-off since 2008 - has mostly reversed.
Global shares are within 10% of their February record, while the U.S. Nasdaq and China's Shenzen indexes are back at multi-year or record highs. (Graphic: World's biggest stock markets since start of 2020, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwwkrovw/Pasted%20image%201594112037896.png) 
Latest numbers from jobs to manufacturing have kept momentum going. But what comes next is important - for investors as well as possibly for U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election prospects in November. 
Economic data is essentially backward-looking, so April to June figures reflected first big falls, as lockdowns drastically curtailed activity, then a bounceback from March-April troughs. Data from July onwards must confirm whether the rebound is becoming entrenched.
(Graphic: Improving data, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwwldlvw/Pasted%20image%201593707305533.png) 
""For now, markets are still in a sweet spot. It's not until the end of the quarter that we are going to get some visibility,"" said Russell Silberston, co-head of developed markets FX and fixed income at asset manager Ninety One.
Markets risk being sideswiped by bad news, Silbertson said, adding: ""If you believe markets are forward-looking, perhaps they are overly optimistic.""
What complicates the picture is that the figures mostly do not reflect record rises in U.S. infections and renewed lockdowns. 
Extraordinary labour and business support schemes, such as furloughs in Britain or additional cheques for U.S. unemployment, may mask the real state of affairs. Unless renewed, these schemes start to roll off from end-July onwards.
Contrary to common belief, surging stocks and a shrinking economy can go together - past meltdowns attest markets can trough up to six months before crises end. But they do need to see data improving at a steady clip. 
""The rate of change (in data) matters more than the level,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s chief cross-asset strategist, Andrew Sheets. ""Markets have got it right.""
(Graphic: Recovery vs. reality, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwwkdopw/Pasted%20image%201594120791926.png) 
OUTDATED EARNINGS 
It's still tough, for some, to square exalted share prices with the economic outlook. Citi strategists say consensus expectations for end-2021 earnings per share are 30% too high. 
That would imply global equities trading at 24 times forward earnings, rather than 17 times. 
(Graphic: Overvalued?, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoryxxpd/Pasted%20image%201594120992646.png) 
Anyone seeking earnings clarity won't get that from the April-June reporting season starting next week, as that will mostly capture lockdown devastation. U.S. and European Q2 earnings are tipped by Refinitiv to have shrunk 40% and 54% respectively.
Instead investors are anxious for companies to point to signs of improvement in the third quarter, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark.
Markets see 2021 as when ""we'll start to see essential improvements in the economy and from companies. The more that's pushed out, the more difficult it is for the market,"" Krosby said.
Reporting season is important for another reason - Morgan Stanley's Sheets notes that current price/earnings ratios encompass a dire second quarter.
""Just by pressing the send button on Q2 earnings, your future earnings will rise. That will be optically important as we get through July,"" Sheets said.
PANDEMIC VS POLICYMAKERS
There is so far no sign policymakers are ready to hit the brakes on stimulus. In fact, Citi predicts $6 trillion in central bank asset-buying over the coming year.
But the union of monetary and fiscal policy has made the difference, meaning upcoming decisions on initiatives such as U.S. jobless supplements, Britain's furloughs and the EU's 750 billion-euro recovery fund are key.
Perhaps ultimately the number that matters most is the virus count. Half a million people are dead - a fifth of them in the world's biggest economy. Controlling that spread may be what determines Trump's re-election chances. 
For all those reasons, markets are see-sawing between risk-on/risk-off, said David Arnaud, a fund manager at Canada Life Investments.

""The evolution of the virus is what will move markets - it's a simple as that,"" he said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took profits a day after the S&P 500 logged its longest streak of gains this year and as new U.S. coronavirus cases rose further.
Large parts of the United States reported tens of thousands of new coronavirus infections. New York expanded its travel quarantine for visitors from three more states, while Florida's greater Miami area rolled back its reopening.
The Nasdaq was outperforming the other two main indexes, hovering between gains and losses but claiming another record high. Boosting the Nasdaq were shares of technology heavyweights  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
""I'm looking at this simply as a digestion day where investors are sort of regrouping after yesterday's nice, upward move, as well as the advance that we saw last week,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
He noted that the forward price-to-earnings ratio on the market is now at a nearly 50% premium to the 20-year average, based on his data.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have risen in the past five sessions despite an alarming rise in coronavirus cases in the United States as a slew of upbeat data for June bolstered views that an economic recovery is underway.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 242.32 points, or 0.92%, to 26,044.71, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 16.99 points, or 0.53%, to 3,162.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 22.63 points, or 0.22%, to 10,411.03.
The S&P 500 e-minis  triggered a ""golden cross"" pattern on Tuesday, when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average, which could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.
An index of bank stocks <.SPXBK> dropped 3.0%. Travel-related stocks, which were among the hardest hit during lockdowns, also fell. The S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPLCOMAIR> shed 4.5%.
The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Industrials (DJI) have risen about 45% from their March lows and are now about 6% and 11% from their record levels hit in February. The Nasdaq (IXIC) reclaimed its record high last month.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT) jumped 6.2% after a report that the retailer is close to launching its membership program, a direct competitor for Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime service. Amazon shares slipped 1.3%.
 Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX) jumped 29% as the U.S. government awarded $1.6 billion to the drugmaker to cover testing, commercialization and manufacturing of a potential coronavirus vaccine in the country.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Tuesday, as parts of the U.S. continued to roll back reopening measures amid growing coronavirus cases. 
The S&P 500 lost 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.24% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.93%.
Rising cases in 41 out of 50 states have forced pockets of the U.S. to pump the brakes or reverse reopening measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has infected about 3 million and killed 132,000 nationwide.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he would pause efforts to reopen the state after the coronavirus infection rate rose above the key threshold of 1.0.
Other parts of the U.S. have also followed suit, with Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announcing on Monday he would halt the state's third reopening phase that was scheduled to start in mid-July.
The World Health Organisation warned it would not ""be a surprised"" if the global death toll from the coronavirus begins to rise following an increase in infections.
""If you imagine that somewhere in April and May we were dealing with 100,000 cases a day, today we’re dealing with 200,000 cases a day, and that is not purely a result of testing,"" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program said.
The rolling back of reopening plans in some states has proved a major blow to airlines hoping for a rebound in travel demand.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) warned weaker demand would lead to job cuts in the coming months, sending its shares 6% lower.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 6%, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fell 3%. and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was down 5%.
Financials, mostly banks, were also hit hard ahead of the earnings season, which starts in earnest next week. 
JPMorgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down more than 2%.
Tech gave up some gains, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) falling from session highs, adding to the downside in the broader market, 
Elsewhere, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) jumped more than 6% as the supermarket giant is reportedly set to begin a new membership service that rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc reallocated expenses on a $1.9 billion municipal money market fund, a spokesman said, a move akin to the fee waivers that rivals have granted.
Because of Vanguard's client-owned structure it cannot simply waive fees and cover them, the industry's traditional method of protecting investors from low interest rates.
Instead, as yields fall below expenses on the Vanguard Pennsylvania Municipal Money Market Fund, ""expenses of the fund are being temporarily reallocated to other funds within Vanguard,"" company spokesman Freddy Martino said via e-mail.
Vanguard, the world's largest mutual fund manager with some $6 trillion in assets, said in a securities filing late on Monday that it made the change ""to maintain a zero or positive yield for the fund.""
Vanguard is not currently reallocating expenses on other funds, Martino said via e-mail. He also said the reallocated expenses are insignificant in the scale of Vanguard's fund line. ""We therefore do not expect this change to increase expense ratios for any of our other funds,"" he said.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, around 2% at the start of the year, has fallen sharply amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was at 0.6677% at midday Tuesday.
Fee waivers were common during the financial crisis and have returned of late. Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Inc, another large money fund sponsor, said June 26 it reduced fees or payments on 16 funds and trusts ""due to current market conditions.""
A Federated spokesman said it has not outlined what impact the waivers may have on its financial results.
Lower rates also have led Vanguard and rivals to close some money funds to new investors as a way to protect returns for existing ones.
Daniel Wiener, who edits a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said Vanguard's action shows how it has many options for deciding how it charges investors for its products.
""In the scheme of things the reallocated costs are minuscule in comparison to the overall costs but what it tells you is that there is lots of flexibility,"" he said.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 01:31PM ET</span>","Epstein red flags, Russian models land Deutsche Bank $150 million fine","By Jonathan Stempel, Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) will pay a $150 million fine from a New York regulator for allowing disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to make payments to Russian models and withdraw suspicious amounts of cash during five years as a client.
Tuesday's settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services is the first such action against a bank related to Epstein. The registered sex offender committed suicide in a Manhattan jail in August, a month after his arrest for allegedly sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women.
The fine is also another blow to Deutsche Bank's reputation as it goes through a major restructuring, following five years of losses totaling more than 15 billion euros ($17 billion).
""For years, Mr. Epstein's criminal, abusive behavior was widely known, yet big institutions continued to excuse that history and lend their credibility or services for financial gain,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.
New York found ""significant compliance failures"" in Deutsche Bank's dealings with Epstein, who the bank had considered ""high-risk"". It also knew of Epstein's history of sex trafficking and abuse, including his 2007 guilty plea to state prostitution charges, yet ignored these ""red flags"" and processed hundreds of transactions ""obviously implicated"" by his past. 
In its statement New York also criticized unrelated dealings by Germany's largest bank with Danske Bank's Estonia branch, which is embroiled in a massive money laundering scandal, and the Federal Bank of the Middle East.
Epstein was a Deutsche Bank client from August 2013 to December 2018, when the relationship ended after further negative press surfaced about his misconduct.
The transactions processed by the German bank included payments to alleged accomplices, lawyers, victims, Russian models and women with Eastern European surnames, and ""suspicious"" cash withdrawals averaging $200,000 a year.
'NOT SUSPICIOUS'
Email traffic showed that Deutsche Bank weighed the risks of retaining Epstein as a client but put them aside, enticed by the millions of dollars in annual revenue he might generate.
According to a consent order, two Deutsche Bank employees visited Epstein in his New York home in early 2015 and asked about new allegations of sex with underage girls.
But they appeared ""satisfied"" by Epstein's response and did nothing to verify the allegations, the consent order said.
The bank also chose in 2017 not to scrutinize payments to a Russian model and a Russian publicity agent. "" (S)ince this type of activity is normal for this client it is not deemed suspicious,"" a compliance monitor said in an email.
New York said Epstein had more than 40 Deutsche Bank accounts, some of which were for the ""Butterfly Trust"", whose beneficiaries included co-conspirators in alleged sexual abuse.
This created a risk that payments could be used to ""further or coverup criminal activity and perhaps even to endanger more young women,"" the New York settlement, which reflected Deutsche Bank's cooperation over several years, revealed.
Accepting Epstein as a client ""was a critical mistake and should never have happened,"" Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing told staff in a memo.
The New York regulator said Deutsche Bank was also sanctioned for ignoring warning signs while processing billions of euros of payments for Danske Bank, which it ranked as ""high-risk"" in 2007, before shortly afterwards identifying alerts on its foreign customers with Russian or Latvian connections.
The German bank ignored internal warnings of the risks until late 2015, transferring at least $150 billion from Russia and other former Soviet states during that time.
Deutsche Bank also acknowledged deficiencies in its monitoring of Danske Estonia and FBME.
""We all have to help ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again,"" Sewing said.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Brazilian companies join call for action on Amazon deforestation,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A group of 39 companies, including several of Brazil's largest firms, expressed concerns over deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest on Tuesday, following global investor demands that President Jair Bolsonaro end the destruction or risk divestment.
While weaker than the threats from the global investment firms, the joint statement is the first from such a broad and powerful group of Brazilian companies since Bolsonaro became president, and signals that corporate pressure for action is building within the country. 
The rate of destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest climbed 34% in the first five months of the year from a year ago after hitting an 11-year high in 2019, government data shows. 
Environmental advocates blame the expanding destruction on Bolsonaro, who has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region while also deploying the military to fight clear cutting and fires.
The signatories on the statement include many of Brazil's largest listed companies, such as the bank Itau Unibanco (SA:ITUB4), miner Vale (SA:VALE3), brewer Ambev (SA:ABEV3), and state-owned electric utility Eletrobras (SA:ELET6). 
Regional or Brazil chiefs for international companies also signed on, including oil firm Shell (L:RDSa), Microsoft (O:MSFT), agrochemical maker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and commodities trader Cargill.
Seven major European investment firms controlling more than $2 trillion told Reuters last month they will divest from Brazilian assets if they see no progress on stopping Amazon deforestation.
Tuesday's statement did not include an ultimatum, but said the companies were available to work with the government to devise solutions. Strong enforcement of environmental laws is necessary, the companies said.

""This group has been increasingly attentive to and concerned about the impact on businesses of the current negative perception of Brazil's image internationally when it comes to the social and environmental issues in the Amazon,"" they said.

Investing.com -- More ETFs have closed than opened for the first time ever, according to data compiled by Toroso Investments.
Through June 29, 218 exchange traded funds were opened in 2020, compared to 231 that closed, bringing Toroso Investments' KPI for closed versus opened ETFs below one for the past 12 months. That number has forever been above one.
The problem? There are too many ETFs that are too similar, and fee compression is getting to them, according to Dan Weiskopf, a portfolio manager at Toroso whose Twitter handle is @ETFProfessor.
“It’s a sad reality that it’s harder to launch a product today than it was five years ago,” Weiskopf said in a video interview this week. “With fee compression comes a higher probability of failure. You need to get that asset base to get to break-even.”
ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy a basket of stocks rather than an individual stock, with lower risk, but part of the problem right now is that investors are saying they don’t want to pay a lot for access to returns when the S&P 500 is compounding easily at 10%.
“My answer to that is markets are not going to compound at 10% forever,” Weiskopf said.
As a result, he expects the KPI ratio to bounce back above one in the coming weeks and months. Weiskopf also believes the industry is ripe for consolidation, with some firms not fully committed to their ETF platforms.
The ETF market is currently at $4.3 trillion of assets under management. Weiskopf thinks that will rise to $4.5 trillion by year’s end, and he said there are estimates that assets under management will reach between $30 trillion and $50 trillion by 2030."

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Wirecard administrator sees strong interest from potential buyers,"By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wirecard's (DE:WDIG) administrator said on Tuesday that more than 100 investors have expressed interest in buying the collapsed German payments firm's core business and holdings.
The firm filed for insolvency last month owing creditors 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
""The aim is to find timely investor solutions in the interest of creditors, employees and customers,"" administrator Michael Jaffe said in a statement after a creditors meeting.
The potential sale of Wirecard North America's assets was most advanced, Jaffe added, with investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Company already mandated to conduct a sale.
Sale processes are also being initiated for other international holdings as well as Wirecard's core business, he said, adding that most of its customers were being constructive and showing an interest in a speedy sale process.
Jaffe said potential investors would soon be able to start due diligence procedures in virtual data rooms.
Reuters reported on Monday that Jaffe was likely to raise only about 400-500 million euros for Wirecard's assets, citing one person close to the matter. This would be about 10% of the total creditors are owed.
 Deutsche Bank 's (DE:DBKGn) chief executive said on Tuesday it was too early to say how it might help Wirecard Bank, adding that its own exposure to the Wirecard fraud was very limited.
Germany's largest bank said last week that it was working with financial watchdog BaFin and Wirecard's administrator on possible support for Wirecard Bank.
While it was ""too early to judge"" how Deutsche Bank may be involved, CEO Christian Sewing said it was ""almost an obligation"" to look at Wirecard Bank for opportunities or to stabilise it given his company's focus on transaction banking. 
""We all now need transparency and that's the first task,"" Sewing told a webcast event organised by Bloomberg News.
Deutsche Bank said last week that it was ready in principle to support Wirecard Bank ""in the context of a continuation of business operations"" if assistance became necessary.
Separately, European Union finance ministers are due to discuss stronger regulation of payment providers at a meeting this week, a German government official said. 

""Europe-wide rules are urgently required,"" the official added. Germany's regulation of Wirecard has come under intense scrutiny since the rapid demise of the former fintech star.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>","Longer, greener, broader: strategies for a world awash in new bonds","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Century bonds and green bonds, the first 20-year U.S. Treasury issue in decades, securities for mom-and-pop investors and with growth-linked payouts -- a borrowing binge is forcing governments to think creatively to get the funds they need.
Net bond issuance from the United States, euro area and Britain is tipped at around $4.2 trillion this year, as they expand budget spending to battle the coronavirus pandemic. That's roughly equal to their combined debt sales in the previous four years, NatWest Markets estimates.
Much of the supply will be sucked up by central banks buying assets. But governments still need to tap the broadest range of issuance tools to find customers for the sudden pile of new debt and keep funding costs down.
This week, Italy is taking orders from retail investors for a BTP Futura and is considering another such bond this year. Thailand also marketed bonds to retail investors in May, Belgium and Finland have issued dollar bonds and Europe is moving towards a joint bond plan. (Graphic: U.S. and European bond issuance surges, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/nmovajdagpa/eikon.png) 
""The more issuance you have, the more opportunity there is to find different markets -- as long as you can deliver to your core investor base and ensure liquidity there,"" said Lee Cumbes, head of public sector debt, EMEA at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""There is a lot more opportunity now to issue things like dollar bonds, ultra-long debt such as 100-year bonds, inflation-linked bonds.""
Aside from diversifying their investor base, such initiatives reduce pressure on local banks, whose outsize government debt portfolios can be a source of risk during crises.
That's one reason Italy aims to gradually double the amount of sovereign bonds held by small investors. Its BTP Futura includes a ""loyalty premium"" linked to nominal economic growth, payable to those who hold the bond to maturity.
""If your growth rate is strong, you can afford to pay bond holders more, and if growth is weak and you can't, your interest burden falls,"" said Jim Leaviss, head of fixed income at M&G Investments. 
(Graphic: G4 central bank balance sheets, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnzeoxpl/Pasted%20image%201592900329850.png) 
GO LONG 
Austria's 2 billion euros of ""century bonds"" last month took orders for more than nine times that amount. Unsurprising, given that anyone who bought its 100-year issue in 2017 would have doubled their money. 
Long-maturity issues with relatively higher yields are attractive for pension and insurance investors facing over $12 trillion of negative-yielding debt worldwide. 
Governments, meanwhile, can lock in long-term funding at cheap rates - Austria paid a 0.85% coupon. Century bonds could become the norm post-COVID, Kames Capital predicts.
Is the next step perpetual bonds -- with no maturity date and paying interest forever? That's an option the European Union should consider, says financier George Soros, who estimates the bloc can raise a trillion euros at 0.5% annually for perpetuity. 
Others are tapping bits of the curve they have not recently issued -- the U.S. Treasury sold 20-year bonds for the first time since 1986 in May.
THE COLOUR GREEN 
Governments are also successfully tapping into the environmental zeitgeist - the Netherlands' 1.42 billion-euro green bond sold out within four minutes on June 23.
""Although the circumstances are unfortunate that we are facing significant funding needs, it does throw up opportunities for governments to look at themed bonds, green bonds,"" Dutch State Treasury Agency head Elvira Eurlings told a recent conference.
France has just pledged a 15 billion-euro ""green"" funding plan. Germany's first green bond is due in September, to be sold via a syndicate of banks.
To reach more investors and sell big-size debt quickly, Germany's debt office this year resumed using syndications for the first time in five years, rather than rely on auctions.
Aberdeen Standard Investments fund manager Ross Hutchison expects this to become more of ""a permanent feature of the issuance process"". (Graphic: Syndicated bond deals increasingly popular, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/oakveaxkavr/eikon.png) 
Finland meanwhile made greater use of private placements, where a bond is sold to a small group of private investors, in the second quarter. 

""If you look at the supply against their forecast, they've done a little. But if you look at all their private placements, you realise they are close to 80% of their total issuance,"" said John Madziyire, portfolio manager, rates at the Vanguard Fixed Income Group. ""Keeping tabs on stuff like this does add value.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - In Dubai's Atlantis resort, at the head of a palm tree-shaped island, workers in face masks clean cushions, sofas and king-size beds in luxury suites that have largely been vacant since the coronavirus pandemic.
The resort and seven other hotels in the regional tourism hub contacted by Reuters are seeing business pick up as Dubai reopened to foreign visitors on Tuesday, but do not expect a significant increase before the fourth quarter of 2020.
""Bookings have started to increase,"" Tim Kelly, managing director at Atlantis Dubai, said, adding he expected a ""solid"" fourth quarter for the resort, known for its giant aquarium and water slides.
The resort shut in March as the United Arab Emirates imposed a coronavirus lockdown and reopened in mid-May when restrictions started easing gradually. Curfews were fully lifted late last month and commercial business and public venues have reopened.
The coronavirus outbreak delivered a blow to Dubai, one of the most visited cities globally, where tourism accounts for more than 11% of GDP. Dozens of hotels closed while occupancy rates fell to less than 10% in others.
The UAE, of which Dubai is a part, has not yet announced the reopening of its borders to foreign visitors on a federal level. The Gulf state halted commercial passenger flights in March, but last month resumed regular outbound flights for citizens and residents.
Khalifa Bin Braik, managing director of hotels at Majid Al Futtaim Properties, said he expected demand to remain soft in the near-term given continued COVID-19 concerns globally and the seasonal summer lull in the Gulf.
""The majority of bookings at this point are coming from the Middle East and Europe ... we are looking at approximately 25% occupancy at our hotels in Dubai to the end of September,"" he said.
Zeeshan Muhammad, head of marketing for Daytur travel, said confirmed bookings are mainly from 2021 onwards. 
For now, most hotels are betting on staycations by residents like Patrick Affley who usually takes his family home to the United Kingdom for six to eight weeks.

""Unfortunately we can't do that now, so we are making the best of Dubai and all it has to offer,"" Affley said over breakfast with his wife and three children at Atlantis.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government has awarded  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc $1.6 billion to cover testing and manufacturing of a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus in the United States, with the aim of delivering 100 million doses by January.
The award announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the biggest yet from ""Operation Warp Speed,"" the White House initiative aimed at accelerating access to vaccines and treatments to fight COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
Shares in Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Novavax rose 29% to $102 in morning trading.
""What this Warp Speed award does is it pays for production of 100 million doses, which would be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of this year, and may be completed by January or February of next year,"" Novavax Chief Executive Stanley Erck told Reuters. 
It will also cover the cost of running a large Phase III trial, the final stage of human testing.
Erck said Novavax expects results of its Phase I trial testing the vaccine's safety within the next week or so. The company aims to start midstage trials in August or September, with Phase III testing starting in October, Erck added.
The HHS announcement follows a $456 million investment in Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate in March, a $486 million award to  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in April, and up to $1.2 billion in support in May for AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) PLC's vaccine being developed with Oxford University. The U.S. government also awarded Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS) Inc $628 million to expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a potential coronavirus vaccine and drugs to treat COVID-19.
The addition of Novavax's candidate to Operation Warp Speed's portfolio ""increases the odds that we will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.
Besides the massive cash infusion for Novavax, the U.S. government inked a $450 million contract with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) to make and supply its antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
Novavax is somewhat of a dark horse in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. The company was not on the list of vaccine finalists for Warp Speed previously reported by the New York Times that included Moderna, AstraZeneca,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), J&J and Merck & Co.
In May, Novavax received an additional $388 million in funding for COVID-19 vaccine development from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a private foundation, after a $4 million investment in March. In June, the U.S. Defense Department awarded the company $60 million to support manufacturing of 10 million doses of its vaccine in 2020.
'A BIG SCALE UP'
The company is in the process of transferring its vaccine technology to an unnamed contract manufacturer that has two large manufacturing facilities, its CEO said. That is in addition to the work being done by Emergent Biosolutions, which is making doses to supply the company's smaller early and midstage clinical trials.
By early next year, Novavax expects to be able to make 50 million doses a month in the United States.
""It's a big scale up in a few different manufacturing sites in the United States,"" Erck said. ""What it leaves us with is the capacity of making many more doses in the U.S. in 2021."" 
Novavax did not start human safety trials until late May. One reason for the delay is that the vaccine is grown in insect cells, a process that can take 30 days before company scientists can start purifying it and making it in bulk.
""You lose a month or so there, but I don't think we're behind because of our data,"" Erck said, referring to animal data showing a strong immune response and high levels of virus-killing antibodies.
Besides Moderna, the company trails two other candidates - one from AstraZeneca and Oxford University and one from Pfizer and BioNTech.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Jared Holz said the cash infusion ""places Novavax in a very enviable position should its data look compelling later in the year.""
Although Novavax has not yet produced a licensed vaccine, Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA uses the same basic technology to make flu vaccine, ""so the risk of us not succeeding is pretty low,"" Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax, said in a telephone interview.
The Novavax vaccine works in conjunction with an adjuvant - a substance that boosts the immune response to help the body build a robust defense against the virus.
Currently, Novavax makes its adjuvant in Sweden. The company is building up U.S. manufacturing capacity for its adjuvant ""so that we can make upwards of a billion doses of adjuvant in the United States,"" Erck said.
Novavax also has a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic and hopes to have two other plants in Europe and one in Asia, Erck said. The company is also working with a manufacturer in India. The aim there is to make more than 100 million doses a month, Erck said.

Under the contract with Regeneron, signed with the HHS' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Department of Defense, the doses manufactured under the project will be owned by the federal government.
Regeneron's cocktail, REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company and another isolated from recovered COVID-19 patients. Rivals Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and AbbVie (N:ABBV) are also pursuing antibody therapies for the respiratory illness. 
REGN-COV2 is being tested separately for both preventing and treating COVID-19, with a late-stage prevention trial being run jointly with the National Institutes of Health.
The agreement covers a fixed number of bulk lots intended to be completed in the fall of 2020, Regeneron said.
A range of 70,000 to 300,000 potential treatment doses or 420,000 to 1,300,000 prevention doses are expected to be available from these lots, with initial doses to be ready as early as end of summer.
The U.S. government would make the doses available to Americans at no cost, if EUA or product approval is granted, Regeneron said.
Shares of Regeneron were up 1.4% at $636.11. They have risen 67% so far this year.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Moderna spars with U.S. scientists over COVID-19 vaccine trials,"By Marisa Taylor and Robin Respaut
(Reuters) - As the United States accelerates the search for a coronavirus vaccine, tensions have erupted between government scientists and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, one of the leading developers, Reuters has learned.
The federal government is supporting Moderna’s vaccine project with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials.
But the company - which has never produced an approved vaccine or run a large trial - has squabbled with government scientists over the process, delayed delivering trial protocols and resisted experts’ advice on how to run the study, according to three sources familiar with the vaccine project. The sources said those tensions, which have not been previously reported, have contributed to a delay of more than two weeks in launching the trial of the Moderna’s vaccine candidate, now expected in late July.
Moderna “could be on schedule if they were more cooperative,” one of the sources told Reuters.
Some of the disagreements have stoked concerns over the young biotech firm’s relative inexperience and what the sources described as its lack of staff and expertise to oversee the most critical phase of human trials. The U.S. government is not facing similar problems with established drugmakers, such as AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc and Johnson & Johnson, working on other leading vaccine candidates, the sources said.
Moderna and other vaccine developers are working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with networks of immunologists and other vaccine experts tasked by the NIH to help oversee trial design.
Moderna denied any missteps on its part but acknowledged “differences of opinion” with experts involved in the unprecedented effort to deliver on the Trump administration’s pledge to find a vaccine within months. It typically takes about a decade to develop a vaccine - and many efforts fail to produce one at all. Moderna said it has an experienced team that includes people who have run multiple large-scale trials. 
“It has not been smooth or easy,” said Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan. “No one has ever done anything like this before - not Moderna, not the NIH, and not any of the other companies.”
In one disagreement, Moderna executives resisted experts’ insistence on close monitoring of trial participants who might contract COVID-19 for changes in oxygen levels that could signal dangerous complications. While other drugmakers complied, Moderna questioned the recommendation as a “hassle” that slowed development, one of the sources told Reuters. Jordan said the company preferred to defer all decisions about monitoring to patients’ physicians but that the company ultimately agreed to some monitoring.
Despite a bumpy process, Moderna remains ahead of other firms in the race for a vaccine, according to statements from the government and the companies. The firm, founded a decade ago, has outpaced much larger companies despite the steeper challenges Moderna faces in scaling up staff and capacity to create a vaccine at breakneck speed. AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson are also steaming toward their own large-scale trials, but they are behind Moderna in the United States.
Stephen Thomas, a vaccine developer who is chief of infectious diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University, said vaccine development can spark such disagreements even without the pressures of an out-of-control pandemic.
“Those tensions, in and of themselves, don't indicate that Moderna is incapable of doing it,” Thomas said. 
In a statement to Reuters, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) said the government’s collaboration with Moderna, as with all organizations in the project, has been “extremely cooperative.” The agency said Moderna’s vaccine candidate is the most advanced and has shown excellent performance in early trials.
HHS declined to respond to further questions. NIH and the FDA declined to comment.
‘WARP SPEED’
The Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program is run by HHS in partnership with other agencies. It is led by Moncef Slaoui, a former GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) executive who more recently served on Moderna’s board of directors. He stepped down in May to run the government’s COVID-19 vaccine project.
Moderna’s vaccine technology uses genetic material called messenger RNA to instruct human cells to produce coronavirus proteins that prompt an immune response. The firm was picked early by NIH because of its technology’s potential to accelerate development. Moderna developed a vaccine candidate in about two months, making it the first to move to early human testing in a small U.S. trial of healthy volunteers in March.
The NIH had hoped to launch Moderna’s large-scale trial by July 10 but the disputes with the company caused the delay, the sources said. Medical news site STAT first reported the trial delay on Thursday.
The company attributed the delay to the need to accommodate last-minute compromises with the NIH and to allow the government to coordinate trials with multiple drugmakers. Moderna’s Jordan called its interactions with government experts a healthy scientific debate. “There have, of course, been differences of opinion, but we believe there has always been good intent,” he said.
Moderna and other vaccine developers have been given significant control and responsibility over the large-scale, so-called Phase 3 trials by HHS. But Moderna has been less forthcoming than other drugmakers about its plans, the sources said.
Moderna outsourced the handling of data collection to the contract research firm PPD (NASDAQ:PPD) Inc. At one meeting set up with the leading companies and government officials, Moderna did not allow PPD to share details of the trial plans, as other companies had done, the sources said. PPD did not respond to request for comment. 
Moderna disputed that it withheld information, calling the complaint a misunderstanding about the company’s presentation at the meeting, which was not as detailed as others.
Moderna delayed submitting its clinical trial protocols by several weeks, the sources said. The protocols lay out goals and detailed procedures for researchers to manage the trial safely. While Moderna maintained it made the call to delay the trial launch, the sources said Moderna lacked enough staff to complete the protocols on time.
Moderna also initially sought a lower threshold for proving whether its vaccine worked than what was ultimately set by the FDA, one of the sources said. The company says it has aligned with the FDA’s guidance after discussions with the agency. 
One of the sources said such disputes and delays speak to a larger problem in the government’s interactions with Moderna. “They try to test every boundary,” the person said.
HIGH STAKES
The stakes could not be higher for the Trump administration. More than 130,000 Americans have died in the pandemic, and the urgency for a vaccine is growing as coronavirus infection rates rise in 39 states.
HHS awarded Moderna $483 million in April to accelerate vaccine development and manufacturing. The company says it is already gearing up to produce at least 100 million doses this year to ensure supply even before trials prove its vaccine safe and effective.
For Moderna, managing its first large-scale vaccine trial is a critical test of its ability to deliver to the public and investors. Moderna has about 20 potential vaccines and therapies in its pipeline, but none are near regulatory approval. Before its pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine, the company’s largest clinical trial involved about 250 participants, according to the federal government’s database of clinical trials. The large-scale trial for its COVID-19 vaccine will have 30,000 test subjects.
The Cambridge, Mass.-based firm has long been a darling of biotech investors, and its chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, is a master fundraiser. In 2018 the company broke records for launching the industry’s largest initial public offering, valued at $7.5 billion. Moderna’s market capitalization has grown to about $23 billion in recent months amid hopes for its coronavirus vaccine.
Both Bancel and Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks have pocketed tens of millions of dollars since the start of the year by selling shares that have tripled in price on news of Moderna’s development progress, Reuters reported last week. The sales have amounted to $21 million for Bancel and over $35 million for Zaks, who has cashed out the majority of his available stock and options. (For full story click https://reut.rs/38yKm7z )
In May, the company announced that its candidate had appeared safe and produced protective antibodies in a small subset of the healthy volunteers in the first clinical trial. The announcement - which boosted Moderna’s stock by 20% - drew criticism from some scientists who wanted to see the full data. The study results are expected to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
In response, Moderna has said that the company worked “cooperatively” with NIH to properly characterize the early data. 
Bancel has consistently cast the company’s messenger RNA technology - which he calls the “software of life” - as a breakthrough in both the speed and effectiveness of vaccine development. “We are not aware of anybody else who can do this at this scale, with this focus, at this speed,” he told investors in June. Bancel has said that the company could have the data to prove its vaccine’s effectiveness by November. 
“The Moderna CEO has been very brash about his company’s technology,” said Peter Pitts, former FDA associate commissioner from 2002 to 2004 and now president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a New York-based research and educational organization. In vaccine development, he said, “often the higher the boasting, the lower the chance of actual success.”
Such overconfidence, Pitts said, can damage public health by signaling that strict precautions, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, may not be as necessary. “If you give the impression that the problem is solved, it’s dangerous,” he said. “People think the vaccine is just around the corner.”
Moderna’s Jordan said the company invites the comparison of its public statements with its results. 

“Our statements about the future potential of our platform must be held up against the clinical data as it emerges,” Jordan said. “We believe that, to date, they have.”

305,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 09:39AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Pares Losses as Citi Raises S&P Target,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early losses to be mixed after early trading on Tuesday, giving up some of the sharp gains posted on Monday but still holding up despite concern about the risk to the economy from a second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
By 14:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was building on Monday’s record-high close, rising 0.4%.
The S&P has been on a five-day winning streak, while the Nasdaq’s new record, fueled by outlandish gains in stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has prompted fears that the market has run too far ahead of economic reality. 
Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic warned in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday that the recovery was in danger of stalling because of the surge in new infections across the south and west. Bostic, whose district includes Florida, said there were ""troubling"" signs from high-frequency data that ""might suggest that the trajectory of this recovery is going to be a bit bumpier than it might otherwise (be)."" His comments chimed with others from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) investment bank, whose analysts had also pointed to a levelling-off of high-frequency data such as mobility app readings.
Early jitters were eased somewhat by reports that  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) had raised its year-end target for the S&P 500, citing ""incessant"" support from the Federal Reserve. Beyond the headlines, some may have missed that the new target of 2,900 is more than 10% below the index's current level. 
""With a central bank ready to comment or act on any pullback, the plausibility of retesting the March lows seems slim,"" Citi's analysts said.
Among individual stocks, Tesla rose another 0.8% for a gain of 28% over the last week that owed much to delivery figures for the second quarter that were some 25% above expectations. The group's financial results are due in two weeks' time. Internal memos that have leaked in the last couple of weeks suggest that the company was still struggling to break even. Tesla's market value is now over $254 billion. Even on the assumption of JMP Securities that Tesla is on track to have annual revenue of $100 billion by 2025 - that is, four times 2019's revenue - that still prices the company at 2.5 times its expected 2025 sales. 
Elsewhere Tuesday.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose by nearly one-third after the government awarded it  $1.6 billion to help its efforts to find a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus, while Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) stock rose 3.4% to a new record high after winning a $450 million contract from the same government program. "
306,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",Vanguard Trounces BlackRock for ETF Flows in Volatile First Half,"(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group’s U.S. exchange-traded funds attracted inflows of about $89 billion in the first half, surging ahead of industry leader BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). in a volatile period.
BlackRock took in an estimated $38 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data, as market swings fueled by the coronavirus crisis spurred selling from the types of active traders who favor the iShares lineup. Vanguard’s dominance contrasts with the first half of 2019, when BlackRock led its main rival by about $1.9 billion.
“Vanguard is more focused on these types of products which are designed to cater to long-term, buy-and-hold investors,” said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies and research for North America at Morningstar Inc. Such customers “likely aren’t looking to make tactical adjustments based on what’s going on in the market,” he said.
The flows strike a blow for Vanguard in the increasingly fierce battle to dominate a more than $4 trillion market. BlackRock became the fund industry leader with its acquisition of the iShares lineup more than a decade ago, but Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate it could be overtaken in size by its chief competitor within 10 years -- or faster in an extended downturn.
BlackRock said market upheaval underscores the value of its lineup.
“When investors needed to rapidly reposition their equity portfolios in light of economic uncertainty and record volatility, they turned to iShares,” said Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. “The same is true when they needed liquidity and transparency in fixed-income markets. IShares’ ETFs repeatedly demonstrated their versatility and resilience this year.”
A “distribution bump” from the commission-free trading trend that took hold late last year also may be benefiting Vanguard, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote last month. The index-investing pioneer, known for its low costs, tends to win whenever it gets on an even playing field, according to the report.
BlackRock’s annual U.S. ETF flows were greater than Vanguard’s from 2014 through 2019, according to Bloomberg data. It still reigns in assets, with iShares accounting for about 38% of the U.S. ETF market, compared with 27% for Vanguard’s offerings.
And it hasn’t taken the fight for customers sitting down. The firm lowered fees on three U.S. equity ETFs in June. That included reducing what it charges for its largest such product, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, to 3 cents per $100 invested from 4 cents. The key differentiator for broad market-tracking products such as the Core S&P 500 ETF can often be fees, Bryan said.
Vanguard’s ETF cash flow this year is “a testament to our investors’ resolve,” said Rich Powers, head of ETF product management at the Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm.
“They’ve maintained discipline, continuing to work towards savings goals in the face of extreme market volatility,” Powers said. Demand has increased from “all types of investors, but particularly by financial advisers that prefer a low-cost, broadly diversified portfolio with intraday liquidity and tight spreads.”
But Vanguard’s ETF inflows were coupled with outflows from its long-term mutual funds. Driven by withdrawals during the market swoon in March, the funds had more than $20 billion in net redemptions this year through May.
Vanguard structures its ETFs as an arm of its mutual funds, a format it patented. The firm’s ETF lineup may be poised to see another bump in the near future. Vanguard plans to convert some mutual fund holdings to lower-cost ETF shares for clients of its advisory business, spokesman Freddy Martino confirmed.

307,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Retail Investors Who Bought June Dip Favored Back-to-Work Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Main Street investors appear united in their vision for economic recovery, emptying their pockets amid the June selloff in anticipation of a prompt return to normal.
Data from TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) showed clients used last month’s volatility to increase their exposure to stocks, lifting the firm’s Investor Movement Index. The biggest jump in holdings came in companies that benefit from an increase in economic activity, like makers of non-essential consumer goods, construction firms, plane builders and banks. Robinhood investors piled into the FAANG-plus-Microsoft group of tech megacaps, adding 330,000 accounts.
It was a bet that so far has paid off even as volatility increased with concern the resurgence of the virus will hamstring the economic recovery. Since a 6% rout on June 11 that wiped out $1.6 trillion in value, the S&P 500 has rallied 6%. Consumer discretionary and tech shares have led the way, jumping at least 9%.
“The dip was met with buying, not with fear,” JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “They believe domestically things will start to return. Domestic travel and the domestic economy have a chance to start to return to more normal levels.”
The S&P 500 jumped 1.6% Monday to close at the highest in almost a month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes added more than 2%. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). closed at a record, with a market value above $1.5 trillion for the first time. Futures slumped Tuesday, indicating a lower open.
While some degree of controversy exists over the degree of market influence retail investors have, their prescience in timing the March bottom has turned them into a cohort that has become closely watched as brokerages from TD to E*Trade and Robinhood have seen record new account openings.
Zero-fee trading has certainly attracted clients, but so has the economic lockdown, which left Americans unable to bet on sporting events or go to casinos. Undeterred by the fastest 30% drop on record, they enjoyed the fastest 50-day rally in nine decades. Pullbacks of 5% have become can’t-miss buying opportunities.
“People are looking at the U.S. equity market and seeing the rebound, and they want a piece of that,” said Anna Han, an equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. “They want a bite of that. For those who do have a little money to spend, maybe because they haven’t been spending at restaurants, out at bars or traveling as they normally do, you can see them putting that money to work and willing to take a little bit of that risk.”
During June, TD data show travel companies including Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. drew the most new buys, underscoring confidence that travel will return toward normal sooner than later even as the virus flared up in large parts of the South and West.
The group known as FAANGM -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- enjoyed the stay-at-home rally that began in March and remained attractive at Robinhood as investors bet on their win-in-any-economy appeal. Amazon and Apple were among the top 5 buys. Facebook and Netflix made the top 50.
Here, too, the bets have paid off. So big has the group’s rally become that even before Monday’s gain, the six companies accounted for a record one-quarter of the S&P 500’s market cap, according to Ed Yardeni of his namesake research firm. The six companies have been among the biggest winners since the virus struck, he noted.
They “are likely to continue to benefit from its aftershocks well after the crisis is over,” Yardeni said in a note to clients. “That’s because their businesses are Internet-based, so the more that people’s work, education, and entertainment are home-based, the more these businesses thrive.”

The closure of the Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund follows losses of 23% in the January-June period. It earned returns of 1.3% in 2019 and losses of 7% in 2018, said the source.

In a letter to investors, first reported by Institutional Investor late on Monday, Lansdowne said the restructuring would kick into effect on Oct. 1 and investors could shift their allocation to its Developed Markets Long Only Fund or the new Opportunities Fund.
The $1.12 billion long-only strategy was down 26.5% in the year to June 30, the source said. It made 18.6% in 2019 and lost 11.8% in 2018, according to data compiled by HSBC and seen by Reuters.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Tuesday further expanded delivery offerings, launching an app-based grocery service in several Latin American and Canadian cities, with the United States to follow later this month.
The company's latest foray into the delivery space is in partnership with Cornershop, a Chilean online grocery provider that Uber has held a majority stake in since October.
Customers in Canada's Montreal and Toronto, eleven Brazilian cities, including Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, four Chilean cities, Colombia's Bogota and Peru's Lima will be able to order groceries from local stores and chains through the Uber Eats app.
In Canada, groceries can be ordered from large chains Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Metro Inc.
A launch in U.S. cities is expected later in July, beginning with regional merchants in Miami and Dallas, an Uber spokeswoman said.
Uber said it had some 9,500 active merchants, with grocery-convenience orders increasing by more than 176% since February across the Uber platform.
Uber's grocery delivery push comes at a time when its core ride-hailing business is under pressure around the globe with coronavirus lockdown orders keeping many passengers at home. 
At the same time, Uber's restaurant delivery business Eats has seen growing demand during the pandemic, with second-quarter food delivery orders up more than 100%.

Uber on Monday said it would acquire U.S. food delivery rival Postmates for $2.65 billion to significantly increase the business of supplying everyday goods, including groceries.

LONDON (Reuters) - A five-day charge by world stocks fizzled on Tuesday as caution about renewed coronavirus lockdowns took hold again, though it was not enough to douse China's July hot streak. 
London, Paris and Frankfurt were down around 1% by early afternoon and Wall Street looked set for a drop, too, as investors shifted back into the dollar and government bonds. 
Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul all lost ground in Asian trading. Shanghai's blue-chip index was sputtering by the close after adding to its 15% gains over the past week. 
New coronavirus cases have surged in several U.S. states, forcing some restaurants and bars to close again, in a setback to the budding recovery that had been propelling risk assets.
Lockdown measures were also reimposed in Melbourne, Australia, confining its nearly 5 million residents to all but essential travel for another six weeks. 
The move was announced just before the state border between Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, and New South Wales, which contains Sydney, is scheduled to close. 
""Just when many parts of the world looked to have got to grips with the coronavirus pandemic, many jurisdictions re-imposed lockdowns to contain a surge in new cases,"" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.
Corporate earnings are expected to fall by about 20% percent this year following the deepest recession in more than a century. Pictet expects a 30% to 40% slump.
""But that does not mean equity and corporate bond markets are due a sharp fall,"" Paolini said, predicting the U.S. Federal Reserve will inject another $1.3 trillion of stimulus this year and the European Central Bank will add another 1.1 trillion euros ($1.24 trillion).
The euro zone economy will drop into a deeper recession this year than previously thought and take longer to rebound, the European Commission forecast on Tuesday. France, Italy and Spain are struggling the most.
Expectations are for a record 8.7% slump, then a 6.1% recovery in 2021. In early May, the commission had forecast a 2020 downturn of 7.7% and a 2021 rebound of 6.3%. 
Analysts said signals from the Chinese government through a state-sponsored journal on ""fostering a healthy bull market"", published on Monday, had helped the buying binge in Chinese shares.
The current China rally has echoes of the past, especially during 2007 and in 2015, which was largely driven by Chinese retail investors.
""Shades of John F. Kennedy's 'Ask not what your country can do for you' inauguration speech here and as close as you might get to a Chinese government 'put' as anything the Fed has done to date vis-à-vis the U.S. stock (and credit) markets,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB, in a research note. 
A rebound in U.S. services in June, almost returning to pre-pandemic levels, had also helped to whet investors' risk appetite.

TROUBLING TIMES
In the currency market, the Chinese yuan edged to its highest levels in nearly four months. The renminbi rose 0.1% to 7.0115 per dollar though it was a small-scale move compared to Monday's near 1% jump.
""The yuan is supported by the risk-on mood in the Chinese share market despite lingering uncertainties over the U.S.-China relations and an anticipated slow pace of recovery,"" said Ei Kaku, senior strategist at Nomura Securities.
Other major currencies were struggling as the dollar regained traction. The yen was flat at 107.41 to the dollar, the euro slipped back to $1.1275 and the Aussie dollar dropped 0.5% after headlines of Melbourne's lockdown..
Gold dipped but was still near an eight-year peak at $1,776 per ounce. Copper was weaker in London trading, having hit a five-month high as part of the China charge in Asia. 
Oil prices were also struggling. Brent crude lost nearly 1% to $42.69 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell to $40.24.
With 16 U.S. states reporting record increases in new COVID-19 case in the first five days of July, according to a Reuters tally, there is renewed concern about demand for fuel in the world's biggest oil-consuming country.
Florida is reintroducing some limits on economic re-openings to grapple with rising cases. California and Texas, two of the most populous and economically crucial U.S. states, are also reporting high infection rates.
""There are a couple of things that we are seeing, and some of them are troubling and might suggest that the trajectory of this recovery is going to be a bit bumpier than it might otherwise,"" Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic told the Financial Times.
The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has now topped 130,000, Reuters calculations show.

315,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Consolidate After Sharp Gains; Dow Futures Down 280,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Tuesday, consolidating after recent strong gains as investors wait for more information on the economy, the spread of coronavirus and corporate earnings.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 29 points, or 0.9%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 54 points, or 0.5%. The Dow Futures contract fell 279 points, or 1.1%. 
The major U.S. cash indices have been on a winning streak of late, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closing positively the last five days and the Dow Jones Industrial Average four of the last five. The S&P 500 posted its highest close since June 10 on Monday, the Dow is at a three-week peak and the Nasdaq at another all-time high.
Most of the recent economic data released have tended to suggest a strong recovery for the U.S. economy in June, including nonfarm payrolls rising by 4.8 million jobs and the ISM non-manufacturing index bouncing all the way to 57.1.
However, it’s debatable how long this positive stance can last given the resurgence of Covid-19 cases, with at least 32 states reporting higher rates this week compared with the last, according to Johns Hopkins University data. 
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said Monday the U.S. economic recovery is in danger of stalling due to the recent spike in coronavirus cases across many states. More Fed speakers are due Tuesday, including Bostic himself, Mary Daly and Thomas Barkin. 
Earlier in Europe, the European Commission downgraded its growth forecasts, saying it now expects the EU economy to contract by 8.3% in 2020, a significantly greater drop than 7.4% in spring. Growth in 2021 will also be slightly less robust than earlier projected.
In corporate news, retailer Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) reports quarterly results after the closing bell. Tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will also be in focus after announcing they won’t process user data requests from the Hong Kong government amid concerns that a new security law could criminalize protests. 
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, and the focus will turn to the American Petroleum Institute's report on the level of inventories, after the previous week showed a draw of 8.1 million barrels. Investors will be looking to see whether the fresh wave of coronavirus infections impacted the consumption of oil across the country. 
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $40.16 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $42.70.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,783.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1282, down 0.2%.

317,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>","Google, Facebook, Microsoft Pause Hong Kong Data Requests","(Bloomberg) -- Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). won’t process user data requests from the Hong Kong government amid concerns that a new security law could criminalize protests.
Last Wednesday, when the law took effect, Google paused production on any new information requests from Hong Kong authorities, said a spokesperson for the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. unit. “We’ll continue to review the details of the new law,” the spokesperson added.
It’s unclear what types of actions will violate the new law, but police arrested a man last week for brandishing a Hong Kong independence flag. Protesters have rallied against the law, and the government has threatened fines and imprisonment for service providers that fail to remove messages. In response, the U.S. has revoked some trade benefits with Hong Kong related to sensitive technology. American officials have expressed fears that the new law signals Beijing’s intention to take full control of Hong Kong, which has operated with more autonomy and freedom than cities on the mainland.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. and Microsoft joined their internet peers in hitting pause on data requests while they examined the new law, spokespersons for both companies said in separate statements. Microsoft said it “typically received only a relatively small number of requests from Hong Kong authorities, but we are pausing our responses to these requests as we conduct our review.”
In 2019, the Hong Kong government requested data from Google users 105 times, according to the company’s reported figures.
Facebook typically works with law enforcement to follow local laws where the company operates, but said it has paused sharing user data with Hong Kong authorities while it conducts a “human-rights” assessment. The pause applies to all Facebook properties, including its core social network, Instagram and WhatsApp.
“Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We have a global process for government requests and in reviewing each individual request, we consider Facebook’s policies, local laws and international human-rights standards.”
Twitter operates in much the same way and paused data requests immediately following the law’s implementation last week, a Twitter spokesperson said, adding that the company has “grave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this law.”
Facebook and Twitter don’t operate in China but do in Hong Kong, where they have offices. Google has a significant presence in Hong Kong, which includes sales staff that works with Chinese companies running digital advertising outside of China.

Petrochemicals firm Ineos, which is run by pro-Brexit billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, said in the autumn that it would make the vehicle in Wales, creating up to 500 jobs, and that a new plant in Portugal would produce the body and chassis.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has seen demand for new vehicles around the world slump and worsened problems affecting overcapacity, just as the sector pumps billions into electrifying its model line-ups to meet stringent emissions rules. 
German carmaker Daimler (DE:DAIGn) said on Friday it wanted to sell its factory in Hambach in northeast France, as it tries to cut costs. 
""As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic some new options such as this one... have opened up that were simply not available to us previously,"" Ineos Automotive boss Dirk Heilmann said.
Ineos will review its options in the next few weeks, it said.
""We have therefore suspended the post-lockdown resumption of work at our sites in Wales and Portugal pending the outcome of this review,"" the company said in a statement.

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as surging U.S. coronavirus cases and forecasts for a deeper-than-feared recession in the euro zone dimmed optimism around a post-pandemic rebound. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 1%, falling back from a near one-month high.
Banks (SX7P), which had surged 4% in the previous session tracking a global rally after China moved to prop up its market, fell 1.3%. Travel and leisure (SXTP), real estate (SX86P), and technology (SX8P) shares dropped more than 1.5% each.
German drugs and pesticides maker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) slumped 6.9% on news that a U.S. judge questioned a long-negotiated settlement of lawsuits claiming its widely used weedkiller, Roundup, caused cancer.
The European Commission said the 19 nation single currency area would contract by a record 8.7% this year before rising by 6.1% in 2021. In early May, the Commission had forecast a downturn of 7.7% this year and a rebound in 2021 of 6.3%.
""We are taking a more cautious stance because a lot of the assumptions are increasingly priced in as certainties. That is something that worries,"" said George Efstathopoulos, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments.
""A lot of the improving data are in response to the removal of physical constraints. They don't really tell us anything about consumption hugely affected by unemployment numbers.""

320,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 05:28AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Downbeat Commission, Results Give Markets a Reality Check","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. stock market may be de-anchoring itself from economic reality but the European one is at least trying not to.
Markets across the Continent fell on Tuesday after the European Commission revised down its forecasts for EU gross domestic product both this year and next due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The new estimates show both a deeper contraction and a weaker recovery over the next 18 months. Eurozone gross domestic product is now expected to shrink by 8.7% this year, instead of 7.7%, and to rebound by 6.1% next year, instead of 6.3%.
The regular quarterly update from the Commission is getting more attention than usual because its spring forecasts had essentially been guesswork, having no base of hard data from the lockdown period. That vacuum has now been filled.
No surprise, then, that the Stoxx 600 was down 1.1% at 367.24 by 5:30 AM ET (0900), with the German DAX the big laggard, down 1.4%, having made the smartest recovery since March. The U.K. FTSE 100 was also down 1.3% while the Italian FTSE MIB outperformed, losing only 0.2%.
The DAX’s underperformance is explained partly by the Commission’s bleak outlook for global trade. The ravages of Covid-19 across India and both North and South America will likely stop Europe from taking its traditional path of exporting its way out of a recession. That makes it doubly important that the ECB and eurozone governments continue to support domestic demand with generous wage subsidies and loose monetary policy in the coming months.
“The still rising rate of infections, particularly in the US and emerging markets, has deteriorated the global outlook and is expected to act as a drag on the European economy,” the Commission said.
The new outlook is still hostage to some crucial assumptions, notably, a gradual lifting of containment measures and no major second wave of infections. It also assumes that fiscal and monetary policy will prevent large-scale bankruptcies and layoffs.  
Those assumptions are set to be challenged in the next couple of weeks by what is sure to be a gloom-laden second-quarter earnings season.
The first numbers dribbling in have not inspired much confidence: hotel operator  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) PLC’s shares fell 4.3% after it reported an 80% drop in revenue in its fiscal first quarter and warned that demand for rooms in key big cities such as London remains “subdued”.  Meanwhile French catering group Sodexo’s shares fell 5.9% after it reported a 30% drop in revenue in its fiscal third quarter – even though it said full-year operating profit will fall by less than the 25% it forecast previously.
Given how long the market has had to process the outlook for such companies, neither update should have been much of a surprise. The sharp drops in the share prices do not bode well for the rest of the season."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) flagged a 23% rise in second-quarter operating profit on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on solid chip sales to data centres catering for a work-from-home economy during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The sales offset weak demand for smartphones and televisions, while one-off gains from its display business, which counts Apple Inc. (O:AAPL) as a customer, also boosted profits, the company said. It gave no further details.
The world's top memory-chip and smartphone maker said operating profit was likely 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) in the quarter that ended in June, far above the 6.4 trillion won analyst forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. It would be the highest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2018.
Revenue likely fell 7% to 52 trillion won from a year earlier, Samsung added, giving only limited data in a regulatory filing ahead of its full earnings figures later this month.
Work-from-home orders and growth in online learning are underpinning chip demand amid the coronavirus pandemic and pushing up DRAM memory chip prices. U.S. DRAM supplier Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) forecast strong quarterly revenue last month.
""Chip demand was stronger than expected due to the COVID-19,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. 
Analysts said the one-off display boost reflected a payment from Apple, with the U.S. smartphone maker struggling to meet agreed shipment targets as iPhone sales take a hit from the pandemic.
The payment was estimated at 1 trillion won, bigger than a similar 800 billion won payment a year ago, they said. 
The handset and TV business may have also fared better than expected due to lower marketing costs and as stores and factories resumed operations worldwide as countries lifted lockdowns aimed at stopping the virus, analysts said.
""The damage from the pandemic was less severe than the market had expected,"" said CW Chung, Nomura head of research in Korea. 
Analysts, however, warned that increases in memory chip prices may not continue in the second half of the year as data centre customers are likely to be conservative in stockpiling chips given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and other countries 
While prices jumped 14% on average in the quarter, they were flat in June versus May, data from DRAMeXchange showed. 
Shares of Samsung Electronics fell 1.8%, versus a 0.4% fall in the wider market (KS11) as of 0206 GMT. 
The South Korean tech giant's resilient earnings, despite the pandemic, came even as its leader, Jay Y. Lee, faces fresh legal troubles. 
State prosecutors are investigating Lee on suspicion of resorting to accounting fraud and stock price manipulation to win control of Samsung Group, Korea's largest conglomerate. Lee's attorneys have denied such allegations.
LG Electronics (KS:066570), Samsung's crosstown rival in TVs, phones and home appliances, meanwhile, said its second-quarter operating profit likely fell 24% to 493 billion won, ahead of a 374 billion won forecast by SmartEstimate. 

Analysts said easing of lockdown measures had helped demand for consumer electronics recover slightly.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Tuesday, as a smaller than expected rebound in German industrial production pointed to a slow and drawn-out recovery, particularly given the increasing number of new coronavirus cases globally.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 1%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.1%. 
Sentiment was dampened by German industrial production data, which rose by 7.8% in May, a sharp rebound from the drop of 17.5% in April, but slightly less than forecast. Factory orders data released on Monday had shown the same pattern.
The two indicators suggest that the European industrial powerhouse has put the worst of the coronavirus lockdown behind it. But production is still well below the levels recorded before the onset of the pandemic, indicating that the recovery is going to take some time.
The corporate picture still looks very weak. 
Italian oil major Eni (MI:ENI) stock fell 0.7% after joining larger rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in flagging asset impairments of around 3.5 billion euros ($3.96 billion) due to a lower outlook for energy prices, noting the coronavirus pandemic would have a lasting impact.
French food-services and facilities company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) stock dropped 2.2% after saying revenue for its third quarter of fiscal 2020 dropped 30% due to the pandemic.
Additionally, Premier Inn owner  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) stock slumped 3.8% after it reported sales plummeted 80% in a quarter ravaged by lockdowns.
On a brighter note, JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports  (LON:JD) stock rose 2.3% after the sports-goods retailer reported a rise in pretax profit for fiscal 2020, but it still expects fiscal 2021 to be materially hurt by the pandemic.
The ever-increasing number of Covid-19 infections, particularly in the U.S., are causing concerns given the importance of America to the world economy. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic warned Monday that the U.S. economic recovery is in danger of stalling, after Texas, California and Florida registered record case levels over the holiday weekend--forcing some businesses to close again. 
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, and the focus will turn to the American Petroleum Institute's report on the level of  inventories, after the previous week showed a draw of 8.1 million barrels. Investors will be looking to see whether the fresh wave of coronavirus infections impacted the consumption of oil across the country. 
At 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $40.20 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $42.74.

The Indian arm of global consumer giant Unilever (L:ULVR) said on July 2 it would rebrand its skin-lightening cream 'Fair & Lovely' to 'Glow & Lovely'.
The company said its skin cream for men will be called 'Glow & Handsome', but Emami said it had launched 'Glow & Handsome’ digitally one week before HUL announced the name change.

Hindustan Unilever first applied for the trademarks, 'Glow & Lovely' and 'Glow & Handsome' in September 2018, application for which was rejected in 2019, and re-applied in June 2020, the company said in a petition to the high court in the western state of Maharashtra.
Hindustan Unilever and Emami did not respond to requests for comment and the court has set July 27 as the next hearing date.
The decision to rebrand its line of skin creams came after Hindustan Unilever faced criticism that the name 'Fair & Lovely' promoted negative stereotypes towards darker skin tones."

The new technology, dubbed Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN), aims to reduce reliance on any one vendor by making every part of a telecom network interoperable and allowing operators to choose different suppliers for different components.
Currently, Nokia along with Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Huawei supplies most of the equipment for building telecom networks and mobile operators can only pick one for each part of their network
As part of the implementation plan, Nokia plans to deploy Open RAN interfaces in its baseband and radio units, a spokesman said. An initial set of Open RAN functionalities will become available this year, while the full suite of interfaces is expected to be available in 2021, the company said.

Nokia, unlike other vendors, had been promising to participate in the development of open RAN technology and have joined several industry alliances.

“Having considered the prospect of the pandemic having an enduring impact on the global economy and the energy scenario, Eni has revised its view of market fundamentals,” the Rome-based producer said in a statement. The company said it would stick to -- or even speed up -- its long-term climate strategy presented in February.
The spread of the coronavirus across the world this year wiped out fuel demand, hitting oil majors’ earnings in the first quarter and threatening worse to come in the second. Despite a recent rebound in consumption in some of the worst-hit countries, resurgent waves of the virus show the recovery remains fragile.
Lowering price forecasts “appears to be the flavor of the month,” Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe, said in a note. At Eni, “we do not see its current dividend as compatible with its aggressive decarbonization strategy.”
Last month, BP signaled it would make the biggest writedown on the value of its business since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, as it cut estimates for oil and gas prices in the coming decades between 20% and 30%. Two weeks later, Shell also said it had revised its mid- and long-term pricing outlook, and warned of a record writedown.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of SoftBank Group Corp climbed 4.6% on Tuesday to reach highs last seen during the dot-com bubble, as massive buybacks help shrink the group's persistent discount. 
Shares closed at 6,190 yen in Tokyo, hitting levels last seen in early 2000, when speculation on internet stocks saw prices surge before crashing and wiping out most of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's wealth. 
The rebound comes after Son in March pledged to spend up to 2.5 trillion yen ($23 billion) on buybacks, helping lift the stock 130% from March lows. 
With around 10 million SoftBank shares being shorted ""we are seeing a typical short-squeeze,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. 
Tailwinds for the company include progress in monetizing core assets such as e-commerce firm  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) to raise $41 billion to fund the buybacks and stabilise its balance sheet. The plan has caused jitters at credit-rating firms.
Alibaba's stock price continues to appreciate, with a portfolio company backed by SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund - insurance startup Lemonade Inc - successfully listing in New York last week.
Vision Fund reported an operating shortfall of 1.9 trillion yen for the year ended March as its portfolio floundered, pulling the broader group to a record annual loss. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) sees the fund booking valuation gains of 600 billion yen in the April-June quarter, analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo wrote in a note last week, ""with significant scope for a rebound in the valuations of non-listed firms"" in the portfolio. 
SoftBank provides little detail on how it revalues its investments. The ongoing impact of the coronavirus outbreak, which has exposed underlying problems at portfolio companies, means the fund's outlook for the rest of the financial year ""remains grim"", Tsuruo wrote.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Tuesday, consolidating after Monday’s sharp gains, as investors try to balance signs of a global economic recovery with concerns over the increasing number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% lower. CAC 40 futures in France were down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K.fell 0.7%.
Sentiment was dampened slightly by German industrial production data, which rose by 7.8% in May, a sharp rebound from the drop of 17.5% in April, but slightly less than forecast. Factory orders data released on Monday had shown the same pattern.
Additionally, Italian oil major Eni joined larger rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in flagging asset impairments of around 3.5 billion euros ($3.96 billion) due to a lower outlook for energy prices, while French food-services and facilities company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) said revenue for its third quarter of fiscal 2020 dropped 30% due to the pandemic.
The big European cash indices gained between 1.5% and 2% Monday, aided by a surge in Chinese shares as well as buying on Wall Street, backed by a sharp rebound in U.S. services industry activity in June.
That strong jump in the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing index, all the way to 57.1, was the latest in a string of June economic releases that offered hope that a meaningful global economic recovery was in progress.
However, the fly in the ointment is the ever-increasing number of Covid-19 cases globally, but particularly in the U.S.
New coronavirus cases have surged in several states--Texas, California and Florida registered record case levels over the holiday weekend--forcing some businesses to close again in a setback to the budding recovery. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic to say Monday that the U.S. economic recovery is in danger of stalling.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, as the continued growth of new coronavirus cases in the U.S., the largest consumer of crude, weighed on sentiment. The U.S. death toll surpassed 130,000 as of July 7, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Later on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute's report on the level of inventories will be in focus, after the previous week showed a draw of 8.1 million barrels. Investors will be looking to see whether the fresh wave of coronavirus infections impacted the consumption of oil across the country. 
At 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $40.05 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $42.52.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,794.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1303, down 0.1%.

Investing.com – Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) teased a better-than-expected 23% rise in its second quarter operating profit, in a regulatory filing on Tuesday ahead of revealing its full earnings figures later in the month.
The South Korean memory chip and smartphone producer estimated an operating profit of KRW8.1 ($6.78 billion), its highest quarterly profit since 2018.
The rise in profit was attributed to strong sales of chips to data centers, with the COVID-19 outbreak forcing many employees to work from home and children staying at home. The sales were able to make up for the drop in demand for smartphones and TVs. One-off gains from the display business, which counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a customer, gave profits a further boost.
But the company also estimated revenue to be KRW52 trillion for the same quarter, a 7% drop from the second quarter.
Samsung Electronics shares fell 2.18%to KRW53,800 ($45.0314) by 1:26 AM ET (6:26 AM GMT).
Meanwhile, state prosecutors are investigating Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jae Yong Lee over charges of accounting fraud and manipulating stock prices to gain control of Samsung Group."

The deal will also help Sunrun compete better with Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) SolarCity in a residential solar market, which, according to the companies, has reached only 3% penetration in the United States.
Vivint Solar shareholders will receive 0.55 of Sunrun common stock for each share held, representing a premium of 10.4% to Vivint's Monday close. 
The deal, unanimously approved by the companies' boards, is valued at $3.2 billion including debt.
Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) owns a 55.84% stake in Vivint Solar, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The private equity company bought Vivint Solar's parent, Vivint Inc, in 2012 for more than $2 billion. Vivint Solar went public in 2014.
The deal is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2020 and deliver annual cost savings of about $90 million, the companies said.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities was the financial adviser to Sunrun, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BofA Securities advised Vivint.
Vivint Solar in May reported an adjusted loss of $1.01 per share in its first-quarter results while withdrawing its full-year forecast. Sunrun posted a net loss of 23 cents per share for the same period.

Business Insider reported in April that Sunrun had laid off at least 100 workers and furloughed another 60 due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>",TikTok Pulling Out of Hong Kong After China Law Controversy,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok will pull its viral video app from Hong Kong’s mobile stores in coming days, becoming the first internet service to withdraw after Beijing enacted sweeping powers to crack down on national security threats.
That announcement came after internet giants from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). voiced opposition to national security legislation that grants the Hong Kong government sweeping powers to police the online and public spheres. TikTok, which has insisted it operates independently of Beijing despite its Chinese ownership, may be able to argue the withdrawal is a move to escape requests to censor content or share user data.
But its retreat could also benefit the Communist Party by removing a forum pro-democracy protesters have used to post videos calling for an independent Hong Kong. The Chinese-owned company didn’t explain its decision but said its Hong Kong exit could occur within days.
“In light of recent events, we’ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,” a spokesperson for the service said.
ByteDance, the world’s most valuable startup, operates some of the world’s most popular social media platforms. TikTok in just a few years became the destination of choice for mainly younger Americans and lip-syncing, dancing Indians. Its Chinese-only twin Douyin and other services such as Toutiao have grown into major venues for more than 1.5 billion people in its home country and beyond.
But that virality is provoking scrutiny around the globe about both its control of valuable personal data -- particularly of youths -- and censorship policies deemed pro-Beijing. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told Fox News “we’re certainly looking” at a ban on Chinese social media apps including TikTok. It’s also the largest and most prominent of 59 Chinese services India has banned, reflecting growing tensions between the neighboring countries after a deadly border skirmish in the Himalayas.
Sensor Tower data showed that as of September 2019, TikTok had about 1.8 million downloads in Hong Kong, a city of 7.4 million people. It’s unclear if ByteDance plans a substitute for TikTok -- Douyin, its closest cousin, is available only in China.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam sidestepped a question about how her administration will respond to decisions by Google, Facebook and Twitter to suspend processing user data requests, over concerns about suppression of free speech. Pompeo blasted the Communist Party’s “Orwellian censorship” in a statement.
While TikTok’s withdrawal may be viewed as support for the pro-free speech camp, the Chinese-owned service -- which likes to portray itself as mainly a fun venue for self-made music videos -- has come under fire repeatedly for censorship.
TikTok has faced persistent allegations its decisions on content align with Beijing’s priorities. It has targeted videos related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, the mistreatment of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region,and standoffs at the India-China border. Last year, a ByteDance spokesman told Bloomberg TikTok didn’t remove videos from the Hong Kong protests for political reasons, saying they may have instead been taken down for violating guidelines around violent, graphic, shocking or sensational content.
TikTok in June took a major step toward burnishing the service by hiring Kevin Mayer, the architect of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.’s direct-to-consumer video strategy. Mayer, who runs TikTok globally, may help smooth relations with U.S. lawmakers and interest groups while attracting talent and new content to speed its international expansion.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday morning, with investors balancing out positive data from the U.S. with the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases globally.
Stocks received a boost from the U.S. reporting a reading of 57.1 for June’s Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on Monday. The figure exceeded analyst forecasts and indicated the U.S. services sector’s return to growth.
“Investors have recognized that as bad as the economy in the U.S. is, it’s not as bad as what people thought it would look like in March and April. The market has started to sense we might see better than anticipated results fairly broadly across a wide spread of companies,” Nancy Prial, co-chief executive officer at Essex Investment Management, told Bloomberg.
But investor risk appetite was muted by the number of global COVID-19 cases topping 11.5 million as of July 7, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge Paul Borman abused his discretion by requiring GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA's head, Mike Manley, to meet face-to-face for reasons unrelated to the case, and without taking into account the risks of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The district judge's order for the parties to report back to the court in only eight days was also unwarranted, the appeals court said. Borman in June ordered Barra and Manley to meet by July 1, and later amended his order to allow other officials in their place.
""We do not mean to say, however, that the district judge may not order a pretrial settlement conference and/or mediation in the normal course,"" the appeals court said in a filing. 
The court in June stayed Borman's order requiring officials from the two firms to resolve the lawsuit, and on Monday rejected GM's request for a new judge to oversee the case, saying Borman's desire for a quick settlement was ""not so extreme"" that he needed to be replaced. 
GM said in a statement it was grateful that the court had quickly reviewed and granted its petition for a writ of mandamus. However, the company did not comment on the rejection of its request to reassign the case to another judge.

GM sued FCA last year, accusing the Italian-American company's executives of bribing United Auto Workers union officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage.

In a filing to Japanese financial authorities on Monday, the automaker said it had raised a total of 832.6 billion yen ($7.8 billion), including 712.6 billion yen announced in late May to respond to the novel virus.
Japan's No. 2 automaker is struggling to recover profitability after posting its first annual loss in 11 years, suffering from falling sales, a tarnished image and a deteriorating cash position even before the virus outbreak sapped global demand for cars.
Under new Chief Executive Makoto Uchida, Nissan has pledged to cut 300 billion yen from its fixed costs over the next four years, by slashing its production capacity and vehicle model range by around one fifth.
Unveiling its recovery plan in late May, Uchida said improving cash flow would be Nissan's biggest challenge, though the company expected to have positive free cash flow in the second half of the current financial year, compared with a negative 641 billion yen in the year to March.
In addition to the secured funding, Nissan has said it has 1.1 trillion in net cash in its automotive business, and credit lines of up to 1.3 trillion yen. 
But the company has acknowledged that more funding might be needed to cushion the blow of the coronavirus if it continues to weigh on sales in the coming months.
Nissan posted a 40% year-on-year fall in global vehicle sales during the March-May period, when global automakers shuttered most of their vehicle plants and car dealerships were closed to stem the spread of the virus.

341,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>",All Eyes on China’s Unstoppable Stocks After $460 Billion Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s equity market is firmly in the spotlight after an almost unprecedented rally that helped lift global stocks to a one-month high.
The speed of the past week’s gains in China is in many ways unseen since the stock bubble that burst five years ago. Monday’s surge alone added more than $460 billion to Chinese stock values, behind just one day in July 2015 as the biggest increase in shareholder wealth since the global financial crisis.
The advance continued on Tuesday, though at a slower pace. The CSI 300 Index rose as much as 2.1% to extend its five-year high, with trading volume more than three times the three-month full-day average. The offshore yuan strengthened past 7 per dollar for the first time since March.
China’s state media struck a more measured tone on Tuesday, after earlier publishing commentaries that highlighted the case for buying shares. Two newspapers urged investors to be rational: the Securities Times -- one of China’s most widely circulated financial publications -- said investors should be mindful of potential risks and not use the market as way to make a fortune overnight.
“The market will likely consolidate after strong rallies, especially as big caps have outperformed smaller peers by a big margin in the past week,” said Shen Zhengyang, an analyst with Northeast Securities Co. “Regulators wouldn’t want to see rapid gains in the market either. But there remain plenty of opportunities, and investors will continue to rotate into some laggards so the uptrend is still intact.”
As China’s tight capital controls limit the investment options for the country’s savers, this year’s low interest rates and the first losses ever for some popular wealth-management products are driving retail investors to stocks. But some analysts, as well as mainland media, say the country’s economic recovery and the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak have helped underpin the rally.
Mainland traders are counting on the momentum to continue, increasing the amount of leverage in the equity market to almost 1.2 trillion yuan ($171 billion), the highest since late 2015.
The risk-on sentiment is sending Chinese government debt plunging, with the yield on 10-year notes rising 1 basis point to 3.04%. That expands the premium over the cost on U.S. Treasuries of the same tenor to about 237 basis points, the largest gap in data going back to 2005.

342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>",Samsung’s $626 Million Oil ETF Alters Index After Rally Miss,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd. is changing the underlying benchmark for its oil ETF after it was unable to track the current index following a dramatic sell-off and subsequent rally in crude prices this year.
Samsung Asset said it worked with S&P Dow Jones Indices to come up with a new index that will track multiple contract months for oil futures to mitigate the risk from holding a single-month contract, the Hong Kong-based money manager said in a statement late Monday.
Once the new U.S. dollar index is rolled out in August, it will eventually be weighted 55% to the one-month forward index, 30% to the two-month index and 15% to the three-month, according to the statement. The ETF fell 1.6% in Hong Kong trading on Tuesday.
The Samsung exchange-traded fund has trailed its underlying index since May, after investors poured into it to bet on a rebound in oil prices after the April plunge. The ETF’s money pool jumped 84 times to $626 million as of July 3, making it the fastest-growing money manager in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
For those who bought the fund -- the Samsung S&P GSCI Crude Oil ER Futures ETF -- in April, their timing looked to be impeccable. Oil futures plunged to -$40 in New York on April 20, as the pandemic and price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia sent the market into freefall. The spot price for West Texas Intermediate has literally turned upside down since then, rallying to about $40 a barrel.
Samsung was unable to track the recovery because its broker didn’t allow the fund to increase its exposure to oil futures. The fund didn’t name the broker. As a result, Samsung’s managers sold out of the active June contract and bought contracts for September, later adding ones for October and December. The September contracts were priced higher than those for June, meaning the fund held fewer of them, reducing their exposure to the ensuing rally.
In a letter to shareholders dated April 21, amid the heightened market panic, Samsung explained its move.
“Over the course of the past day, the price of June 2020 contracts has dropped substantially,” the fund wrote, adding it could drop to zero or negative.
The fund said it was taking a “defensive position” to protect investors by selling the contracts in these “exceptional circumstances.”
It acknowledged the trade-off for the move: “The downside is that investors may not be able to enjoy any upside of holding June 2020 contracts” if the market price rebounds.
That’s exactly what happened. As a result, the fund has posted a decline of 78% this year as of July 2, compared with a 66% drop in the index it tracks. The fund appointed several clearing brokers in May.
Unprecedented oil-market volatility this year has wreaked havoc on ETFs and other products designed to give investors an easy way to bet on the direction of crude prices. The Samsung ETF and the U.S. Oil Fund, which trades in New York, are among those that upended their strategies to reduce the risk of getting wiped out by another plunge below zero.
Bank of China Ltd. faced a public outcry and scrutiny over the collapse of an investment product linked to oil futures, and is facing the possibility of absorbing $1 billion in losses suffered by its retail clients.
In South Korea, mom-and-pop investors exposed to about 1.45 trillion won ($1.2 billion) worth of structured notes tied to Brent or WTI futures faced losses. In India at least three brokerages have petitioned the courts to challenge the settlement of contracts after their clients faced millions of dollars in losses from the negative prices.

As part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), companies had to certify in good faith that ""current economic uncertainty makes this loan necessary to support"" their ongoing operations. The government-backed loan is forgivable as long as the companies restore employment to pre-pandemic levels.
Broadhaven Capital Partners LLC, which according to its website has advised on more than $50 billion worth of deals in the past decade, including the $4.5 billion sale this year of asset manager  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM) to rival Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN), applied for and was cleared for a PPP loan of between $350,000 and $1 million, according to a list released by the U.S. government on Monday.
Broadhaven representatives did not respond to a request for comment on why the investment bank applied for the loan and whether it had received and used it.
Technology-focused investment bank Union Square Advisors LLC, consumer and healthcare-focused investment bank North Point Advisors Inc and consumer-focused investment bank Sawaya Partners LLC were also each approved for a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million.
The loans helped retain 35, 31 and 24 jobs at each firm, respectively, according to the data released by the U.S. Treasury Department and Small Business Administration.

344,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Surge Into a Bull Market in Win for Government,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s rallying stock market is defying predictions of the death of the city in the wake of a new security law.
The Hang Seng Index has jumped 7.8% since the law was imposed on July 1, its best three-day gain since April 2015, and entered a bull market on Monday. The advance has been led by mainland Chinese firms listed locally, with Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co. jumping more than 29%, but Hong Kong firms have also seen sharp gains.
A sudden rally in mainland equities and a strengthening yuan have stimulated investor appetite for Hong Kong shares, which were recently the cheapest relative to the U.S. since at least 2005. But regardless of the cause, a rising stock market will bolster claims by officials that the new law would restore both stability and prosperity to a city that has been wracked by protests.
Such views seemed far-fetched in May, when news of the national security legislation first broke. The index fell almost 7% that month, clocking up the biggest drop relative to the MSCI All-Country World Index in more than two decades.
Yet it was apparent then that Beijing was determined to shore up the city as a financial center in the face of growing overseas concern. Waves of mainland capital flooded into equities as international investors dumped them, helping to strengthen the local currency. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority sold HK$7.2 billion ($925 million) of local dollars this week after the exchange rate rose to the strong end of its trading band against the greenback.
A flood of listings by Chinese firms is adding support. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. last month raised $7 billion through secondary share sales in Hong Kong.
A rising stock market will do little to assuage concerns about the draconic nature of the legislation. Late on Monday, Hong Kong’s police force were granted sweeping powers from warrant-less searches to demands to take down internet posts.
But given how cheap Hong Kong stocks are relative to history, and the intensifying momentum in equities in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the gains could have a way to run. An extended rally may bring some cheer to a city with a broken economy and uncertain future.

Pemex, as the Mexican state oil company is known, is asking some of its contractors if they can wait until next year to be paid money that is owed to them now, according to people with knowledge of the situation, asking not to be identified because the phone and in-person conversations aren’t public.
Three contractors that are being asked to defer payment are waiting on $115 million in payouts, according to the people, but the amount owed to companies across Pemex’s supply chain could easily total billions of dollars.
According to the people, contractors enter their invoices on Pemex’s website and receive a confirmation number and an estimated time of payment. The invoice number, known as “Copade,” is no longer being issued in some cases, the people said.
Pemex didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The expansion of Pemex’s outstanding payments with suppliers is a worrying development given the difficulties the heavily indebted oil company already faces, said Wilbur Matthews, founder of Vaquero Global Investment LP, which trades in Pemex bonds.
“If Pemex refuses to give you an invoice number, it doesn’t become a payable to Pemex and it doesn’t become a receivable to the company, so it’s like accounting limbo land,” Matthews said in a telephone interview. “But the reality is that Pemex owes them this money. What it means is that Pemex has a massive additional debt burden.”
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has placed Pemex at the heart of his goals to make the country self-sufficient in energy and revive national production. Yet the company suffered a record $23 million loss in the first quarter of the year as the coronavirus pandemic coupled with 15 years of declining oil output took its toll.
The company’s bonds were downgraded to junk by Moody’s in April, and it’s been forced to slash at least $1.8 billion from its exploration and production budget this year.
“What you’re seeing with some of the delays to payments of suppliers is that the reality of the situation is starting to bite,” Montgomery said by phone.
Mexico’s oil services industry has seen thousands of people lose their jobs due to the suspension of contracts with Pemex, which accounts for more than 95% of production in the country. More layoffs are expected while oil service companies wait for information from Pemex about when contracts will be restarted.
“I don’t know which company will go to court, where the judge says Pemex has to pay what it owes, but something bad is going to happen,” said Matthews. “At $40 a barrel things have to be run perfectly, and Pemex is not run perfectly.”

TORONTO (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) is committing C$150 million ($111 million) to racial diversity initiatives and aims to increase the proportion of non-white executive hires to 30% from 20%, Canada's biggest lender said on Monday.
 RBC  joins Bank of America (N:BAC), which announced $1 billion to address racial inequality, and others, including Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), in committing funds for racial justice causes following the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May. 
Across Canada's top six banks, people of color account for only about 10% of senior executives, according to a Reuters analysis, but none of the top six banks had either a Black CEO or a board member. 
Minorities made up 37% of RBC's Canadian workforce and 35% of U.S. employees in 2019, according to a report.
RBC said in a statement it has to better understand, identify and address issues that impede the success of Black, Indigenous and other racialized groups at the bank.
The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism in June urged business leaders to commit to increasing Black representation among their workforces, executives and board roles by 2025.
""Many Canadian companies have made statements condemning anti-Black systemic racism it's now time to back that up with action by signing the pledge,"" founder Wes Hall, who also runs shareholder services firm Kingsdale Advisors, said in a statement.
RBC did not say when it seeks to reach its 30% firm-wide target for non-white executive hires.
The bank pledged C$100 million in small business loans over five years to Black entrepreneurs and a C$50 million investment until 2025 to create opportunities for 25,000 Black, Indigenous and people of color.

Last month,  Manulife Financial  Corp (TO:MFC) and Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS) pledged C$3.5 million and C$500,000 respectively for diversity initiatives.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street investors scored emergency government loans amid pandemic,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - Some investment firms, including those that run hedge funds or manage money for wealthy investors, are among the businesses approved for emergency U.S. government loans to help small businesses pay employees during the coronavirus lockdown, according to data made public on Monday. 
They included Semper Capital Management LP, which bets more than $2 billion on mortgage and other asset-backed securities; Domini Impact Investments LLC, a mutual fund manager with about $2 billion under management; Brevet Holdings LLC, a $1.2 billion lending firm; and Truvvo Wealth Management LP, which manages more than $2 billion for large families and institutions.
Emails to the firms seeking comment were not immediately returned. The data does not track which loans were disbursed, paid back, or if they will qualify for forgiveness.
All told, the U.S. Small Business Administration said in a report on Monday that finance and insurance firms represented $12.2 billion across 168,462 loans, about 2.3% of the program's total lending as of June 30. The figures for investment firms alone were not immediately available. 
Many investment and wealth management firms are relatively small, and staff pay varies widely, often far from the stereotype of the billionaire jet-set financier. Unlike restaurants and hotels, many financial businesses remained open during the coronavirus-related lockdowns and shifted relatively smoothly to remote work. 
Investment firms typically earn a percentage of assets under management and profits as fees. The markets rebounded sharply after hitting a low in late March, which would have reversed some of those losses. 
The firms disclosed on Monday add to some already revealed in public filings. 
Cohen & Company Inc (A:COHN), for example, said in May it had received $2.2 million under the PPP, noting its small market capitalization and lack of access to the public capital markets. The company declined a request for additional comment on Monday beyond its previous statement that, in part because of the loan, it ""does not anticipate any significant workforce reduction or reductions in compensation levels in the near future.""
Some financial firms initially approved for loans quickly canceled or returned them amid additional guidance from the Treasury Department and media scrutiny. One was Metacapital Management LP, according to managing member Deepak Narula.
A spokesperson for another hedge fund listed as a recipient in Monday's data, Advent Capital Management LLC, said it explored the idea of taking a PPP loan but never completed an application and did not receive any aid.

350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Indonesian Oil Refiner Makes $48 Billion Bet to Double Capacity,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia is accelerating plans to almost double its oil refining capacity, ignoring a temporary slump in demand triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, as the former OPEC member seeks to cut reliance on fuel products imports.
PT Pertamina will spend $48 billion over the next seven years to increase processing capacity to 1.8 million barrels per day from 1 million currently. The expansion, which also includes building 8.6 million metric tons of petrochemicals capacity, will help the country halt refined products imports, according to the state-owned company.
Indonesia’s reliance on imports is now more than 50% of its annual demand because of years of underinvestment in building refining capacity. The national oil company plans to expand existing refineries and build a new one which can produce cleaner fuels including Euro V standard gasoline and green fuel from palm oil that may help cut annual imports worth $9 billion.
If Pertamina failed to act now, or further delay its plan to add refining capacity, the nation may become fully dependent on imports, President Director Nicke Widyawati told parliament last week. There’s an urgency to upgrade existing refineries that mostly produce fuels meeting Euro II emission standards because of the need to switch to cleaner fuels to cut pollution, she said.
Additionally, fossil fuel demand is forecast to continue growing until at least 2030, before consumers start using more renewable energy, Widyawati said. To meet the demand for renewables and biofuels, Pertamina is setting up green refineries, which will use palm oil as a raw material to produce fuels.
“We are also integrating some refineries with petrochemical plants, so when demand for fuel declines, we can switch production,” Widyawati told the parliament.
Still, sourcing capital for the expansion, some of the largest capital projects in Indonesia’s history, may become a huge challenge for Pertamina and prompt it to work with multiple partners, according to industry consultant Wood Mackenzie.
Global Partners (NYSE:GLP)
“The other challenge is that oil production is fast declining in Indonesia and hence a need to partner with a crude supplier to secure long term crude supply,” Wood Mackenzie’s Research Director Sushant Gupta said. “These investments are also coming at a time when the global refinery industry is expected to see a refinery capacity surplus in the medium term and weak margins.”
Russia’s Rosneft PJSC, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., Mubadala Investment Co. and Taiwan’s CPC Corp. are among oil companies in talks with Pertamina for the refinery and petrochemical projects, which on completion will also allow Indonesia to export fuel products to countries including Australia and New Zealand.
Indonesia, which quit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2016, has had some success in reducing fuel products imports. It halted aviation fuel and diesel imports last year, helped by increased local output and higher blending of palm oil with diesel to power vehicles and industrial generator sets.
Shrinking Output
Indonesia’s goal of becoming self-sufficient in energy supply can’t be met by expanding refining capacity alone, Woodmac’s Gupta said. The country’s crude oil output has declined to about 700,000 barrels per day from a high of 926,000 barrels in 2008, according to official data, underlining the need for long-term crude supply partnership.
While the government has a target to restore crude output to 1 million barrels per day by 2030 by squeezing out more from existing fields and hunting for large discoveries, it may be a daunting task. It may have more chances of boosting output through overseas acquisitions, according to Andrew Harwood, research director for Asia Pacific upstream oil & gas at Woodmac.
“In the current price environment, there is limited capital available for investing in exploration and enhancing recovery from mature fields in Indonesia,” Harwood said. “Therefore, Pertamina is more likely to look at additional overseas acquisitions to improve its oil production outlook.”
With a growing middle-class population and rising fuel demand driven by swelling car sales, Indonesia may still face a shortage of fuel products even after expanding its own production capacity, according to Woodmac. The country may see a shortfall of about 450,000 barrels per day of transport fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel in 2027, making it one of the largest deficit markets globally, the consultant estimates.
“We believe Indonesia will have to strike a balance between building its own refineries and importing products from global markets,” Gupta said.

(Reuters) - Cruise industry rivals are teaming up in an effort to sail again.
On Monday,  Royal Caribbean  Group (N:RCL) and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) announced a joint task force to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The “Healthy Sail Panel,” co-chaired by former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt and former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, is advising the companies on restart plans they will submit to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other regulators at the end of August. The panel plans to share its findings with the entire cruise industry and regulators.
The cruise industry has taken a major hit from the pandemic, with some of the earliest large clusters of COVID-19 occurring aboard cruise ships in which thousands of passengers and crew were packed in close quarters.
On March 14, the CDC issued a no-sail order for all cruise ships, which it subsequently extended to July 24.
Operators including Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival Corp (N:CCL) have voluntarily extended their pause in operations from U.S. ports until September.
During a group interview Monday, Leavitt, Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Officer Richard Thain and Norwegian Cruise Line CEO Frank Del Rio did not offer details on what protocols might be included in an industry restart, or whether recent spikes in U.S. coronavirus cases may further extend the pause in operations.

“We are all just feeling our way here, and it's become clear to me that there is a shift happening sociologically in the context of masks,” said Leavitt. “I think it'll be very interesting to see what other businesses do. And not just the cruise lines, but others. We're all just working our way through this.”

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) surged 13% to a record high on Monday, extending their rally to over 40% in five sessions after analysts raised their price targets on the electric car maker following its strong quarterly deliveries.
The day's jump increased Tesla's stock market value by $30 billion, eclipsing the entire value of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), currently at $25 billion. 
JMP Securities increased its price target to $1,500 from $1,050 after Tesla on Thursday reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy.
""We believe that the question to be considered is not whether the stock is expensive on current valuation measures, but what the company's growth and competitive position signal about the stock's potential for the next several years,"" JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha wrote in a client note. Tesla's annual sales could hit $100 billion by 2025, he predicted.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which rates Tesla ""underweight,"" raised its price target to $295 from $275, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) upped its target to $1,000 from $900. The median analyst price target for Tesla is $675, compared with its current price of $1,372, according to Refinitiv.
Tesla's solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark the first time in Tesla's history that it would report four consecutive quarters of profit.
However, with Tesla's stock up nearly 500% over the past year, many investors believe the rally is unsustainable. The stock is trading at 158 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv, an exceptionally high valuation.

Following Monday's surge, Tesla's market capitalization stood at $245 billion, growing its lead as the world's most valuable automaker.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said on Monday it had hired former Danaher Corp (N:DHR) executive Dan Daniel to bolster its team that focuses on acquiring and operating industrial businesses in the United States. 
Daniel, who served as executive vice president at Danaher from 2008 till March this year, is expected to become chief executive of an industrial company that KKR will acquire, and help improve its performance, KKR's co-head of Americas private equity Pete Stavros said in an interview.
He added that the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown presents opportunities for KKR to acquire companies. 
""With demand being down in the industrial sector, it makes for an attractive buying environment,"" Stavros said.
Daniel managed Danaher's industrial technologies and life sciences portfolios until 2017, and subsequently ran the company's diagnostics and dental divisions.
He is the second Danaher executive KKR has recruited. In 2017, KKR hired Ronald Voigt, who previously ran X-Rite Pantone, a Danaher subsidiary. Voight was eventually named CEO of Hyperion Materials & Technologies after KKR acquired the Worthington, Ohio-based industrial tools maker in 2018 from  Sandvik  AB (ST:SAND) for 4 billion Swedish knona ($432 million).
KKR said its upcoming industrial acquisition will be made through its flagship $13.9 billion Americas Fund XII.
All KKR industrial portfolio companies have an employee stock ownership program as an incentive to drive growth, the buyout firm said.

In March, KKR merged Gardner Denver Holdings Inc, a pumps and compressors producer it acquired for $3.9 billion in 2013, with the industrial division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, creating a new company,  Ingersoll Rand  Inc (N:IR), which has a $12 billion market capitalization. KKR has kept a 17% stake in the new company.

Investing.com -- Investors wouldn't let bad news on the coronavirus front keep them from focusing their energies on high-flying Internet companies.
Monday's gains come after the major indexes closed out their best quarter in decades, with the S&P 500 up 20% and the NASDAQ Composite soaring more than 30% for the three months ended June 30. The markets have regained much of the terrain lost when Covid-19 forced businesses, cities, and schools to shut down across the country in March.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), two companies that benefited from consumers forced to stay home and order items and entertainment over the Internet, led Monday's surge. Both achieved record highs. But it remains to be seen what the rest of the week will hold for stocks, as analysts cut their outlooks on new lockdown concerns.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More Data on the Direction of Employment
At 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) on Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest JOLTS job opening data.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect to see 4.85 million, which would be less than the 5 million reported for the previous month. The survey helps measure job vacancies and recruiting trends.
JOLTs comes on the heels of a stronger than expected rebound in jobs, but pandemic-era unemployment is still at post-World War II highs.
2. Another Round of Oil Inventory Estimates
Later on Tuesday, the oil industry will release its inventory estimates for the previous week. The American Petroleum Institute's report, which comes out at 4:30 PM ET, is watched closely because it comes out right before the government's data the following day.
API's estimate for the previous week showed a draw of 8.1 million barrels. There were concerns brewing on Monday that this week's estimate could show a reversal or disappoint on the low end, as a fresh wave of coronavirus infections forced a pause in business reopening plans across the country.
Market intelligence firm Genscape, as well as rival Seevol.com, suggested a substantial build in crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub that took delivery of oil delivered on expiring contracts of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark.
3. Will the FANG Rally Last?
Technology stocks will be a focus for market watchers this week as FANG stocks are surging even as analysts downgrade stocks on fears that the coronavirus shutdowns have not ended.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, joined the fray on Monday, saying rising Covid-19 infections and the end of the government's economic stimulus efforts are risks for stocks in the near term. This comes as big stocks like Amazon and Netflix hit new record highs.
Amazon touched $3000, and Netflix reached $499.50 on Monday. The Nasdaq 100, which represents the index's top nonfinancial stocks is now up 20% for the year. Large FANG stocks also help push the S&P 500 up, as they are a major influence in that index"

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose more than 3.5% even as Imperial Capital downgraded the streaming stock to inline from outperform on worries there is ""modest"" room for upside given the stocks surge in recent months.
In chip stocks, Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) surged 6% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts reiterated a buy rating on the stock and a price target of $113, noting the company's diversified end-market product mix.
Florida and Texas reported new single-day records for infections over the weekend, as coronavirus outbreaks across pockets of the U.S. showed little sign of abating.
Infections now total nearly three million nationwide, with 132,000 dead.
The surge in cases comes as data showed the U.S. services sector, which is responsible for the bulk of economic growth, rebounded strongly last month, renewing investor expectations for a sharp economic rebound.
The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) jumped to 57.1 in June from 45.4 in May. 
""With broad-based reopening and a very low bar set by the readings of the past two months, we saw a very solid rebound this month to 57.1, the strongest reading since February 2020 (57.3),"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Energy's move higher was cut short as oil prices pared gains to settle in the red, down 7 cents barrel, as some warn about the long-term Covid impact on crude demand.  
""We believe that oil-market participants are focusing on the current demand trends but are still ignoring the long-term implications of the corona pandemic,"" Commerzbank said. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, boosted consumer discretionary stocks, rising 5.8% to top $3,000 for the first time ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which starts in earnest next week.
""(W)hen the next earnings season starts, this (Amazon) is a stock where these analysts, which primarily are all bullish, are going to have to be raising their price objectives,"" Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Craig Johnson said.

Netflix stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio of about 96, according to Macrotrends. That compares to Nasdaq's PE ratio, which was at almost 23 on July 3, Macrotrends reported. A high PE ratio relative to the market can indicate that a stock is overvalued or that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.
“The stock has performed consistent with our Outperform rating as measure by pretty much any standard time unit,” Imperial analyst David Miller wrote, according to Briefing.com. The streaming service’s shares are up 50% in 2020 compared to a 3.3% drop in the S&P 500 so far this year. 
The stock has 28 buy-equivalent ratings, nine holds and five sell-equivalents, according to MarketWatch, with an average price target of $468.34. Shares are trading at about $495, compared to Imperial’s price target of $489.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","Wall Street rises on strong services sector, hopes of China recovery","By Caroline Valetkevitch
(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes were up more than 1% on Monday as data showing unexpected growth in the U.S. services sector last month and a revival in China's economy boosted optimism, helping investors look past a surge in new coronavirus cases at home.
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index jumped to 57.1 in June, almost returning to pre-pandemic levels, but a recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States has threatened the emerging recovery.
""These numbers are important, and it helps to explain the increase in consumer confidence,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
Investors also bet on an improving Chinese economy and its impact on the global growth as the yuan led commodity currencies higher against the dollar. Earlier, Chinese stocks jumped more than 5%.
A slew of upbeat U.S. data, including a record rise in monthly payrolls, has powered the Nasdaq to all-time highs and has helped the S&P 500 and the Dow shed much of their losses. The S&P 500 is roughly 6% below its February peak, while the Dow is about 11% below its record high from that month.
The S&P 500 rose for the fifth day, undeterred by a record surge in new COVID-19 cases in 16 states in the United States this month that could further hamper reopening plans and poses a big risk to the economic recovery. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 368 points, or 1.42%, to 26,195.36, the S&P 500 gained 41.93 points, or 1.34%, to 3,171.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 197.03 points, or 1.93%, to 10,404.66.
Over the Independence Day weekend, several states reported a record increase in new infections, with Florida surpassing the highest daily tally reported by any European country during the peak of the outbreak there.
Online retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) crossed $3,000 for the first time and was the top support to the benchmark index and the Nasdaq.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc were up about 10%, rising for the fifth session as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) bumped up its price target for the electric carmaker's stock following better-than-expected quarterly deliveries.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc climbed 5.1% after the ride-sharing company agreed to buy food-delivery app Postmates Inc in a $2.65-billion all-stock deal.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 14 new lows.

Investing.com – Wall Street surged on Monday as investors continued to back mega-cap tech stocks as better-than-expected economic data suggested the recovery remains on track despite an ongoing increase in Covid-19 cases nationwide.
The S&P 500 gained 1.77%, the Nasdaq Composite added 1.76% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.30%.
Florida and Texas reported new single-day records for infections over the weekend, as coronavirus outbreaks across pockets of the U.S. showed little sign of abating.
Infections now total nearly three million nationwide, with 132,000 dead.
The surge in cases comes as data showed the U.S. services sector, which is responsible for the bulk of economic growth, rebounded strongly last month, renewing investor expectations for a sharp economic rebound.
The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) jumped to 57.1 in June from 45.4 in May. 
""With broad-based reopening and a very low bar set by the readings of the past two months, we saw a very solid rebound this month to 57.1, the strongest reading since February 2020 (57.3),"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Tech was among the biggest gainers, with FAANG stocks driving the move higher, led by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose more than 3% even as Imperial Capital downgraded the streaming stock to inline from outperform on worries there is ""modest"" room for upside given the stocks surge in recent months.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 3% and topped $3,000 for the first time ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which starts in earnest next week.
Energy led the gains for the broader market, underpinned by rising oil prices even as some warn that rising cases threatened the recovery seen in crude oil demand.
""We believe that oil-market participants are focusing on the current demand trends but are still ignoring the long-term implications of the corona pandemic,"" Commerzbank said. 
On the M&A front, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) tabled a $2.65 billion shares-only offer to acquire Postmates, the fourth largest food delivery services company, to beef up its UberEATS business.  
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged to another all-time high, up 10%, just a week after its second-quarter deliveries topped estimates. "

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Uber scoops up Postmates for $2.65 billion in 'everyday' delivery push,"By Subrat Patnaik and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Monday said it would acquire Postmates Inc for $2.65 billion to expand its food delivery market share and significantly increase the business of supplying everyday goods at a time when the coronavirus has pummeled its core ride-hailing service. 
The all-stock deal, still subject to regulatory approval, would give Uber a roughly 30% share of the U.S. food delivery market, trailing only rival DoorDash, which commands some 45%, according to analytics firm Second Measure.
Uber said both companies' boards have approved the deal, for which Uber currently expects to issue some 84 million shares of common stock. Uber offered a premium of about 10% on Postmates' last valuation of $2.4 billion. Its shares were up 5% at $32.24.
Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi on Monday told analysts the tie-up would allow Uber Eats to distinguish itself by delivering not only restaurant food, but everything from groceries to personal care and fashion items. 
Uber has launched an option to send packages via its U.S. ride-hail drivers during the pandemic and teamed up with grocery stores in several countries. The acquisition allows it to expand into Postmates' existing network in 4,200 U.S. cities.
""The vision for us is to become an everyday service,"" the Uber CEO said.
Khosrowshahi said he expects the deal to create profitability for the Uber's Eats unit, as well as some $200 million in cost saving synergies in about two years and additional efficiency gains through Uber's smarter routing technology.
The tie-up comes after a month of frenzied merger talks in the industry as millions of Americans were marooned at home by the coronavirus crisis. Companies have traditionally tried to gain market share with costly promotions and driver incentives.
Uber's original plan to acquire U.S. food delivery rival GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which commands a 23% market share, faltered over regulatory and other concerns. GrubHub was snatched up by Takeaway.com NV on June 11.
When Uber presented its offer in June, Postmates was gearing up for an initial public offering for July.
Postmates board, however, was concerned that being a smaller player in food delivery and the economic recession could cast a shadow over the new stock's long-term performance, according to a source familiar with the matter. The board instead decided to opt for certainty by agreeing to a tie-up with the well-capitalized Uber.
Even with a pandemic-induced increase in demand, Uber Eats recorded a $313 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter. Uber on Monday said Eats bookings have more than doubled in the second quarter, but the company declined to provide additional financial details, including on Postmates.

Khosrowshahi said some 30% of Postmates' orders come from subscribers, a reliable customer segment Uber aims to expand with its own subscription service.

Global equity returns will be limited and stocks will still be near current levels 12 months from now, analysts led by Robert Buckland said in a note. The boost from $6 trillion of global quantitative easing will likely cancel out the economic drag from rising Covid-19 infections, they said.
“While we recognize that fighting the Fed is a thankless task, central banks have already driven a very significant rerating in global equities,” said the strategists. “We would not chase markets higher from current levels. We would prefer to wait for the next dip.”
Citi’s warning comes at a time when many market participants are wondering whether global stocks’ 40% rally from their 2020 lows has more upside, or whether it’s time to take profit and exit for safer instruments. While fiscal and monetary policies across the globe remain supportive, risks to the economic recovery continue to linger as some U.S. states like Texas are seeing a significant jump in Covid-19 infections.
Buckland’s team also cautioned that global equities are more expensive than investors may think. Based on their calculations, consensus earnings expectations for next year are 30% too high considering the global economic collapse, which brings the MSCI All Country World Index’s 2021 price-to-earnings ratio up to 24 times from the current 17 times.
“Policymakers have propped up markets by boosting the PE even as the E collapses. However, over time the E needs to catch up,” the analysts said.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka echoed Citi’s sentiment, saying on Monday that the risk-reward for equities is unattractive in the second half of 2020, with stocks likely to lag behind bonds and cash.
Among different equity regions, Citi strategists are overweight U.S. and emerging markets, neutral the U.K. and Europe and underweight Japan and Australia.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 12:41PM ET</span>",Thailand says monkey labour 'almost non-existent' after UK shop ban,"By Juarawee Kittisilpa and Orathai Sriring
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Monkey labour to harvest coconuts for commercial products ""is almost non-existent"" in Thailand, the commerce minister said on Monday, after British retailers announced bans on products campaigners say use the animals in their production.
Waitrose [JLPLC.UL], Co-op <42DE.L>, Boots (O:WBA) andOcado (L:OCDO) vowed not to sell products that used monkeylabour, while Morrisons (L:MRW) has already removed Thai products amid an appeal by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fiancée Carrie Symonds.
Symonds on Friday backed a call to supermarkets to stop selling Thai coconut products over accusations of monkey ""slaves"" by the rights group People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) published in the Telegraph newspaper. 
""Using monkeys for the coconut industry is almost non-existent,"" Thai Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit told reporters, saying human labour had long ago replaced monkeys.
""But there may still be the pictures of monkey collecting coconuts for tourism on video clips, which created a misunderstanding,"" Jurin said.
Deputy agriculture minister, Mananya Thaiset, echoed his comments. ""How do you even find that many monkeys to collect large amounts of coconuts to cater to the industry?"" she said
When asked by email about the minister's comments that the video may have been taken at tourist shows, rather than in an industrial plantation, PETA Senior Vice President Jason Baker said: ""PETA’s investigation footage was captured recently on plantations and training schools.""
""When the government tries to explain away extreme cruelty to monkeys, it only makes the public angrier,"" he added.
Reuters could not verify whether the monkeys in the PETA video were being used in commercial coconut farming.
Thailand last year exported coconut milk worth 12.3 billion baht ($396 million), about 8% of it to Britain.
Walmart-owned (N:WMT) supermarket Asda also said it was removing products from Aroy-D and Chaokoh, Thai brands of coconut milk, while investigating the PETA report.
An Aroy-D spokeswoman disputed the report and said British retailers did not consult it before their announcements.
Chaokoh did not reply to queries on Monday.
Edwin Wiek, of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand that tends to rescued wildlife, said he believed the practice was waning as farmers strived to meet European trade standards.

""I do believe that monkeys are still being used for the coconut picking. But in the last 15 years, it’s going down at a very big rate,"" he said.

(Reuters) - After surpassing  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp as the world's most valuable automaker and stunning with forecast-beating deliveries, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has taken time out to poke fun at the company's naysayers - with sales of red satin shorts.
""Limited edition short shorts now available,"" CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday. 
Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn.
The ""Short Shorts"" on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY” in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names.
The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk's infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana.
That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman.
The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns. 
""Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,"" the product description says, adding: ""Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell."" It will ship within 2-4 weeks.
Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.

After the delisting of the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN, ticker TVIX, strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. reckon the firm behind the $1 billion note could team up with a fresh issuer to launch a copycat.
VelocityShares, a subsidiary of Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) Plc, marketed TVIX while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG issued the product. The Swiss bank announced last month it was moving TVIX to over-the-counter trading and no longer creating new shares. Its new ticker is TVIXF.
“TVIX is VelocityShares largest product (and one of the first it launched), so we believe the company will be motivated to try to re-issue a similar product with a new issuer,” JPMorgan strategists led by Bram Kaplan wrote last week.
A spokesperson for Janus Henderson, which bought VelocityShares in 2014, didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
There would likely be healthy demand for any such product as investors continue making leveraged bets on market turbulence.
Over $400 million has poured into the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, ticker UVXY, in the past two weeks. Just a day after the Credit Suisse announcement, an upstart firm applied to register a geared fund that will invest in volatility index futures.
There’s also precedent for the move, according to JPMorgan.
In 2016, Credit Suisse delisted a pair of three-times leveraged crude oil notes known by their tickers UWTI and DWTI. VelocityShares went on to launch copycat products with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).; those notes were redeemed earlier this year amid turbulence in the oil market.

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",The VIX Is Still Flashing Warnings for Stock Bulls on a Rampage,"(Bloomberg) -- Fear is still rife across volatility markets even as greed powers U.S. stocks anew after their best quarter since 1998, in a historic divergence making life harder for Wall Street speculators.
While the S&P 500 Index has rallied a whopping 40% from the March trough, a measure of implied equity swings known as the Cboe Volatility Index remains elevated at around double its February low.
Systematic traders who make a living by wagering on price gyrations ahead are in a bind. On the one hand, a flat but elevated VIX futures curve is flashing risks on the pandemic-driven economic trajectory, the November election and liquidity threats. On the other, S&P bulls tanked on policy stimulus see good reason to defy caution in the VIX landscape.
All that means volatility players are lacking the conviction to go all-in one way or the other, as stocks and the VIX send diverging signals on risk.
“Equity and equity volatility markets are pointing in very different directions,” Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA strategists wrote in a note. “This dichotomy represents a serious issue for volatility market participants.”
Chief among the latter are the multi-billion-dollar funds that short equity swings by selling options for income in a yield-starved world. Ordinarily these players would pounce at current levels in a bet that volatility markets will catch up with rallying stocks.
And they would have long-term history on the side. Typically when stocks rise, the VIX falls as traders look forward to less turbulence ahead, and vice versa. Yet the likes of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). consider the gap between the gauge and S&P 500 returns one of the largest on record, thanks in part to the dizzying speed of the cash-equity rally.
While stocks have unleashed a recovery rally for the history books, the jitters never really went away. Hedges like gold and bond duration remain well bid amid fears over fresh outbreaks of the virus, the possible end of fiscal aid and the limits of monetary stimulus.
In the current landscape it’s “tough to find strong conviction on buying or selling equity vol either way,” said Colton Loder, managing principal of Cohalo, an alternative investment manager based in Washington.
Loder reckons the VIX can fall modestly given the still-low equity positioning and the technical consequences spurred by the delisting of TVIX, the world’s biggest volatility exchange-trade product. But he sees market risks as finely balanced.
Who dares wins and the sell-side is touting plenty of trades across derivative markets, both long and short. SocGen recommends buying out-of-the-money EuroStoxx 50 calls, whose prices are depressed given significant selling pressure from overwriters in the options market. The French banks also suggest selling deep out-of-the-money weekly S&P 500 puts which deliver a high premium by historic standards.
But as fresh virus waves spur continued lockdowns, many traders are in no mood to harvest the volatility-risk premium, or the tendency for implied swings to overshoot realized levels.
Tobias Hekster at hedge fund True Partner points to the expiration of additional unemployment benefits in the U.S. as a possible flash point in coming months.
“We would not be surprised if we get a memorable summer in the markets,” said the co-chief investment officer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied to four-week highs and China's yuan headed for its best day against the dollar since December on Monday as investors counted on a revival in China to boost global growth, even as surging coronavirus cases delayed business re-openings across the United States.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 49 countries, rose 0.7% to its highest since June 6, by midday in London.
European shares jumped, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising 1.4%. Stocks exposed to China -- carmakers, industrials, energy firms and luxury goods makers -- rose strongly, while banks also rallied. 
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.8% to its highest since February, with the bullish sentiment spilling into other markets.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 gained 1.1%.
Chinese blue chips jumped 5.7% on top of a 7% gain last week to their highest in five years. Even Japan's Nikkei, which has lagged with a soft domestic economy, managed to rise 1.8%.
China's offshore yuan was on track for its best day against the dollar since December, up nearly 0.7% at 7.0210 per dollar.
Among the reasons investors cited for the buying was improving economic data - UBS noted Citi's Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. has risen to its highest level on record. The index measures how well economic data releases are faring relative to consensus forecasts. 
Some cited an editorial in the China Securities Journal, which said on Monday that China needed a bull market to help fund its rapidly developing digital economy.
""We advise against regarding uncertainty as a reason for exiting markets. Instead, we see ways for investors to cope with uncertainty - including averaging into markets - or even take advantage of volatility,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
In Hong Kong, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) chief global equity strategist Sean Darby said the positive sentiment towards Asian markets was the result of better-than-expected regional economic data and elevated liquidity levels.
""All of the global monetary policy indicators are flashing green right now. It is very loose and that should mean markets which have underperformed should do well,"" Darby told Reuters.
""The dollar has also been weaker over the past five days so emerging markets, led by China, normally do well on that back of that.""
Most markets gained ground last week as a raft of economic data from June beat expectations, although the resurgence of coronavirus cases in the United States is clouding the future.
In the first four days of July alone, 15 states have reported record increases in new cases of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 3 million Americans and killed about 130,000, according to a Reuters tally.
Analysts estimate that re-openings affecting 40% of the U.S. population have now been wound back.
""Markets will have to climb a wall of worry in July as economic activity likely softens from the V-shaped recovery seen over recent months,"" said Robert Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac. ""We must remember, too, that U.S. and China relations are deteriorating noticeably.""
Two U.S. aircraft carriers conducted exercises in the disputed South China Sea on Saturday, the U.S. Navy said, as China carried out military drills that have been criticised by the Pentagon and neighbouring states.
The risks, combined with unceasing stimulus from central banks, have kept sovereign bonds supported in the face of better economic data. U.S. 10-year yields edged up to 0.7% on Monday, well off the June top of 0.959%.
Italy's 10-year bond yield fell 4 basis points to around 1.29% -- pushing towards more than three-month lows hit last week. That squeezed the gap over benchmark German Bund yields to around 171 basis points. 
Analysts at Citi estimate global central banks are likely to buy $6 trillion of financial assets over the next 12 months, more than twice the previous peak.
Major currencies have been largely range-bound with the dollar index down 0.3% at 96.894, having spent an entire month in a snug band of 95.714 to 97.808.
The dollar was flat against the yen at 107.50 on Monday. The euro rose 0.6% against the dollar, above the $1.13 mark.
In commodity markets, gold has benefited from super-low interest rates across the globe as negative real yields for many bonds make the non-interest-paying metal more attractive.
Spot gold traded at $1,776.21 per ounce, just off last week's peak of $1,788.96. 
Oil prices were mixed with Brent crude futures up 1.2% at $43.58 a barrel. U.S. crude was flat at $40.65 a barrel, amid worries the surge in U.S. coronavirus cases would curb fuel demand.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Ford's Bronco SUV bucking to take on FCA's Jeep,"By Ben Klayman and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Monday rolled out the product and marketing strategy for its new family of Bronco SUVs designed to take a bite out of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles' (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) profitable Jeep franchise.
Ford's Bronco lineup, launching later this month, will include two- and four-door models, as well as a smaller Bronco Sport. The vehicles' boxy looks, their new bucking bronco logo, a ""Bronco Nation"" online fan club along with the ""Built Wild"" marketing campaign are all part of Ford's plan to muscle into the lucrative off-road adventure segment that Jeep has dominated for decades. 
The new Bronco lineup will offer off-roading technology aimed at people who want a comfortable ride on the highway, and who go off-roading on sand, gravel or dirt, not clambering over boulders, Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said in an interview. 
""We see our vehicle different than Wrangler,"" the Jeep model favored by extreme off-road enthusiasts, Farley said. ""We see it as a vehicle you can live with every day.""
Bronco's real mission is to boost profits as Ford strives to repay debt taken on to weather the coronavirus slowdown. Last year, Ford said retooling its Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant to build Ranger mid-sized pickup trucks and the Bronco instead of hybrid and compact cars would improve operating earnings by more than $1 billion.
Teaser images from Ford and spy photos from auto magazines have hinted the new Bronco will take styling cues from the first generation of Ford Broncos, built from 1966 to 1977, which were boxy two-door models now considered one of the earliest SUVs. Ford withdrew the Bronco line in 1996 amid falling demand for two-door SUVs.
While FCA declined to comment on the Bronco, Chief Executive Mike Manley and his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, invested heavily in the Jeep brand. The Jeep family includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming.
Jeep generates a huge share of FCA's profit.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company's market value — more than $20 billion at the time.
Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold about 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from almost 1.6 million in 2018. Ford's aspirations are lower starting at 125,000 sales in the first year, according to suppliers. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000. 
As part of the Bronco launch, Ford will create four U.S. off-road testing grounds next year, dubbed ""Off-Roadeos."" 
Ford will unveil online the four-wheel-drive SUVs at 8 p.m. ET on July 13, when customers can begin placing $100 deposits.

388,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Wall Street Is Too Negative About a Biden Win,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is too negative on prospects for the markets if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidential election in November, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Numerous factors could make Biden more market-friendly than analysts currently predict, including a historical tendency to converge toward the political center, potential benefits from infrastructure spending, a softening of tariff rhetoric and higher wages, strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note Monday. They also said the tax hit to S&P 500 earnings is likely to be lower than many are expecting, and that an increase in the federal minimum wage would probably be net positive for companies.
“The consensus view is that a Democrat victory in November will be a negative for equities,” the strategists said. “However, we see this outcome as neutral to slight positive.”
Wall Street has gone from relief that Biden is the presumptive nominee over more progressive candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, to concern that an election victory could hurt stocks through policy moves like a rollback of Trump-era tax cuts.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said Democratic tax changes could lower S&P 500 earnings per share to $150 from its forecast $170 in 2021.
A survey last month by RBC Capital Markets showed investors are more worried about the November election than another wave of Covid-19 infections.
Others say Democratic gains could be relatively benign for markets. Experts at the Scowcroft Group who have followed Washington policymaking for decades said last month that investors shouldn’t be nervous about the prospect of a Biden presidency, noting that Biden might act in a less disruptive way on trade than President Donald Trump. Credit Suisse’s Jonathan Golub sees the prospect of higher tax rates as a “headwind not an impediment.”
JPMorgan looked at stocks that may fare better or worse if Biden is the victor in November. Potential outperformers under a Democratic agenda include companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Johnson & Johnson,  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., according to the report. Underperformers might be firms such as  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA).,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC)., AT&T Inc. and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd., they said.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Buy now, pay whenever? Lockdown lift for online shopping loans","By Nikhil Nainan
(Reuters) - Browsing online during lockdown, Jessica Friend spotted a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses she liked, but the price tag made the 30-year-old Ohio resident think twice.
What persuaded her to click 'buy', Friend said, was the short-term credit offered by Afterpay (AX:APT), which split the $260 payment into four interest-free instalments.
Afterpay is among a handful of alternative credit firms which offer small loans, mostly to online shoppers, and make their money by charging merchants a 4%-6% commission.
These buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firms have benefited from a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus crisis in countries including the United States, where state aid has also boosted retail sales.
""I'm more inclined to use them because they make it easier to afford to get the things I want all at once ... and when I want to splurge on something,"" Friend said of the loans.
Some investors are now betting shoppers will stay away from stores as coronavirus cases rise again in several countries around the world, boosting business for BNPL firms.
But swelling subscriber numbers may also increase bad loans, mainly among first-time users who are more likely to default.
And as job losses rise and government aid ebbs, the business model will face its first real test in a recession.
""Much still hinges on any virus second waves and government wherewithal to keep boosting demand,"" said Andrew Mitchell of Ophir Asset Management which owns shares in Melbourne-based Afterpay, whose market value has risen to $12.55 billion from over $100 million four years ago.
While a move to online shopping was underway before the pandemic, the shift has accelerated under lockdown and Afterpay signed up more than a million new active U.S. customers between March and early May, taking its overall base there to 9 million.
Meanwhile retailers desperate to move merchandise have also become more receptive to partnerships with BNPL firms, which unlike credit cards or mortgages, make loans instantly.
Klarna, Europe's biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20% on average globally.
With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden's Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face,  Disney 's (N:DIS) streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora.
Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150% annually.

(For an interactive version, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyprrrnope/index.html)
Although fears of credit losses sparked a sector-wide sell-off in March, the entry of big tech investors and rising subscriber numbers have since supported a sharp recovery, with stocks now at record highs.
(GRAPHIC: Buy now, pay later firms on a tear, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzwbdqpw/Buy%20now%20pay%20later%20firms%20on%20a%20tear.PNG)
'TURN OFF THE TAPS'
The pandemic forced most companies to tighten their risk settings, which they say may push up loan rejection rates, although Afterpay, Klarna, Zip (AX:Z1P) and Sezzle (AX:SZL) declined to provide specific numbers. 
""BNPL operators can turn off the taps and quickly throttle down growth if repayment risks increase,"" Mitchell said.
While Afterpay, with bad loans totalling 1% of its loan book as of March, changed its requirements so that customers had to pay a quarter of their loan upfront, co-founder Nick Molnar said rejection rates were roughly in line with the start of the year.
Molnar said an overwhelming majority of Afterpay customers, whose average transaction value is A$150, pay back on time, while loans on new purchases are denied to those who do not.
Although some brokerages expect Afterpay to turn a profit by 2022, rising costs to finance expansion and credit losses that eat into receivables are likely to mean BNPLs, which operate on thin margins, remain unprofitable for some time.
Klarna saw credit losses more than double in the first three months of the year to about 0.7% of underlying sales as it expanded in Europe and the United States, where regulation of the sector is almost non-existent.
Only California has said BNPL firms need a license, and fined some for lending without one.
In Australia, where the industry first took off on the back of easy funding, the corporate regulator is set to release a follow-up report this year to one it issued in 2018 raising concerns about users becoming overextended and calling for BNPLs to be regulated in line with other credit services.
Companies, investors and analysts agree that young people with stimulus money in their wallets are driving sales and BNPL shoppers that Reuters spoke to were all under 35 and bought household items, as well as skin care products and clothes.
""The vast majority of our customers have income levels of under $75,000, so I would say the majority probably have a stimulus check,"" said Charlie Youakim, CEO of Sezzle, one of the smaller firms.
The younger demographic is harder to assess because they lack credit history, meaning most companies use algorithms to run real-time eligibility checks and assess risk of default.
""Our internal engine assesses risk taking various parameters into consideration which also will include consumer payment history, what is being purchased and is combined with varying third-party data sources and authentication solutions,"" Klarna spokeswoman Aoife Houlihan said.
Sydney-based Zip, with bad debts of just over 2% of receivables, said it assesses shoppers' public information and credit scores. 

Around one in 100 customers is late with payments each month, spokesman Matthew Abbott said, adding that Zip recently tightened eligibility rules, leading to higher rejection rates.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, rallying as investors look for a strong economic recovery in the second half of the year despite the resurgence of coronavirus cases in many states. 
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 1.1%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 117 points, or 1.1%. The Dow Futures contract rose 343 points, or 1.3%. 
The U.S. economy gained 4.8 million jobs in June, data released before the long holiday weekend showed, much more than expected.
“It shows how the re-openings have allowed businesses to get into gear and bring workers back,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Economic data out of Europe and China are also indicating that a recovery is underway, prompting strong equity gains in both regions. There is a great deal of optimism that U.S. services data for June, due for release later Monday, will show that this sector is expanding again.
Adding to the positive tone is the idea that another stimulus package could soon be agreed upon by the country’s political leaders. 
On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration is ""very seriously considering"" a second round of stimulus checks, according to The Wall Street Journal.
This may well be needed given the upsurge in new Covid-19 cases, with the U.S. recording over 150,000 new cases over the long holiday weekend. This has resulted in local lockdowns in many of its more populous states.
This has prompted Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to revise down its estimates for the U.S. economy this quarter, now expecting the economy to grow 25% in the third quarter having previously predicted 33%. That would result in the economy slumping 4.6% this year, worse than the 4.2% previously seen.
“A combination of tighter state restrictions and voluntary social distancing is already having a noticeable impact on economic activity,” Goldman economists said in a report published on Saturday.
In corporate news, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) will be in the spotlight after saying on Sunday that its energy unit will buy Dominion Energy's (NYSE:D) gas transmission and storage network for $4 billion.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) will also be in focus after Bloomberg reported that the ride-sharing company has agreed on a deal to buy food-delivery app Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock agreement.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, as Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, reinforced confidence that the physical market is approaching balance, raising its official selling prices for all types of its crude in August by $1, relative to the Oman/Dubai average.
That said, the continued growth of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. resulted in an underperformance from the American benchmark, WTI futures.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $40.66 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $43.30.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,786/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1299, up 0.5% on the day.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Lloyds Bank boss Horta-Osório to step down after a decade at the helm,"By Iain Withers
(Reuters) - Lloyds Bank (L:LLOY) Chief Executive António Horta-Osório said on Monday he would step down next year after a decade at the helm, leaving Britain's biggest domestic bank to find a successor to steer it through the coronavirus fallout.
While his departure had been expected, it comes at a critical time as banks brace for a wave of bad debts as customers struggle in an economy heading into a deep recession.
Horta-Osório's successor will need to push Lloyds further into wealth management and online services while finding a way to increase profits in an era of almost zero interest rates, analysts said.
His departure could also lead to some musical chairs at top banks with analysts speculating about both where Horta-Osório might go next and who will replace him at Lloyds.
A Lloyds spokesman said a search for a successor that would include both internal and external candidates would begin imminently, adding that Horta-Osório, 56, had given the company no indication of what he planned to do next.
Goodbody analyst John Cronin said Horta-Osório could take the top job at Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) or Unicredit (MI:CRDI), especially if the Italian bank's boss Jean-Pierre Mustier were to switch to Lloyds.
Alison Brittain, head of hospitality company  Whitbread  (L:WTB) and a former head of retail banking at Lloyds, is also likely to be linked to the role, as will RSA Insurance (OTC:RSNAY) CEO Stephen Hester and former HSBC chief John Flint, Cronin said.
""While (Horta-Osório) will be sorely missed, it is not surprising that he is planning to move on after what will be 10 years at the helm come 2021,"" he added.
JP Morgan analysts said Lloyds had a solid range of potential internal candidates including head of commercial banking David Oldfield, head of retail banking Vim Maru, and finance director William Chalmers, who joined last year.
'MIXED EMOTIONS' 
Lloyds shares have halved since Horta-Osorio took over in 2011, though they were higher for much of his tenure before slumping along with other bank stocks due to the coronavirus.
The bank's shares were up 2% on Monday following the announcement, lagging rival lenders in the FTSE 100 stock index amid a broad market rally.
Horta-Osório led a turnaround at Lloyds in the aftermath of its government rescue in the 2007-09 financial crisis and the bank returned fully to private hands in 2017.
During his time at Lloyds the Portuguese banker won plaudits for championing mental health issues at companies after he was signed off work for two months in 2011 for stress-induced insomnia and exhaustion.
But he faced strident criticism from lawmakers over his high pay package and for the bank's handling of a major fraud at its HBOS Reading branch that led to six people being jailed in 2017. 
Horta-Osório said he would leave by June next year and was going with mixed emotions. He told staff in a memo seen by Reuters that leading Lloyds had been the job of a lifetime.
Lloyds said on Monday it had appointed industry veteran Robin Budenberg as chairman. He will join the board in October before taking over from Norman Blackwell early next year.
Budenberg built his career in investment banking at SG Warburg and UBS. He advised the British government on its bailout of banks, including Lloyds, during the financial crisis. 

He later led the UK Financial Investments company managing the state's holdings in banks following the bailouts and is currently chairman of The Crown Estate, which manages Queen Elizabeth's property holdings.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Big Four told to ring fence auditing in Britain by June 2024,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY should ring fence auditing in Britain as a separate business by June 2024, their regulator said on Monday in one of the most sweeping changes to the sector globally to improve audit quality.
Corporate failures at builder Carillion and retailer BHS led to three government-backed reviews that recommended a shake-up of auditing, but the government has yet to introduce legislation to mandate change, partly due to Brexit and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) had already begun seeking voluntary changes to help speed up reform, and said on Monday it was asking the ""Big Four"" firms to agree to operational separation based on a set of principles it has discussed extensively with them.
The principles include ensuring that the total amount of profits distributed to the partners in the audit practice does not persistently exceed the contribution to profits of the audit practice, a step that prevents consultancy work subsidising audit.
An implementation plan should be submitted to the FRC by Oct. 23 for implementation by June 30, 2024 at the latest, the regulator said.
Deloitte said it would work with the FRC to develop its plans, but that it was important not to lose momentum with other reforms in the three reviews.
KPMG said it supported operational separation in Britain as a first step to restoring trust in companies. PwC said it would continue to engage with the watchdog on the complexity and detail of the principles.
EY said it would work with the FRC, but that the proposals alone would not deliver all the changes needed.
The audit shake-up includes replacing the FRC with a more powerful Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority or ARGA.
It also envisages helping smaller accounting firms like Mazars, BDO and Grant Thornton compete at the top end of the market that is dominated by the Big Four.

The FRC said it remains fully committed to introducing further aspects of the reform package over time, and that talks on ""shared audits"" with the Big Four were ongoing.

394,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Banks Lead the Mean Reversion March,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets have started the week with a bang, with a surge in Chinese equities apparently giving investors confidence to put last month’s massive liquidity injection from the £uropean Central Bank to use.
As such, it’s a mean-reversion day, with beaten-down ‘value’ stocks outperforming growth sectors such as technology that have, paradoxically, tended to be the more ‘defensive’ play since the pandemic erupted.
By 530 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1.3% at 370.32, while the German DAX was up 1.5% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.9%, the latter after the grand reopening of the U.K.’s bars and restaurants on Saturday.
The Stoxx 600 Banks index, a decent proxy for sentiment toward cyclicals and value stocks, was up 3.6% in a bounce that can only be seen as a punt on valuations returning to less depressed levels. Little has happened over the weekend to make European bank stocks a better value proposition: interest rates are set to stay below zero beyond most investment horizons, and there is little that can be done to stop a wave of bankruptcies hitting the sector in the second half of the year, pushing bad loan ratios sharply higher. Still, with European bank shares trading at less than 0.3 times their book value, the risks can look skewed to the upside on a day when summer is in full swing and the TV news isn't full of Dutch and Austrian politicians grumbling about bailing out the south of the continent.
True, there are a couple of bank-specific catalysts affecting the market on Monday. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock is doing the ‘bounce of shame’, rising 6.9% after the bank’s underperforming management resigned under shareholder pressure on Friday. Asia-focused HSBC  (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  PLC (LON:STAN) stock were up 5.1% and 4.1% respectively on a surge in optimism for Chinese assets, while Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) shares underperformed with a gain of only 0.6% after announcing that respected CEO Antonio Horta Osorio will step down at the end of next year.
In Italy, meanwhile, UBI Banca (MI:UBI) stock rose to a post-pandemic high as  Intesa Sanpaolo 's (MI:ISP) hostile bid gained support in the teeth of opposition from UBI’s core shareholders. Regulator Consob approved the takeover attempt last week, ramping up the pressure on UBI’s current owners to show that they can deliver the returns promised by Intesa’s Carlo Messina.
The other big ‘mean reversion’ play – namely aerospace – is also notching some big gains, with Rolls Royce (LON:RR) shares rebounding some 6.4% from Friday’s sharp drop,  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) shares rising 4.5% and Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) rising 2.9%. Again, there’s little in the way of news flow to justify the movement. The only data of note on Monday, German factory orders and Spanish industrial production, both came in below expectations."

(Reuters) - European shares headed towards a one-month high on Monday, with a rally in China's markets setting an upbeat tone as investors banked on the world's second biggest economy to lead a recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.6%, as stocks exposed to China, including carmakers (SXAP), industrials (SXNP), energy firms (SXEP) and luxury goods makers, gained strongly.
The German DAX (GDAXI), London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) all rose about 2%.
China's blue-chip index (CSI300) jumped over 5%, as investors stocked up on cheap funding to invest in an economy that analysts predict will recover faster and better than other major countries battling new waves of infections. [.SS]
""They (China) were the first to get hit by the virus, and that's the sort of timeline that other economies in the world can expect for a bounce back,"" said Michael Baker, an analyst at ETX Capital in London.
""The only concern is the United States. That's a spanner in the works.""
In the first four days of July alone, 15 states have reported record increases in new cases of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 3 million Americans and killed about 130,000, according to a Reuters tally.
Optimism from Asia spilled over to European trading session, with HSBC (L:HSBA),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) offering the biggest boost to the STOXX 600.
Europe's battered banking index (SX7P) jumped 4%, touching its highest level since June 10. 
UK homebuilders  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV) were the top gainers, surging about 6% after reports that British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak planned to raise a property tax threshold, among other steps to reduce the economic toll of the health crisis. (L)
Barratt said it was starting the new financial year with ""cautious optimism"" as its forward order book improved.
Sonova (S:SOON), the world's biggest hearing aid maker, rose 5.0% after saying it would close some stores and cut jobs as it expects first-half results to only partially recover from the pandemic hit.
Nordic banking group Nordea (HE:NDAFI) rose 3.0% after it agreed to buy the occupational and individual pension portfolios from Frende Livsforsikring AS.

Swiss speciality chemicals group  Clariant  (S:CLN) slumped 13.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600 on trading ex-dividend.

396,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>",Chipmaker SMIC Eyes China’s Biggest Share Sale in a Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. is preparing to raise as much as $7.5 billion via mainland China’s largest stock sale in a decade, a big cash infusion for a chipmaker Beijing’s counting on to reduce reliance on American technology.
China’s top homegrown chipmaker could sell as much as 53.2 billion yuan of shares, according to a Sunday filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In May, analysts estimated a Shanghai listing could fetch somewhere in the $3 billion range. The offering would be the largest since Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd.’s 68.5 billion yuan initial public offering in 2010. SMIC’s Hong Kong stock jumped 21% to a record Monday, racking up its biggest gain since 2009 after mainland bourses surged.
China’s biggest contract manufacturer of chipsets represents a major piece of Beijing’s vision to create a self-reliant and world-class semiconductor industry, particularly as Washington tightens restrictions on sales of silicon and software to the nation. SMIC plans to use the stock-sale proceeds to develop next-generation chipmaking to try and compete with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Like TSMC, SMIC is a so-called foundry that helps fabricate chips based on other companies’ designs, and could prove key to Huawei Technologies Co. if Washington follows through on threats to choke off its pivotal semiconductor business.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
SMIC benefits the most from China’s push for self sufficiency in semiconductor supply. Rising research expenses to develop next-generation production technology may be the biggest drag on profitability growth. Sales gains could be constrained by delays in acquiring fabrication tools from foreign manufacturers.
- Charles Shum, analyst

SMIC’s shares have more than tripled in Hong Kong since March’s bottom, while the Hang Seng Index is up just 21%, on bets that trade friction with the U.S. will force Beijing to focus more on homegrown tech and products that replace imports. China’s state-backed funds pumped $2.25 billion into a SMIC wafer plant in May.
The effort comes at a time the Trump administration is threatening to deny domestic companies like SMIC or Huawei access to crucial components and circuitry. SMIC’s listing is also a boost for the STAR market, which has struggled to attract major technology companies since its launch last year.
The initial institutional offer for the shares was 165 times oversubscribed. China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund will subscribe to 3.52 billion yuan of the offering as a strategic investor while Singapore’s sovereign fund, GIC Pte., will invest 3.32 billion yuan.

LONDON (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) index compiler FTSE Russell began publishing forward-looking interest rates on Monday, entering a four-way race for a new market opened up by the scrapping of Libor next year.
Regulators want the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor, which banks were fined for trying to rig, replaced with the Bank of England's Sonia rate for sterling denominated swaps, loans and futures by the end of 2021.
But market participants have said that the Sonia overnight rate lacks the forward-looking variants or ""tenors"" that Libor has, making it harder to switch some contracts like interest rate swaps.
FTSE Russell said its Term Sonia Reference Rates or TSRR will be published on an indicative basis for six months to allow potential users to track its performance first.
It will cover 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month tenors, with live rates set to be published by the end of 2020.
""We have partnered with a diverse mix of market participants to offer an indicative forward-looking risk-free rate for Sterling in multiple tenors,"" said Arne Staal, the LSE's global head of research in information services.
Ending the use of Libor is one of the biggest challenges faced by global markets in decades given its use in derivatives, swaps, loans, credit cards and mortgages worth around $400 trillion.
FTSE Russell, part of the London Stock Exchange (L:LSE) is competing with ICE (N:ICE), which is already the administrator for Libor, IHS Markit, and Refinitiv - which the LSE wants to buy - to become the go-to provider of Sonia term rates.

Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which owns Reuters News, has a 45% stake in Refinitiv.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday amid hopes of a global economic recovery, but concerns remain over the increasing number of new coronavirus cases.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.1% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 2%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 2.2%.
Economic data of late has tended to point to a reasonably prompt economic recovery around the world. 
Earlier Monday, German factory orders jumped 10.4% in May, rebounding after falling by a revised 26.2% the previous month.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) senior economist Katherina Utermoehl said via Twitter that the data point to a ""much more gradual recovery"" than in retail, ""due in particular to weak foreign demand."" 
""BUT as deconfinement in key countries only kicked off in May, June should have more oomph,"" Utermoehl added.
This follows on from the U.S. recording the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June, much more than expected, while PMI data in China and throughout Europe have tended to suggest renewed confidence in a brisk pickup in activity.
Additionally, the U.S. Congress is set to resume talks on the next stimulus bill later this month. The likely need for additional stimulus grows as the number of Covid-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The World Health Organization reported the highest number of cases over a 24-hour period, with both Texas and Florida reporting new one-day records for new infections on Saturday.
Turning back to Europe, Boohoo (LON:BOOH) stock slumped 11% following a media report on the working conditions at one of its suppliers. The British online fashion retailer said on Monday it would terminate relationships with any supplier who was found not to be acting within its code of conduct.
Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) stock rose 2.7% after the British group’s CEO, Antonio Horta-Osorio, said he will step down at the end of next year. Rivals banks HSBC (LON:HSBA) rose 6% and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) 5%, benefitting from their links to Asia given the big equity rally in that part of the world.
Later in the session, the June construction PMI release from the U.K. will be published, as will eurozone retail sales for May.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday, although the continued growth of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. resulted in underperformance by the American benchmark, WTI futures.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased by almost 56,000 on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University. raising concerns that this jump could hit oil demand in the United States.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",One of Japan’s Largest Employers Plans to Cut Office Space by 50%,"(Bloomberg) -- While much of Japan continues to debate the pros and cons of remote working, one of the country’s largest employers has made up its mind -- and it could be a bad sign for the office sector.
 Fujitsu Ltd.  (T:6702) said it will cut its office space in Japan by 50% over the next three years, encouraging 80,000 office workers to primarily work from home in what it termed a “Work Life Shift for the new normal.”
“We will change the conventional concept of workers commuting to a fixed office and, through high autonomy and mutual trust between employees, deliver value to clients,” Fujitsu said in a statement.
The plan calls for a 5,000 yen ($464) a month stipend for workers to set up their home office environment in lieu of an existing commuting allowance and turning all existing offices to “hot-desking,” an approach many offices are currently discouraging to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Fujitsu is Japan’s 17th largest publicly traded employer, according to Bloomberg data, with almost 130,000 workers in total. Factory employees won’t be impacted by the move.
Fujitsu also recently made headlines as the maker of the world fastest supercomputer, named Fugaku, which is being used to help identify potential Covid-19 treatments and predict the flow of virus-laden droplets.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Kota Ezawa raised his price target for the stock by 28% on Friday, saying the company will likely avoid a “severe deterioration” in its upcoming earnings.
While some of Fujitsu’s initiative could be driven by marketing concerns -- the company sells technology that supports remote working -- it doesn’t augur well for Japan’s office sector in a post-Covid-19 world.
Tokyo Offices Seen Facing Record Vacancies on Shift to Telework
Many traditionally-minded companies have called for employees to return to their offices, but face resistance among their staff. A survey conducted in May by the Japan Productivity Center found that more than 60% of those questioned wanted to continue working remotely even after the pandemic is contained.
Fujitsu is the second major company in recent days to bow to that sentiment. Snack maker Calbee Inc. introduced a system for its 800 office workers to work from home full-time, with no obligation to travel to the office. It expects about 30% of its staff to go to the office.
Tokyo’s office vacancies have begun to tick up over the past months, rising to 1.64% in May according to Miki Shoji Co. data. Vacancies have risen for three straight months for the first time since 2012. Data for June is set to be released on Thursday.
A falling job-to-applicant ratio also “flashes a warning signal” for Tokyo office leasing demand, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Patrick Wong wrote in a July 3 report.

401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",Turkey Bans Six Global Banks From Bets Against Nation’s Stocks,"(Bloomberg) --
Turkey imposed a ban on six foreign banks from betting against the nation’s stocks in a move that appeared to contradict recent steps toward easing such restrictions.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., Merrill Lynch International,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Plc,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, and Wood & Co. have been barred from short-selling stocks for up to three months, Borsa Istanbul said in a statement.
The announcement comes less than week after the country’s Capital Markets Regulator removed a short-selling ban on its largest listed companies on June 30, easing a restriction introduced in October 2019 to help shield the country’s markets from various bouts of volatility this year.
Last month, MSCI Inc. warned that it may start a consultation on a proposal to reclassify the MSCI Turkey Index to frontier-market or stand-alone status in the coming months if the “already deteriorating accessibility level of the Turkish equity market were to worsen.”
Investors say that would lead to sizable stock outflows and reputational damage. Authorities have already burnt bridges with foreign investors by drastically limiting their access to the currency and making it difficult from them to trade Turkish assets. Earlier this year, the banking regulator briefly barred  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and UBS from trading the lira altogether.
The heavy-handed approach has compounded an outflow of capital, with foreign investors reducing their share of the local-currency bond market to a record low of less than 5%. They have pulled $4.4 billion from Turkey’s equity market over the past 12 months, the biggest exodus since at least 2015.

The U.S. automaker's Chongqing-based venture with Changan (SZ:000625) said on Monday its sales jumped 7.7% from a year earlier. It did not disclose the number of vehicles sold.
Ford's new SUV models including Escape, Edge and Explorer are selling well and contributed to growth in past months, it said in a statement.
Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (SZ:000550), in which Ford owns a stake, said in a filing last week that it sold 39,192 vehicles last month, up 67% year on year. JMC sells Ford-branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and vans as well as JMC-branded commercial vehicles.
The ventures also saw sales up in April and May, putting the Dearborn, Michigan-based company on track for its first quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2017. It said the aging model lineup caused the sales slide.
Ford's rival General Motors (N:GM) said its sales in China dropped 5.3% between April and June.

Citi equity strategists are recommending clients play it safe by holding U.S. stocks and healthcare shares and reducing exposure to bank shares, as earnings are likely to take a while to recover from the coronavirus fallout.
""The bullish push from $6 trillion of global quantitative easing is likely to cancel out the bearish drag from the ongoing lockdown,"" the investment bank's equity strategists said in a note published late on Sunday.
Restrictive measures imposed to contain the virus has ravaged economic activity and hurt demand for risky assets in recent months, but their impact has been offset somewhat by huge asset buying from central banks, which has supported confidence.
""We would not chase markets higher from current levels,"" the strategists said.
The note forecasts the S&P 500 (SPX) to be at 3,160 points in mid-2021, about 1% higher than Friday's close. It expects other major markets from Australia (AXJO) to Europe (STOXX) and Japan (TOPX) to be similarly steady.
The outlook is broadly similar to that outlined by HSBC Private Banking last week, and a touch more downbeat than  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) which is slightly more positive on equities.

Citi said financials will struggle with prolonged low interest rates, and are best avoided, in favour of defensives such as health care. Citi upgraded its recommendation for the materials sector to overweight and downgraded consumer staples.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Monday amid hopes of a global economic recovery aided by more stimulus, but concerns remain over the increasing number of new coronavirus cases.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.4% higher. CAC 40 futures in France were up 1.9%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 1%.
Economic data of late has tended to point to a reasonably prompt economic recovery around the world. The U.S. recorded last week the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June, much more than expected, while PMI data in China and throughout Europe has tended to suggest renewed confidence of a brisk pickup in activity.
Additionally, the U.S. Congress is set to resume talks on the next stimulus bill later this month, while Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, will be keen to cement the structure of a Covid-19 recovery fund as it now has the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
A meeting of euro area finance ministers on Thursday could be telling before a looming July 17-18 summit - crucial to securing agreement on a recovery fund.
The likely need for additional stimulus grows as the number of Covid-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The World Health Organization reported the highest number of cases over a 24-hour period, with the U.S. reporting a spike in cases over the long holiday weekend.
Turning back to Europe, Swiss manufacturer  Geberit  (SIX:GEBN)said Monday that its sales fell 9.8% in the first half of the year due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
German factory orders continued the recent data trend of suggesting a recovery, jumping 10.4% in May, admittedly slightly below estimates, after falling by a revised 26.2% the previous month.
Later in the session, the June construction PMI release from the U.K. will be studied, as will eurozone retail sales for May.
Oil prices traded in a mixed fashion Monday, as the continued growth of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. weighed on the American benchmark, WTI futures, while the global benchmark Brent futures posted small gains on falling supply.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased by almost 56,000 on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University. raising concerns that this jump could hit oil demand in the United States.
Elsewhere, production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, has fallen to its lowest in decades, as the group cuts output by a record 9.7 million barrels per day for a third month in July. 
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $40.58 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $43.19.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,782.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1290, up 0.4% on the day.

China's economy is recovering, while its capital markets are undergoing reform and attracting money from home and abroad, setting the scene for a healthy bull market, the official China Securities Journal said in an editorial on Monday.
The commentary from the newspaper, which is affiliated to the state-run Xinhua News Agency, points to government support for a further stock market run-up following a recent strong rebound. China's blue-chip index (CSI300) jumped over 4% on Monday morning to a fresh five-year high.
A vibrant capital market can help the Chinese economy ""breed new opportunities in crisis, and break new ground in a changing world"", the editorial said.
China has been stepping up capital market reforms amid tech-related tensions with the United States, while relations have worsened due to the coronavirus, which U.S. President Donald Trump blamed China for mishandling. 
With the global supply chain being reshaped and power rivalries intensifying, China will be aided by a mature financial market, the editorial said.
The country introduced a U.S.-style, registration-based system for new listings on its Nasdaq-style STAR Market launched a year ago, and is replicating the reform on Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext.

The new mechanism and other reform measures have laid the foundation for a ""healthy bull"" market, which is also being fueled by evidence of the country's strong economic recovery, the editorial said.

Shares for the pharmaceutical arm of conglomerate SK Holdings opened at KRW98,000 on July 2 on their debut, and quickly hit the KRW127,000 KOSPI market limit, which prohibits stock from increasing 30% daily. The company followed up the soaring debut to close at KRW165,000, or a 29.92% gain, a day later.
The IPO priced the offering of 19.57 million shares at KRW49,000, the top of the range, in June. The company raked in around KRW959.30 billion ($799.07 million).
SK Biopharmaceuticals’ successful outing has raised hopes for other biopharmaceutical companies who have delayed their plans to list due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility in the equities market.

TOKYO/BANGALORE (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) has no plans to increase board oversight of its $100 billion Vision Fund, two sources said, disregarding calls from activist investor Elliott Management and signalling governance reforms have stopped short of the fund.
In recent months Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has met other Elliott demands, from launching a 2.5 trillion yen ($23 billion) buyback - vital to propping up SoftBank's share price - to increasing the number of outside directors including the board's only woman.
However even after a disastrous run betting on startups like office-sharing firm WeWork that plunged the Japanese conglomerate to its biggest-ever annual loss, power structures at the Vision Fund remain largely intact.
U.S. hedge fund Elliott asked SoftBank to create a subcommittee at board level to oversee and aid the Vision Fund's investment process, sources previously told Reuters. [nL8N2AP01V]
SoftBank has pushed back against creating such a committee, with executives arguing investments already vetted by top management and $3-5 billion deals put to the large limited partners, said one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified as the matter was private. 
SoftBank declined to comment. Elliott did not respond to a request for comment.
The fund's poor performance scuppered plans to raise a further mega fund from investors including the first fund's anchor backers, the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
Saudi's Public Investment Fund did not respond to a request for comment. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala declined to comment. 
Son is well-known for his gut-led investment style and retains final say on investments. He is joined on the fund's own committee by managing partner Saleh Romeih and fund head Rajeev Misra - whose remuneration doubled last year. 
The India-born ex-Deutsche Bank AG (DE:DBKGn) investor is synonymous with the fund, meaning his position there is secure despite the poor performance, one of the sources said.
International media have cited documents and unidentified sources outlining efforts by Misra to get ahead of rivals at the organisation. SoftBank has denied the veracity of the reports.
Following the WeWork debacle, Son pledged to improve oversight of portfolio firms and end bailouts of those which struggle.
Recent governance changes at group level include the creation of a nominating and remuneration committee chaired by an outside director.
One key role for nominating committees is succession planning. 62-year-old Son last month said he may continue leading SoftBank beyond the end of his sixties. [nL4N2E20SO]
The reforms bring SoftBank closer to Western norms but governance experts said there are still few checks on Son himself. [nL4N2D000N]

Uber and Postmates did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Monday morning, soaring to highs not seen in almost four months even amid increasing COVID-19 figures.
Investors are relying on cheap liquidity and hopes of more stimulus measures from governments to kickstart their economies. But the number of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down, with over 11.4 million global cases as of July 6 according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The World Health Organization reported the highest number of cases over a 24-hour period over the weekend, with many U.S. states reporting a spike in cases over the long holiday weekend.
China’s Shanghai Composite jumped 3.68% by 10:55 PM ET (3:55 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 2.40%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 2.34%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.44%, with Yuriko Koike winning around 60% of the vote for a second term as Tokyo’s governor on Monday.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.46% and the ASX 200 was up 0.14%.
Nomura analysts said in a note, “We think there is a case for raising tactical allocation on Asian equities in the context of global equity portfolios... we see a number of catalysts that could drive Asia ex-Japan equities’ outperformance over U.S. equities in the near term. Better COVID-19 trends and mobility data in economies/markets that dominate the Asia ex-Japan index should translate into faster economic recovery vs the U.S.”
But other investors remained cautious with the number of U.S. cases approaching 3 million and simmering U.S.-China tensions.
“It is very clear that the U.S. never got the COVID outbreak under control the way that other countries did. By reopening the economy too soon, we have seen a frightening increase in the pace of new cases. So markets will have to climb a wall of worry in July as economic activity likely softens from the V-shaped recovery seen over recent months. We must remember too that U.S. and China relations are deteriorating noticeably,” Robert Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac, told Reuters."

415,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 07:36PM ET</span>",Buffett’s Berkshire Ends Deal Drought With Dominion Bet,"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett finally found his next crisis-era deal.
His  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa), which has stayed relatively quiet during the tumult of the coronavirus pandemic, broke its silence at the end of a holiday weekend with its biggest acquisition in more than four years. The agreement for Dominion Energy Inc.’s natural gas pipeline and storage assets signaled to the market that Buffett is willing to pounce despite his cautious tone in May about the pandemic, according to David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business.
“He’s willing to make investments now, of a fairly sizable amount,” Kass said. “It’s very positive that he’s sending a signal for the right deal at the right price, $10 billion or more, ‘We’re ready to go, we’re ready to invest.’”
Buffett, who has crafted Berkshire into a conglomerate valued at $434 billion, built his reputation as an investor able to swoop in during volatile markets to strike unique and complicated deals in past crises. After being stymied on the acquisition front during the recent bull market for stocks, Buffett still wasn’t striking any deals during the initial stages of the pandemic and even dumped his stakes in the major U.S. airlines.
His inability to make a major acquisition recently has drawn scrutiny from his critics who have argued that Buffett has lost his ability to pull off the game-changing transactions that helped vault Berkshire into the ranks of the most valuable U.S. public companies. Now, the deal to buy substantially all of Dominion Energy’s natural gas transmission and storage assets for $4 billion, along with the assumption of $5.7 billion in debt, shows that Buffett is willing to put his money to work, Kass said.
“We are very proud to be adding such a great portfolio of natural gas assets to our already strong energy business,” Buffett, who is chief executive officer and chairman of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, said in a statement Sunday.
“I’m inspired to see that, given that he’s bearish, he’s still willing to make acquisitions where he thinks it makes sense and where it meets Berkshire’s hurdle points,” said Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, which invests in Berkshire shares.
Buffett has considered its energy business one of the “lead dogs” of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations alongside its railroad. Berkshire’s purchase expands its hold in the sector, adding more infrastructure to handle natural gas to its already sprawling energy operations across states such as Nevada and Iowa. Berkshire also struck the deal at a low point in the market. Natural gas futures in the U.S. dropped last month to their lowest point in 25 years and have recovered just slightly since then.
“This looks like confirmation that commodities like energy are undervalued,” Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which owns Berkshire shares, said in an emailed comment. “At the bottom, assets move from weak hands to strong hands.”
Berkshire is digging deeper into a business that’s been facing increasing scrutiny amid the push for energy companies to shift away from fossil fuels. In its own statement on Sunday, Dominion Energy cited its target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
The deal also highlights the work of one of Buffett’s key deputies, Greg Abel, who led the energy business for years and is now chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy alongside his role as Berkshire’s vice chairman for all non-insurance businesses. Abel has gained a reputation as a key dealmaker for Berkshire with the 2013 purchase of NV Energy and even the battle to buy Oncor Electric Delivery Co., which didn’t ultimately come together. Abel is viewed as a potential successor to Buffett, 89.
The Dominion deal is set to be Berkshire’s largest acquisition ranked by enterprise value since its purchase of Precision Castparts Corp. in 2016. Still, Buffett ended the first quarter with a record $137 billion on hand and has been hankering for an “elephant-sized acquisition” to put a chunk of his cash pile to work. The Dominion agreement’s total enterprise value would account for about 7% of that total.
“It’s not something that’s going to move the needle from a balance sheet standpoint, but it’ll produce several hundred million dollars a year in net income to Berkshire,” said Cheviot’s Pollock. “That’s no paltry sum. That adds up over time.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - At Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930), demand for its chips from data centres bulking up to meet a surge in work-from-home traffic was not likely enough to offset muted sales of its smartphones in the second quarter, analysts said.
The world's biggest supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips on Tuesday will announce preliminary April-June revenue as well as operating profit, which it previously expected to show a decline.
Profit likely fell 4.5% to 6.3 trillion won ($5.25 billion) from the same period year earlier, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, which is weighted towards the more consistently accurate analysts.
Work-from-home orders and growth in online learning is underpinning chip demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting U.S. DRAM supplier Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) to forecast strong quarterly revenue last month.
Chips bring in roughly half of Samsung's profit. The rest is mainly smartphones, of which the South Korean firm is the world's largest maker.
""With improved demand, a spike in DRAM prices helped Samsung continue with a solid performance in the second quarter,"" said analyst Park Sung-soon at Cape Investment & Securities. 
Those price increases were likely driven by data centres stockpiling chips and so are unlikely to continue, analysts said. Though DRAM prices jumped 14% in the quarter, they were flat in June versus May, showed data from DRAMeXchange.
""Until uncertainty stemming from the pandemic goes away, the sector's outlook isn't too positive,"" said CW Chung, Nomura head of research in Korea.
In smartphones, Hyundai Motor Securities estimated Samsung's operating profit fell 16% in April-June.
Gadget sales have fallen along with discretionary spending during the pandemic. Samsung's smartphone shipments hit a low in April and is likely to take time to recover, analysts said.
Samsung's display business - whose customers include Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] - is likely to post a second consecutive quarter of loss, analysts said.

The firm will likely release detailed earnings figures later this month.

SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - China has suspended imports from two Brazilian pork plants owned by meatpackers JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) and BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), according to the Chinese customs authority, as it cracks down on meat shipments amid concerns about the new coronavirus.
China is temporarily halting imports from a BRF plant in Lajeado and a JBS-owned Seara brand plant in Tres Passos, both in Brazil's southern Rio Grande do Sul state, according to a posting dated Saturday on the General Administration of Customs China (GACC) website.
The posting, which only identified the plants by registration numbers, gives no reason for the suspension. But Brazil is reeling from the second worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world behind the United States.
China is the largest buyer of Brazilian pork, beef and chicken. It has requested that meat exporters globally certify their products are coronavirus free, which BRF, JBS and other Brazilian meatpackers have already done.
A total of six Brazil meat plants have now been blocked from exporting to China amid rising concerns over thousands of cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, among slaughterhouse workers in the country.
BRF said it was not given a reason for the suspension, which it only discovered via the GACC website. But the company said it was already working with Brazilian and Chinese authorities to reestablish exports from the facility as quickly as possible.
JBS said in a statement it would not comment on the decision. It was taking various measures to ensure its food is of the highest quality and that its workers are protected, JBS said.
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said it would only comment after it received an official communication from China on the matter, which it has not received.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy is buying Dominion Energy Transmission, Questar Pipeline, Carolina Gas Transmission, 50% of the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, and 25% of the Cove Point liquefied natural gas facility in Maryland.
Dominion will retain 50% of Cove Point.  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) owns 25%.
The Berkshire unit will also assume $5.7 billion of debt, giving the transaction a $9.7 billion enterprise value. It expects a fourth-quarter closing, pending regulatory approvals.
""We are very proud to be adding such a great portfolio of natural gas assets to our already strong energy business,"" Buffett said in a statement.
Dominion expects up to 90% of future operating earnings to come from utilities.
The company and  Duke Energy  Inc (N:DUK) separately announced on Sunday they would abandon their $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, running under the Appalachian Trail and through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.
Dominion and Duke cited delays and uncertain costs, despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision last month. 
Berkshire controls 91.1% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which owns the MidAmerican Energy, NV Energy and PacifiCorp utilities, natural gas pipelines, wind power assets and electricity businesses in Britain and Canada.
The unit accounted for 12% of Berkshire's $23.97 billion of operating profit in 2019. Its chairman, Greg Abel, is also a Berkshire vice chairman.
Berkshire ended March with $137.2 billion of cash, reflecting Buffett's four-year inability to find major acquisitions, even as the coronavirus pandemic took hold and stock prices plunged.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined additional comment.

Wirecard last week filed for insolvency owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a 1.9 billion euros ($2.14 billion) hole in its accounts that auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The legal complexity of coordinating between different authorities and auditors led to gaps arising in the supervision of Wirecard's accounts. 
""I want to give BaFin more control rights over financial reports, regardless of whether or not a company has a banking section,"" he said in an interview with Sunday paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS).
Scholz said that BaFin's protection mechanisms against accountants' conflicts of interest must be improved.
He would propose rotating auditors to ensure more independence, and to examine whether the big accountancy companies - which apart from EY in Wirecard's case include KPMG, PwC, Deloitte - should be both advising and monitoring one company at the same time.
He would back plans to give BaFin more funding and staff to undertake special and wider audits.
""No-one should assume it is enough to hold your breath and hope for the best,"" he said. ""We will have to clarify in each area what went wrong.""

BaFin president Felix Hufeld, who has defended BaFin's record in the Wirecard crisis, was doing a good job, Scholz said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -  El Al 's (TA:ELAL) fate is expected to be decided in the coming days, with the Israeli airline looking to reach a deal with workers on job and spending cuts to get government aid.
An official at El Al, which has put almost all of its 6,500 workers on unpaid leave and suspended passenger service, told Reuters that its board will choose between two proposals.
Avi Edri, chairperson of the transport workers union at the Histadrut labour federation, said 2,000 job cuts are likely, as well as salary reductions to pilots.
""Without (government) money El Al will go bankrupt,"" Edri said. ""We don't have any choice but to dismiss workers.""
El Al has signed a deal with flight attendants and is in talks with mechanics and pilots.
Of the two proposals on the table, one includes $400 million in bank loans, 82.5% guaranteed by the state, and El Al issuing 150 million shekels ($43 million) in shares, requiring capital from controlling shareholders.
A second is a $250 million, 75% state-backed loan plus a $150 million share offer, in which the government commits to buy whatever shares are not purchased by the public.
Either decision will drastically alter El Al since a key condition for receiving the loans is achieving $400 million of cost savings a year.
El Al will also give up some of its fleet of short-haul Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 aircraft and eliminate unprofitable routes, although it will likely keep all its Boeing 787s, the official said.
The airline, which owes some $350 million in customer refunds due to cancelled flights after Israel closed its borders, lost $140 million in the first quarter.

Even before the coronavirus outbreak, El Al faced increased competition, but the official said that it will eventually be profitable due to the drop in expenses.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",German union in show of strength as Commerzbank's top duo exits,"By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank's (DE:CBKG) chief executive and chairman were under pressure from activist investors to axe jobs, but they decided to go first after a damaging clash with unions last week, sources close to the situation told Reuters.
With nearly 12,000 jobs at stake, a quarter of the Commerzbank workforce, divisions came to a head when labour representatives blocked a supervisory board meeting to discuss the future of Germany's second largest bank.
Although precipitated by a public campaign for change by U.S. activist investor Cerberus, one of its top shareholders, the sudden resignations of both CEO Martin Zielke and chairman Stefan Schmittmann came as a shock. 
Even Cerberus, which has called Commerzbank ""disastrous"", had wanted an orderly transition, firstly with changes to its supervisory board, and then to its management.
But behind the scenes, unions were working on their own separate resistance campaign. This played a significant role in the upheaval, interviews with those involved and documents show.
Union officials, irate that Commerzbank's management refused to provide them with documentation to prepare in advance of a supervisory board meeting, cried foul and got it called off.
""Not in our name! Why Verdi got a supervisory board meeting postponed"", the union said in a two-page flyer to employees.
While underscoring the enduring power of organised white-collar labour in corporate Germany, the episode has also prompted some of Commerzbank's biggest shareholders to call privately for improved dialogue with the unions, whose representatives make up half of corporate boards.
One of Commerzbank's top shareholders believes Zielke and Schmittmann had a bad track record working with staff, and that this must change, a person with direct knowledge of the investor's thinking said.
""This is a chance to restart the relationship.""
A person close to Zielke and Schmittmann said that they did their best to work with labour, but 40 different works councils at Commerzbank, each with competing interests, complicated this.
""There were too many open flanks,"" a boss of the Verdi union, Jan Duscheck, said after the resignations, citing unruly investors and job cut proposals. ""In the end, the conflict with Verdi and the works councils came to a head.""
'DOOMED TO FAILURE'
For Stefan Wittmann, a Verdi union official who sits on Commerzbank's supervisory board, the issue is not so much about job cuts but the strategy the bank has for those who remain.
""A strategy against the interests of the workforce is doomed to failure,"" Wittmann told employees.
The sudden departure of Commerzbank's top management duo means that a board meeting planned for Wednesday is more likely to focus more on its leadership turmoil than its strategy.
It had promised to publish a strategy review by August at the latest, but the timing is now an open question.
""Commerzbank can't afford a drawn-out power vacuum ... A successor for Zielke must be found quickly,"" Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, a top-10 investor in Commerzbank, said of the rare dual resignation.
While it was Zielke who first broached resignation, this got Schmittmann thinking about his own future, the chairman told employees in an intranet post seen by Reuters.

""If the coach of the team leaves, then you also have to ask yourself as 'club president' if his evaluation of the situation applies to you as well,"" Schmittmann said.

Guevarra said the immigration officers who inputted the fictitious entries have been relieved of their duties and face administrative sanctions.
""The investigation has now turned to persons who made the false entries in the database, their motives and their cohorts,"" Guevarra told reporters.
Marsalek, 40, was fired as COO of the German firm on June 18 after auditor EY refused to sign off on Wirecard's accounts. The company, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, collapsed a week later owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a $2.1 billion hole in its accounts that auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The missing money was purportedly held in escrow accounts at two Philippine banks, which have denied any links with the Wirecard. 
Guevarra said it was possible Marsalek could be in the country, telling Reuters, ""Notwithstanding the Bureau of Immigration report, I do not totally discount the possibility that Marsalek may be in the Philippines.""
""We are an island country, and there are backdoors through which undocumented foreigners may slip through,"" he said. 
Munich prosecutors obtained arrest warrants against ex-CEO Markus Braun and Marsalek on June 22. Braun turned himself in that day, but Marsalek has disappeared and his mobile number is no longer in service.
Both are suspected of market manipulation, false accounting and fraud, while the circle of suspects has widened to the entire management board of Wirecard.
Marsalek's lawyer has declined all requests for comment.
Marsalek had oversight of Wirecard's Asian operations, which are at the centre of suspicion by auditors and prosecutors of attempts to falsely inflate cash balances, turnover and profit. 
Guevarra said earlier immigration records had shown that Marsalek had been in the Philippines from March 3 to 5.

428,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 04, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Boeing,"By Geoffrey Smith and Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) has had a dreadful year in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the outlook for the aerospace giant after the March 2019 grounding of its 737 Max jet. But shares climbed around 25% in June, cutting back steep losses for the year amid signs that the worst may be over.
Geoffrey Smith argues the bull case for Boeing which revolves around the growth outlook for commercial aviation. Liz Moyer counters that fundamentals don’t bode well for the company’s outlook. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The bull case
The very long-term bull case revolves around the question of whether the company’s management is right on its call that the Covid pandemic will not, ultimately, end the secular growth in commercial aviation.
“The fundamentals that have driven air travel for the past five decades and doubled air traffic over the past two decades remain intact,” Boeing’s new CEO David Calhoun said on the company’s last earnings call. “We believe this industry will recover but it will take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends.”
The reasonable assumption that Calhoun and his team understand their own business still leaves you a three-year fallow period in which you can probably expect better returns elsewhere with your money, but does not mean Boeing is destined to long-term decline like a department store or a shopping mall owner. Wide-bodied aircraft and servicing attack helicopters are not businesses that are crying out for disruption. Aerospace is still a good business to be in for the long haul.
That’s particularly true given that nearly half of Boeing’s business comes from defense and space. The Starliner capsule charge is likely to be merely a short-term embarrassment, and in any case only a rounding error compared to the 737 MAX problems. Together, the defense and global services businesses have order backlogs of some $87 billion, which they can reasonably expect to process at an operating margin well over 10%.
Investors can have legitimate concerns about Boeing’s debt, and its long-term trajectory will remain unclear there is clarity on its compensation liabilities to airlines and on their willingness to stick with past orders. That’s a question that will take a couple of years to answer. But the existential risk of insolvency is as good as ruled out by its strategic importance, both as a keystone employer, and as a key defense contractor. The Federal Reserve’s program for buying corporate debt is expressly tailored to keeping the borrowing costs of such companies under control.  The company has taken a hell of a hit, but there’s life in the old dog yet.
The bear case
To make the bear case on Boeing, look no further than the fundamentals.
Revenue has fallen sharply since the beginning of 2019, accelerating after the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets and the globe-straddling Covid-19 virus that has seriously interrupted international and domestic air travel. First quarter revenue was down 26% over last year. Full-year 2019 revenue fell 25%.
Boeing recorded a loss of $1.70 a share in the first quarter, citing the effects of Covid-19 and the 737 MAX issues. Free cash flow was a negative $4.7 billion.
In the year earlier period, EPS was $3.16 and revenue was $16.9 billion. Right now, the consensus of analysts tracked by Briefing.com says second quarter will be a loss of $2.17 a share on revenue of $14.3 billion. 
The company's commercial airplane division saw revenue plummet 48% in the first quarter, and deliveries of aircraft cut by two-thirds. As a result Boeing has had to slow down production. Its 787 plane production will fall to 10 a month this year from 14 and gradually shrink to 7 a month in 2022. Its 777 production will be three a month next year.
This comes as airlines from all over the world have canceled orders or delayed delivery. Late last month, the airplane leasing company BOC Aviation canceled an order for 30 737 MAX planes, and Norwegian Air Shuttle scuttled plans to buy 92 737 MAX jets and five 787 Dreamliners.
 Some airlines are suing Boeing to recoup money they paid in advance for orders they have since canceled. 
And it's not just passenger aircraft that is vexing the company. In its space business, Boeing's Starliner capsule has been having issues, forcing the company to take a $410 million charge in the fourth quarter in case it has to redo a test flight after failing to reach the correct orbit to dock with the International Space Station.
Boeing suspended its dividend in March and put a pause on share buybacks indefinitely. Its CEO will forgo pay.
A v-shaped recovery – both in economic terms and in terms of virus mitigation – would help Boeing, especially if air travel returned to somewhat normal. But spikes in Covid-19 cases around the world, forcing the reversal of business reopening efforts, don't bode well for Boeing's near-term."

The country's CySEC commission said Commerzbank had been sanctioned over investment operations conducted by the now-defunct Laiki - also known as Cyprus Popular Bank - in 2011, following Laiki's merger with Greece's Marfin-Egnatia Bank.
Commerzbank declined to comment on the case, which followed an eight-year probe by Cypriot authorities.
The investigation, which was launched following calls by left-wing AKEL lawmaker Irene Charalambides, looked into whether the Cypriot deals may have broken laws prohibiting a company from buying its own stock.
CySEC said Laiki invested in two structured products issued by Commerzbank in 2008. Marfin-Egnatia, which was at that time a Laiki subsidiary, was an index sponsor responsible for the composition of the portfolio.
As a result of the 2011 merger between Laiki and Marfin-Egnatia, Laiki became the index sponsor, creating a conflict of interest, CySEC said.
It said Laiki and Commerzbank acted in ""concert"" to manipulate the market in relation to Laiki shares on several occasions in April and May 2011.
CySEC said it had not fined Laiki because it is in administration and did not want to put an additional burden on former depositors, bond holders and shareholders.
Laiki, once Cyprus's second-largest bank, was taken into administration and wound down under terms of a 10 billion euro ($13.56 billion) international financial assistance package to Cyprus in March 2013.
Some 4.3 billion euros in uninsured deposits exceeding the EU threshold of 100,000 were wiped out, and thousands of people lost their life savings.
Charalambides said she felt vindicated by the result of the investigation.

""The resolution authority should consider the possibility of civil lawsuits against Commerzbank to ensure that the funds channelled to these structured bonds, with the objective of manipulating shares, be returned, and given to depositors whose funds were subjected to a haircut,"" she said in a statement.

Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA) said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.
Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.
""You always need to keep thinking,"" Shell's Van Beurden told the newspaper. ""Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.""
A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEO's comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simplify its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years. 
Shell has a complex Anglo-Dutch holding structure with a tax residency and headquarters in the Netherlands and a registered office in Britain.
Unilever's decision to move followed the scrapping in 2018 of a plan by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to do away with a 15% dividend withholding tax.
Shell’s corporate structure features the parent company headquarters in The Hague but two share classes and other arrangements to prevent the Dutch government from levying withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders of its former British arm.
The arrangement has come under renewed scrutiny after the Dutch government tried to scrap the dividend tax as an incentive to convince Unilever to unify its dual structure in Rotterdam.
Rutte abandoned the plan after a popular outcry over the tax cut, which was seen as a gift to rich foreigners.

Shell has consistently lobbied against the dividend tax, which it says makes financing dividends, share buy-backs and acquisitions more difficult.

(Reuters) - Apparel company Lucky Brand Dungarees is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it said on Friday, becoming the latest retailer to fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic.
The firm said it had entered into a ""stalking horse asset purchase agreement"" with SPARC Group LLC, which owns brands such as Aeropostale and Nautica, for the sale of ""substantially all"" its operating assets.
Such a pact sets a starting bid or minimally accepted offer as a threshold for other potential buyers if they want to bid.
Lucky Brand estimated both assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million, its filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware showed.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted sales across all channels,"" the firm's interim chief executive, Matthew Kaness, said in the statement.
""While we are optimistic about the reopening of stores and our customers' return, the business has yet to recover fully.""
ABG-Lucky, a newly-formed unit of Authentic Brands Group, the brand manager which bought Barneys New York out of bankruptcy, will buy the intellectual property of Lucky Brand, the statement added.
The company said it had received new financing commitments from some existing lenders to ensure enough liquidity to fund the business through the closing of the sale.
The statement did not specify the amount of commitments received, adding that the company would operate its business during the Chapter 11 process.

The research arm of the world's biggest fund manager said two factors would support Europe's economy and financial markets in the coming months.
Success in restricting the spread of COVID-19 and signs that shopping and travel activity was rebounding meant: ""we could see the pace of recovery in the second half outpacing other regions, including the United States"".
It said the new 750-billion-euro European recovery plan was a ""crucial turning point"" too and will, for the first time, create a jointly issued European 'safe' asset of a meaningful size.

""As a result we maintain our overweight in European peripheral government bonds and are considering an upgrade to European equities,"" the BII's top strategists said in a weekly report.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Funds that rode the market's rally to generate the highest second-quarter returns included those invested in assets such as mining stocks, energy and technology.
Global financial markets staged an impressive rebound in the second quarter despite deepening economic pain from the coronavirus pandemic, with the U.S. equity benchmark S&P 500 index clocking its strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 1998.
That helped an overwhelming number of funds generate a positive return over the last three months, even as they remained down in the year to date.
Many sectors that suffered the steepest losses as broad parts of the global economy went under lockdown during the first three months posted the largest comebacks.
U.S. energy funds, as well as those domiciled in Europe, Asia and Africa, jumped around 30% during the quarter, alongside a 24% surge in industrial commodities and a 27.7% gain in U.S.-based small-cap funds, according to Morningstar data.
Despite those gains, each sector remains down 3% or more for the year to date.

While equity markets rebounded, investors remained cautious that unprecedented economic stimulus measures by global central banks would spark inflation.
U.S-based precious metal funds soared nearly 54% during the quarter, the most of any asset class, and are up nearly 13% for the year through June 28, according to Morningstar.
Overall, 282 out of 293 non-U.S.-domiciled global fund categories tracked by Morningstar posted gains in the second quarter, with agriculture funds suffering the worst loss with a 4.4% decline.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/rlgpdlowqpo/index.html
For the year to date, only 86 fund categories have a positive return, led by a 15.8% gain in precious metals funds and a 15.7% gain in biotechnology funds.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jznpnzkznpl/index.html
In the U.S., only 2 out of 107 fund categories - bear market funds, and managed futures - posted negative returns during the quarter. For the year to date, 71 fund categories are in the red, led by the 40% decline in energy equity funds.
""The market very quickly embraced that there was going to be a deep recession and investors are now looking forward to what that healing process will look like,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management Multi-Asset Solutions team.
A recent surge in U.S. coronavirus cases will likely not push financial markets into another panic because of gains in controlling the spread of the virus in Asia and Europe, Jacobsen said. The U.S. now accounts for a quarter of all coronavirus infections.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 was up as much as 25% at one point in the second quarter before pulling back to post a 16% gain, mirroring its 20% decline in the first three months.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgporkrevd/index.html
Those gains helped bolster funds such as the GMO Special Opportunities fund, which led all actively managed equity funds with a 151% advance in the second quarter.
The managers of the fund, which has its largest positions in consumer companies such as  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) and communications firm Cardlytics (NASDAQ:CDLX) Inc, declined comment.
The top-performing fixed-income fund, meanwhile, was the Braddock Multi-Strategy Income fund, which invests mainly in mortgaged and other securitised debt, with a 32.6% gain. The fund remains down 34.4% for the year to date.
Among fixed-income funds in general, U.S.-based emerging market debt funds returned 12.7% while high-yield bonds gained nearly 9%. U.S.-based government bond funds, meanwhile, gained 0.6% or less as Treasuries edged off of historic low yields.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Cannae  Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) and Senator Investment Group, which are trying to buy CoreLogic Inc, said on Tuesday they own enough of the data and analytics firm to call a special meeting and that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is sure it can arrange financing for the deal.
The investment firms said in a regulatory filing they jointly hold a 15% stake in CoreLogic. This includes 8.2% of common stock, shares of common stock underlying share contracts equal to 1.8% of the common stock and cash settled swaps referencing 5% of the outstanding shares, according to the filing, made on Tuesday.
The stake is big enough for the two to ""call a special meeting of the stockholders,"" the filing added.
Cannae and Senator on Friday made an unsolicited bid to buy the property data and analytics company for $65 a share in cash and said the proposal was ""well in excess of what the company can achieve under its current plans.""
CoreLogic is reviewing the bid and will update shareholders on the outcome ""in due course,"" it said in a statement. The company also said its board and management team were ""laser-focused on increasing growth and profitability to drive shareholder value,"" citing its recent announcement of significantly higher revenue and guidance on Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for the second quarter.
CoreLogic's shares edged down 16 cents to $68.21 shortly before midday.
Tuesday's regulatory filing also detailed the two investors' financing plans. Bank of America provided Cannae with a ""highly confident letter dated June 28, 2020 indicating that BofA Securities is highly confident of its ability"" to arrange and syndicate the credit facilities in connection with the planned takeover, the filing said.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Global hedge fund liquidations surge as coronavirus hurts returns: data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - More hedge funds went out of business during the first three months of 2020 than at any other time since 2015 as the coronavirus led to heavy losses and investors pulled out billions in assets.
Hedge Fund Research reported on Tuesday that 304 funds liquidated around the world in the first quarter, marking the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2015 when 305 funds shut down. The number of closures is 50% higher than it was during the last three months of 2019 when 198 funds were liquidated, HFR data show.
Managers grappled with gyrating markets in late February and March as investors worried about the virus' death toll, shuttered economies and rising unemployment rates. Investors pulled $33 billion out of hedge funds in the first quarter, HFR reported earlier, marking the fourth-largest outflows ever.
At the same time only 84 new funds opened for business in the first quarter of 2020, the slowest pace of new launches since the financial crisis when 56 new funds opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2008, HFR said. The pace of new launches fell off even from late 2019 when 89 funds opened in the last three months of the year.
This leaves 8,081 hedge funds and 1,167 funds of hedge funds, where managers create a portfolio of hedge funds for their clients, for investors to choose from.
Hedge funds have struggled to deliver top returns over the last years which has made fund raising tough. Law firm Seward & Kissel reported that travel restrictions during the pandemic have had a dramatic impact on fund raising. Some long-closed funds have agreed to take in new capital and investors have expressed interest in funds that specialize in credit, healthcare, and municipal bonds, the firm's recent surveys found.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Hedge fund celebrity John Paulson shuts firm to become a family office,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose multi-billion payoff on a bet against the overheated housing market a decade ago turned him into an industry superstar, will stop managing money for outside clients and turn his firm into a family office.
""After considerable reflection and careful thought, Paulson & Co. will convert into a private investment office and return all external investor capital,"" the 64-year old manager wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.
The news had been expected for some time after Paulson & Co's assets had been shrinking, prominent employees left the firm, and performance had been mixed.
Paulson himself hinted at the move toward a family firm, in which the wealthy invest just their own fortunes, in a podcast early last year.
Now he joins a number of prominent fund managers – Carl Icahn, George Soros, Stanley Druckenmiller – who have all returned outsiders' money and freed themselves from the pressures of sending quarterly client letters, talking clients through big positions and being always tethered to the office.
Paulson called his 26 years as a fund manager ""rewarding"" and said he is proud of his returns and the fact that the firm has been at the forefront of investing in global events ranging from the housing crisis to many block-buster mergers.
He plans to remain active in the markets, the letter said, without disclosing how much money will be returned to clients and whether his firm, headquartered in midtown Manhattan, might cut employees or cut the size of its offices.
""Even the great investors stumble, and when they do, they realize how little they like dealing with outside investor questions and withdrawals. Family office life, unlike family life, often is less filled with drama,"" said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan.
A spokesman for Paulson could not be reached for comment.
Bloomberg first reported the move.
At the start of 2020, Paulson & Co oversaw $10.7 billion in assets and noted in a regulatory filing that many of the funds were 100% owned by Paulson himself, suggesting that many outside clients had already left the firm.
Paulson, a soft-spoken manager with a courtly manner, shot to fame when he earned $4 billion off the subprime bet in 2007 and repeated with a $5 billion payout in 2010 on bets the economy would recover.
By 2011, his firm was managing $38 billion and Paulson was a regular speaker at industry conferences and guest at charity events. He donated to favorite causes and become somewhat involved in Republican politics. Central Park, where he often jogs, received $20 million and Harvard University, where he earned his business degree, got $400 million five years ago.
Still Paulson maintained a low profile by refusing most interviews and declining to discuss big investments on television. Some of those bets didn't work out and many clients left after losses on Sino-Forest Corp and drug companies like Valeant. The firm shrunk further when employees including Samantha Greenberg, Sihan Shu, Dan Kamensky, James Wong and Michael Barr moved on.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and suppliers set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet program at least a year ago, signaling the end for a plane that democratized global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft, industry sources said on Friday.
Boeing's ""Queen of the Skies"", the world's most easily recognized jetliner with its humped fuselage and four engines, marked its 50-year flying anniversary in February 2019, clinging to life thanks to a cargo market boom fueled by online shopping. 
But the end for the program has been hanging in the air for years amid falling orders and pricing pressure. The coronavirus pandemic has also crushed passenger travel and demand for new jets. 
The last order for a passenger version came in 2017, when the U.S. government asked Boeing to repurpose two 747-8 jetliners for use as Air Force One by the U.S. president. 
Boeing declined to confirm that it was pulling the plug on the 747 program, first reported by Bloomberg News on Thursday.
""At a build rate of 0.5 airplanes per month, the 747-8 program has more than two years of production ahead of it in order to fulfill our current customer commitments,"" a Boeing spokesman said.
""We will continue to make the right decisions to keep the production line healthy and meet customer needs,"" he added.
The end of the 747 would follow Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) phasing out of its A380 jumbo jet. In June, the last convoy of outsize parts for the world's largest airliner crawled towards an assembly plant in southwest France.
The death of the 747 program could also mean charges and layoffs for halting production at the mammoth wide-body plant outside Seattle. It could also have financial implications on newer programs such as the 787 Dreamliner and the latest model of 777, which would have to bear a larger share of the plant's huge overhead if the 747 line went dark.
One supplier source said he was not sure when Boeing made a formal decision to end the program but said the final number of ship sets - as complete sets of parts are known - was agreed to with the supply base at least a year ago.

Boeing has also removed language from financial filings that said it would continue to ""evaluate the viability"" of the 747 program, which one industry source said was a tell-tale sign of its plans.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s chairman and chief executive stepped down on Friday, bowing to demands from top shareholder Cerberus that the German lender change its strategy to stop a downward spiral in its financial performance.
The resignations of chief executive Martin Zielke and supervisory board chairman Stefan Schmittmann cap weeks of drama after the U.S. private equity firm last month attacked Commerzbank's management for failing to do enough to stop the decline.
The 150-year-old lender has struggled this year, reporting a first-quarter loss, halting its 2019 dividend plans, backtracking on the sale of its Polish unit mBank (WA:MBK), and losing a soccer team sponsorship deal to its rival  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), with whom it failed to merge last year.
Bailed out by the state during the last financial crisis, Commerzbank is now considering cutting thousands more jobs and closing hundreds of branches to turn itself around.
Months before Cerberus took its complaints public, the German state, frustrated with the bank's poor performance, replaced both of its representatives on the supervisory board.
Commerzbank said that a committee of the supervisory board discussed on Friday Zielke's offer to resign and would recommend the board accept it at a July 8 meeting. 
""I would like to open the way for a fresh start,"" Zielke said. ""The bank needs a profound transformation and a new CEO, who gets the necessary time from the markets to implement a strategy.""
Zielke was meant to present a strategy update to the board this week but the chief executive, in the top spot for four years, but was blocked from doing so by labour representatives. 
Cerberus, which bought a 5% stake in Commerzbank in 2017, began an activist campaign to force the lender to change strategy and hand the U.S. investor two seats on its supervisory board early last month.
The U.S. investor said on Friday that it was not surprised by the resignations, though it was surprised by the timing, a person close to the investor told Reuters, adding that it would work with the government and bank staff to fill the management vacuum.
The state, which owns almost 16% of Commerzbank, is its largest shareholder. The Finance Ministry said it was fully committed to its engagement with the bank.
""Commerzbank plays a central role in the financing of small and medium businesses and exports,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Two top 10 investors said on Friday that Roland Boekhout, who recently joined Commerzbank from ING Group (NYSE:ING), would be a credible replacement for Zielke, echoing sentiments from other bankers in recent months. Neither Commerzbank nor Boekhout responded to requests for comment.
Last year, Commerzbank wanted to merge with its larger rival Deutsche Bank but talks broke down.
Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said that while Deutsche under CEO Christian Sewing was able to focus on strengthening its own business, Commerzbank ""by contrast appeared rather unimaginative.""
""This led to the annoyance of the shareholders,"" he said.

The resignations could renew speculation of a merger between the two. The headline leading the website of a top German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, on Friday evening read: ""Sewing, take over!""

The flight issued a distress signal and sought permission to make an emergency landing while flying over the Halkidiki region of Greece, the civil protection ministry said.
The ministry said the crew had reported a fire, but a Ryanair spokeswoman said the emergency had been triggered by an ""unidentified odour in the cockpit and cabin"" and that there had been no fire.
Emergency protocols were deployed and the aircraft landed safely at Thessaloniki's Macedonia airport, where 157 ticketed passengers, an infant and six members of the crew disembarked, the ministry said.

MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - The Italian Parliament gave the green light on Friday to a package of incentives to encourage sales of state-of-the-art combustion engine cars as well as electric and hybrid vehicles, two lawmakers told Reuters.
Italy will be joining France and Germany in helping the automotive industry, which has been hammered by the coronavirus crisis.
However, unlike Berlin and Paris, which have focused on 'green' cars, Rome is also targeting so-called ""Euro 6"" thermally efficient vehicles, as electric and hybrid cars still have little foothold in Italy.
Last year, electric cars accounted for just 0.56% of total Italian registrations, with hybrids at 6.1%, according to foreign car manufacturers association UNRAE.
Marco Opipari, an analyst at Fidentiis, said cars produced in Italy before the lockdown and left unsold were all Euro 6 vehicles.
""If you want to address this backlog of unsold cars and provide oxygen to the industry, you need to support purchases of combustion engine cars too,"" he said.
Rome will offer buyers of Euro 6 vehicles with a price lower than 40,000 euros an incentive of 3,500 euros ($3,930), if they scrap cars that are 10 years old or more, according to the legislation voted on by the Lower House's budget committee. The existing subsidies for electric and hybrid cars will also be bolstered.
The legislation will be in force from August until December, with the costs to be shared between the government and car dealers.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) (FCA), Italy's largest automaker, is only now rolling out its first alternative-engine models, with an electric version of the Fiat 500 small car and plug-in hybrid versions of Jeep's Renegade and Compass models due this summer.
New car registrations in Italy fell by almost half a million, or 46%, in the first half of this year, according to transport ministry data. The number of lost registrations could total around 700,000 units by the end of 2020, UNRAE said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A union representing workers at Embraer filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to dismiss the company's board, after a $4.2 billion deal with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) collapsed amid the pandemic, claims the Brazilian planemaker said were an act of ""bad faith.""
The failed deal left the Brazilian jetmaker scrambling for a new path forward as the coronavirus pandemic hammered travel demand.
Embraer said the union was ""using unfounded allegations and distorting information in order to confuse public opinion and the company's workers."" It added it had yet to be served. 
The lawsuit is the latest headache for Embraer in the aftermath of its breakup with Boeing. Under the deal signed in 2018, Boeing was going to buy the majority of Embraer's commercial aviation unit in order to take on Airbus in the mid-range jet segment. 
But the deal collapsed at the 11th hour in April, leaving Embraer and Boeing pointing fingers at each other. 
The lawsuit accuses Embraer's board of having allowed Boeing to conduct what amounted to ""espionage,"" by having its U.S. engineers work within Embraer's research and development unit during the time when the deal seemed like it would in fact materialize. 
In the wake of the pandemic, Embraer is now being supported by the government through a $600 million loan and said this week it was negotiating a buyout program. It posted a loss of $210 million last quarter. 
Embraer's board ""operates creating billionaire losses and passing on the cost of its incompetence to workers,"" the union alleged in court papers. 
The planemaker said the union's claims showed ""ignorance about the company and its management."" 

The Boeing-Embraer deal was subject to several lawsuits, including by the metalworkers union which sought to stop it. Some judges initially agreed to block the deal, but appeal judges ultimately overturned all allegations.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish jet executive on trial over Carlos Ghosn's dramatic escape from Japan told a court on Friday that the former Nissan (T:7201) boss spoke about Hollywood making a movie of his getaway as he flew in a private jet to Beirut. 
Ghosn, once a leading light of the global car industry, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 and charged with underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes, charges he denies. 
The ousted chairman of the alliance of  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) had been awaiting his trial under house arrest in Japan when he escaped in December via Istanbul to Beirut, his childhood home. 
An executive from Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet and four pilots were detained in early January soon after Ghosn's escape and charged with migrant smuggling, a charge carrying a maximum sentence of eight years in jail.
They appeared in white protective overalls, masks and gloves as a measure against the coronavirus, as the court in Istanbul began hearing their defence. Two flight attendants, charged with failing to report a crime - which could incur a sentence of up to one year - were also there. 
All seven defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In their indictment, prosecutors had said MNG Jet operations manager Okan Kosemen - who is one of the seven on trial - knew before the flight left Osaka that Ghosn would be on board and would transfer to Beirut. 
Kosemen said in court on Friday he was only told via phone about Ghosn's presence on the plane during its flight to Istanbul and that he cooperated under duress, believing his family could be in danger.
Kosemen said a Lebanese broker who had arranged the flight had told him by phone, from Beirut, that the ex-Nissan boss was on board. He added that he had heard ""screams of joy"" in the background.
""I swore at him (the broker). I was very angry,"" he told the court. 
Kosemen later met the arriving plane at an Istanbul airport, and accompanied Ghosn on the Beirut-bound flight, he told the court. ""Carlos asked me how much the plane cost ... and told me about Hollywood producers who want to make this escape a movie,"" he said.
A lawyer for Ghosn did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
At the end of Friday's session, the court ordered the release pending further proceedings of Kosemen and the four pilots, who had been in custody until now.
""When you take into account the time they've served already we expected a release decision earlier. The court answered our calls for a release today. We think our client is innocent,"" Kosemen's lawyer Levent Yildiz told Reuters.
SAGA SHAKES AUTO WORLD
The prosecution said Kosemen used WhatsApp to communicate with pilots before, during and after the Osaka-Istanbul flight, using terms like ""luggage"" and ""consignment"" to refer to Ghosn. Kosemen told the court ""consignment"" referred to sake - rice wine - that he himself had ordered from Japan. 
According to the indictment, Kosemen told prosecutors a price of $175,000 was agreed for the flight with the Lebanese broker and paid into MNG Jet's bank account. 
In January, MNG Jet said he acted without the knowledge of the company and it had filed a criminal complaint for the illegal use of its aircraft. MNG declined to comment.
The pilots have said they are only required to check headcount, not the identities of passengers, according to the indictment. 
Japan has formally asked the United States to extradite two Americans - a former Green Beret and his son - who also stand accused of helping Ghosn flee Japan. They were arrested in Massachusetts in May.
    The Ghosn saga has shaken the global auto industry, at one point jeopardising the Renault-Nissan alliance which he masterminded, and increased scrutiny of Japan's judicial system.

    Renault and Nissan have struggled to recover profitability following his tenure, during which both automakers say Ghosn focused too much on expanding sales and market share.

""We confirm we are in the early stages of reviewing a range of potential options,"" the company said in a statement in response to a Bloomberg report. 
""However, no decisions have been made.""
The Bloomberg report said Rolls was examining options including raising equity and disposals, with the sale of its ITP Aero unit one disposal being studied.
Shares in Rolls-Royce, which have lost 57% of their value since the beginning of the year, extended losses to trade down 9.4% at 264 pence at 15.35 GMT.
The company said its financial position and liquidity remained strong. 
Roll-Royce, which makes engines for planes such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus 350, has been hit hard by the sharp downturn in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
It said in May it planned to cut at least 9,000 jobs, or a sixth of its workforce, as it shrinks to fit the smaller market it expects to emerge from the crisis.
Most of the jobs, out of a global staff of 52,000, will go from its civil aerospace business, which generates just over half of its 15 billion pounds ($18 billion) of annual revenues.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Rolls' credit rating to junk in May, saying actions to contain the pandemic, including social-distancing, travel restrictions, and stay-at-home orders, had sharply reduced demand for air travel.

The move comes as the auto industry faces overcapacity and plunging demand for new cars in Europe.
It will also lead Daimler to take a restructuring charge of hundreds of millions of euros in its second quarter, the company said.
Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands, had used the Hambach factory to produces electric and combustion-engined variants of its two-seater Smart vehicles, making more than 80,000 cars in 2017.
But production of the Smart will move from France to China after Daimler said last year it would build its next generation of Smart electric cars through a joint venture with Geely (HK:0175). 
""I hope that the future of this modern and exemplary site which has chosen the ecological transition, notably by producing electric vehicles, will be assured,"" French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) and PSA said on Friday they were sticking to the merger plan signed last year after a newspaper said the carmakers were looking at spinning off assets to cut a planned 5.5 billion euro ($6.2 billion) cash payout to FCA shareholders. 
A spokesman for FCA (MI:FCHA) dismissed the report on possible changes to the dividend in Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore, while PSA (PA:PEUP) said it remained ""lucid in the face of the regular speculations to which this merger project is subject"". It added it was implementing the binding agreement signed by the two companies in December.
""The structure and terms of the merger are agreed and remain unchanged,"" the FCA (N:FCAU) spokesman said.
Italian-American group FCA and France's PSA plan to finalise their merger by the first quarter of next year.
Il Sole said FCA could conserve cash by handing shareholders assets in place of the special dividend, which has drawn criticism in Italy after the company agreed a 6.3 billion euro state-backed loan to help it through the coronavirus crisis.
Il Sole said talks were at a very early stage and no decision had been taken, adding the aim was to keep the 5.5 billion euro value of the special dividend but to turn it from cash to assets.
Accepting the state-backed loan may not legally bar FCA from paying the dividend, as it is not due until 2021 and would be paid by Dutch parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. However, Italian politicians have questioned the appropriateness of such a large cash payout during the crisis. 
Options being considered include spinning off the Sevel van business, a 50-50 joint venture between the two groups, which could be valued at between 2.5 and 3 billion euros, or FCA's Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands, Il Sole said.
Spinning off Sevel could help address European Union concerns about competition in the van segment, but Il Sole said the option looked complicated as it would require PSA to transfer its 50% stake in the unit to FCA.
Another option is scrapping a planned spin-off of PSA's controlling stake in parts maker  Faurecia , Il Sole said.
A source close to the matter said PSA could instead sell its Faurecia (PA:EPED) stake before the merger and keep the cash proceeds in the merged company.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Gilead's COVID-19 antiviral remdesivir gets conditional EU clearance,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Friday it had given conditional approval for the use of antiviral remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients following an accelerated review process, making it the region's first authorised therapy to treat the virus.
The move comes just a week after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave its go-ahead for the drug, produced by Gilead Sciences (O:GILD), to be used in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age who are also suffering from pneumonia and require oxygen support.
It also comes just days after the company allocated nearly all of its supply of remdesivir to the United States over the next three months, stirring concerns about availability elsewhere.
""We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to secure efficient treatments or vaccine against the coronavirus,"" said Stella Kyriakides, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, in a statement.
The Commission said on Wednesday it was in negotiations with Gilead to obtain doses of remdesivir for the 27 European Union countries.
Remdesivir is in high demand after the intravenously-administered medicine helped to shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial.
It is believed to be most effective in treating COVID-19 patients earlier in the course of disease than other therapies like the steroid dexamethasone.
Still, because remdesivir is given intravenously over at least a five-day period it is generally being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalisation.
The EU's green light broadens the use of remdesivir around the world - the United States has cleared it for emergency use and it is also approved as a COVID-19 therapy in Japan, Taiwan, India, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, Gilead said on Friday.
A conditional marketing authorisation is one of the EU regulatory mechanisms created to facilitate early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including those for emergency situations in response to public health threats such as the current pandemic, the Commission said.
The approval is valid for one year in the bloc and can be extended or converted into an unconditional marketing authorisation if all necessary data are available on its efficacy and side effects.

The agency reviews data as they become available on a rolling basis, while development is still ongoing. The EMA's rolling review began at the end of April.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Global Markets: COVID recovery vs COVID reality,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares stalled near a four-month high on Friday and the industrial bellwether metal copper scuffed its longest weekly winning streak in nearly three years, as nagging coronavirus nerves tempered the recent recovery run. 
The market rally, fuelled by Thursday's record U.S. jobs numbers, largely blew itself out after a record daily total of new U.S. COVID-19 cases, though news of the fastest expansion in China's services sector in over a decade kept Asia's tail up early in the day.
Chinese shares had charged to their highest level in five years [.SS], helping the pan-Asian indexes to four-month peaks, so the sight of European markets stalling left traders floundering, especially with no Wall Street to pick things up again because of a U.S. market holiday. (EU) 
Currency and commodity markets were also subdued after an otherwise strong week for confidence-sensitive stalwarts such oil, copper, sterling and the Australian dollar, which all struggled on Friday.
More than three dozen U.S. states are now seeing increases in COVID-19 cases, including Florida, where they have leapt above 10,000 a day. And while Europe is largely easing restrictions, some places are having to keep them or reimpose them again.
""I think infection rates and fears of localised lockdowns have doused some of the enthusiasm,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Jukes.
""We have three elements now; vaccine hopes, decent data in most places - but also the return of infection rates, which can make you nervous."" 
London, Paris and Frankfurt's stock markets were down 1.2%, 0.4% and 0.8% respectively as trading began to wind down, although all were up for the week. The euro and pound were also fractionally lower, though it was barely noticeable thanks to the dollar's second dip of the week.
The euro was at $1.1226 and though it gained against the safe Swiss franc it fell versus the red-hot Norwegian crown, which has been on the rise for months, in tandem with most petrocurrencies. 
S&P 500 futures were down 0.2% but volumes were low due to the U.S. market holiday for Independence Day.
The previous day's U.S. non-farm payrolls had shown a well-above-forecast 4.8 million surge in jobs in June. It came largely thanks to rises in the hard-hit hospitality sectors, though economists did note some caveats.
The number of permanent job losses continued to rise, increasing by 588,000 to 2.9 million, while the unemployment rate remains a chunky 7.6 percentage points above its February level. A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysis put the U.S. unemployment rate behind all its developed market peers, barring Canada.
WILL THE BEARS BITE BACK?
The recovery faces headwinds as the surge of new coronavirus infections prompts U.S. states to delay and in some cases reverse plans to let stores and restaurants reopen and activities resume.
BofA said in a report on Friday that $7.1 billion had been was pulled out of equity funds over the last week, and its closely-followed 'Bull & Bear' indicator was out of ""buy"" territory for the first time since March 17.
Nevertheless, investors seem to have been largely overlooking the various virus spikes for now at least, and taking the view that things are still improving globally.
A market fear gauge, the VIX volatility index, has seen its biggest drop in two months and German government bond yields were set for their biggest weekly rise in a month, though they nudged down on Friday to -0.44%. 
Riskier Italian yields fell to 1.26% as well though, which is their lowest since late March, at the peak of Europe's coronavirus lockdown. [GVD/EUR] 
Oil prices also eased after an otherwise solid week. Brent crude fell 0.65% to $42.86 a barrel while U.S. crude dropped 0.66% to $40.38 a barrel. Both were around $25 this time two months ago.
Copper prices were poised for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, their longest winning streak in nearly three years, though it too was slightly down on the day at $6,040 a tonne, more than $1,500 up from lows it plumbed in March. [/MET/L]
""The one issue that hangs over all the markets is 'Will we see a surge in secondary infections that will trigger a second wave of national rather than regional shutdowns?',"" Malcolm Freeman, director of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - A panel of European Union lawmakers has rejected the candidate for executive director of the bloc's banking watchdog for a second time in a bid to attract more women to top EU jobs.
The European Parliament's economic affairs committee voted by 24 to 23 to recommend that the full parliament rejects Francois-Louis Michaud as the next executive director of the European Banking Authority (EBA) when it meets next week.
Michaud, a senior official at the European Central Bank, told a hearing in parliament last month that he was fully aware of the need for a better gender balance at the EBA, and was willing to commit to appointing more female senior staff at the Paris-based agency.
The first candidate for the job, Irish central banker Gerry Cross, was also rejected by lawmakers in January, though his former role at banking lobby AFME before joining the Central Bank of Ireland, had also raised concerns for some lawmakers.
The vote late on Thursday was a success in the fight for more gender equality in filling top positions in EU financial institutions, Sven Giegold, a member of parliament's economic affairs committee that held the vote, said in a statement on Friday.
If full parliament rejects Michaud then EBA would have to present lawmakers with a shortlist of at least one male and one female candidate, Giegold said.
""We are disappointed about this outcome and we wait for the decision of the Parliament in its plenary session next week,"" EBA said.
The job became vacant after Adam Farkas left to head AFME earlier this year, with lawmakers angered by what they saw as the latest example of a ""revolving door"" between top EU jobs and the more lucrative private sector.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Spain's banks look to make lockdown branch closures permanent,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - As Spain reopens after the COVID-19 crisis, its banking industry is seizing the opportunity to shrink its swollen branch network which has long been a drag on profitability, with just four banks so far planning at least 800 branch closures this year.
Despite significant cuts since the 2008 financial crisis and more than 2,000 last year, Spain's 24,000 bank branches still give it one of the highest ratios to people in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund, trailing just San Marino, Mongolia and Luxembourg. 
Union opposition to closures and a population more reliant on using in-branch services than others in Europe have slowed Spanish banks' progress in closing branches despite their running costs being a major drag on profitability. 
But after shutting down huge parts of their networks during the lockdown, lenders are examining whether changes to consumer behaviour mean more branches can remain shut.
""Many of the even older clients will have discovered that you can do things quite quickly and cheaply online. I am not sure they would go back to doing things the same way as before,"" said Nick Hill, managing director at rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
 Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Sabadell (MC:SABE) both plan not to reopen some of the branches they closed during the lockdown imposed in Spain to curb the pandemic, according to sources. 
Sabadell and Bankia are closing 235 and 140 branches this year, respectively, while Unicaja is reducing its traditional network by 100 in the next three years. Oscar Arce, the Bank of Spain's director general for economics, told a news briefing this week that it would be up to each bank to decide on branch closures but said ""there were elements in every bank's network that were not profitable."" 
In a sector grappling with higher loan-loss provisions to cope with the pandemic, financial consultant Kearney believes Spanish banks will need to reduce costs by between 2 billion to 3 billion euros in the medium-term to improve profitability - and branch closures are likely to be central to that. 
MCDONALD'S MODEL
Around 35% of bank branches across Europe have closed in the last 10 years according to Kearney, as lenders slashed costs and customers switched to digital platforms. 
But in Spain around 65% of product and service contracts are still agreed in branches, compared to less than 50% in Europe as a whole. That's left Spanish lenders wary about cutting off access to branch services, particularly in rural areas. 
Instead some are set to accelerate a model they were trying before the crisis - using a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) style franchise to outsource branch services. 
Lenders like Unicaja (MC:UNI) and Liberbank have started using self-employed agents to run branches and sell the bank's products. The 'financial agent' is responsible for rent, electricity and water supply bills while the bank provides the technology and the financial products, Jonathan de Joaquin Velasco, the head of strategy and risk policy at Liberbank, told Reuters. 
""We get rid of all the fixed costs, we turn them into variable costs, and this obviously has a very relevant impact on efficiency over time,"" De Joaquin Velasco said. 
When Liberbank first launched this model with one 'pilot' 'financial agency' in September of 2016, it had 992 traditional branches. As of the end of the second quarter, the lender will have 560 traditional branches and 200 financial agencies. 
Though Velasco did not give a breakdown on the cost-savings arising from this model, he said its implementation would on average improve the efficiency ratio by almost three times that of an equivalent branch in size. 
Banks can also use the model to incentivize the sale of higher margin products for wealthier customers, making the remaining outposts more profitable. 
""Downsizing the network is a long established trend, but more than just downsizing it is the transformation of branches, that will continue"", said Caixabank's Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Gortazar during a business school event on June 18.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Audi (DE:NSUG) and utility EnBW (DE:EBKG) are setting up an electric car battery operation at EnBW's Heilbronn plant to build scaleable storage facilities by the end of this year, drawing on retired batteries to help power grids.
Electric vehicle battery recycling and reuse has become a priority for car and battery makers while renewable energy companies face the problem of how to absorb surpluses of wind and solar power to avoid waste and disruption to the stability of grids, slowing the transition to purely carbon-free energy systems.
Alexander Kupfer, project head of circular economy at Audi and in charge of his firm's activities at the site, said the cooperation was part of Audi's recycling commitments.
""We want to develop a plug and play battery storage solution for the energy industry,"" Kupfer said in an interview. 
""The storage facility in Heilbronn will be the blueprint for a scaleable product that can be sold in growing numbers.""
Audi has been testing the behaviour of electric car batteries, which represent a third of an EV's unit costs, in a research setting in Berlin for three years.
The batteries to be used for the commercial phase of the project come from test cars, which have run hundreds of thousands of kilometres, Kupfer said.
""A used EV battery still can function for another three to 10 years,"" he said.
EnBW, a market leader in renewable energy, will construct storage containers at the Heilbronn power and heat cogeneration plant, that would serve as a reference site.
Thereafter, EnBW would develop similar storage tools for sale to industrial power customers, local utilities or decentralised generation plants.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has warned top American companies including Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL)and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) over risks faced from maintaining supply chains associated with human rights abuses in China's western Xinjiang region, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.
""It is critical that U.S. companies and individuals be aware of the large-scale human rights abuses perpetrated by the PRC government in Xinjiang,"" Keith Krach, Undersecretary of State for economic growth, energy and the environment wrote on July 1.
""Businesses should evaluate their exposure to the risks that result from partnering with, investing in, and otherwise providing support to companies that operate in or are linked to Xinjiang,"" he said in the letter which was sent to trade groups.
The United States is seeking to ratchet up pressure on China at a time of heightened tensions over that country's treatment of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong.
On Wednesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory saying companies doing business in Xinjiang or with entities using Xinjiang labor could be exposed to ""reputational, economic, and legal risks"".
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. China has denied mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and help fight extremism.
When asked about U.S. government warnings over supply chain risks linked to Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that allegations of forced labour were fabrications.
""Some people in the U.S. keep on saying they care about ethnic minorities in Xinjiang while also taking all kinds of measures to oppress Xinjiang companies,"" he said at a daily news conference in Beijing. 
He said this showed their hypocrisy and desire to suppress Xinjiang's development. 

In a call with reporters, Krach said the complex nature of supply chains was making companies vulnerable to potential risks and urged them to be more vigilant. He did not say how many U.S. companies might have been entangled in such supply chains.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chairman of majority state-backed lender Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) has called on the Bank of England to lift curbs on dividends by the autumn to make lenders attractive to investors again.
Howard Davies said banks - which were forced in March to ditch dividends and buybacks until the end of 2020 to bolster their finances against an expected steep economic downturn - could not suspend payouts indefinitely.
""It's probably fair to say the banking sector is not investible because when people try to do the models about what banks are worth they can't plug in any numbers for cash out,"" Davies told a City & Financial webinar on Friday.
The Bank of England was not immediately available for comment.
British lenders have lent more than 40 billion pounds ($50 billion) of state-backed funds to struggling businesses during the crisis, but are bracing for an expected wave of defaults in the coming months.
""We can see clouds gathering on the horizon, but it hasn't yet started to pour down with rain, but I think we know that it's going to, and that's going to be a very difficult period for us,"" Davies said.
Anne Boden, CEO of digital bank Starling, meanwhile, said banks would need government support in handling unpaid state-backed business loans in the coming months.
RBS's stock has fallen by around half this year, wiping 15 billion pounds from its market value, while rival Lloyds (L:LLOY) shares are also down around 50%. The FTSE 100 as a whole is down 18% in the year to date.
RBS was rescued by the British government in 2008 and, despite plans to sell off the stake, it still owns 62% of the bank.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Boeing communications chief resigns over decades-old article on women in combat,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) communications chief Niel Golightly abruptly resigned on Thursday, following an employee's complaint over an article the former U.S. military pilot wrote 33 years ago arguing women should not serve in combat.
His exit leaves Boeing trying to fill the crucial role for the fourth time in less than three years, just as it is battling to shore up its brand after the prolonged safety grounding of its Boeing 737 MAX jetliner.
The job has become the industry's biggest hot seat as Boeing fends off criticism for its handling of the 737 MAX crisis.
""My article was a 29-year-old Cold War navy pilot's misguided contribution to a debate that was live at the time,"" Golightly said in a statement included in Boeing's announcement.
""My argument was embarrassingly wrong and offensive. The article is not a reflection of who I am; but nonetheless I have decided that in the interest of the company I will step down,"" Golightly said.
According to an excerpt on the U.S. Naval Institute website, the December 1987 article titled ""No Right to Fight"" said: ""At issue is not whether women can fire M-60s, dogfight MiGs, or drive tanks. Introducing women into combat would destroy the exclusively male intangibles of war fighting and the feminine images of what men fight for - peace, home, family.""
Golightly told staff in an email seen by Reuters on Thursday that the exclusion of women at the time was ""government policy and broadly supported in society. It was also wrong.""
Golightly declined to comment beyond Boeing's statement and his email.
Golightly's departure after just six months on the job, during which he was said to be introducing sweeping changes, followed the board's review of an internal anonymous ethics complaint that flagged his article. 
He decided to step down after discussions with Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and others, Golightly said in his email.
Golightly acted after Boeing board members, already feeling pressure from the 15-month-old MAX crisis, had expressed little patience for a potentially damaging new distraction, people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. employers have been more responsive to complaints related to sex and racial equality and diversity fueled in part by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, and anti-racist activism following the slaying of Black men by police.
Boeing has touted its strong commitment to improving diversity, though the number of women on its executive council has fallen from five to two since the beginning of 2019, according to Boeing's annual reports and website.

464,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",StockBeat: German Investors Are Holding on for a (Delivery) Hero,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Fans of Avenger and X-Men movies will be well versed in the psychology of people’s need for heroes. The trouble often starts when you look for them in the wrong places.
Few markets in the world need a hero more than Germany’s right now, after the spectacular explosion of Wirecard  (DE:WDIG), the payments company that managed to fool a whole load of investors and strategic partners – not to mention its auditor and its regulator – into thinking that it was a legitimate business riding a wave of technological innovation into a glorious future.
No-one is suggesting that meal delivery company Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) is a fraud, but with the stock rising another 5.1% to a new all-time high on Friday on the back of some preliminary sales numbers for the second quarter, it’s legitimate to ask whether it, too, isn’t benefiting unduly from investors’ need for a hero. 
The stock has rallied 45% year-to-date and is up over 60% from its March lows, with the performance of the last three months owing much to the perception that it belongs in the “stay-at-home” class of stocks whose growth trajectory has permanently changed for the better thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Friday’s numbers appear to bear out such confidence. Order numbers were up 94% from a year earlier in the three months through June, and the growth appeared to be gaining momentum toward the end of the quarter: June’s figures were up 104% from a year earlier.  Gross merchandise value, meanwhile was up 64% from a year ago over the quarter.
Both revenue and GMV growth accelerated from the first quarter’s levels of 58% and 92% respectively.
All well and good. But what about the profits? Delivery Hero lost money in both of the last two years, and its EBITDA margin widened from -14.6% in 2018 to -29.5% last year (it's predicting something between -14% and -18% this year). In the Middle East & North Africa region, the only one where it makes money at an EBITDA level, orders fell in the quarter (due to temporary curfew restrictions on deliveries). The biggest increases in business came in markets where it loses the most money on every delivery: the Americas and Asia.
There was no word on whether this surge in business volume had done anything to improve margins, which is a bit odd, given that a company that makes repeated losses might want to flag any improvement on that score. It has already warned that the MENA business faces a 50 million euro hit to EBITDA.
In fairness, Delivery Hero operates in a lot of markets – almost all of them emerging – and it may be asking too much for bottom-line guidance so soon after the quarter’s end. But the update didn’t even include top-line guidance.
The absence of such information – at least until July 28, when the full quarterly results are due - is a reminder that meal delivery in general is still to prove its viability as a business model. Delivery Hero managed to raise over 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in January through the issuance of new shares and convertible bonds, so there are no immediate concerns about its financial health.
All the same, it still needs to prove that it can do more than just lose money over a longer period."

The Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) said it had found Grab had discriminated against its drivers, prioritising those provided by partner PT Teknologi Pengangkutan Indonesia (TPI) to the Softbank (T:9984)-backed firm.
In a statement, Dinni Melanie, the chair of the watchdog judicial panel, said it had found Grab infringed the anti-monopoly laws after evaluating the case on Thursday evening.
The agency imposed a fine of 30 billion rupiah ($2.1 million) on Grab and a penalty of 19 billion ($1.03 million) rupiah on TPI.
A spokesman for Grab, which is Southeast Asia's most valuable startup with a valuation of $14 billion, told Reuters the firm would appeal the verdict.
""Grab’s view is that it has not violated any regulation, engaged in any anti-competitive business practices, or injured any third parties,"" he said, characterising the watchdog's findings as ""unsubstantiated allegations"".

U.S. authorities are investigating Denmark's largest bank Danske (CO:DANSKE), which was forced out of Estonia after it admitted that 200 billion euros ($226 billion) in suspicious payments had been made through its branch there.
""The reputation of the Estonian state has suffered greatly in several international money laundering cases in recent years,"" Estonian Finance Minister Martin Helme said in a statement, which did not name any banks.
The money laundering allegations being investigated by the United States focused on money flows through Estonia, which has been a bridge between Russia and Europe.
Helme said in a statement that if penalties are imposed on banks as a result of the investigations then Estonia wanted to ""participate as a state in the distribution of fines."" 
""As a country, we are the victims of this process"".
Sweden's  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) said in March an internal investigation found transactions totalling $4.8 million which potentially violated U.S. sanctions and that it would report this to U.S authorities.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - International banks were seeking details on Friday of the scope of U.S. legislation that would penalize them for doing business with Chinese officials who implement Beijing's sweeping new national security law on Hong Kong.
The U.S. Senate passed the bill unanimously on Thursday, a day after it saw full support in the House of Representatives, in a rare example of bipartisan support that reflects politicians' concern over the erosion of the Hong Kong's autonomy following China's imposition of the law on Tuesday.
The bill calls for sanctions on Chinese officials and others who help violate Hong Kong's autonomy, and financial institutions that do business with those who are found to have participated in any crackdown on the city.
But it does not lay out which individuals might be included, nor what they would be forbidden from doing.
Banks including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were among those holding calls on Friday with U.S. colleagues to discuss the potential fallout from the legislation, but few conclusions could be drawn at this stage, sources said.
Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment.
President Donald Trump has not yet indicated if he will sign the bill into law.
""Financial institutions are concerned about the legislation principally because of uncertainty about how the sanctions will be used,"" said Nick Turner, a lawyer specializing in sanctions and anti money laundering at Steptoe and Johnson in Hong Kong.
Turner said the main area of uncertainty was around what would constitute a significant transaction, and whether that would prevent a bank providing retail or private banking services to a sanctioned person, as well as which individuals might be named.
The bill calls for the Secretary of State to report to Congress within 90 days of the law’s passage and identify any foreign person who has, or is, materially contributing to undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.
Within 60 days, the Treasury Secretary must then submit a report identifying those banks that have knowingly conducted a significant transaction with someone named.
""Internally, it’s very difficult for us to take a call on this now and think about its impact without seeing the names of the people and the entities that would be targeted,"" said a trade finance banker at a large European bank, who also discussed the bill with colleagues on a call.
""If they name party members who are sitting on the boards of large SOEs (state-owned enterprises), that would create a massive problem,” he added, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Ambani’s  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI), which has scored billions of dollars of investments from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). to  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). for its digital businesses, has launched the JioMeet video conferencing app after beta testing. The app has already garnered more than 100,000 downloads on the Google Play Store after becoming available Thursday evening.
Like Google Meet, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and other services, JioMeet offers unlimited high-definition calls -- but unlike Zoom, it doesn’t impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said on the JioMeet website.The launch coincided with a nationwide ban on dozens of popular apps from Chinese technology giants including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s UC Web, on grounds they threatened security and data privacy. JioMeet went viral Friday on social media alongside the hashtag #MadeinIndia.
The app is one facet of Ambani’s rapidly expanding digital empire, which includes India’s largest telecom operator with nearly 400 million users. On Friday, Reliance announced Intel Capital has invested $253 million into JioPlatforms, a unit of Ambani’s oil-to-retail conglomerate. The U.S. chipmaker’s arm is the 11th investor in about as many weeks to announce its backing for the digital services platform.
“JioMeet will be a very credible disruptor in the space,” said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director of boutique consultancy Bexley Advisors. “Just the fact that it has no time limits on calls makes it a serious challenger to Zoom, despite its entrenchment.”
JioPlatforms is amassing a wide range of services from music streaming to online retail and payments, fast turning into an ecommerce juggernaut that can take on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on its own home turf. Like elsewhere, video conferencing apps have become lifelines for millions of Indians working in cramped homes during Covid-19 lockdowns.
JioMeet is also debuting at a time Zoom users have accused the service of security flaws. It’s been accused of siding with China after deactivating accounts of pro-democracy activists in the U.S and Hong Kong, which it said was intended to comply with Chinese law.

At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, France's CAC 40 fell 0.1%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.1%. Volumes are likely to be limited with the U.S. on holiday to celebrate Independence Day.
The final PMI services indices for Europe showed the region picking up but not quite ending its decline, climbing to 48.3 in June from 30.5 the previous month. Typically, a number below 50 indicates that activity is contracting.
Earlier Friday the Chinese service sector showed a clearer improvement, with the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index coming in at 58.4 in June, the highest reading in two months.
With the U.S. recording Thursday the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June, above the average forecast of 3 million, there are signs that the global economy is spluttering back into life. 
Yet the danger surrounding the Covid-19 outbreak remains, particularly in America which recorded over 50,000 new cases Thursday, for the second day in a row, threatening to derail the nascent recovery. The U.S. accounts for around a quarter of the 10.8 million coronavirus cases recorded worldwide.
Turning back to Europe, stock in U.K.-based banking giant HSBC (LON:HSBA) fell 0.5% after pledging to boost investments in China even after Beijing launched sweeping new security legislation to crack down on Hong Kong.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) stock dropped 0.6% and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) stock fell 0.8% after reports that the two are looking at ways to reduce the planned special dividend that was due to be paid to FCA shareholders ahead of their merger.
Germany's Delivery Hero  (DE:DHER) jumped 4.6% after the takeaway food company said its order growth nearly doubled in the second quarter, while spread-betting firm CMC Markets (LON:CMCX) rose 15.3% to a new all-time high after saying it expects full-year profits to be above the upper end of its previous forecast range, due to a sustained rise in client activity driven by market volatility this year.
Oil prices dropped on Friday, after OPEC member Angola said it wouldn't compensate for past quota-busting by cutting output until the fourth quarter. Bigger signatories to the OPEC+ pact on output restraint have said that the planned phased return of idled capacity to world markets is dependent on all members actually delivering the output cuts that they promised.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest pension fund, on Friday reported a record quarterly loss of 17.71 trillion yen ($164.74 billion) in January-March after global stock markets plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic.
GPIF posted a negative return of 10.71% on its overall assets during the three months, compared with a 4.61% gain in the previous quarter, it said in a statement.
The mammoth-size fund, which managed 150.6 trillion yen of assets by end-March, is closely watched by global financial markets.
The quarterly loss, the biggest since GPIF started managing its assets on the market in 2001, poses a potential challenge to the new president Masataka Miyazono who took the helm in April as market uncertainity looms.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei average (N225) fell 18% during the quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 24%.
The GPIF in April raised its allocation target for foreign bonds to 25% from 15% and lowered domestic bonds allocation to 25% from 35%. Its portfolio is evenly split at 25% each across domestic and foreign stocks and domestic and foreign bonds.
The fund had 23.87% of its portfolio in Japanese bonds as of end-March, compared with 36.15% in September 2016 when the Bank of Japan launched its policy of pinning 10-year government bond yields around 0%. Its foreign bond holdings accounted for 23.42% of its portfolio.
The fund allocated 22.87% to domestic stocks and 23.9% to foreign stocks.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Air France unions braced for job cut talks,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government on Friday called on Air France to avoid mandatory layoffs as the airline prepared to announce some 7,500 job cuts to cope with a collapse in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Managers at the airline, part of Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) Group, are due to meet labour unions in Paris on Friday to detail the redundancy plans affecting some 15% of all employees, including pilots, stewards and ground staff. 
At least half of the cuts will likely entail voluntary departures and retirement plans, sources familiar with the matter said this week, while 1,000 jobs are likely to be cut at Air France's ""HOP!"" airline.
But the prospect of possible compulsory layoffs has raised alarm among workers and the French state, which has granted Air France 7 billion euros ($7.87 billion) in aid to help it survive the pandemic. 
""A successful labour reorganisation is one where there are no forced departures,"" junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Sud Radio on Friday. 
Pannier-Runacher said the government's aid package for the airline, which included state-backed loans, was justified as the carrier was ""on the edge"", but called on Air France managers to pursue cutbacks responsibly. 
Aircraft maker Airbus' (PA:AIR) plans to cut some 15,000 jobs across Europe - with a third of those in France - sparked similar warnings this week, as a wave of restructuring triggered by the virus outbreak begins to hit.

Under CEO Ben Smith, who joined from Air Canada in 2018, Air France-KLM has sought to cut costs, improve French labour relations and overcome governance squabbles between France and the Netherlands, each owners of close to 14% of the group.

479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>",SoftBank Stock Bounces to 2020 Peak as Buyers Look Beyond WeWork,"(Bloomberg) --Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) shares just reached a new high this year, propelled by a series of buybacks that have seen the stock recoup the losses suffered during the coronavirus market rout.
The stock rose 2.6% on Friday to 5,778 yen ($54), the highest since July 2019. That’s more than double the level of a March low.
The recovery is something of a vindication for CEO Masayoshi Son, who unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and bankroll record share buybacks. Son has frequently complained that SoftBank’s shares, even at their peak, trade at less than the value of its portfolio of investments.
SoftBank has also had a series of wins over the same period, finally solving the puzzle of Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) with their merger completed in April, and seeing a welcome return to successful investment bets as online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc (NYSE:LMND) surged as much as 86% in its U.S. IPO. Thursday.
“The steps being taken to improve its balance sheet, such as repurchase of its debt, are being recognized,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, a senior analyst at Iwaicosmo Securities Co.
SoftBank shares have had a volatile run over the past year as portfolio companies such as WeWork ran into trouble and the coronavirus hammered many of its businesses. That triggered a record 1.36 trillion yen operating loss for the last fiscal year. Optimists believe the worst is over for the company.
“After the trillion-yen level writedowns last quarter, it’s not possible that it’ll be worse than that,” said Kawasaki.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo raised his price target for the stock by 100 yen to 7,200 yen on Wednesday, lifting his expectations for the company’s forthcoming first-quarter earnings and noting that there is “still plenty of room for the shares to advance” given the buybacks and steps to clean up its balance sheet.
SoftBank has already repurchased 500 billion yen of shares based on a resolution adopted March 13, separate to its 2 trillion yen pledge. Under that larger program, it has already formally announced plans to buy 1 trillion yen of buybacks through next March, with Son indicating he hoped to carry out the full amount.
Whether the shares can continue their increase depends on future catalysts, Iwaicosmo’s Kawasaki said.
“The shares will need another catalyst that boosts shareholder value, such as the second Vision Fund,” he added.
Son said in May that SoftBank will use its own cash for the second Vision Fund for now, until an improved investment performance attracts outside partners."

A potential bid is still at an exploratory stage, as there’s no information available yet on the valuation and finances of Wirecard’s Asian operations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential. There’s no certainty that Pine Labs will proceed with a formal bid, the people added.
The sale of Wirecard’s businesses will be clouded by ongoing probes into its operations after the German payments firm was forced into insolvency by an accounting scandal. Wirecard said last month that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed.
However, several Wirecard’s subsidiaries -- including those in Asia -- weren’t part of the insolvency filing. The firm’s administrators have said the assets are attracting interest from many global investors and a sale process involving investment banks is on the way.
Pine Labs is potentially interested in Wirecard’s regional point-of-sale business, which handles merchants’ payments transactions, one of the people said. That is Pine Labs’ core business in India, and any acquisition of Wirecard assets would allow it to expand those operations further in Southeast Asia, the person added.
Pine Labs Chief Executive Officer Amrish Rau declined to comment in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News.
Singapore is home to Wirecard’s Asia-Pacific headquarters and the company has been expanding aggressively in the region, which accounted for almost 45% of the group’s reported revenue in 2018, second only to Europe. In the city state, the fintech firm is facing probes by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the local accounting authority and the police’s financial-crime unit.
Pine Labs, founded by Lokvir Kapoor, processes $30 billion of payments a year and serves some 140,000 merchants via 450,000 network points, according to the company’s website."

HSBC will establish a financial technology company on the mainland, and its life insurance joint venture in China will hire new staff to provide non-branch based wealth management services to customers in Shanghai and Guangzhou, the Asia-focussed lender said in a statement.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open just higher on positive signs of a global economic recovery, but ranges will be tight with the U.S. markets on holiday and the number of coronavirus cases still mounting.
At 2:25 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. up 0.2%, and CAC 40 futures in France up 0.4%.
Economic data released earlier Friday pointed to a brisk pickup in the Chinese service sector, with the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index coming in at 58.4 in June, the highest reading in two months.
With the U.S. recording Thursday the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June, above the average forecast of 3 million, there are signs that the two largest economies in the world may be spluttering back into life.
Yet the danger surrounding the Covid-19 outbreak remains, particularly in America which recorded over 50,000 new cases Thursday, for the second day in a row. The U.S. accounts for around a quarter of the 10.8 million coronavirus cases recorded worldwide.
More than three dozen U.S. states have seen increases in Covid-19 cases, prompting them to delay and in some cases reverse plans to let stores reopen and activities resume, threatening to derail the nascent recovery.
Turning back to Europe, volumes are likely to be limited Friday with the U.S. enjoying a three-day weekend to celebrate Independence Day. 
Economic data will center around the final PMI services indices for the region, while in corporate news U.K.-based banking giant HSBC (LON:HSBA) could be in the spotlight after pledging to boost investments in China even after Beijing launched sweeping new security legislation to crack down on Hong Kong.
Other stocks in focus will include Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), after reports that the two are looking at ways to reduce the planned special dividend that was due to be paid to FCA shareholders ahead of their merger.
Oil prices dropped on Friday, as the continued growth of new coronavirus cases, in particular in the U.S. given its importance as the world's largest oil consumer, has prompted worries that the recovery in demand of fuel could stall as states reimpose travel restrictions.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $40.27 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $42.72.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,784.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1237, flat on the day.

The bank, which has come under fire over its support for the legislation, on Friday announced it was starting a new service to provide customers in mainland China with digital wealth and insurance planning services. It will initially cover new customers in Guangzhou and Shanghai, according to a statement. The bank is also establishing a fintech company to support its business.
At a time of increasing political turmoil, China’s rapidly growing middle and upper class is still the grand prize for banking giants across the world, with households sitting on about 90 trillion yuan ($12.7 trillion) in investable assets. Firms from UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG have identified wealth management as a prime focus for their onshore businesses amid a market opening.
“These new investments mark HSBC’s continued efforts to capture high-growth opportunities in Asia, particularly in mainland China, the region’s biggest wealth pool and one of the world’s largest insurance markets,” said Greg Hingston, HSBC’s head of wealth and personal banking in Asia-Pacific, said in the statement.
Regulators including the People’s Bank of China announced in June the kick off of a long anticipated program called Wealth Management Connect, which will allow residents in Hong Kong, Macau and southern China to invest across the border.
HSBC’s push for wealthy clients dovetails with Chief Executive Noel Quinn’s plan to deploy more resources into Asia as the group cuts jobs and underperforming businesses in Europe and the U.S. as part of a massive overhaul.
In a statement on its official WeChat account last month, the London-based bank pledged to continue to invest and support the Chinese economy after the local media reported that its layoff plan means that HSBC may put an end to its China business.
Earlier this year, HSBC combined its retail banking and wealth management, and private banking businesses with $1.3 trillion in assets. Its private banking unit said in March that it targets to triple the number of billionaire clients in Greater China in the next three years.

The bank, which following a 13-year hiatus returned to Saudi Arabia in 2018 after being granted a capital markets licence, said last year it would also expand its direct custody and clearing services to the oil-rich kingdom. 
David Livingstone told a conference on Thursday that while there was no set time-table for the lender to obtain a full banking licence in Saudi Arabia, the outlook for financial sector activity is positive.
""That is something we want to participate very strongly in,"" he said. ""Recently we secured our direct custody and services licence and we will be growing that business.""
The division provides services from trading execution to clearing to institutional investor clients. 
Citigroup was among the banks that advised  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) on the oil giant's record $29.4 billion initial public offering last year and in April advised the Saudi government on a $7 billion three-tranche bond sale.
Asked whether Citigroup is more cautious about lending to Middle East producers given lower oil prices, he said ""on balance, no"". 
Brent crude (LCOc1) is trading at around $42 a barrel, recovering from recent lows due to output cuts by oil producers, but is still down from over $60 a barrel at the start of the year, as the coronavirus pandemic crimped demand.

Livingstone said the low cost base of many Middle Eastern producers gave them greater ability to withstand ""lower for longer"" oil prices than those in some other parts of the world.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Japan has formally asked the United States to extradite a former Green Beret and his son accused of helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co boss Carlos Ghosn flee the country while he was awaiting trial on financial charges.
Japan submitted a request to the U.S. State Department to extradite Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, after they were provisionally arrested in Massachusetts in May, the U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing on Thursday.
Lawyers for the Taylors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Their lawyers have argued that they have not been charged in Japan with an offense for which extradition is possible under the U.S-Japan treaty.
The Japanese embassy in Washington and U.S. Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.
The Taylors were arrested in Harvard, Massachusetts, on May 20 at Japan's request after authorities there in January accused them of helping smuggle Ghosn, Nissan's former chairman, out of the country on Dec. 29, 2019, in a box.
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, after being charged with engaging in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.
Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan.

Both men have been held without bail since their arrest. Prosecutors have argued that neither Taylor, including Michael, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and private security specialist, should be released from jail as they are flight risks.

The amendment also requires the company to maintain a minimum liquidity of $2 billion.

(Reuters) - The final days of the best quarter for the benchmark S&P 500 since 1998 were not enough to keep investors from pulling $4.6 billion out of U.S.-based stock funds in the week that ended Wednesday, according to Lipper data released on Thursday.
The S&P 500 500 rebounded from its stark drop in the first quarter to rally nearly 20% between April and June. The pace of gains has slowed over the last two weeks, however, as states including Florida and Texas have posted a series of new record highs for coronavirus infections.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",How Moderna executives are cashing in on COVID-19 vaccine stock speculation,"By Tom Bergin and Robin Respaut
(Reuters) - Biotech firm  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc could reap tens of billions of dollars in sales and stock appreciation if it wins the race for a COVID-19 vaccine. If it loses, the early-stage company’s value could crash.
In the meantime, the firm’s chief executive is pocketing millions of dollars every month by selling shares that have tripled in price on news of Moderna’s development progress, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows. The sales - by CEO Stéphane Bancel, his childrens’ trust and companies he owns - amount to about $21 million between January 1 and June 26, including $6 million in May.
The company’s chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, has cashed out the majority of his available stock and options, netting over $35 million since January, the filings show.
The lucrative liquidations highlight the unusually powerful incentives for biotech executives to highlight development milestones for drugs that often never get approved or sold, according to interviews with seven executive-compensation experts. Optimistic corporate statements on coronavirus vaccines, they said, could cause investors to overpay for company shares or create false hope among the public and health officials seeking new weapons to fight the pandemic.
Bancel set a fixed schedule for his share sales - known as a 10b5-1 plan - long before the pandemic hit. Such executive share-sale plans are meant to guard against insider trading, avoiding the potential for executives to sell in advance of bad news they know is coming, or to put off selling until after a positive announcement.
Zaks sharply increased the pace of his sales with a new plan he put in place on March 13. That was three days before Moderna announced it had dosed the first human with a vaccine candidate, news that sent its stock price up 24% and signaled that future development milestones might push the shares higher.
The sales give the firm’s executives an unusual opportunity to lock in big profits on what could be fleeting market optimism, said Jesse Fried, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote a book about executive compensation.
“This may be their one shot at making a boatload of money if the vaccine doesn’t work out,” Fried said. Executives have wide discretion in releasing information, he said, and Moderna’s chiefs have a powerful motivation to “keep the stock price up.”
Reuters found no evidence that Bancel, Zaks or Moderna has exaggerated the company’s vaccine progress.
Many news outlets have reported sales by Moderna executives in the wake of positive news on its vaccine efforts. Reuters is the first to report that Bancel and affiliated entities are selling 90,000 shares every month and that Zaks moved to sharply increase his sales in March, three days before Moderna released market-moving news.
A Moderna spokesman said that Bancel is liquidating only a small portion of his holdings and that “substantially all of his family’s assets remain invested in Moderna.” This stakeholding reflected Bancel’s “long-term commitment” to the firm, the spokesman said. Bancel, his companies and his children’s trust own more than 24 million Moderna shares, making him the second largest stockholder, owning about 8% of the firm, down slightly from the beginning of the year.
Zaks did not respond to requests for comment, and Moderna did not comment on his share sales.
The high frequency, volume and profits of Bancel’s transactions - at about 90,000 shares monthly - are unique among the CEOs of 26 companies identified by Reuters as developing COVID-19 vaccines or treatments and that regularly publish information on executive trades of company shares.
Twenty-one of the firms have seen their stock rise since the end of January, just before coronavirus spread globally, and ten of those, including Moderna, have seen share prices at least double. But just four of the CEOs of those firms, including Bancel, have sold company stock. Only one - Chad Robins of Adaptive Biotech - made substantial, regular sales under a 10b5-1 plan, like Moderna’s Bancel. Adaptive Biotech, however, has seen a far smaller recent stock-price increase - about 50% - than Moderna. During May and June, Robins sold about $12 million in stock after Adaptive’s stock price rose on news that it is researching antibody therapies and a coronavirus test that delivers faster results.
Adaptive Biotech declined to comment and referred to a company filing that said Robins sold the stock to diversify his investments.
Most of Bancel’s sales have been carried out through plans in place since December 2018, the filings show. The transactions started in November 2019, when a trust belonging to his children began selling 11,046 shares each week. This January, Bancel and two companies he controls started selling stock regularly. Since then, they have collectively sold about 90,000 Moderna shares each month.
HIGH RISKS, REWARDS
Such scheduled sales are more common at early-stage biotech companies such as Moderna - which face intense risk-reward scenarios - than at more established and diversified drug firms, where executives frequently hold their equity until they leave the company.
Executives’ ongoing sales are an effective hedge against the bigger downside risk faced by companies like Moderna. Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the firm has more than 20 therapies and vaccines in development - but none near approval. Investors view the firm as a frontrunner in creating a COVID-19 vaccine, but it faces 17 serious competitors with candidates in clinical evaluations and 129 others in earlier development stages, according to the World Health Organization. Only a very small number of companies are expected to get vaccines to market, biotech executives and health experts say.
If Moderna successfully launches its coronavirus vaccine and a dozen other of its most promising trial medicines, its stock price could rise to $279 based on the new revenues, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts. That would yield Bancel a fortune of about $10 billion including currently unvested share options, the Reuters analysis shows.
The firm’s stock has soared from $18 in late February - just before it announced it had shipped its vaccine candidate to the U.S. government for trials - to close at $56.57 on July 2, down 5%, after a report that the start of its large vaccine trial would be delayed. That gives the company a market capitalization of nearly $23 billion. The stock hit a high of $80 in May.
But Morgan Stanley also has a “bear case,” in which the company would be worth only as much as the cash on its balance sheet if all of its vaccine and drug candidates don’t make it to market.
‘SCIENCE BY PRESS RELEASE’
Bancel and Zaks have been bullish on Moderna’s prospects in public statements.
Bancel calls the mRNA technology the company uses for all vaccine development the “software of life,” with potential to create “a new class of medicines.” He has also said Moderna’s process can create vaccines much faster and with a better chance of “technical success” - and, by implication, regulatory approval - than other firms.
“We are not aware of anybody else who can do this at this scale, with this focus, at this speed,” he told investors on June 2. Earlier, in a May 7 earnings call, Bancel said he had “never been as excited and optimistic about the future of Moderna.”
Many investors and analysts are optimistic as well but say it is difficult to evaluate Moderna’s prospects given the early stages of trials.
The company drew criticism from scientists for releasing incomplete data from a trial being conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). On May 18, Moderna announced that its vaccine candidate had produced protective antibodies in a small subset of healthy trial volunteers. The news pushed Moderna stock up 20% to its peak of $80.
Some scientists suggested Moderna should have held off publishing until it had all test subjects’ results. “This was science by press release,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Without complete data, he said, “you’re left to read the tea leaves.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci - the nation's top infectious disease expert - shared the test results with U.S. governors, Vice President Mike Pence said in a Twitter post the day of Moderna’s announcement. But Fauci - who is running the Moderna trial - later said he didn’t like the company’s early release of incomplete data, according to an interview published by the STAT health news service. A spokeswoman for Fauci’s agency, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not comment beyond what Fauci said in the interview.
Bancel told investors at a June conference that Moderna’s leadership worried the information had been seen by too many people, including at the NIH. He said the company made the partial findings public because it worried the data would get leaked - and it considered the incomplete results material information that all investors should receive at the same time. A company spokesman told Reuters the company believed it needed to release the information to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

The day after the May 18 announcement, Zaks sold 125,000 shares - netting him nearly $10 million - at a price of $78, up from $66 on the Friday before the Monday press release. Company filings show the sale was executed in accordance with the plan that Zaks put in place on March 13.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Wirecard debt that facilitated SoftBank investment put up for auction,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Convertible bonds that were part of a complex transaction that allowed Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984) to buy a stake in now-collapsed payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) and then de-risk the transaction have been put up for sale in an auction. 
In a process managed by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), bonds convertible into Wirecard debt with a nominal value of 900 million euros ($1.01 billion) will be sold via an auction set to close on July 8, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
Many of Wirecard's creditors are eager to sell their exposure to the now-insolvent company, as police have raided the German firm's offices and its administrator has started selling its assets.
The auction should end one of the most complex acquisition structures seen in recent times. Instead of buying a direct stake in Wirecard, SoftBank bought bonds that could be repaid with Wirecard shares. 
Soon after, however, Credit Suisse sold 900 million euros of new bonds to investors linked to the convertible bond held by SoftBank, which would be convertible into Wirecard shares. This transaction effectively repackaged SoftBank's convertible bonds and sold them on at a profit for the Japanese investor.
The structure is one made famous by billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who used to buy stakes with little risk to his company Berkshire Hathway before benefiting immediately from the boost to the share price from his involvement. 
The auction would likely represent a significant loss to investors currently holding the convertible bonds; the linked Argentum convertible bonds were trading at a cash price of 13.5 cents on the euro on Thursday, having been as high as 73.5 just three weeks ago.

Mnuchin said undertaking an independent review was fully consistent with a presumption of innocence. ""The decision to pursue an independent review demonstrates the strength of the African Development Bank,"" he said.
The regional development bank's board on Wednesday announced Robinson would lead a high-level panel that will review a report by the bank's ethics committee, which had cleared the bank's president, Akinwumi Adesina, of improper conduct.
Adesina had been accused of abuse of office by a whistleblower at the bank, including favoritism in hiring. He has denied the allegations.
The panel will include Leonard McCarthy, a former South African government official and former vice president for integrity at the World Bank, and Gambian Chief Justice Hassan Jallow. It is to complete its review in two to four weeks. 
The Bank's board last month said it stood by the internal investigation that cleared Adesina, but agreed to U.S. demands for an independent review in the interest of due process. It finalized plans for that review on Wednesday.
The United States, AfDB's second-largest shareholder, had demanded a new independent probe into the allegations against Adesina, rejecting the bank's investigation over reservations about the integrity of the bank's process.

That put it at odds with the largest shareholder, Nigeria, which had voiced its support for Adesina.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: JPMorgan drops terms 'master,' 'slave' from internal tech code and materials","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is eliminating terms like ""blacklist,"" ""master"" and ""slave"" from its internal technology materials and code as it seeks to address racism within the company, said two sources with knowledge of the move.
The terms had appeared in some of the bank's technology policies, standards and control procedures, as well in the programming code that runs some of its processes, one of the sources said. 
Other companies like  Twitter Inc  (K:TWTR) and GitHub Inc adopted similar changes, prompted by the renewed spotlight on racism after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May. https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733303508418560 
The phrases ""master"" and ""slave"" code or drive are used in some programming languages and computer hardware to describe one part of a device or process that controls another. 
""Blacklist"" is used to describe items that are automatically denied, like a list of websites forbidden by a company's cybersecurity division. ""Whitelist"" means the opposite - a list of items automatically approved.
Floyd's death has sparked a re-examination of words that might carry racial overtones. For example, some realtors are no longer using the term ""master bedroom,"" and Universal Music Group's Republic Records stopped using the word ""urban"" to describe music genres and internal departments or roles.
JPMorgan appears to be the first in the financial sector to remove most references to these racially problematic phrases, and it comes after the bank has said it is taking other steps to promote Black professionals and anti-bias culture training for staff.
Columbia Business School programming professor Mattan Griffel said such terms have long been controversial and can be difficult to change.
The technology that underpins bank operations is often a spaghetti-like mess that results from merged companies, decades-old code and third-party systems, and any change can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, Griffel said. 
Changing these terms within the bank's code could take millions of dollars and months of work, Griffel said. 

""This is not a trivial"" investment by the bank, Griffel said. ""This kind of language and terminology is so entrenched. It has to (change) and now is as good a time as any.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher and the Nasdaq reached an all-time closing high on Thursday as investors headed into their long holiday weekend buoyed by a record surge in payrolls, which provided assurance that the U.S. economic recovery was well under way.
All three major U.S. stock averages advanced, with the benchmark S&P 500 posting its fourth straight daily gain.
Massive stimulus and hopes for a speedy economic rebound have returned the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to 7.6% and 12.6% below their record highs reached in February.
The indexes registered strong gains for the week. 
The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs  in June according to the Labor Department, 1.8 million more than analysts expected, setting a second consecutive record.
Massive rehiring sent the unemployment rate  down to 11.1%.
""There was a lot to like in economic data for the week,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""And there's still talk that there will be more stimulus from Washington after they get back from the Fourth of July break."" 
Still, even with May and June's consecutive record payroll gains, the labor market has still recovered only a fraction of the 22 million jobs lost in the March-April plunge.
The recovery of the U.S. economy, now in its sixth month of recession, could stall as new cases of COVID-19 hit record levels and several states hit hardest by the resurgence halted or reversed plans to reopen their economies. 
On Thursday, Florida reported a record-shattering 10,000 new cases of the disease, worse than any European country reported at the peak of their outbreaks.
""With the spikes (in new COVID-19 cases) we've seen the larger states - Texas, California and Florida - those states have taken steps to turn back their re-opening plans,"" Nolte added. ""And that will slow the overall growth and consumer spending in those regions.""
In the coming weeks, market participants will train their focus on second-quarter reporting season. In aggregate, analysts now expect S&P earnings to have dropped by 43.1% as companies grappled with plunging demand and disrupted supply chains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 92.39 points, or 0.36%, to 25,827.36, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 14.15 points, or 0.45%, to 3,130.01 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 53.00 points, or 0.52%, to 10,207.63.
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), a barometer of investor anxiety, logged its largest weekly point drop since the week ending May 8.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but real estate <.SPLRCR> and communications services (SPLRCL) closed higher, with materials (SPLRCM) enjoying the largest percentage gain.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500, and in June retained its top spot as the most globally invested stock, according to data from trading platform eToro.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) jumped 8.0% after the electric car maker's second-quarter vehicle deliveries beat Wall Street estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 123 new highs and 10 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.03 billion shares, compared with the 13.24 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The move to oust Lu was proposed by a majority of the Luckin's directors, but the company said it failed to get the necessary two-third voting majority from its board.
The results of the vote come a day after Luckin released findings from an investigation, which said its former chief executive and chief operating officers were involved in fabricating annual sales of about $300 million.
The special committee running the investigation also recommended Lu's removal based on evidence from its investigation and the chairman's degree of cooperation.
Lu, who is the controlling shareholder of Luckin, is also the founder of auto-rental firm CAR Inc and Chinese ride-hailing firm Ucar Inc.

During the investigation, Luckin sacked its CEO and COO, both executives who had previously held top positions at Lu's other firms.

Investing.com – Wall Street fended off late selling to end higher for the week on Thursday as concerns about rising coronavirus cases offset a stronger-than-expected jobs report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.36%, or 263 points, but had gained 469 points intraday. The S&P 500 rose 0.48% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.52%.
Florida reported a one-day spike of more than 10,000 coronavirus cases, underscoring further signs that states are struggling to control the spread of the virus that threatens to stall the reopening progress.
Investor sentiment was further hurt by a setback in the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the frontrunner in the vaccine race, fell 4.9% on news the drugmaker will delay a clinical trial for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The move marked a blow to the drugmaker's expectations to deliver key data from the trial by Thanksgiving. 
The spike in new infections prompted investors to reassess their bullish bets on stocks tied to reopening progress. 
Airlines and cruise stocks retreated from session highs; American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) turned negative after hitting a session high of $13.42 and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) was also down after rising intraday.
Stocks had made a strong start to the session after a quicker-than-expected recovery in jobs stoked hopes of a V-shape recovery.
The U.S. economy created 4.8 million jobs in June, topping forecasts for 2.9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. Economists expected it to drop to 12.4%.
About 33% of lost jobs, or 7.5 million out of 22.2 million, have been clawed back following losses earlier in the month, but some questioned whether the strength can continue as infections continue to mount.
""The June employment report was unambiguously positive, with jobs coming back much faster than anticipated, "" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""While the quick turnaround is very encouraging, sustainability remains in question given the covid resurgence and the rollback of reopening in some states.""
Energy was among the biggest gainers despite cutting gains as investor worries about demand abated somewhat.
 Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL)  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) led the sector higher.
Growth in emerging economies, low energy prices and rising petrochemical sales will support oil demand, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said. The bank forecasts oil demand to decline by 8% this year, rebound by 6% in 2021 and reach pre-Covid levels in 2022.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 8% to an all-time high as its second-quarter vehicle deliveries, topped analysts estimates at a time when others in the auto industry have seen sales slump.
Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, well above estimates for 74,130 vehicles.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street shifts bets to big pharma as COVID-19 vaccine race progresses,"By Carl O'Donnell and Sujata Rao
(Reuters) - Wall Street is moving some bets on COVID-19 vaccines to large pharmaceutical companies with robust manufacturing capabilities, signaling that a love affair with small biotech firms might be ending after the sector’s best quarter in almost 20 years.
Early signs of the shift came Wednesday, when positive data for one of  Pfizer  Inc’s (N:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine candidates sent shares of the large U.S. drugmaker up more than 3%. Shares of its partner on the vaccine, Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) <22UAy.F>, have been flat on the data. 
Although the news had little effect on shares of Pfizer’s large rivals in the vaccine race, smaller peers  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  (O:INO), both of which have previously shown promising COVID-19 data of their own, ended down more than 4% and 25%, respectively. Inovio partially rebounded Thursday.
For the week so far, shares of bigger players in the vaccine race, such as Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Merck (N:MRK), have also outperformed Inovio and Moderna.
Some of the selling was likely driven by end-of-quarter profit-taking, locking in dizzying gains in an otherwise turbulent market. Moderna and Inovio shares have risen nearly 200 percent and 540 percent in the year-to-date, respectively, greatly eclipsing gains for large pharmaceutical companies. 
Analysts say investors are changing their strategy to focus on companies that can make, as well as discover, a vaccine and that the risk reward profile for some biotechs is less favorable after their stunning gains so far this year.
“I would certainly say success by Pfizer, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), or Johnson & Johnson could make it more challenging for smaller companies, given size and scale and manufacturing capability,” said Vamil Divan, a biotechnology analyst at Mizuho. 
Smaller biotechnology companies with promising COVID-19 vaccines pose a special challenge for investors, said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Group Plc.
Because of their limited manufacturing capabilities, investors in those stocks are effectively betting that the company or its drug will be bought by larger companies, he said. 
“In smaller cap stocks like biotech, it all tends to be quite binary so fundamental or detailed analysis don't always work,” Onuekwusi said. 
Medical manufacturers have never faced a challenge like that of producing a global COVID-19 vaccine.
Companies including Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have said they each aim to produce as many as 1 billion doses by the end of 2021. 
There are more than 17 vaccine candidates being tested on humans in a frantic global race to end a pandemic that has infected 10 million people and killed more than half a million. Drugmakers have released early stage human trial data for five vaccine candidates so far.
Bernstein Research analyst Vincent Chen said COVID-19 vaccines could generate in excess of $10 billion in annual revenue, but many investors are struggling to determine their value.

""In the near term, they are not going make a ton of money on” the vaccines, said Evan Seigerman, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). “The initial round of vaccines are going to be given away or sold at cost. Where people will start making money is if COVID-19 vaccine becomes something like the flu shot and people need to constantly protect against it.”

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal will nationalise and then sell the majority stake in engineering firm Efacec Power Solutions that had been controlled by Angolan businesswoman and ex-first daughter Isabel dos Santos, the government said on Thursday. 
Dos Santos, the daughter of former Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is a suspect in a fraud investigation in her homeland and withdrew from Efacec's shareholding structure in January, according to the company.
The nationalisation of 71.7% of the firm is a transitionary move, said a decree published on President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's website, and shares will immediately go on the market.
""The cabinet took this decision because Efacec is in a situation of impasse after the 'Luanda Leaks',"" Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira told reporters after a cabinet meeting, referring to documents alleging corruption in Angola.
""Otherwise government intervention would not have been necessary.""
Dos Santos has repeatedly denied wrongdoing but had no new comment after Thursday's announcement, said her spokeswoman Catarina Vasconcelos.
There was no information about any compensation for her shares. 
Dos Santos bought her stake in the company in 2015 for around 200 million euros ($225 million) through offshore company Winterfell 2 Limited.
In December 2019, hundreds of thousands of files dubbed the ""Luanda Leaks"" were released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire.
Portugal's public prosecutor's office said in February it had ordered the seizure of bank accounts belonging to dos Santos, who holds significant stakes in several other major firms in Portugal, Angola's former colonial power.
Efacec employs 2,500 people in Portugal and is of great relevance to the economy, Siza Vieira said.

Angola has named dos Santos a formal suspect over allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds during her time as chairwoman of state oil company Sonangol.

506,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 02:54PM ET</span>",Brexit Negotiators Home In on ‘Landing Zone’ Despite Differences,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. and European Union negotiators have started to sketch out the broad outline of an agreement on their future relationship as both sides look to the other to make compromises to seal the deal.
After talks in Brussels ended this week a day earlier than planned, officials close to the negotiations said the two teams are beginning to coalesce around a general “landing zone” that could form the basis of an agreement on trade and other areas of cooperation.
The two sides will regroup in London next week. While both acknowledge major sticking points remain and time is short, the negotiators have so far managed to retain the air of optimism that has surrounded the talks since a telephone call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU leadership last month injected fresh momentum, the officials said.
The teams are conscious of the need to make swift progress. Johnson has called for an accord by the end of July, while the EU has identified a summit of leaders in mid-October as the last possible moment for a deal to be reached, to allow for the several weeks then needed to ratify it.
The two sides are heading for a stripped-down agreement that includes a free trade deal eliminating tariffs and quotas, but it will probably fall short of the broader accord the bloc had originally proposed, an EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.
Judges, Fish
The bloc has signaled that it is prepared to back down from its demands to keep the same access to British fishing waters it enjoys today and for the European Court of Justice to have a role in policing any agreement.
Negotiators are also looking at ways to distance the U.K. from the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ, even if, under the bloc’s rules, it has to remain the ultimate arbiter of EU law.
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has also signaled that the bloc is ready to rethink its position on the level playing field. The rules, designed to ensure fair competition between the two sides, are one of the biggest points of contention in the talks. Barnier has suggested he is open to discussion about whether Britain will be required to follow the EU’s framework for state aid.
The EU is now looking for the U.K. to make similar conciliatory moves, including accepting that the entire agreement must have a single dispute resolution structure. That’s something the British side has so far rejected, because it would give the bloc leverage to retaliate in different areas if the U.K. broke the terms of one part of the agreement.
In a statement released after talks broke up on Thursday, Barnier said “an agreement is possible and in everyone’s interest,” and underlined that he had taken on board the U.K.’s red lines.
‘Equivalent Engagement’
“The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement,” Barnier said. “We need an equivalent engagement by the U.K.”
David Frost, the U.K.’s chief negotiator, said the informal format of the talks had “given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions” and that he was committed to getting an understanding on the principles underlying an agreement in July.
“The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful,” he said. “But they have also underlined the significant differences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.”
One official cautioned that fishing is proving particularly difficult to resolve, and that a lot of work remains to be done.
Britain will leave its transition period at the end of 2020 after Johnson decided not to take up the option of extending it. Without an accord, the U.K. and EU will default to trading on terms set by the World Trade Organization, meaning the return of tariffs and quotas.

507,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 02:28PM ET</span>","Dow Eases From Highs on Rising Infections, but Jobs Surge Lifts Hopes","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – Wall Street retreated from highs on Thursday as concerns about rising coronavirus cases reined in some investor optimism following a stronger-than-expected jobs report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.02%, or 263 points, but had gained over 400 points intraday. The S&P 500 rose 1.04% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.10%,
Florida reported a one-day spike of more than 10,000 coronavirus cases, underscoring further signs that states are struggling to control the spread of the virus that threatens to stall the reopening progress.
The spike in new infections prompted investors to reassess their bullish bets on stocks tied to reopening progress.
Airlines and cruise stocks retreated from session highs; American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) turned negative after hitting a session high of $13.42 and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) was also down after rising intraday.
The ongoing rise in new cases cooled some hopes that signs of a quicker-than-expected recovery in jobs point to a V-shape recovery.
The U.S. economy created 4.8 million jobs in June, topping forecasts for 2.9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. Economists expected it to drop to 12.4%.
About 33% of lost jobs, or 7.5 million out of 22.2 million, have been clawed back following losses earlier in the month, but some questioned whether the strength can continue as infections continue to mount.
""The June employment report was unambiguously positive, with jobs coming back much faster than anticipated, "" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""While the quick turnaround is very encouraging, sustainability remains in question given the covid resurgence and the rollback of reopening in some states.""
Energy was among the biggest gainers, underpinned by rising oil prices as investor worries about demand abated.
 Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL)  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) led the sector higher.
Growth in emerging economies, low energy prices and rising petrochemical sales will support oil demand, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said. The bank forecasts oil demand to decline by 8% this year, rebound by 6% in 2021 and reach pre-Covid levels in 2022.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 8% to an all-time high as its second-quarter vehicle deliveries, topped analysts estimates at a time when others in the auto industry have seen sales slump.
Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, well above estimates for 74,130 vehicles.
Elsewhere, insurance tech company Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) rallied on its public market debut, soaring 105%. The stock was priced at $29 per share.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the frontrunner in the race to find a Covid vaccine, fell 5% on news the drugmaker will delay a clinical trial for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The move marked a blow to the drugmaker's expectations to deliver key data from the trial by Thanksgiving. "

""We think that up to 500 jobs could be saved if the government supported us for example our programme to develop hydrogen-powered aircraft,"" Guillaume Faury told the magazine on Thursday.
Extending to 24 months a government programme designed to stem job losses by putting employees on shorter working hours, with the government partially compensating for lost salary, could save a further 1,500 jobs, he added.

Talks were already underway to that end, he said.

The 747 democratized global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine passenger jets.
The last 747-8 will roll out of a Seattle area factory in about two years, according to the Bloomberg report. (https://bloom.bg/38n5A8p)
When contacted by Reuters, Boeing did not confirm the Bloomberg report.
""At a build rate of 0.5 airplanes per month, the 747-8 program has more than two years of production ahead of it in order to fulfill our current customer commitments,” a Boeing spokesman told Reuters.
""We will continue to make the right decisions to keep the production line healthy and meet customer needs.""
Boeing's 747 plane is enjoying a second life as a cargo mule for companies like  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) due to a freight market boom fueled by online shopping. 
In 2016, Boeing said it could end 747 production amid falling orders and pricing pressure. 

Major U.S. carriers like United Continental Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) have already said goodbye to the 747.

The company, which had employed nearly 6,000 people across 250 sites, said the move would enable it to negotiate with landlords ahead of an expected sale of the business.
The closures add to the thousands of jobs that have been lost on Britain's High Streets in recent days from companies hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown, including the owner of food outlet Upper Crust. 
CDG Chief Executive James Spragg said he was ""acutely aware"" of the group's duty to employees and recognised it was a difficult time for them.
""Working alongside the administrators, we will do everything we can to support them through this process with a view to preserving as much employment as we are able to,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are checking whether Google's purchase of Fitbit might allow it to drive rival makers of wearable devices, app developers and other online service providers out of the market, and boost its dominance in online advertising and search. 
Healthcare providers are also being asked whether they would see Google as a rival if it is allowed to buy the fitness tracker company in a $2.1 billion deal criticised by privacy and consumer groups, according to EU documents seen by Reuters.
The EU queries underscore the importance of Fitbit's (N:FIT) trove of health data generated from its devices, which are used to monitor users' daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled, and how this could further extend Alphabet Inc-owned (O:GOOGL) Google's market power into a fast-growing area.
A 47-page questionnaire to potential rivals asks if the deal will reinforce Google's dominance in general search and online advertising and how the smartwatches and fitness trackers market will develop if the Fitbit deal does, or doesn't, go ahead.
""In your view, would the aggregation of Fitbit's data to Google's database strengthen Google's position in the supply of online search advertising services?"" regulators ask.
They want to know if users will have another option should the prices of Fitbit's devices go up, and whether Google will provide its operating system for smartwatches at less favourable terms, or even stop providing them, to Fitbit's rivals.
App developers for mobile payment services, digital service distribution, navigation, translation, virtual assistant and search are all being asked if the deal will result in lower prices and more choice, or the opposite.
Another 11-page questionnaire asks healthcare providers whether their customers would migrate to a new Google competing service in the event Google has access to Fitbit's devices or data.
The European Commission is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 20. 

Australia's antitrust regulator has warned against the deal, while U.S. and EU advocacy groups have also voiced criticism.

The House Armed Services Committee approved its version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, by 56-0 shortly before midnight.
The bill sets policy for the Department of Defense on everything from how many ships are built to benefits for troops to how the country should counter threats from Russia and China.
Because it is one of the few bills Congress passes every year, lawmakers use the NDAA as a vehicle for a wide range of policy provisions.
The House version of the 2021 NDAA includes an amendment to remove the names of Confederate generals, who fought U.S. forces during the Civil War, from military bases within a year.
The Senate's version of the NDAA includes a provision to change the names within three years.
Widespread protests over the treatment of Black Americans and bipartisan support in Congress make it likely that some version of the provision will remain in the NDAA as it moves through Congress.
After the House and Senate pass their versions, they will negotiate a compromise version of the bill, which both chambers must pass before it can be sent to Trump.
Trump has promised a veto, breaking with several of his fellow Republicans in Congress who favor changing the names. The House provision was introduced by Democratic Representative Anthony Brown and Republican Don Bacon.

The House NDAA also would make it more difficult for Trump to follow through on plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in Germany by barring their removal unless the Pentagon certifies doing so will not affect national security.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is building mobile molecule printers to help make the potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by CureVac in Germany, the electric-car maker's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, tweeted on Wednesday.
CureVac, an unlisted German company, has said it is developing portable, automated mRNA production units that it calls printers and which Musk described as ""RNA microfactories"".
They are being designed to be shipped to remote locations, where they can churn out its vaccine candidate and other mRNA-based therapies depending on the recipe fed into the machine.
But for the immediate pandemic use - should its vaccine candidate win market approval – it has production sites with regulatory approval in Germany with a capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses.
The company, based in Tuebingen and backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is a pioneer of the so-called messenger RNA approach, which is also pursued by BioNTech and its partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
RNA molecules are single-stranded, and thanks to their recurring molecular pattern, they can be produced in a relatively simple biochemical process that do not require genetically modified living cells, which are needed to produce most other biotech drugs.
CureVac is also building a new stationary site that could increase its output tenfold to billions of doses. 
The ""microfactories"" would be built at Tesla Grohmann Automation in Germany, Musk said in a Twitter thread late on Wednesday night.
Tesla acquired the company that develops automated manufacturing systems for batteries and fuel cells in 2016 to expand its production.

CureVac has been working with Tesla Grohmann to develop the mobile printer technology, a person familiar with CureVac said.
Musk did not elaborate on his plans. Tesla and CureVac were not immediately available to comment.
Musk, who is known to make impromptu announcements on Twitter, had in March said that Tesla has extra FDA-approved ventilators that can be shipped free of cost to hospitals within regions where the electric-car maker delivers.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 12:02PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hong Kong activists discuss 'parliament-in-exile' after China crackdown,"By Natalie Thomas and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are discussing a plan to create an unofficial parliament-in-exile to keep the flame of democracy alive and send a message to China that freedom cannot be crushed, campaigner Simon Cheng told Reuters.
Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was convulsed by months of often violent pro-democracy, anti-China protests last year against Chinese interference in its promised freedoms, the biggest political crisis for Beijing since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas and arrested more than 300 people on Wednesday as protesters took to the streets again in defiance of new, sweeping security legislation introduced by China to snuff out dissent.
The law pushes China's freest city and one of the world's most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path. China, which denies interfering in Hong Kong, has warned foreign powers not to meddle in its affairs.
Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, worked for the British consulate in the territory for almost two years until he fled after he said he was beaten and tortured by China's secret police. Cheng, who has since been granted asylum by Britain, describes himself as pro-democracy campaigner.
""A shadow parliament can send a very clear signal to Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities that democracy need not be at the mercy of Beijing,"" he told Reuters in London. ""We want to set up non-official civic groups that surely reflect the views of the Hong Kong people.""
He said that while the idea was still at an early stage, such a parliament-in-exile would support the people of Hong Kong and the pro-democracy movement there. He declined to say where the parliament might sit.
""We are developing an alternative way to fight for democracy,"" Cheng said. ""We need to be clever to deal with the expanding totalitarianism: they are showing more powerful muscle to suppress so we need to be more subtle and agile.""
He said more and more people were ""losing hope that it is effective to go out on to the streets or run for election"" to Hong Kong's Legislative Council, or mini-parliament.
""We should stand with the Hong Kong people and support those staying in Hong Kong,"" he said.
'VERY GOOD SIGNAL'
Asked about HSBC's (L:HSBA) support for the sweeping national security law, Cheng said the British government should speak to senior British capitalists to make them understand the importance of democracy.
After Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered millions of Hong Kong residents the path to British citizenship following China's imposition of the law, hundreds of thousands of people would come to the United Kingdom, Cheng said.
""The UK has given a very good signal,"" Cheng said. ""At least hundreds of thousands of people will come."" 
Almost 3 million Hong Kong residents are eligible for the so called British National (Overseas) passport. There were 349,881 holders of the passports as of February, Britain said.
""One day we will be back in Hong Kong,"" Cheng said.
Hong Kong returned to China 23 years ago with the guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including its independent legal system and rights to gather and protest, under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Huge protests calling for democracy, especially on the anniversaries of the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen crackdown, were common and brought major streets to a standstill for 79 days in the Umbrella movement of 2014.

The national security law punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, will see mainland security agencies in Hong Kong for the first time and allows extradition to the mainland for trial.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Clouds may be parting for dividend investors,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - U.S. companies are cutting their dividends less than investors anticipated, providing a potential boost to a stock market rally that has clashed with concerns over a recent surge in coronavirus infections. 
S&P 500 companies are likely to see an aggregate 2% decline in 2020 dividend payments, compared with analyst projections earlier this year of around 10%, according to S&P Dow Jones.
That's good news for income-seeking investors at a time when a series of rapid interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has taken U.S. Treasury yields to near zero, sending market participants further afield in search of steady payouts. 
""We saw a devastating amount of dividend cuts, but the second half of the year does look a bit better,"" S&P Dow Jones analyst Howard Silverblatt said. 
U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday for the July 4th holiday. On Monday, data firm IHS Markit reports its surveys of U.S. business activity, while Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) reports quarterly results on Thursday and U.S. initial jobless claims are also due out that day. 
S&P 500 companies slashed or suspended over $40 billion in dividends in the second quarter, the deepest quarterly drop since 2009, according to S&P Dow Jones. The cuts tapered off in the latter part of the quarter as the U.S. economy began to rebound, fueled by Fed stimulus and easing lockdowns across the nation. (Graphic: S&P 500 annual indicated dividend rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjlbmrvr/pvGG3-s-p-500-annual-indicated-dividend-rate%20(2).png ) 
""The hope is that we have turned a corner, but that is going to depend on the reopening of the economy,"" Silverblatt said. 
The fall in Treasury yields to historic lows has raised the allure of stock dividends, which are generally paid four times a year.
The gap between the S&P 500 dividend yield and the 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) yield in March hit a high not seen since at least the 1970s, according to Datastream data, which does not go back further. Currently, the S&P 500's dividend is nearly 2%, compared with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury's 0.67% yield.

Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been buying shares of dividend-paying companies that have also been outperforming in the epidemic, including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ),  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB),  General Mills  (N:GIS), and retailers Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and Walmart (N:WMT).
Johnson & Johnson, which is among companies rushing to develop a coronavirus vaccine, raised its dividend in April. In June, Kroger (N:KR) and  Target  (N:TGT), which have been seeing more business with people staying at home, (N:TGT) upped their dividends. 
""I have plenty of older clients who only want dividend stocks,"" Dollarhide said. ""There are plenty of COVID-19 dividend plays,"" he added.
With California, Texas and many other states reporting record increases in new cases of COVID-19, the pandemic's trajectory remains the main source of uncertainty of whether more companies will suspend or cut their dividends. 
Over 40% of the United States has now reversed or placed reopenings on hold, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note. 
Adding to uncertainty about future dividends, the Fed last week capped big-bank dividend payments and barred share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter after finding lenders faced significant capital losses when tested against an economic slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) shares have fallen about 1% since late Monday after the bank warned it would reduce its dividend as a result of the Fed's annual bank stress tests.

Still, only three S&P 500 companies decreased or suspended their dividend payments in June, while six companies upped their dividends, according to S&P Dow Jones.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 11:21AM ET</span>",Unions urge Airbus to slow down restructuring plans,"By Julie Rimbert and Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE/PARIS, France (Reuters) - French unions and regional leaders urged Airbus (PA:AIR) on Thursday to step back from a Big Bang restructuring as workers across Europe waited for a factory-by-factory breakdown of 15,000 job cuts brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
The battle over the scale and timing of cuts heated up as Air France (PA:AIRF) staff also waited for confirmation of 7,500 expected cuts in French aviation's worst week for decades.
Airbus unveiled the cuts on Tuesday, with France and Germany bearing the brunt of the restructuring with around 5,000 cuts each, while Britain is set to lose 1,700 jobs and Spain 900. 
It has said it has no plans to close its dozen or so manufacturing sites spread across its four core nations but began detailing reductions at each plant in talks on Thursday.
""Nobody has been spared,"" said CFE-CGC union official Francoise Vallin outside Airbus headquarters in Toulouse.
Airbus unions and leaders are at odds over whether the health crisis that restricted air travel and crippled airlines is a temporary one or the sign of more structural problems.
At stake is how quickly Airbus can carry out its biggest ever shake-up and whether existing furlough schemes are enough.
Airbus wants to act swiftly to pre-empt a second wave of the virus in the coming winter and counter what its chief executive has described as a structural shock to the aviation industry.
It is looking for an agreement by the autumn and all cuts implemented by the summer of next year, which is seen as a relatively rapid timetable for big reorganisations in Europe.
Unions want any adjustment spread out over a longer period, relying more on the ordinary pace of departures. They have declared a ""red ""line against compulsory job cuts, backed by the French government which has called the plan ""excessive"".
""Natural departures are about 6,000 per year in the group, so if you spread it over two years, you can absorb part of the plan through natural erosion,"" Jean-Francois Knepper of the Force Ouvriere union said.
He declared the reorganisation plan ""a cataclysm"". 
SUPPLIER FEARS
Talks begin in earnest on Monday with the CGT union calling a ""day of action"" among French aerospace workers on July 9. Some Airbus workers plan demonstrations a day earlier.
Airbus has said it does not expect air travel to return to normal for 3-5 years.
It is planning to cut 980 headquarters staff in Toulouse as part of the shake-up.
After seeing its executive ranks grow in recent years, insiders say it has embarked on a battle against fixed costs. 
Officials in Toulouse, Europe's aerospace capital, are worried about the trickle-down impact of the job cuts on everything from small suppliers to shops and house prices.
""Airbus and its immediate Tier 1 suppliers can survive with negotiated layoffs, but Tier 2 and 3 ones could be devastated,"" said Jean-Louis Chauzy, head of the CERER consultative body in Toulouse's Occitanie region

Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, pledged to win guarantees from Airbus about its presence there. The company's Spanish plants are set to lose 900 jobs mainly as a result of a slump in wide-body jets for which it makes parts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity funds that were able to best weather the global economic upheaval from the coronavirus pandemic this year are turning to healthcare, e-commerce and electric vehicle stocks as they look ahead to 2021. 
Few expect a quick economic recovery or containment of the virus that would allow a widespread return to office buildings and schools. Instead, top-performing fund managers say they are positioning their portfolios to benefit from an increase in new forms of technology as businesses and consumers change their habits amid a lingering pandemic. 
""It's depressing to see the data that among the developed world, we're having the worst situation, but we're looking for the big industry trends that will persist no matter how long (COVID-19) goes on and will continue afterwards,"" said Michael Lippert, whose Baron Opportunity fund is up 30.7% for the year to date. 
As a result, Lippert has been buying shares of warehouse company Rexford Industrial Reality Inc as a play on the growth of ecommerce and data, and cybersecurity firm Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) Inc in anticipation that remote work will persist well into next year. Shares of Rexford are down nearly 10% in the year to date, while shares of Splunk are up nearly 33%. 
Overall, actively managed U.S. equity funds lost an average of 5.7% over the first half of the year, slightly more than the 4% decline in the benchmark S&P 500 index, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. Funds that outperformed tended to avoid industries such as retail and travel that were decimated by the global economic shutdown, and invested heavily in technology stocks, which rallied from the shift to working from home and helped push the Nasdaq Composite index to record highs.
The stark divide between technology and companies heavily affected by the shutdowns were evident in the wide range of fund returns for the year to date. The GMO Special Opportunities fund posted the top overall return in the first half of the year with an 80.4% gain, more than 20 percentage points ahead of its closest competitor. The worst-performing fund, the WP Smaller Companies Income Plus fund, lost 48.7%. 
A widening gulf between the best and worst-performing stocks is ""creating high opportunities for winners and losers at a security level, driving fund performance,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. 
Gerald Sparrow, whose Sparrow Growth fund gained 33.4% in the first half of the year, said he was focusing more on healthcare technology companies in areas such as monitoring and equipment. 
He expects more volatility in the sector as the U.S. presidential elections in November approaches as candidates propose caps on the cost of drugs and other procedures. That would lead to more opportunities for innovative companies that will take market share regardless of spending trends in the wider industry. 
""My word of wisdom is to buy heavily in healthcare the night before the election,"" he said. 
Gary Robinson, a portfolio manager of the Baillie Gifford US Equity Growth fund, which gained 45.3% in the first half of the year, said he was looking more at companies that will benefit from the shift to electric vehicles. 

""This is a trend that is going to continue regardless of the pandemic,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether American corporations can be sued for alleged human rights abuses occurring abroad under a 1789 law, agreeing on Thursday to hear appeals by two companies - Cargill Inc and a Nestle SA (S:NESN) subsidiary - accused of knowingly helping perpetuate slavery at Ivory Coast cocoa farms.
The two companies are asking the nine justices to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit, filed on behalf of former child slaves from Mali who worked on the farms, against the companies filed under the Alien Tort Statute to proceed.
The lawsuits targeted the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle, the world's biggest food producer, and commodities trader Cargill, the largest privately held U.S. company.
The case concerns the 18th century U.S. law called the Alien Tort Statute that lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in American courts in certain instances. The business community has long sought to limit corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute.
The plaintiffs accused the companies of aiding and abetting human rights violations through their active involvement in purchasing Ivory Coast cocoa and turning a blind eye to the use of slave labor on the farms despite being aware of the practice in order to keep cocoa prices low.
A federal district court in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit twice, most recently in 2017. That court found that the claims were barred by recent Supreme Court decisions that have made it harder for plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts for alleged violations overseas.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 revived the claims, citing the allegations that the companies provided ""personal spending money"" to local farmers to guarantee the cheapest source of cocoa. The 9th Circuit found that the payments were akin to kickbacks and that the low price of cocoa was dependant on the child slave labor.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Coca-Cola Company (N:KO) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) all filed briefs asking the court to hear the Nestle and Cargill appeals.

The Supreme Court in 2013 and 2018 cases has curbed the ability of plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts under the Alien Tort Statute for overseas human rights violations, but has not definitively ruled that U.S. companies can never be sued under that law.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Tesla's 'jaw-dropping' second-quarter deliveries send shares surging,"By Akanksha Rana and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) outpaced analyst estimates for second-quarter vehicle deliveries on Thursday, defying a trend of plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as coronavirus-linked lockdown orders kept shoppers at home, and sending its shares up 8%.
The unexpected delivery numbers come a day after Tesla became the highest-valued automaker, surpassing the market capitalization of former front-runner Toyota Motors Corp (T:7203).
The rally on Thursday further widens Tesla's lead over legacy automakers as investors grow confident in its ability to define the industry's electric and software-driven future. 
Shares surged by about $85 in early trading to $1,204.
Analysts said the solid delivery numbers heightened expectations for a profitable second quarter, which would mark the first time in Tesla's history that it would report four consecutive quarters of profit.
""A 90k delivery number in this COVID lockdown environment is a jaw dropper,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note. 
Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, significantly above estimates for 74,130 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data. It delivered 80,050 units of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 for the quarter.
The company did not break out deliveries by model or country, but Chinese vehicle registrations showed accelerating consumer demand for the Model 3 sedan. Nearly 16,200 Teslas were registered in China in April and May combined, with June figures still outstanding.
The company is also ramping up output at its Shanghai vehicle factory, where it aims to produce 150,000 vehicles by the end of this year. The Shanghai plant was only briefly impacted by coronavirus shutdowns in late January and early February.
Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory -- in California, where the bulk of its vehicles is currently produced -- was shut down for some six weeks during the quarter, heeding local orders to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. While vehicle deliveries increased 2.5% on a quarterly basis, production dropped nearly 20%.
""While our main factory in Fremont was shut down for much of the quarter, we have successfully ramped production back to prior levels,"" the automaker said in a statement. 
Tesla in January said 2020 vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units, a forecast the company has left unchanged despite the pandemic.
Tesla is now seeking a location for a second U.S. vehicle factory to build its Model Y and a new electric pickup truck, zeroing in on Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas.
Other major automakers posted lower U.S. monthly or quarterly new vehicle sales on Wednesday due in large part to weak fleet orders, but said consumer demand remained robust despite the continuing coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday it has agreed on terms for government loans with five U.S. carriers, including  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).
The Treasury said it had signed letters of intent with American, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA),  SkyWest  Airlines (O:SKYW), and  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) under a $25 billion emergency loan program created by Congress in March.
American said in April it expected to apply for a loan from the U.S. Treasury of approximately $4.75 billion on top of $5.8 billion in payroll assistance.
Treasury separately awarded airlines $25 billion in payroll assistance bailouts with most of the aid in the form of grants that does not need to be repaid.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that ""conversations with other airlines continue, and we look forward to finalizing agreements as soon as possible."" Airlines have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the loan.
Like the payroll assistance funds, the loans come with a ban on stock buybacks and paying dividends and set limits on executive compensation.
Hawaiian Airlines, which was awarded $292 million in payroll assistance, had sought an additional $364 million Treasury loan.
Spirit was awarded $335 million in payroll assistance and said it was eligible for $741 million in Treasury loans. SkyWest received $438 million in payroll assistance.
Airlines have warned that a recent spike in U.S. coronavirus cases could dampen travel demand that is still off around 75% from last year but has rebounded significantly over April lows.
American warned on Thursday that it is overstaffed by around 8,000 flight attendants.
Airlines can furlough or eliminate jobs starting Oct. 1.

Last week, six U.S. unions representing aviation workers told lawmakers another $32 billion in payroll aid is needed to keep hundreds of thousands of workers employed through March 31.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As some Americans prepare to travel for the July 4 holiday weekend, and airlines slowly ramp up service, the U.S. government has not changed rules for air travel during the pandemic, leaving airlines to implement their own measures.
Most are taking what they call ""a layered-approach.""
That is the trick, according to infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center: ""To implement a series of measures that work together to reduce risk. You can't rely solely on any one of them because there is no magic bullet that takes care of everything.""
Is he personally ready to fly? Not yet: people should still be sheltering in place if they can and avoid unnecessary travel, he said.
""By its very nature when you jam people together into a tube of toothpaste such as a plane, that's close contact and you're going to assume some risk while you do that,"" he said.
Here is a list of airline policies and what Dr. Schaffner had to say about each.
MASKS
Major U.S. airlines all require masks and have threatened to remove a passenger's flying rights for failing to comply.
""If I had to choose one thing, masks would be far and away the single most important thing.""
HEPA AIR FILTERS
These hospital-grade filters are standard on commercial aircraft and filter cabin air about every three minutes, removing 99.97% of airborne particles.
""These do a major job."" 
MIDDLE SEATS 
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) are blocking middle seats through at least September. American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) are not.
""Close intimate contact is the way this virus is spread. You're at risk based on the condition of the fellow passenger in your same row, two rows forward and two rows back.""
DEEP CLEANING
Airlines say they have increased cleaning between flights and overnight, disinfecting high-touch surfaces from seat buckles to overhead bin handles with products approved to kill human coronavirus.
Many also use an electrostatic spray that wraps around aircraft surfaces, killing viruses on contact and forming a protective shield for 30 days.
""These steps take care of the inanimate part of transmission. If you're particularly fastidious, bring some wipes along.""
TEMPERATURE CHECKS
U.S. airlines have called for government-administered temperature checks during the airport screening process but nothing has been agreed. Frontier Airlines began its own screenings last month.
""Useful but with profound limitations.""
HEALTH CHECKLISTS
Leading airlines are requiring passengers to disclose during the check-in process whether they have any COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed in the past 14 days.
""This is also limited because people can just tell you falsehoods.""
LIMITING FOOD AND DRINK SERVICES
Airlines have mostly suspended in-flight services on domestic flights.
""The issue is that you have to remove your mask while eating or drinking.""
DECALS INDICATING 6-FT SPACES ON FLOORS
Airports now have markers on the floor reminding people to keep a distance.

""That's a simple, inexpensive and very good thing to do. People do need reminding.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's markets watchdog has told the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) to improve its ""Chinese wall"" protocols among other changes to better manage potential conflicts of interest.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in the report, published on Thursday, that members of SEHK's Listing Department, which has a regulatory function, should not attend meetings with prospective listing applicants alongside HKEX business executives as this ""may give an impression that the Listing Department is assisting the HKEX business side to win business."" 
It also said that the listing department should take steps to improve its ""Chinese wall"" arrangements as the current protocol ""contains numerous ambiguities ... and may be difficult for Department staff to interpret and follow."" 
In a response included in the report, HKEX said it has been actively considering and reviewing, amongst others, the controls relating to the organisation and operation of the listing department, and that HKEX's business side no longer invites SEHK Listing Department officials to meetings with prospective companies. 
The SFC periodically reviews the exchange's performance. 
Hong Kong ranked third in global charts for IPO fundraising last year, having raised $24.2 billion, exculding  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s 12.9 billion secondary listing, according to Refinitiv data. 
In March, Hong Kong's anti corruption watchdog charged Eugene Yeoh, a former joint-head of the bourse's IPO vetting team, with bribery linked to IPO applications. 

Yeoh declined to comment on the charges when approached by Reuters last month outside a Hong Kong magistrates court where his case was ""mentioned"".

542,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",Delta's global growth drive stalled by Latin American bankruptcies,"By Marcelo Rochabrun and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) had a strategy for years: expand worldwide by buying stakes in airlines and partner with them while avoiding the cost and red tape of full acquisitions.
That strategy, more aggressive than those of any rival, could now backfire. Aeromexico this week became the third Delta partner to file for bankruptcy due to the coronavirus pandemic, following LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group and Virgin Australia.
In Latin America, Delta spent nearly $3 billion to build up stakes in Aeromexico and LATAM over the past three years.
The investments had promise before the pandemic, but their valuations have since been crushed and could be leveled entirely if equity holders are wiped out, as is common in Chapter 11 reorganizations. 
Even if that does not happen, Delta faces diluted equity stakes if other partners come in through the two airlines' reorganizations, as well as a probable downsizing. Both factors could make them less promising partners to connect with its flights.
In the worst case scenario, it would be at the back of the queue if either company liquidates, getting pennies on the dollar.
But over the longer term, partnerships could be a way for U.S. airlines to reboot international travel, which is expected to recover more slowly than domestic travel.
""A restructured set of partners ... could end up being the way that the U.S. majors reconstruct their global networks,"" said Vik Krishnan, who leads McKinsey's Travel practice in North America. ""In other words, they become more reliant on these partnerships rather than less.""
Even if Delta did want to trim back its global partnerships, the bankruptcies mean that any stake sale would make little sense, at a time when Aeromexico and LATAM are valued at record lows.
One consultant said there was a chance Delta could chip in some funds to help Aeromexico survive, given the importance of the market across the southern U.S. border.
""Delta has spent time, money and effort on Aeromexico. If they had to rescue them, I think they would,"" said Carlos Ozores, an aviation consultant at ICF.
It might not be as inclined to rescue LATAM, Ozores said, partly because the relationship is much newer. 
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian has said the company stands by its partners.
Following Aeromexico's bankruptcy, Bastian forecast it would emerge from Chapter 11 ""well positioned to succeed and will be a stronger partner for Delta."" 
But the carrier, which has received $5.4 billion in U.S. government aid to pay employees through September, has shown no willingness to put cash into foreign partners' restructurings. 
The Financial Times on Wednesday reported Delta would support Virgin Atlantic, in which it holds a 49% stake, with deferred payments on branding fees and shared IT platforms.
Its approach contrasts with that of state-controlled Qatar Airways, which owns a 10% in LATAM and has joined other shareholders to commit $900 million in cash to the Chilean carrier.
Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said the bankruptcies do not affect its financial position or the state of its balance sheet.
DIMINISHING VALUE
For years Delta built a foothold in new markets through joint ventures, which allow airlines to coordinate fares and schedules. By buying stakes, it also got to appoint board members to have a say in its partners' strategies.
But with border restrictions and international travel at a near standstill, the partnerships' economic and strategic value has been vastly curtailed, analysts said.
Three of Latin America's largest airlines - LATAM, Aeromexico and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) - are now in Chapter 11, as governments avoided potential bailout packages. Analysts expect a changed post-crisis landscape in the region with fewer competitors and higher ticket prices.
Delta paid $2 billion for a 20% in LATAM just 3-1/2 months before global travel imploded in March. With that money, it could now buy LATAM more than twice over.
It booked the value of its 49% stake in Aeromexico at $833 million in 2019, but as of Wednesday the investment was only worth about $85 million, according to the market cap value from Refinitiv, a data provider. 
In its bankruptcy papers, Aeromexico called its relationship with Delta ""extremely important in strengthening its position in the Mexico-United States travel market,"" the Mexican carrier's largest and most critical international market. 
Delta also owns stakes in Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) and Korean Air, and has a joint venture partnership with Virgin Australia, which is set to be bought out of administration by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, and joint venture agreement with Canada's WestJet pending U.S. regulatory approval.

It had been negotiating a stake in Italy's Alitalia which, since the pandemic, is expected to survive only by being re-nationalized.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",The heat's on Corporate America to reveal racial diversity data,"By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - American companies are coming under increasing pressure from investors to publicly disclose information about diversity among employees in the wake of nationwide protests against racial discrimination.
Many executives have pledged to champion equality in response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the United States and beyond.
The goal of global investors increasingly focused on social and governance issues is to gain a common metric on racial diversity to compare companies and hold them to account on their pledges, building on a drive to improve gender equality.
The good news, they say, is that U.S. firms with more than 100 employees already gather such data for the federal government annually via a form known as the EEO-1, along with gender information. 
However, the data is confidential and companies are not required to publicly release it, with some arguing it does not accurately capture the structure of their businesses.
Only 32 companies in the Russell 1000 make the information public, according to researcher Just Capital, either via the form itself or through detailed summaries.
""The EEO-1 is not the holy grail, but it's an excellent starting point,"" said John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Research and Management, an investment firm pressing executives to publicly disclose the data. 
Once companies began releasing information, it would create competition to improve diversity, he added.
This was echoed by Mirza Baig, Global Head of Governance at London-based  Aviva  Investors, part of insurer Aviva (L:AV).
""We think it's inevitable that those data points will be disclosed and we think companies should get ahead of it.""
UNDERREPRESENTED
Companies that file the EEO-1 form, to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), record the number of workers they have of each race and gender across 10 job categories, including senior officials, sales workers and technicians. The latest filings are for 2018, as the 2019 deadline was deferred to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The data reveals some very unequal pictures.
For instance, of 290 executives and top leaders at  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), one of the companies to publicly release the information, seven were Black and nine were Hispanic or Latino in the payroll period covering the last two weeks of 2018. 
Both figures represented only around a 3% share of top positions, well below the two groups' proportion of the U.S. population, of about 13% and 19% respectively.
At Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), in another example, Black people held 5% of 4,197 top-level roles as of last year, and Hispanic or Latino people held another 4%.
The figures are broadly in line with aggregated EEOC data https://www.eeoc.gov/statistics/employment/jobpatterns/eeo1/2018/national/table showing that of the roughly 900,000 people holding those top jobs across the country, about 3% were Black and 4% were Hispanic in 2018. 
Companies that disclose the data, like Uber and Bank of America, show a more serious effort to improve minority representation, said Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a University of Massachusetts professor who studies workplace diversity.
""Transparency is a prerequisite for both goal-setting and accountability,"" he added.
An Uber spokeswoman said the company ""is committed to investing in long-term strategies to create a sustainable pipeline of talent from historically underrepresented communities.""
Bank of America says on its website it is ""focused on attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent."" 
'WALK THE WALK'
There has been a marked shift in attitudes since the protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. 
Companies have collectively pledged hundreds of millions of dollars and to remake their own workforce profiles.
However firms voicing support for racial equality should back up their talk by releasing their EEO-1 data, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer says in letters being sent to 67 companies in the S&P 100.
""We're asking companies that condemned racism to walk the walk,"" Stringer, who oversees some $206 billion in retirement assets, told Reuters.
Activist investors say efforts to make diversity data public are gathering momentum, partly since this can be easier than reforms like adding social metrics to CEO pay programs or naming new board members.
For instance, at cybersecurity company  Fortinet  Inc's (O:FTNT) annual meeting on June 19 - the ""Juneteenth"" U.S. holiday marking the end of slavery in 1865 - 70% of shares voted backed a resolution to report on its workforce diversity. 
Kristin Hull, CEO of resolution sponsor Nia Impact Capital, said the vote tally - a record high among similar resolutions at U.S. companies according to the Sustainable Investments Institute - reflected the current discussion about race in corporate America.
A Fortinet spokesman said it planned to release its EEO-1 data.
MATCHING THE WORKFORCE
However to date, most companies have shied away from public disclosure of EEO-1 data. Executives say privately they worry about legal liability, bad publicity and attracting rivals' recruiters if they employ many minorities. 
Some argue the form's categories such as ""craft workers"" or ""laborers"" aren't relevant to their businesses. 
Even some of the activists do not give out their data. ""We have not historically published the EEO-1 forms, but we are reviewing that approach,"" said Robyn Tice, spokeswoman for Calvert parent  Eaton Vance  Corp. (N:EV) 
Some companies do disclose data, but on their own terms.
Just Capital counted 204 companies that disclosed some information on the gender and ethnicity of their employees as of August 2019, often in non-standard ways.
In a report on its website, for example, Starbucks Inc (O:SBUX) states that 17.5% of its executives ranked at senior vice president or higher are ""People of Color.""
A Starbucks spokeswoman said it was reviewing whether to release its EEO-1 data publicly.
Others disclose little data currently, like Snapchat parent  Snap Inc . (N:SNAP)
Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a CNBC interview on June 11 that, while it was working on providing more details, it was worried that disclosures ""have actually normalized the current composition of the tech workforce,"" which has few minorities.
A Snap spokeswoman said the company planned to disclose a breakdown of its employees by race and gender as the EEO-1 form outlined, but would likely use different job categories that better matched its workforce. It also plans to show additional data such as hiring rates, she added.

HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?
Calvert's Streur mentioned  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) as an example of a company that could expect more pressure to release its full EEO-1 data. 
Nearly every year since 2005, shareholder activists have put a resolution on the idea to a vote at the retailer's annual meeting - an uncommonly long run.
The company has opposed the resolutions. In its notice for this year's meeting, held on May 21, it noted it began releasing certain diversity data annually in 2018. 
In 2018, 48% of shares cast backed a resolution calling for the EEO-1-level disclosure. A similar resolution got 36% support at this year's meeting, held four days before Floyd's death. 
A Home Depot spokeswoman said it was ""committed to diversity and equal opportunity"". She cited a company diversity report, which states minorities made up 44% of its workforce in 2018.
American Century's Sustainable Equity Fund (O:AFDAX) was one backer of the resolution this year, according to Guillaume Mascotto, vice president for the fund manager. 
He said the national conversation about race would make more shareholders likely to back calls for disclosure in the future.

""More and more investors, especially those that have a long-term horizon are going to want to see how companies are approaching this.""

544,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher; Jobs Data Ahead,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Thursday, rallying ahead of the three-day weekend amid growing confidence of an economic recovery despite the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in many states. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.7%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 45 points, or 0.4%. The Dow Futures contract rose 259 points, or 1%. 
The three cash indexes are on course to post another positive week, following on from their best quarter in decades, amid signs that the vast monetary and fiscal stimulus from the U.S. authorities has resulted in a prompt economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak's ravages.
The U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded more than expected in June, housing data have shown a strong bounce and retail sales posted a record jump in May, adding to hopes that the recovery will be faster than predicted. 
With this in mind, attention will focus on the release of U.S. employment figures, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), to see if the world's largest economy can sustain its fragile recovery. 
Economists are forecasting the addition of 3 million jobs in June, building on the surprise 2.5 million gain a month earlier. Still, it will take some time to recover the approximately 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. 
The more up-to-date information will be from the weekly numbers, which are expected to show a further drop in the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits to 1.355 million from 1.48 million. 
Adding to the positive tone Thursday has been the news late Wednesday that a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX) performed well in early-stage human trials. 
Progress on the vaccine front has become increasingly important as events around the world, but in the U.S. in particular, have cast doubt over the willingness and ability of countries to enforce lockdowns effectively enough to contain the virus' spread. 
The number of reported new cases in the U.S. rose to over 50,000 Wednesday, a record for a single day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This has prompted a number of states to roll back on their reopening plans.
In corporate news, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will be in the spotlight after the fast-food retailing giant paused its reopening schedule, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday after Energy Information Administration data Wednesday showed crude inventories in the U.S. fell 7.2 million barrels from a record high last week, far more than expected. 
This backed up the American Petroleum Institute data from the previous day, which suggests a bump up in demand for crude.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $40.11 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $42.36.
Elsewhere, gold futures were up 0.3% at $1,784.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1276, up 0.2% on the day.

545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Deutsche Boerse’s Outage Fuels 35% Volume Crash in German Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The sudden, hours-long breakdown in Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG’s electronic trading system on Wednesday led to a significant drop in volumes across affected markets, adding to the summer lull and leaving some traders frustrated.
Transactions on Germany’s DAX Index tumbled 35% to the lowest level since May 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Budapest, volumes fell 47% and in Prague the decline reached 66%. The exchanges, along with those in Vienna, Zagreb and Ljubljana, share Deutsche Boerse’s T7 trading system.
The technical glitch lasting about three hours muted market activity during an already quiet trading week, as the U.S. prepares for a public holiday and with many traders away from their screens for summer vacations. It was Deutsche Boerse’s second major malfunction this year as a result of a software issue, leaving market participants wondering whether there could be more.
“I hope we won’t see a repeat of this breakdown -- such an outage should remain an exception,” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere, head of trading at asset manager MPPM EK in Eppstein, Germany. “Any trader who misses profits will not be amused.”
Some traders were frustrated by the decision to resume derivatives trading, including bund futures, on the Eurex platform 30 minutes earlier than on Xetra, according to Hernandez Sampere.
To be sure, Wednesday’s slump in volumes wasn’t limited to European stock exchanges hit by the T7 trading system’s crash. The FTSE 100 also saw an 8.6% decline in trading volumes, while the drop for the CAC 40 was 7.7%.
“It was the first day of the month and most investors are likely to have done their trades before or at month-end as it was half year-end on Tuesday,” said Matthew McLoughlin, London-based head of trading at Liontrust Investment Partners LLP. “Also, U.S. investors will have a quieter week building up to the fourth of July holiday, so that could have had an impact. I agree that volume could have been made up for in the closing auction, but I don’t think there was demand for it yesterday.”

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is not exempt from paying value added tax (VAT) on part of a service from an outside supplier to help manage its funds, a European Union court ruled on Thursday, dashing the fund sector's hopes for cost savings.
The world's biggest asset manager had argued that between Jan. 1, 2010, and Jan. 30, 2013, it should not have to pay VAT on all the service given that it included services for special investment funds, which are exempt from the tax.
Britain's tax authority disagreed and sought to recover the unpaid VAT for that period.
The First Chamber of the Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that a ""single supply of management services, provided by a software platform belonging to a third-party supplier for the benefit of a fund management company, which manages both special investment funds and other funds, does not fall within the exemption provided for in that provision.""
BlackRock said it respected the EU court's decision.
The court said that BlackRock in Britain receives services from a unit in the United States via a software platform called Aladdin that provides portfolio managers with market analysis to help make investment decisions.
These services constitute a single supply, whichever funds are being managed, it said.
Gert-Jan van Norden, a financial services partner at KPMG Netherlands, said the ruling would be a disappointment for the wider funds industry, which was hoping to copy BlackRock had the ruling gone the other way.

""It does not seem a very reasonable outcome. If you bought these services from two different entities, it would not be a problem,"" van Norden said.

549,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Set for a Rare Moment of Outperformance,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The first week of the new quarter appears to be suggesting that asset managers believe in the European recovery.
By 5:30 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.2% at 365.52, continuing a rally that started in mid-March. It's over 27% up from those lows, but is still 16% below its pre-lockdown levels.
The German DAX was up 1.8% and the FTSE 100 was up 0.8%.
For most of the three and a half months since markets bottomed, Europe has lagged the U.S., due to some initial concerns about the Eurozone policy response and to the relatively light weighting of tech stocks that appear best placed to survive and prosper in the post-pandemic world.
However, there’s a growing sense that Europe should enjoy a rare moment of outperformance in the coming months. Not only is the U.S. election and all the associated uncertainties for U.S. policy direction, starting to loom large. But the economy itself appears to be better positioned for a more convincing rebound, given Europe’s better performance in containing the coronavirus. Policy-makers in Europe and the U.S. are nearly unanimous in agreeing that there can be no economic recovery without getting the virus under control, so the state of the medical emergency matters enormously to market valuations. 
With the exceptions of the U.K. and Sweden, Europe has throttled Covid-19. From a peak of around 35,000 in April, the rate of new infections per day has fallen to less than 5,000. That compares to a daily record of 52,000 in the U.S. on Monday, with a clearly rising trend and increasing evidence that economic reopening is being delayed or even reversed.
High-frequency data such as IHS Markit’s purchasing managers indices the Ifo and Insee surveys of German and French business confidence also point to a smart rebound in activity in the third quarter. While the Eurozone composite PMI was still – just – in contractionary territory in June, the first flows of summer tourists in July should ensure that it returns above 50 next month.
To add to this, European policy-making is enjoying a rare moment of enlightened consensus, with the vast majority of EU members – including Germany and France – aligned in pushing for a ground-breaking 750 billion euro recovery fund that will support the economy from next year. The phantom threat of the German constitutional court to the ECB’s monetary stimulus is receding as Germany’s lawmakers take the side of the ECB. And European banks are about to channel an extra 549 billion euros from the ECB’s last ‘TLTRO’ operation into the economy now.
Of course, the outlook still has huge risks, not least in the shape of British tourists spreading the virus through the laughably-named ‘air bridges’. And longer-term, says ING’s Carsten Brzeski, you can fret about the likelihood of a permanently higher jobless rate and the risk that – in a de-globalizing world – Europe won’t be able to export its way to recovery as it has done in the past.
However, those are arguably worries for another quarter."
550,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Apple supplier Foxconn, others hit as India holds up imports from China: sources","By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's additional scrutiny of imports from China has disrupted operations at plants owned by Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) in southern India, three sources told Reuters, and other foreign firms are also facing delays as tensions between the two countries build.
Customs officers at Indian ports have held back shipments from China and sought additional clearances after deadly clashes at the disputed Himalayan border last month. The checks have been imposed without any formal order.
While several companies such as Apple (O:AAPL) and Dell (N:DELL) have been battling to free stuck shipments, hundreds of employees at Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn's two plants in the south had no major work to do this week as shipments were delayed, sources said. 
More than 150 Foxconn shipments - containing smartphone and electronic parts - were stuck at the port of Chennai, though some are being cleared slowly now, the first source said. The total number of parts in the shipments was not clear.
Foxconn's two plants in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh state mainly assemble Apple (O:AAPL) and  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) smartphones in the country and employ thousands of workers, many of whom stay in company-provided accommodation.
""Foxconn was in a very bad state ... lots of workers stayed at the dormitory because there was no work,"" said the first source. 
Foxconn, Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to Reuters queries.
The finance ministry also did not respond. Two officials at the ministry, which oversees the customs department, said the inspection measures were temporary and will ease soon. 
""We cannot keep checking 100% of shipments forever ... Shipments of non-Chinese companies being impacted will be cleared on priority,"" said one official.
While the exact impact of the disruptions is not immediately clear, the delays come when companies in India had already been battling disrupted supply chains due to coronavirus shutdowns in recent months. Business activity has only just begun to pick up.
Prominent U.S.-India lobby groups and local industry bodies have urged the Indian government to intervene.
While some delayed Dell shipments have been cleared since last week, the company had roughly 130 shipments stuck this week at Indian ports, the second source said. This included around six shipping containers with parts for servers and desktop computers, the person added.
Dell did not respond to a request for comment.
Separately, MG Motor, owned by China's SAIC (SS:600104), also has some shipments stuck at a port in southern India, a source close to the company told Reuters. MG started selling cars in India last year and has committed $650 million in investments.
""The whole (auto) industry will be impacted if components are stuck,"" the source said.
MG Motor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday that it hoped India would correct its discriminatory actions against Chinese companies immediately, after India banned some Chinese mobile apps amid the border crisis.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Stocks skip higher ahead of U.S. jobs data,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a fourth straight day on Thursday as encouraging coronavirus vaccine trials kept investors' spirits up ahead of what was expected to be a record rebound in U.S. jobs figures later.
Economists polled by Reuters expect a bumper 3 million U.S. jobs to have been added in June on top of the 2.5 million created in May, and some generally reassuring data from both Asia and Europe this week. 
Despite the ongoing rise in global virus cases, Asian equity markets saw their biggest daily rise in over two weeks overnight, aided by news that a vaccine being trialled by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Germany's BioNTech had been well tolerated in early-stage human tests. 
Europe made a strong start, with banking, travel and carmaker stocks driving 1-2% gains for its main bourses, and the euro helped back up towards $1.13 by another drop in the dollar. 
""The big thing today is the U.S. non-farm payrolls... but by and large risk has been bid and the dollar has been weakening,"" said RBC FX strategist Alvin Tan.
""What has really helped sentiment (in the last 24 hours) has been some of the preliminary results on a vaccine"".

News emerged late Wednesday that a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech performed well in early-stage human trials and saw the production of neutralizing antibodies in all the patients who were inoculated after 28 days. 
Progress on the vaccine front has become doubly important as events in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere have cast doubt over the willingness and ability of western countries to enforce lockdowns effectively enough to contain the virus' spread. 
The number of reported cases in the U.S., the world’s economic engine, rose to over 50,000 Wednesday, a new record for one day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

It also reported strong trading at its sugar business.

May unemployment data for the euro zone is due out at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), and is expected to show a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.7% from 7.3% in April.
But the main focus of the day will turn to the release of U.S. employment figures, at 08:30 AM ET, to see if the world's largest economy can sustain its fragile recovery. 
Economists are forecasting that the U.S. economy added 3 million jobs in June after a shock 2.5 million gain a month earlier. But the two months of gains would still pale in comparison to the approximately 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. 
Oil prices edged higher Thursday after Energy Information Administration data late Wednesday showed U.S. crude inventories fell 7.2 million barrels from a record high last week, far more than expected. 
This backed up the American Petroleum Institute data from the previous day, which suggests a bump up in demand for crude.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Commodity trade financiers in Singapore are teaming up to strengthen lending practices and improve transparency in the sector following a spate of defaults at trading firms, four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, one of Asia's biggest oil traders, and three other Singapore-based commodity traders ran into severe financial difficulties this year, hit hard by an oil price crash and a slump in fuel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Commodity trade finance chiefs from about 20 banks including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd and OCBC, have formed a working group to propose new guidelines, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity as the news has not been made public.
Authorities that have leant their backing to the working group include the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Enterprise Singapore, an agency that promotes trade, and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.
The move is the strongest response yet by banks and Singapore regulators to shore up confidence in the commodity trading industry.
HSBC, DBS and OCBC declined to comment. The MAS and Enterprise Singapore said they would issue a response later on Thursday. 
Two of the sources said many European lenders are also part of the working group.
Scorched by losses, several banks have tightened credit and stepped up scrutiny of existing loans to commodity firms, which has played a part in reducing trade volumes in the region. [nL3N2CB0XA][nL3N2C90SQ]

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher at the open Thursday, helped by positive results from a potential Covid-19 vaccine although sentiment remains cautious as coronavirus cases mount ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data.

The number of reported cases in the U.S., the world’s economic engine, rose to over 50,000 Wednesday, a new record for one day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
At least five states -- Arizona, California, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas -- had record-high totals of new case reports.

558,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 01:18AM ET</span>",The Retail Apocalypse Is Getting Even Darker for U.K. Landlords,"(Bloomberg) -- The collapse of mall landlord  Intu Properties  Plc (LON:INTUP) is about to send shockwaves through a sector that’s already reeling.
Nine of the U.K.’s biggest shopping centers could potentially be sold into a market that had already seized up before the virus struck. With the tenants of those properties only paying a fraction of their rent as the pandemic deepens a prolonged retail crisis, the risk they’re sold at knock-down prices threatens to further sink the values of malls nationwide.
And that all assumes one key factor: somebody wants them in the first place.
“The buyers of these assets will pay a yield that reflects the increased credit risk, the increased obsolescence, increased vacancy and reduced footfall,” said Andrew Jones, chief executive officer of LondonMetric Property Plc. “Tomorrow’s rent is a lot lower than today’s, so the price will reflect a new paradigm -- it’s a pretty scary outcome.”
Retailers paid just 36% of third-quarter rent due last week, compared with 41% on the collection date three months earlier, according to data from Remit Consulting out Thursday.  Hammerson  Plc (LON:HMSO), which owns about a dozen large U.K. malls, said on Wednesday it had so far collected just 16% of third-quarter rents that were due last week on its British properties.
Once a reliable source of cash flow, malls and stores have become a major drag on the share prices of landlords including British Land Co. and  Land Securities  Group Plc (LON:LAND). The arrival of Covid-19 has only piled on further doubts about the assets’ future, as the outbreak accelerates a shift to online consumption that was pushing brick and mortar retailers to the brink even before they faced months of forced closure.
The meager rent payments are a grim indicator of how many retailers will actually survive the crisis, according to Rob Virdee, an analyst at real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. Furniture chain Harveys and the U.K. arm of Victoria’s Secret are among those that were placed into administration in the past month.
And even those that avoid bankruptcy are slashing their real estate footprint. Shirt maker TM Lewin plans to close all of its brick and mortar outposts and cut 600 jobs as it moves online, while John Lewis is planning to close some of its 50 department stores, the Evening Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
“It is virtually every day that we get another administration,” LondonMetric’s Jones said. “I’m not interested in the current rent because I have no confidence that rent is going to stay the same.”
Landlords are having to work harder to maximize their rent collection figures. Most have switched to monthly rents and are agreeing deals with individual retailers offering a range of solutions, from rent holidays in exchange for lease extensions to long-term repayment plans.
But it’s clear the balance of power has shifted. Pepco Group, owner of the Poundland value chain, said last month it had renegotiated the leases on 76 of its stores and secured rent cuts of more than a quarter.
Furthermore, a government decision to extend restrictions on tenant evictions hasn’t encouraged retailers to pay what’s due, Stifel analyst John Cahill wrote in a research note Wednesday. Even retailers that remained open through lockdown, such as Boots drugstores, withheld some rent payments.
Extreme Makeover
Recognizing the threat of widespread retailer failures on landlords and their lenders, the government announced Tuesday that it would relax planning laws, making it easier to convert stores for other uses.
Many owners of stores and malls are already looking at ways to convert them into apartments or even warehouses to capitalize on the explosion in online shopping -- anything but stores. NewRiver REIT Plc, is working up plans for about 2.5 million square feet of development projects across its existing portfolio of malls and stores, Chief Executive Officer Allan Lockhart said last month.
Intu had already begun drawing up plans to build homes around some of its properties before its collapse. Cashed-up real estate companies or private equity firms with deep pockets will likely be looking at the firm’s properties in the same way.
The long-suffering landlord called in the administrators on Friday, as the pandemic shut off rescue options including a capital raise to reduce its 4.5 billion-pound ($5.6 billion) debt pile. Talks to stave off the company’s collapse failed against the backdrop of a looming half-year valuation of its properties that most lenders expected to result in another severe hit.
In the current environment, a price is anyone’s guess. Investors don’t believe major landlords’ own mall valuations, with firms’ shares trading at deep discounts to the stated value of their assets.
“We are closer to the bottom now, it’s just whether or not the bottom has moved,” Jones said. “Trends that were taking years to play out are now taking place in weeks or months.”

The company will reduce its international and transcontinental crew to the minimum required by the Federal Aviation Administration, plus one flight attendant, effective from Oct. 1, 2020, Jill Surdek, American Airlines' vice-president of flight service, said in a letter to employees on Wednesday.
U.S. carriers have warned that furloughs could take place in October, when the government payroll aid for the airline industry expires, but said they were hoping to avoid them. 
""While we hope our customers continue returning to the skies in the coming months, the reality is that this pandemic has changed our business for years to come,"" Surdek said.
The company said it would initiate early-out programs to minimize the need for furloughs and would address the excess numbers in the coming weeks. 
Last week, American Airlines said that avoiding furloughs will be difficult and it expects to have between 10% and 20% more workers than needed in July 2021. 
Earlier in the day, rival JetBlue (O:JBLU) and pilots' union Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), reached an agreement to avoid involuntary furlough until May 1, 2021. 
Separately, American Airlines said on Wednesday it expects its summer 2021 long-haul international capacity to be down 25% compared with 2019, as it sees significantly lesser business from its international market. (https:// ""The COVID-19 has forced us to re-evaluate our network,"" Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja said, adding that the company will have a significantly smaller international network in the year ahead.

Pfizer’s early stage human trial for BNT162b1, one of four mRNA candidates currently under development by the company, saw the production of neutralizing antibodies in all the patients who were inoculated after 28 days.
But some investors urged calm and caution over the positive results from yet another vaccine candidate.
“We are cautious... we have received positive news about potential vaccines in the past, but all are yet to see widespread production and distribution,” Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), said in a note.
Meanwhile, there are more than 10.6 million COVID-19 cases globally as of July 2, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The ever-rising number of cases prompted World Health Organization officials to warn that countries with increasing numbers of cases might need to reinstate lockdowns as well as other restrictions to curb the virus’ spread.
“Some countries who have had success in suppressing transmission who are opening up now may have a setback, may have to implement interventions again, may have to implement these so-called lockdowns again. We hope not. We hope that we won’t have to go into widespread lockdown again. So it’s not too late to act fast,” Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said during a press conference on Wednesday.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears exploring sale of home improvement business,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears is exploring a sale of its home improvement business following interest from potential suitors such as private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
The struggling U.S. retailer's Sears Home Services division has emerged as a coveted asset during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers embark on renovations while they stay home.
The division is one of the department store operator's few crown jewels following its bankruptcy in 2018 and $5.2 billion sale to hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert, who was already its biggest shareholder and creditor.
Transformco, the owner of the Sears and Kmart retail chains, could raise at least $1 billion by divesting the home improvement business, the sources said. Sears has tapped investment bankers at Guggenheim Securities LLC to explore selling the business, the sources said. 
Transformco could also sell a stake in Sears Home Services and retain some ownership of the business, one of the sources said, cautioning that a deal may not come together at all. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Transformco and Guggenheim declined to comment. 
Sears Home Services handles work such as appliance repair, replacement of vinyl siding, roofing and kitchen remodeling. 
Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) earlier this year acquired Sears' logistics business Innovel Solutions for $1 billion, allowing the company to refinance its debts. Sears last year also sold its DieHard battery brand to  Advance Auto Parts  (N:AAP) for $200 million.
Lampert, once Sears' CEO and chairman, has been slimming down the department store operator for years. When it exited bankruptcy in early 2019, the company had 425 Sears and Kmart locations. By late last year, the count was down to 182, Reuters reported.

In April, Sears temporarily closed all its stores in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to permanently close some locations in the months ahead, bringing its total store count, now around 90, to about 65, according to a source familiar with the matter.

562,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>",Hong Kong’s Stock Market Reopens to a Changed Reality Under Law,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Hong Kong’s stock market now need to factor in a substantially altered political and legal environment.
The city’s businesses reopen on Thursday after the July 1 holiday which saw the dramatic imposition of national security legislation. The new laws, drawn from mainland China’s system of governance, complicate the city’s reputation as a place with a robust rule of law. They will also likely ignite concern about capital flight, especially after Boris Johnson’s government said it will allow millions of Hong Kong citizens to move to the U.K.
The city’s financial markets have been resilient to the crackdown, although no one had seen the contents of the legislation until Tuesday evening. While the Hang Seng Index sank the most in five years the day after the planned law became public knowledge, the benchmark took less than two weeks to recover from that shock. The gauge is almost exactly where it was before China’s move to crack down on dissent in the city was first reported, with cheap valuations and steady inflows from mainland-based investors supporting local financial markets.
The Hong Kong dollar is also showing few signs of stress -- trading near the strong end of its trading band against the greenback. Its 12-month forward points have dropped since spiking to the highest level since 1999 in May, showing demand to speculate against the currency is also waning.
There are clear signs that Beijing intends to prop up Hong Kong’s financial system through inflows and a flood of stock listings by mainland companies. Whether that support will be enough to maintain (or replace) the confidence of the global business community will need to be seen.
Investor confidence remains muted. The Hang Seng is in a bear market even as stocks in the U.S. and a benchmark of Asian shares recovered. Hong Kong equities lost almost 7% in May, the biggest drop relative to the MSCI All-Country World Index since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. That made the Hang Seng so cheap it still trades below book value, meaning traders are pricing firms’ assets at less than their stated worth.
Hong Kong’s economic outlook is clouded. The coronavirus pandemic has halted the daily influx of mostly mainland Chinese shoppers, hurting retail sales. The city’s wider economy contracted 8.9% in the first quarter from year-ago levels, suffering its worst quarter on record and extending the first recession in a decade.
With the new laws creating doubt over what could land people in trouble, global businesses will need to reassess Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a financial center. Further retaliation by the U.S. could also place the city even more firmly on the frontline of a battle between Beijing and Washington. All of which makes investing in Hong Kong assets a gamble on an increasingly uncertain future.

Airlines have been hit hard due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with American Airlines (O:AAL) and other U.S. carriers warning of furloughs in October, when the government payroll aid program for airlines expires.
Under the CARES Act that gave the U.S. aviation sector a $32-billion bailout to cover payroll, airlines cannot force any involuntary furloughs before October. Major unions have asked the U.S. Congress to consider extending the package through March 31.
Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said last week it will soon send warning notices to about 2,500 pilots regarding possible furloughs at the airline.

 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said in an employee town hall meeting last week that avoiding furloughs will be difficult and the U.S. airline expects to have between 10% and 20% more workers than needed in July 2021.

The fast-food chain, that saw a 30% dip in global sales in the first two months of the current quarter, has been hurt by the shut down of its restaurants.
During the coronavirus-induced lockdowns, fast-food restaurants had to limit operations, leading to lower sales. Nearly 99% of McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. remain open for drive through, delivery and take-out options.
New cases in the United States have been rising and several states at the center of a new surge in infections have taken steps back from efforts to ease restrictions on businesses.
""Our resiliency will be tested again. COVID-19 cases are on the rise – with a 65 percent increase in infections over the last two weeks,"" Joe Erlinger, McDonald's U.S. president and Mark Salebra, head of the National Franchisee Leadership Alliance said in the letter.

The company's shares were down about 1% in extended trading.

The completion of bankruptcy proceedings sets up the embattled company to tap a state-backed fund that would help power utilities cushion hits from wildfires.
PG&E said it deposited about $5 billion in the wildfire fund.
The company also said it will fund the wildfire victims trust with $5.4 billion in cash and common stock representing a 22.19% stake in the reorganized firm.
The utility had a tumultuous time since filing for bankruptcy protection in January last year, with California Governor Gavin Newsom raising concerns about the reorganization plan as well as a state regulator asking for governance and oversight changes to its plan.

The company, in June, also pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in Northern California touched off by the utility company's power lines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) agreed to pay $678 million to settle a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the U.S. government accusing the Swiss drugmaker of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe its cardiovascular and diabetes drugs.
The U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement late on Wednesday to resolve charges that Novartis violated the federal False Claims Act and an anti-kickback statute.
Novartis was accused of organizing tens of thousands of sham educational events where it provided doctors with exorbitant speaker fees, lavish dinners and expensive alcohol to induce more prescriptions.
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan called the incentives ""nothing more than bribes,"" and said federal healthcare programs paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursements for the tainted prescriptions.
""Giving these cash payments and other lavish goodies interferes with the duty of doctors to choose the best treatment for their patients and increases drug costs for everyone,"" Strauss said in a statement.
Novartis admitted and accepted responsibility for many of the allegations and agreed to scale back its speaker programs.

The payout includes $591.4 million to the U.S. government as damages under the False Claims Act, a $38.4 million forfeiture for violating the anti-kickback statute, and $48.2 million to various U.S. states, the Justice Department said.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 06:35PM ET</span>","U.S. regulator, Boeing complete 737 MAX certification test flights","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) have completed certification test flights on the 737 MAX, a key milestone toward the plane's return to service, the U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.
The MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
The FAA said it must still evaluate data from the three days of testing and has other tasks to complete.
""The agency is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing's work,"" the FAA said. ""We will lift the grounding order only after FAA safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.""
Boeing declined to comment, saying it would defer to the FAA statement.
The tests of Boeing's proposed changes to the automated flight control system on the aircraft are a pivotal moment in the company's worst-ever corporate crisis. The FAA must complete the data review, approve new pilot training procedures, among other steps, and is unlikely to approve the plane's ungrounding until mid-September, Reuters reported this week.
If that happens, the jet is on a path to resume U.S. service before year-end, in a process plagued by delays.
The crisis has cost Boeing more than $18 billion, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still ongoing. In December, Boeing fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after scrutiny into the jet's design and development tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators.
A Transportation Department inspector general report first reported by Reuters on Tuesday faulted Boeing for not disclosing information to the FAA about a key safety system known as MCAS tied to both fatal crashes.

Boeing agreed to add significant safeguards to MCAS, make other software updates and move wiring bundles that the FAA said posed a safety hazard.

The mergers-of-equals transactions can help companies cut expenses and boost earnings without the ""stigma of transacting at lower values, premiums or multiples,"" Jefferies said in its July newsletter.
The coronavirus crisis has caused demand to plummet across industries such as retail and travel, hurting revenues and making it difficult for many firms to raise new capital.
""In the current economic environment, scale has become only more critical, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has cast a harsh spotlight on sub-scale enterprises,"" Jefferies said.
The U.S. investment bank also said that a ""V-shaped"" economic recovery was a long shot, given the risks of withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and a second wave of virus infections.
A new wave of cases, however, could trigger more monetary easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve and as a result strengthen stock markets, Christopher Wood, head of global equity strategy at Jefferies, said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - More than a thousand food delivery drivers on motorcycles gathered in São Paulo on Wednesday to protest their work conditions, set by  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and makers of other apps, as their services remain in high demand due to coronavirus lockdowns. 
The drivers seek better pay and improved health measures, with Brazil now a coronavirus epicenter and delivery workers facing exposure to the virus. 
Drivers paraded through Sao Paulo's Paulista Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare, blocking traffic, and also protested in other Brazilian cities. 
The government said this week that about 50% of working-age Brazilians are out of work due to the coronavirus, as the crisis pushes more and more people into precarious employment options. 
Lockdown measures have drawn more demand for delivered food in Latin America's largest economy. Brazil's iFood is the market leader, followed by Colombia's Rappi and Uber, which are larger companies but more prominent in other countries. IFood said some of its users were ordering as much as 30% more deliveries now than before the crisis. 
But drivers complained that the apps pay them less while making them work more, and that they face possible suspension if they do not comply. Several said the apps lure them with high pay at the beginning, which then dwindles over time. 
""They are making us work weekends, every day, or we face the risk of getting blocked,"" said Felipe Gomes, who delivers for iFood.
Amobitec, a trade group that represents iFood and Uber, said in a statement that competition among apps had become tougher during the pandemic, amid a ""significant increase in delivery drivers,"" but that the companies had managed to support many families during the crisis.
""The flexibility of apps was essential so that hundreds of thousands of people ... had an alternative to generate income and support their families,"" Amobitec said.
It was not the first time delivery workers have taken to the streets to demonstrate against Uber, Colombia's Rappi and Brazil's iFood. But the demonstration appeared to be the biggest. 
Customers and restaurants took to social media to support the drivers, whose cause was a trending topic in Brazilian Twitter feeds. 
Their working conditions have also drawn the attention of prosecutors, who have launched investigations of all the apps and sued iFood. 
The companies classify drivers as freelancers, insisting the firms are intermediaries between restaurants and the delivery workforce. They say the apps provide workers with the freedom to set their hours and level of commitment. But workers and prosecutors strongly disagree. 
""An algorithm determines everything for them: the value of the work, the duration of their work, even the route they should take, and if you don't accept, there are penalties,"" said Tatiana Simonetti, a Brazilian labor prosecutor. 
IFood and Rappi said worker demands have been addressed and would not commit to raising pay in response to the pressure. Rappi said most workers receive 18 reais ($3.38) per hour, although drivers told Reuters they often receive much less. 
Uber declined to comment, deferring to the Amobitec statement. 
Rodrigo Gandolfo, iFood's vice-president of logistics, said deliverymen get paid around 20 reais ($3.77) per hour at the busiest times, such as lunch and dinner.
""It's hard to talk about making structural changes,"" Gandolfo said. ""We can talk about constant improvement, but the majority of driver demands have already been covered by iFood."" 

The protests were to continue into the night, with the delivery workers riding their motorcycles through the city while wearing the branded backpack containers bearing the companies' logos.

The German automaker added that most of its employees working in production lines since May will have their contracts temporarily suspended. The other 50% that were previously furloughed will take over auto production until Aug. 31, as agreed between Mercedes Benz and workers union.
""With this schedule, we will have fewer people working per shift, which guarantees social distancing,"" the vice president of human resources at Mercedes-Benz for Latin America, Fernando Garcia, said in a statement. 
""In addition, we have temporarily adjusted our production volume to meet specific orders from truck customers,"" Garcia added.
Mercedes Benz's announcement comes as auto sales begin to recover from months of stagnation triggered by the economic fallout from COVID-19 pandemic. Brazil's auto sales have risen to 132,800 units in June, three sources told Reuters, compared with 62,200 in May. 

They added that approximately 10,000 trucks and buses were sold last month, up from 5,460 in May.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A top Mexican exporters' group on Wednesday urged the government not to spook foreign investors after a number of disputes erupted over major projects in the run-up to the start of a new North American trade deal.
Wednesday marked the entry into force of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at a time of growing commercial tension within the continent.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pushed for renegotiation of billions of dollars worth of contracts agreed under the last government. He also helped stop construction of a brewery in the border city of Mexicali by U.S. firm Constellation Brands, saying it jeopardized water supply.
The National Board of the Maquiladora and Export Manufacturing Industry (Index) warned that Mexico could be damaged by the Constellation Brands row and contractual disputes between the government and private energy providers.
""As Mexico we have to watch the messages we send abroad. The Constellation Brands issue and the changes to the rules of the game in the energy sector, among others, cause uncertainty and mistrust, and there must be trust for there to be investment,"" Index president Luis Aguirre told a videoconference. The $1.4 billion Constellation Brands (N:STZ) brewery was nearing completion when the project was halted by a March referendum against the plant which the president had encouraged.
The company and the government say they aim to reach an alternative agreement, but the news alarmed economic analysts.
Lopez Obrador has also argued that corruption skewed energy sector contracts in favor of private companies.

Aguirre said foreign direct investment into the export sector should increase ""significantly"" in the wake of USMCA's start provided authorities follow the group's recommendations.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said it would re-close more than two dozen stores in seven states starting Thursday, including its home state of California, bringing total closures to 77 as coronavirus cases continue to rise.
The stores will close in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada and Oklahoma, it said on Wednesday, when additional stores had already closed in Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Utah.
Apple has taken a city-by-city approach to opening and closing stores, evaluating data for each community. In cities where stores remain open, Apple requires face coverings for employees and customers while also performing temperature checks and frequent cleaning, the company said.
Apple's approach has meant that some stores remain open while others are closed in the same state.
In California, many Los Angeles area stores will close Thursday as the region's coronavirus cases rise, while a flagship store in San Francisco's Union Square shopping district remains open. In Texas, stores in the Austin area had remained open until this week despite closings in Houston last week.

Apple closed all of its stores outside mainland China in March, and not all U.S. stores re-opened after the initial closures. Apple has said its retail employees will continue to be paid through the closures.

Investing.com - The S&P closed higher, led by real estate and utilities, as improving jobs and manufacturing data and positive coronavirus vaccine data boosted investor sentiment at a time when rising virus cases threaten the outlook.
The S&P 500 gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.95% to close at a record high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) released online results of a vaccine that showed promise in boosting immune responses in healthy patients.The results have not yet been reviewed by a medical journal.
The positive early-stage results helped ease concerns about a spike in cases that has forced some states to stall reopening efforts.
Still, manufacturing and labor data continued to show signs the recovery remains on track.   
Private payrolls grew by 2.4 million in June, while May's figure was revised higher to 3 million, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. That missed economists' forecast for a rise of 3 million.
The private jobs data come ahead of the crucial nonfarm payroll report for June. Economists are forecasting that the economy generated 3 million jobs last month, but that ""seems aggressive, and sets the bar very high,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""We see risks skewed to the downside.""
On the manufacturing front, ISM manufacturing data  for June showed an uptick to 49.8, beating expectations of 49.6. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
The sharp rebound in manufacturing following the slump in April and May was led by strong improvements in the new orders and production indexes and paves the way for a solid month in July. The path beyond will depend on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, Jefferies added.
Energy fell 2.5%, shrugging off rising oil prices as worries over crude demand weighed on sentiment despite data showing U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 7.2 million barrels last week.
Rising mega-cap tech stocks supported the broader market, led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as the social media giant – taking steps to address recent concerns -- offered to meet with boycott organizers.
But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a notable exception to the climb in broader tech, after the iPhone maker said it would re-close more stores in seven states including Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada and Oklahoma, starting Thursday.
In other news, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares 19% higher.

2. Jobs and Unemployment Data
June jobs data and weekly unemployment claims may show improvement when figures are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Economists are forecasting that the U.S. economy added 3 million jobs in June after a shock 2.5 million gain a month earlier. But the two months of gains would still pale in comparison to the approximately 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April.

Covid-19 cases jumped again to more than 43,000 in the U.S., for a total of more than 2.6 million infections nationwide.
As a result, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is closing 30 stores, again, from California to Oklahoma, of its more than 270 nationwide. The market didn’t much care, with shares little changed at the close on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly preparing for market volatility ahead of the U.S. presidential election, with some shifting stock positions and selling the dollar, as Democratic contender Joe Biden maintains a lead against President Donald Trump in opinion polls.
Plenty can change in the four months before the Nov. 3 vote, and many investors remain focused on whether a resurgence of the coronavirus will damage a nascent U.S. economic rebound. 
Some money managers, however, are already preparing for the possibility of a Biden victory by betting against the dollar and cutting their positions in U.S. stocks. 
""The president's poll numbers have fallen off a cliff,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). ""The market is looking at this and saying, 'If the election were held today Biden would win.'”
The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden leading Trump by 8 percentage points among registered voters. Approval of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has plummeted.

A Biden victory - as well as a possible Democratic sweep of the House and Senate - could threaten policies championed by Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.
Despite the sharp coronavirus-fueled dip, the S&P 500 (SPX) is up about 37% since Trump took office. The index gained 85% and 79% during the first terms of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, respectively.
Under Biden, the corporate tax rate is likely to increase to 28%, reversing half of the cut enacted by Trump and the Republican-led Congress in late 2017, according to Amundi Pioneer Asset Management.
That could reduce S&P 500 earnings by roughly $20 per share, driving investors out of U.S. stocks and hurting the dollar, said Paresh Upadhyaya, portfolio manager at the firm who is betting against the greenback. 
Arthur Laffer Jr., portfolio manager at Laffer Tengler Investments, unwound his dollar position last week, believing a Biden victory could lead to slower growth and pressure on the U.S. currency. Laffer Jr's father has advised Trump on economic issues. 
Net bets against the U.S. currency in futures markets recently hit a two-year high.

“The two parties are as far apart on policy as they have ever been, making the result consequential for markets,” BlackRock's analysts said in a note.
Orlando of Federated Hermes has raised his cash allocation as coronavirus cases have grown and Trump's poll numbers sagged. He plans to reduce positions in dividend-paying stocks if Trump's slide in the polls continues on concerns about increased taxes on dividends and capital gains.
Plenty of investors remain unconvinced that a Biden victory or Democratic sweep would bode ill for stocks, especially as the Federal Reserve is expected to backstop the U.S. economy if needed.
""As long as (stimulus) stays constant ... you will continue to have some ballast in terms of asset prices,"" said Sam Hendel, president at Levin Easterly Partners. 
Some investors are also wary of putting too much faith in polls, after many failed to predict the UK's decision to exit the European Union in 2016 and Trump's election victory that year.

Traders in the options market are betting on a surge in volatility around the election. The S&P options market is implying an election-related move of 5-5.5% compared to an average absolute 1-day move of 2.92% in the past three elections, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives at Susquehanna Financial Group.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose multi-billion payoff on a bet against the overheated housing market a decade ago turned him into an industry superstar, will stop managing money for outside clients and turn his firm into a family office.
""After considerable reflection and careful thought, Paulson & Co. will convert into a private investment office and return all external investor capital,"" the 64-year old manager wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.
The news had been expected for some time after Paulson & Co's assets had been shrinking, prominent employees left the firm, and performance had been mixed.
Paulson himself hinted at the move toward a family firm, in which the wealthy invest just their own fortunes, in a podcast early last year.
Now he joins a number of prominent fund managers – Carl Icahn, George Soros, Stanley Druckenmiller – who have all returned outsiders' money and freed themselves from the pressures of sending quarterly client letters, talking clients through big positions and being always tethered to the office.
Paulson called his 26 years as a fund manager ""rewarding"" and said he is proud of his returns and the fact that the firm has been at the forefront of investing in global events ranging from the housing crisis to many block-buster mergers.
He plans to remain active in the markets, the letter said, without disclosing how much money will be returned to clients and whether his firm, headquartered in midtown Manhattan, might cut employees or cut the size of its offices.
""Even the great investors stumble, and when they do, they realize how little they like dealing with outside investor questions and withdrawals. Family office life, unlike family life, often is less filled with drama,"" said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan.
A spokesman for Paulson could not be reached for comment.
Bloomberg first reported the move.
At the start of 2020, Paulson & Co oversaw $10.7 billion in assets and noted in a regulatory filing that many of the funds were 100% owned by Paulson himself, suggesting that many outside clients had already left the firm.
Paulson, a soft-spoken manager with a courtly manner, shot to fame when he earned $4 billion off the subprime bet in 2007 and repeated with a $5 billion payout in 2010 on bets the economy would recover.
By 2011, his firm was managing $38 billion and Paulson was a regular speaker at industry conferences and guest at charity events. He donated to favorite causes and become somewhat involved in Republican politics. Central Park, where he often jogs, received $20 million and Harvard University, where he earned his business degree, got $400 million five years ago.
Still Paulson maintained a low profile by refusing most interviews and declining to discuss big investments on television. Some of those bets didn't work out and many clients left after losses on Sino-Forest Corp and drug companies like Valeant. The firm shrunk further when employees including Samantha Greenberg, Sihan Shu, Dan Kamensky, James Wong and Michael Barr moved on.

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) reported a staggering $3.58 billion quarterly loss on Wednesday as coronavirus-related store shutdowns resulted in a $3 billion impairment charge.
The global health crisis has forced brick-and-mortar retailers to tap credit lines, lay off employees and suspend dividends and buybacks in a bid to stay afloat.
""While our stores are reopened, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the country for the remainder of the year,"" Macy's chief executive, Jeff Gennette, said in a statement, adding that the department store operator does not expect another total shutdown of stores.
Macy's, which also owns Bloomingdale's, said net sales for the fiscal first quarter ended May 2 nearly halved to $3.02 billion.
The retailer's results come as some of its peers, including J. Crew, J.C. Penney (N:JCP) and Neiman Marcus Group, have filed for bankruptcy after failing to cope with market uncertainties and mounting debt.
Macy's, which on June 25 said it would lay off about 3,900 employees in corporate and management positions in a bid to save cash, did not provide an updated outlook.[nL4N2E2245]
Macy's has faced a huge slump in traffic at its stores, especially those in malls and urban areas harder hit by lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, Gennette said on a call with investors on Wednesday. 
He said he does not expect the ""virtual disappearance of international tourism spending"" to ""recover any time soon.""
In response to the market changes, Macy's has invested heavily in improving its digital business and personalized marketing, clearing out unsold inventory and offering services like curbside pickup.
""Whether in staffing, fleet size, online initiatives or real estate monetization, it (Macy's) is at last implementing the radical surgery that should have begun years ago,"" said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. ""Today's results should not be seen as any kind of surprise, but as a necessary reflection of reality -- in short, a deep reset of the entire enterprise.""
Macy's shares were down nearly 6% in afternoon trading.
On a per-share basis, the company reported a net loss of $11.53 in the first quarter compared with a profit of 44 cents a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company lost $2.03 per share, meeting expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

As of May 2, Macy's had $1.52 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $18.58 billion in total liabilities and shareholders' equity.

Debt flows accounted for $23.5 billion of total, while Chinese equities attracted some $6.1 billion, the data on non-resident flows showed.
Equities outside of China reversed an outflow trend to see net inflows of $3.4 billion.
Emerging Asia was the region that attracted the most flows last month with $17.1 billion, while Latin America, with $7.3 billion, came second.
Debt issuance picked up significantly in the second quarter, the report said, and is now above the average of recent years.
""We see this shift in sentiment as healthy, reflecting deeply discounted valuations in many places, which mean that adverse economic outcomes and weak growth are largely priced,"" IIF said.
However, the recent buildup in tension between Washington and Beijing is seen as a sentiment dampener toward emerging markets.
""Moving forward, we see investors being more discerning regarding investment decisions towards (emerging markets),"" the report said.

SEOUL/BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Some governments in Europe and Asia said on Wednesday they have enough of Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s COVID-19 anti-viral remdesivir for now despite fears of shortages since the U.S. drugmaker pledged most output to its home market for the next three months.
The pharmaceutical company's move stirred the global debate about equitable access to drugs and brought concerns about accessibility, especially in regions where coronavirus rates are still high or there have been new outbreaks. 
Remdesivir is in high demand after the intravenously-administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial. It is believed to be most effective in treating COVID-19 patients earlier in the course of disease than other therapies like the steroid dexamethasone. 
Still, because remdesivir is given intravenously over at least a five-day period it is generally being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalisation.
Britain and Germany said they had sufficient reserves for now, though they were weighing options for when those might be exhausted.
South Korea, for its part, has started distributing stocks, but plans talks to purchase more supplies in August. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) this week said it had secured all of Gilead's projected production for July and 90% of its production in August and September, in addition to an allocation for clinical trials.
The European Union (EU) said on Wednesday it was in negotiations to obtain doses for its 27 member nations. 
""SUPPLY CHAINS UNDER STRAIN""
""The buying-up of remdesivir is disappointing news, not necessarily because of the shortages it implies for other countries, but because it so clearly signals an unwillingness to cooperate with other countries, and the chilling effect this has on international agreements about intellectual property rights,"" said Ohid Yaqub, senior lecturer at the Science Policy Research Unit of Britain's University of Sussex.
Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer and lead for Britain's Department for Health and Social Care, told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday that new drugs such as remdesivir were likely to be in ""relatively short supply in the first instance"" versus existing generic ones like dexamethasone.
The German health ministry said that the conditional market approval Gilead is expected to receive from the EU's executive Commission this week carries an implied obligation to deliver sufficient quantities in the future.
""We trust Gilead will meet this obligation,"" it said.
Gilead has said it linked up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan to supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries, but it has not discussed in detail its supply strategy for developed nations outside the United States.
""The issue is the high demand for a drug that is still an investigational medicine and probably had not been scaled up to a manufacturing level when the outbreak occurred,"" said Gino Martini, the UK Royal Pharmaceutical Society’s chief scientist.

""The U.S. action means clinical supply chains will be under strain. It will be down to manufacturers Gilead to boost production in order to satisfy demand for the use of remdesivir.""

586,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 01:51PM ET</span>",Automakers laud U.S. consumer 'resilience' despite COVID-19 hit to sales,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Major automakers posted lower U.S. monthly or quarterly new vehicle sales on Wednesday due in large part to weak fleet orders, but said consumer demand remained robust despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
""This quarter demonstrated the resilience of the U.S. consumer,"" said Jeff Kommor, head of U.S. sales at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), as the automaker reported a 39% slump in sales for the second quarter. 
""Retail sales have been rebounding since April as the reopening of the economy, steady gas prices, and access to low interest loans spur people to buy.""
But some auto dealers worry that spiking coronavirus cases in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California could spell fresh trouble for new vehicle sales.
Scott Fink, CEO of Fink Automotive Group, which has two Hyundai stores and single Chevrolet, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Mazda dealerships in the Tampa, Florida area, said his sales in June were ""pretty good,"" but he was concerned about ""hot-bed states like where I am."" 
""I'm happy to do what we're doing, but there's a level of anxiety from top to bottom,"" Fink said. ""You can feel it with the consumers and you can feel it with staff members."" 
U.S. auto production was shut down for two months in the spring as part of efforts to thwart the spread of the novel coronavirus. That has left automakers scrambling to ramp up production again to boost low dealer inventories. 
""GM entered the quarter with very lean inventories and our dealers did a great job meeting customer demand, especially for pickups,"" Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president for sales at General Motors Co (N:GM). ""Now, we are refilling the pipeline by quickly and safely returning production to pre-pandemic levels.""
GM said its efforts to rebuild dealer inventory levels included working with logistics and trucking companies to make sure vehicles ship as soon as they roll off the production line. 
GM posted a pandemic-fueled 34% decline in second-quarter sales, but noted while April sales sank about 35% versus the same month in 2019, May and June saw declines of around 20% or under. 
""Our resilient sales reflect an improving demand curve,"" McNeil said.
April Ancira, vice president of Ancira Auto Group, which has 12 dealerships mostly around San Antonio, Texas, said in the short term she was more concerned about low vehicle inventories than consumer demand. But long term, she worries that government relief programs will run out before the U.S. economy recovers. 
""At some point, this is all going to catch up to us if things don't turn around in a hurry,"" Ancira said. 
While U.S. consumer demand for new vehicles has rebounded surprisingly quickly despite the economic ravages wrought by COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, fleet sales to rental car companies, corporations and government agencies have dragged overall sales down.
Recovery for those sales is expected to be slow, while the future of the rental car industry is uncertain. 
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said that while its overall sales fell 22% in June, sales to consumers rose 6% versus June 2019, while its fleet sales plummeted 93%.
FCA's Kommor said fleet sales ""remained low"" during the quarter as FCA ""prioritized vehicle deliveries to retail customers."" 
""As a result, we have built a strong fleet order book which we will fulfill over the coming months,"" he added.

Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported a 26.7% drop in sales in June, though sales for some SUV models were up versus the same month in 2019. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) said its second-quarter sales were down nearly 50%.

Hugo Boss said last month that Grieder, the former CEO of Tommy Hilfiger Global & PVH Europe, will start on June 1, 2021, succeeding Mark Langer.
The German company said on Wednesday that now the appointments to the board were complete, Langer would step down and take up a consultative role on July 16, rather than on Sept. 30 as planned when it announced his departure.
Hugo Boss said Langer's responsibilities were already being transferred to the remaining members of the board.

The carrier, which is in the process of being nationalised after 11 years of troubled private management, will fly from Milan Malpensa airport to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and London.
Milan city airport Linate, which before the health crisis was Alitalia's second-biggest airport after Rome's Fiumicino (MI:ATL), will reopen on July 13, two sources close to the matter said.
Starting from July Alitalia will also serve a dozen of domestic destinations from Milan Malpensa, expanding its offer from the Lombardy region, one of the most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.
Alitalia is currently run by a temporary administrator and the government announced in March that the treasury would become its main investor after the coronavirus sent the carrier's planned sale into tailspin. 
Bolivian-born entrepreneur German Efromovich, who had expressed his interest in investing in Alitalia before the health crisis, said on Wednesday he was still open to buy a stake in the Italian carrier alongside the government.
""I am ready to take a stake as big as the Italian government is prepared to offer ... I don't ask for the majority, but I want to have a say over the governance and the management of the company,"" Efromovich said during a hearing on the transport sector by Italy's parliamentary committee.
The entrepreneur, however, criticised Rome's plan to inject 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in the carrier, suggesting that the restructuring could be done with lower financial resources.
""On the basis of my personal experience speaking of 3 billion euros doesn't make sense,"" Efromovich said.

It is not clear whether Rome is prepared to team up with private investors in the restructuring of Alitalia.

Investing.com - Wall Street made a positive start to the third quarter as improving jobs and manufacturing data boosted investor hopes the economic recovery remains intact at a time when rising virus cases threaten the outlook.
The S&P 500 gained 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.74% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.
Private payrolls grew by 2.4 million in June, while May's figure was revised higher to 3 million, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. That missed economists' forecast for a rise of 3 million.
The private jobs data come ahead of the crucial nonfarm payroll report for June. Economists' are forecasting that the economy generated 3 million jobs last month, but that ""seems aggressive, and sets the bar very high,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""We see risks skewed to the downside.""
On the manufacturing front, ISM manufacturing data  for June showed an uptick to 49.8, beating expectations of 49.6. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
The sharp rebound in manufacturing following the slump in April and May was led by strong improvements in the new orders and production indexes and paves the way for a solid month in July, but the path beyond will depend on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, Jefferies added.
With many states including Texas, California, Florida, and New Jersey recently scaling back efforts to reopen businesses, the reopening trade came under pressure with energy and financials leading to the downside.        
Energy fell 2%, shrugging off rising oil prices as worries over crude demand weighed on sentiment despite data showing U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 7.2 million barrels last week.
Rising mega-cap tech stocks supported the broader market, led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as the social media giant – taking steps to address recent concerns -- offered to meet with boycott organizers.

In other news, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottomed lines, sending its shares 12% higher. 
On the monetary policy front, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's lastest meeting showed policymakers supported the need to continue rolling out stimulus discussed and bolstering forward guidance in the coming months, but determined that jury was still out on the use of yield curve control."

The decision was made with the state, he said.
“It is not the time to forge ahead with indoor dining,” de Blasio said, citing surging outbreaks in Florida, California and Texas. “The news we’ve gotten around the country gets worse and worse all the time.”
Instead, de Blasio said the city would help restaurants expand their operations outdoors on sidewalks and curbside parking spaces.
“I’m very convinced we can help restaurants survive, but we have to do it safely and do it outdoors,” he said.
The city’s second phase of reopening, which started June 22, has permitted more than 5,000 restaurants to set up outdoors, but the limited seating comes nowhere close to returning the beleaguered industry to where it stood before the pandemic forced a citywide shutdown in March.
Studies have found the virus spreads more easily indoors and particularly among diners in restaurants. Epidemiologists have said that in some restaurants, the virus has been transmitted as it moves through an interior space via air conditioning or cooling fans. This factor, combined with New York City’s population density and its status as an international and domestic gateway, heightens the risks of viral spread.
The mayor’s news for the city, reeling after months of a virus-imposed lockdown, wasn’t all bad, though. He said the city’s beaches in the Rockaways, Coney Island, Staten Island and the Bronx will open today, and that 15 of the largest public pools will be opened by August.
Three pools -- in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens -- will open July 24, and the other 12 on Aug. 1, de Blasio said.

597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",OPEC Cuts Output to Lowest Since 1991 as Virus Slams Oil Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC slashed oil production to the lowest level since the Gulf War in 1991, as it escalated efforts to revive global markets just as a resurgence of the coronavirus is threatening demand again.
Saudi Arabia faithfully delivered the extra curbs promised in June, and the laggards, though still trailing in implementing the cuts, stepped up their performance, according to a Bloomberg survey. OPEC and its partners’ record output cuts since May have helped revive the oil market, but a recent surge of Covid-19 infections in countries including the U.S. is highlighting the fragility of the revival.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production by 1.93 million barrels a day to 22.69 million a day last month, according to the survey. That’s the lowest since May 1991, though membership changes since then affect the comparison.
The survey is based on information from officials, ship-tracking data and estimates from consultants including Rystad Energy A/S, Rapidan Energy Group, JBC Energy GmbH and Kpler SAS.
The intervention by OPEC+, the coalition that spans the cartel plus outsiders such as Russia, has helped more than double benchmark Brent crude from the lows of April, when the virus outbreak is estimated to have taken out about a third of global demand. Prices were above $41 a barrel on Wednesday.
Yet the pullback in the group’s output to the lowest in almost three decades illustrates the scale of the sacrifice involved. OPEC+ pledged 9.7 million barrels a day of cuts at a meeting in April -- about 10% of global supplies -- and some of its Middle East members then promised to voluntarily cut even deeper in June.
Saudi Arabia, the group’s biggest member, cut back by 1.13 million barrels a day to 7.53 million in June, fully implementing its additional voluntary reduction. Fellow Persian Gulf exporters Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates met their OPEC-mandated targets, but fulfilled only a small part of the extra curbs.
Varying Compliance
Overall, OPEC delivered all of the reduction pledged in the April agreement, though rates of compliance vary significantly between members.
While Iraq, Nigeria and Angola are still lagging behind, their performances improved last month. Iraq implemented 70% of its quota, Nigeria 77% and Angola 83%. At a meeting in early June, the countries agreed to make up for earlier cheating by making extra curbs in the coming months.
Compliance from countries outside OPEC has been stronger than usual, as the scale of the demand collapse and risk of a renewed price decline encourage adherence. Russia pumped close to its target for a second month, and Kazakhstan was on track to hit its quota.
The slump in OPEC’s output also reflects the long-term decline in several members -- most notably Venezuela.
While exempt from having to make deliberate cuts, Caracas is nonetheless seeing output dwindle as U.S. sanctions and prolonged economic recession slam its petroleum industry. It pumped just 340,000 barrels a day last month, the survey showed.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Pfizer  jumped Wednesday after preliminary data for a Covid-19 vaccine showed promising results, pushing the market higher.
Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) rose 5% and its partner in the project,   Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX), rose 2.2%. TheDow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 are both trading slightly higher Wednesday.
The vaccine program, called Project Lightspeed, aims to battle the Covid-19 virus. It includes four investigational vaccine candidates. The preliminary data demonstrated that one of them, BNT162b1, could be administered in a dose that was well tolerated and generated dose dependent immunogenicity, the company said.
The data has yet to be peer-reviewed.
“We are encouraged by the clinical data of BNT162b1, one of four mRNA constructs we are evaluating clinically, and for which we have positive, preliminary, top-line findings,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., the senior vice president and head of Pfizer's Vaccine Research & Development unit.
“These preliminary data are encouraging in that they provide an initial signal that BNT162b1 targeting the RBD SARS-CoV-2 is able to produce neutralizing antibody responses in humans at or above the levels observed in convalescent sera – and that it does so at relatively low dose levels,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., the CEO and co-founder of BioNTech."

(Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on Wednesday as rising hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine reversed premarket losses, overshadowing fears of another round of lockdowns following a record surge in coronavirus cases in the United States.
A COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German biotech firm BioNTech showed promise and was found to be well tolerated in early-stage human trials.
Pfizer's shares jumped 4.1% on the news, while BioNTech gained 3%, helping improve the mood on Wall Street after the United States registered 47,000 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic.

The move by the troubled Beijing-based coffee chain comes follows a request by the majority of the directors based on a special committee's finding that the CEO and COO were involved in fabricating sales numbers.
The coffee chain, according to a media report, sold vouchers redeemable for millions of cups of coffee to companies that had ties to Lu, helping it record a sharp rise in sales.
Luckin said the committee found that 2019 sales were inflated by 2.12 billion yuan ($300.1 million), and costs and expenses by 1.34 yuan billion ($189.7 million).
Fortunes of Luckin, which directly competes with U.S.coffeehouse Starbucks (O:SBUX), have nosedived since the probe was disclosed in April, ending up with the Nasdaq suspending the trading in its shares on Monday.
The probe found funds ""were funneled to the company through a number of third parties associated with the company employees and/or related parties."" 
Lu, who is the controlling shareholder of Luckin, is also the founder of auto-rental firm CAR Inc and Chinese ride-hailing firm Ucar Inc.
During the investigation, Luckin sacked its CEO and COO, both executives who had previously held top positions at Lu's other firms.
The company said 15 employees are facing disciplinary actions and 12 others who participated in the transactions would be terminated. 
Luckin is also in the process of ending ties with all third parties involved in the fabricated transactions, it said, without revealing any names.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new report into the Federal Aviation Administration's decision to certify the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX may help proponents seeking reforms to the long-standing practice of delegating some aircraft certification tasks to manufacturers.
On Wednesday, the Transportation Department's inspector general released a 52-page report that said Boeing withheld key information about a crucial safety system known as MCAS, that is tied to two fatal crashes and raises questions about whether Boeing employees performing work for the FAA faced undue pressure.
On June 16, Senate Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker and the top Democrat on the panel Maria Cantwell introduced legislation to strengthen FAA oversight of aircraft certification. 
It aims to eliminate the ability of aircraft makers like Boeing to unduly influence the certification process, marking the most significant step toward reforms following the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people.
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told Reuters last week he planned to introduce his airplane certification reform bill in September. He praised some aspects of the Senate measure but said ""our bill will be stronger."" 
DeFazio praised the inspector general's report.
""The more scrutiny we put on Boeing and the FAA, and the more we dig into why and how the system failed so horribly and led to the deaths of 346 innocent people, the better chance we have of fixing the system to ensure no family has to endure this nightmare again,"" DeFazio said in a statement.
DeFazio said the IG report reinforced some findings in the committee's ongoing 737 MAX investigation, ""including Boeing’s efforts to conceal critical information from regulators in its rush to get the MAX to market.""

Boeing said Tuesday it was ""committed to transparency with the FAA during all aspects of the airplane certification process."" FAA said it is making significant changes to how it oversees certification tasks delegated to Boeing.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday after signs that the labor market may have held up better than expected over the last two months, along with another dribble of encouraging test data from biotech companies researching cures for Covid-19.
Payrolls processor ADP’s monthly update on private-sector job creation fell well short of expectations at 2.369 million, but the number for May was revised sharply upwards to a net gain of 3.065 million, from an initial estimate that 2.76 million jobs had been lost.
The mood was lifted further by the release of the Institute of Supply Management's monthly manufacturing survey. ISM's main index rose to 52.6, above the 50 level that typically represents growth, from 43.1 in May. That suggests that output had stopped falling by the end of the quarter.

Standout performers in early trading included FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock, which rose 16% after the company posted strong fiscal fourth-quarter numbers, helped by a surge in online buying amid the coronavirus pandemic, and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock, which rose over 11% after the meat substitute company signed a partnership with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) (NYSE:BABA) to make its plant-based Beyond Burger available in 50 Freshippo stores in Shanghai, starting this weekend. That's a welcome piece of upbeat news after McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) deflated hopes of a major distribution deal in the U.S. after a disappointing test run of its products in Canada.
Elsewhere, Macy's (NYSE:M) stock rose 2.0%, supported by the macro backdrop after reporting a whopping $3.58 billion loss for its fiscal first quarter and warning that it doesn't expect any significant recovery in the immediate future. The news, which had been expected, was taken as a step toward fundamentally ""resetting"" the business for the time after the pandemic.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",Investors reckon China's grip is good for Hong Kong markets,"By Samuel Shen and Noah Sin
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the streets of Hong Kong, activists protest against China's new security law. But in the trading rooms of Asia's dominant financial hub, investors are cheering the mainland's embrace.
Hong Kong markets will benefit from more listings by Chinese companies, more mainland money, and more financial links with the world's second-biggest economy, traders and analysts say, despite legislation some fear will erode the city's freedoms. 
Beijing unveiled the law on Tuesday, and Hong Kong police made their first arrests of protesters under the legislation on Wednesday.
But the street chaos may not spill onto Hong Kong's stock market when it reopens on Thursday after a public holiday, investors say. The Hong Kong dollar  did not budge when the new law was unveiled.
""As long as Chinese companies come and list in Hong Kong, the party will go on,"" said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities, Hong Kong. 
""Finance people are just obsessed with making money. Nothing can deter them from their only goal in life,"" Lun added, saying the finance industry was ""living in a parallel universe"" compared with ""democracy fighters"".
That disconnect could reflect the city's yawning wealth gap. It also underscores Hong Kong's increasing economic reliance on the mainland.
Investors' view of the law could change eventually if questions over Hong Kong's judicial and political independence force expatriates and businesses to leave, costing the economy dear.
Markets have been bracing for some impact, causing Hong Kong's stock market to underperform. The Hang Seng index (HSI) rose 3.5% in the last quarter, compared with 8.5% gains in Chinese shares (SSEC), and MSCI Asia ex-Japan's (MIAPJ0000PUS) 18% rise.
If there is a correction in the Hang Seng, it will mainly reflect a fragile economy and weak corporate earnings, said Linus Yip, Hong Kong-based chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd.
Washington's moves to revoke Hong Kong's special treatment under U.S. law will have limited impact, most analysts say, while closer economic ties with China will benefit the city. 
""The more interesting thing is U.S. restrictions forcing Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, that's only going to continue, which will be phenomenal for the Hong Kong stock market and the Hong Kong exchange,"" said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
CHINA'S EMBRACE
Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Bank, Singapore, said the fresh wave of secondary listings in Hong Kong by big Chinese companies is drawing massive amounts of cash into the city.
""Nothing pulls people more than if they can make money. So while there's plenty of uncertainty in terms of what this new security law entails, the money appeal remains a key magnet.""
In the first half of the year, secondary listings of U.S.-listed Chinese tech giants JD.com (O:JD) (HK:9618) and NetEast (O:NTES) (HK:9999) - the world's top 2 and top 3 flotations respectively - made Hong Kong the world's third-biggest initial public offering (IPO) market, according to accountancy firm EY. 
Money from Chinese listings would also bolster Hong Kong's currency, said Bruce Yam, strategist at Everbright Sung Hun Kai, Hong Kong. 
This week, China also announced details of a Wealth Management Connect scheme that links investments and financial services between Hong Kong, Macau, and their neighboring mainland cities, as part of a scheme to integrate Hong Kong more closely with the mainland. 
Chinese companies already account for 73% of Hong Kong's stock market capitalization, and China-related IPOs accounted for 82% of such funds raised in Hong Kong last year. 

""From a long-term perspective, the release of the National Security Law increases the predictability of Hong Kong's stability,"" said Mark Dong, Hong Kong-based co-founder of Chinese asset manager Minority Asset Management, which buys Hong Kong stocks via cross-border stock connect schemes.

(Reuters) - Treatments for peanut allergy and Parkinson's disease are among U.S. drug launches that have been postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic as drugmakers struggle with disruptions to business, a Reuters review of filings and interviews with executives show. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved more than 30 new medicines since January, but at least five drugmakers including Bristol Myers Squibb (N:BMY), Sanofi (PA:SASY), Neurocrine Biosciences (O:NBIX),  Endo Pharmaceuticals  (O:ENDP) and Aimmune (O:AIMT) have changed their launch plans. 
More may be delayed as authorities battle to control a pandemic that has already claimed more than 125,000 U.S. lives. 
""We don’t believe there will be any kind of 'new normal' until there are effective (COVID-19) vaccines,"" said Barry Greene, president of  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc (O:ALNY), which makes treatments for genetic disorders. 
""We are going to be in this interesting world for quite a while.""
Launching drugs is an expensive and complicated process that includes sales representatives talking to doctors, coordinating supplies and treatment with pharmacies and clinics, and advertising campaigns - many of which have become harder during lockdowns or other restrictions to tackle the pandemic. 
That's bad news for patients and drugmakers. 
Delays altogether could cost companies over a quarter of the originally estimated more than $1 billion in 2020 sales for the products approved by the FDA since January, according to a Reuters estimate based on company and analyst sales forecasts.
Hold-ups are mainly affecting treatments for diseases that are less acute, or less profitable for drugmakers, as the industry prioritizes its most promising new medicines.
""Clearly diseases that are less severe will have more impact to sales,"" Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) Chief Executive David Ricks said in an interview. 
Lilly and rival  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) have moved forward with launches of recently approved cancer drug Retevmo and heart disease treatment Vyandeqel, respectively, the only available treatments for two rare and potentially deadly conditions.
That's little consolation for patients waiting for delayed drugs, such as Neurocrine's Parkinson's treatment Ongentys. 
NEW WORLD 
""The sooner we get a new option, the better,"" said Rachel Dolhun, vice president of medical communications at the Michael J Fox Foundation, an advocacy group for patients with Parkinson's disease. There are already Parkinson's drugs, but they don't work well on all patients, she said. 
The first U.S.-approved treatment for peanut allergy, Palforzia from Aimmune, was put on hold after COVID-19 stalled its launch in March. The launch of multiple sclerosis medicine Zeposia was delayed by Bristol Myers Squibb by about three months before the company launched it in June.
For a list of affected drugs see FACTBOX. 
Neurocrine Chief Executive Kevin Gorman said in an interview that many neurologists had been redirected to fighting the pandemic, leading to delaying Ongentys until later in 2020. The delay to Palforzia, Aimmune's sole approved drug, means the company will not generate any revenue until later this year, prompting it to halt new hires in a bid to preserve its $370 million of cash. ""We assume that there is some kind of return to normal some point this year and that the launch will actually take place in late summer, early fall, and that we will start to generate revenues from then on out,"" said Eric Bjerkholt, Aimmune's chief financial officer, during an investor call.
Around half a dozen more drugs are scheduled to be reviewed by the FDA in the coming month, including  Ultragenyx  Pharmaceutical Inc's (O:RARE) therapy for a group of genetic disorders and Endo's skin-treatment Xiaflex, which it said it would delay launching until later in the year. 
But their prospects may depend in part on the progress of the pandemic. 

Prescriptions across the board have fallen as doctors offices have closed for non-emergency business, and the process of approving treatments for patients could also slow down. For some products, ""every patient requires reams of prior authorizations and lots of tests to be done, and lot of paperwork to be shared. In the old world, that was hard. In this world, that would be impossible,"" said Alnylam's Greene.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair reported ""very strong"" bookings from holidaymakers as it relaunched its network with 1,000 flights on Wednesday, the start of a summer that Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary hopes will restore Europe's confidence in air travel. 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has been flying a skeleton service since the COVID-19 pandemic closed down much of Europe in March. It was set to fly 105,000 passengers on Wednesday, almost as many as it flew in April and May combined. 
O'Leary, one of the loudest advocates for a reopening of European air travel from COVID-19 restrictions, said he was hopeful the airline could go from 4.5 million passengers in July to as many as 6 million in August, around half its normal level. 
""It's a good start,"" O'Leary told Reuters in an interview after the first 150 flights took off on time with all passengers wearing face masks. 
""If we have a strong July and August with lots of families travelling on holidays ... and recognising they can do it safely, I think we will see ... a much more stable return to normal volumes from September onwards,"" he said. 
Critics say a return to widespread tourism in Europe could reverse major progress in tackling COVID-19. 
Ireland's outgoing health minister said on Wednesday he found himself ""shouting at the radio"" when another Ryanair executive said it was safe to travel despite the government advising against it.
O'Leary said he was confident Britain would this week announce an opening of travel with the European Union, ahead of a court case on Friday taken by Ryanair and rivals against the UK government's 14-day quarantine. 
""There is no scientific basis for it and we expect to get it overturned,"" he said, adding Ireland's chief medical officer was being ""over-cautious"" in advising against travel. 
PRICING WEAK
O'Leary said bookings for the first couple of weeks of flights in July were ""very strong"" with August ""reasonably strong."" September and October are a bit weaker at the moment, he added, as people wait to see how the situation develops. 
Ticket prices have been weak for the summer and are likely to remain so. 
""Certainly, for the next 12 months you are going to see lower-than-ever airfares, certainly on Ryanair,"" O'Leary said. 
While passenger numbers are likely to return to 2019 levels next year, it will probably take until 2022 or 2023 before ticket prices return to pre-pandemic levels, he predicted. 
Ryanair has said it may cut up to 3,000 jobs among pilots and cabin crew, but O'Leary said he was ""reasonably hopeful but not confident"" it could agree pay cuts and changes to work practices to avoid most of them. 

Some unions in continental Europe are ""are sticking their heads in the sand,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Companies voicing support for racial equality should back up their talk by releasing their workforce diversity data, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer says in letters being sent to 67 companies in the S&P 100 on Wednesday.
""We're asking companies that condemned racism to walk the walk,"" Stringer said in an interview. ""It's not enough to condemn racism in words, systemic racism in corporate America is going to require concrete action,"" he said.
Stringer oversees some $206 billion in retirement assets and his office has been influential in pressing companies on other issues like adding more women directors and addressing climate change.
U.S. companies have rushed to show solidarity with the African-American community after the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody.
Eighty of the companies in the Fortune 100 have made statements since Floyd's death on at least one social media platform supportive of the Black community, according to a review by digital marketing firm Klear. 
Corporations also have pledged contributions to social justice groups and vowed to remake their own workforce profiles, where women and minorities often hold more lower-paid jobs. 
But judging companies' relative progress can be difficult without access to a form filed confidentially to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In it companies list how many employees they have across 10 job categories, from executives to laborers, by gender and race.
Only 32 companies in the Russell 1000 make the form's detailed information public, according to a review by researcher Just Capital as of August 2019. They include Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
Another 204 companies report on their employees' race and gender but use many different formats, which can make it hard to compare their relative progress. Some executives say their own formats better reflect their businesses or show data of interest to investors.
Making the EEOC form accessible to the public would provide more detail such as the specific number of Black employees at a company across several managerial roles.

Stringer's office declined to name companies receiving the letters. They ask companies to commit by Aug. 30 to disclosing their reports in 2021, when they are next due for submission to Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trading in German blue-chip index DAX (GDAXI) and other exchanges across Europe resumed after nearly three hours of outage on Wednesday due to a ""technical issue"" at German electronic trading platform Xetra.
The interruption in the fully-electronic cash market trading system affected stock exchanges in Frankfurt, Vienna, Ljubljana, Prague, Budapest, Zagreb, Malta and Sofia as they use the Xetra T7 system, exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said.
The technical snag is a further blow to Deutsche Boerse, which saw one of its longest outages in April when the Frankfurt stock exchange was halted for more than four hours.
Chief Executive Theodor Weimer said after the April blackout that the stock exchange had taken precautions to avoid such a breakdown in the future.
Exchanges came back online around 0930 GMT, but the cause of the disruption in Xetra on Wednesday was not immediately clear. Deutsche Boerse spokesman Patrick Kalbhenn declined to comment.
The German stock exchange's cash markets generated a turnover of 159.8 billion euros ($179.5 billion) in May.
The Austrian blue-chip index (ATX) opened 0.1% higher at around 0930 GMT, more than two hours after the scheduled opening time, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) opened down 0.5%.
Some European bond and stocks futures affected by the Xetra issue also resumed trading.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Wednesday, consolidating after strong gains Tuesday closed out Wall Street’s best quarter in more than two decades. Volumes could be light given scheduled key economic data and amid caution given the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in many states. 
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futurestraded 22 points, or 0.7%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 57 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract fell 266 points, or 1%. 
The three cash indices all posted their third straight positive month in June, rebounding after the sharp losses in the March. TheDow Jones Industrial Average recorded its best quarter since the first quarter of 1987, the S&P 500 the best quarter since the fourth quarter of 1998 and the Nasdaq Composite since the fourth quarter of 1999.
Helping the stock markets push higher has been an extraordinary injection of monetary and fiscal stimulus from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration.
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed willingness to provide support for as long as necessary.
In fact the Senate late Tuesday voted to extend the deadline for businesses to apply for coronavirus aid under the Paycheck Protection Program until August.
However, Powell also warned that a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak could ""force government and force people to withdraw again from economic activity” ... and ""undermine public confidence, which is what we need to get back to lots of economic activity.""  
This is particularly relevant as the U.S. reported more than 47,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Tuesday - the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic, This has prompted populous states like California, Texas and Florida to restrict economic activity once more.
Payrolls processor ADP will release its monthly report on hiring in the U.S. economy at 8:15 AM ET, with analysts expecting the economy to have created three million jobs. The ISM manufacturing index is due out at 10 AM ET, and is also expected to rebound sharply. Finally, the minutes from the latest  FOMC meeting are due at 2 PM ET.
In corporate news, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will be in the spotlight after posting strong gains post session after the deliveries and logistics company strong fiscal fourth quarter numbers, helped by a surge in online buying amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Additionally, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) are both due to release earnings ahead of the bell.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by American Petroleum Institute data showing a larger-than-expected reduction in U.S. crude inventories last week.

The aerospace manufacturer said it would cut 15,000 jobs in Europe in a restructuring after a 40% slump in its 55 billion euro ($61.8 billion) jet business, sparking concerns about compulsory redundancies in France where it has its headquarters.
Junior Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said the government estimated 2,000 of 5,000 planned cuts by Airbus in France could be saved by a reduced-work scheme and with help from state investment in next-generation green jets. 
France's hard-left Force Ouvriere union said mandatory job cuts at the planemaker were a ""red line"" and other labour representatives said they would fight such measures. 
Workers told Airbus to focus on voluntary departures or retirement plans. 
""The state urges Airbus to ensure that there are as few forced redundancies as possible,"" Djebbari told BFM TV. ""Airbus faces a very difficult period ahead. The state stands beside Airbus, and beside Air France.""
Djebbari urged Air France (PA:AIRF), which also plans layoffs due to the travel slump, to minimise compulsory redundancies, after the government agreed state aid for the carrier worth 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).
""It's not 7 billion euros to pay for redundancy programmes. It's 7 billion for survival, to pay salaries at the end of the month,"" the minister said.
Djebbari confirmed Air France planned to shed nearly 7,600 jobs in a restructuring plan to be announced this week, including 1,000 at its regional unit 'Hop!'.
Force Ouvriere called on Airbus to press on with plans to bring some assembly operations for the A321 aircraft to the French city of Toulouse, where the group has its headquarters.
Airbus has been striving to balance belt-tightening against aid offered by European governments to survive the coronavirus crisis. Djebbari said it was too early to say whether some Airbus plants might close. 
The French government, which owns 11% of Airbus and 14.3% of Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY), has asked Air France to cut carbon emissions and domestic flights as conditions for state financial support.

Virgin Money said it would also press on with rebranding its Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank branches by January 2021, a plan that was shelved in May.
The bank said it would make around 300 redundancies for the time being, 200 fewer than previously planned.
It will also close 22 branches and consolidate a further 30, resulting in a total reduction of 52, unchanged from before.
Virgin Money announced the planned cuts in February as part of a cost-cutting programme begun following the merger of Virgin Money and Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group in 2018.
The lender posted a first-half pretax loss in May after booking a 232 million pound ($288 million) provision for bad loans and likely defaults due to the pandemic. 
Virgin Money follows HSBC in resuming plans to cut jobs after a pause, after its larger rival dusted off plans to cut around 35,000 jobs in June.

623,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Sainsbury, B&M Show Pockets of Value in Stressed Retail Sector","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For the last four months it’s been accepted wisdom that if you have to be invested in retail, then make it either in e-commerce or in companies that trade in basic necessities like food.
This week’s updates have re-affirmed that wisdom.
Certainly, it seems that there is little point in waiting for the release from lockdown to revive the U.K.’s beleaguered shopping malls.  Over the last week, one of the U.K.’s two biggest retail landlords, Intu Properties  (LON:INTUP), has appointed administrators, while the other,  Hammerson  (LON:HMSO), said on Tuesday it was still – just – able to keep within debt covenants having successfully negotiated with its lenders to shift the goalposts a bit.
And the future still looks decidedly grim for retailers who depend on commuters and tourists. SSP Group (LON:SSPG), the operator of brands such as Upper Crust and Ritezza that are staples of railway stations and airports, said Wednesday it is planning to cut 5,000 jobs. It noted that U.K. train passenger numbers have fallen 85% from pre-pandemic levels.
That business isn’t coming back any time soon. While the opening of so-called “air bridges” to the rest of Europe will allow a degree of tourist footfall at airports, “long-haul travel is anticipated to remain at extremely low levels,” the company said. Additionally, “with the current social distancing measures remaining in place, the recovery in passenger numbers in the rail sector is expected to be prolonged.” 
The group said it expects only 20% of its outlets to be open by the autumn.
But things look a lot better in the grocery store business, where J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) reported an 8.2% rise in comparable sales in the 16 weeks through June 27. Online sales doubled, helping to defend market share even if the associated costs of ramping up its delivery infrastructure kept a lid on profitability. The company was still cautious about the outlook for the second half of the year, noting that its figures were being flattered not only by stockpiling, but also by the good weather since lockdown restrictions were eased.
Sainsbury shares were trading unchanged by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), while SSP Group shares were down 2.2%. SSP shares, like those of WH Smith (LON:SMWH) which trades on the same model, have failed to make any meaningful recovery from the March lows and are still down over by between 50% and 60% year-to-date.
Wednesday’s star performer, however, was from a part of the retail sector that can reasonably be expected to thrive in the next year or two. B&M European Value Retail (LON:BMEB), which operates discount shops around the continent, said comparable sales rose 28% in the three months to June. U.K. sales rose 34%. With unemployment soaring, and incomes falling even for those who can avoid the worst, that’s a trend that seems likely to continue. B&M European Value Retail shares rose 5.1% and are now up 2% since the start of the year."

The carmaker, owned by China's Geely, said it had not received any reports of accidents or injuries connected to the flaw and that the move was preventative to avoid any possible issues in the future.
""The issue is related to a steel cable connected to the front seat belts,"" it said. ""The cable may, under certain rare circumstances and user behaviours, over time suffer from fatigue. This could eventually cause damage to the cable, resulting in reduced seat belt restraint function.""

Another prominent freight transporter FedEx Corp (N:FDX) has also suspended shipments, according to a BloomberQuint report, adding that the company is facing backlogs beyond its control.
FedEx was not immediately available for a comment.

“The Fed has underpinned this market and it’s been complemented by monetary policy,” said Quincy Krosby, Prudential’s chief market strategist. “You may not like the fact that it has extinguished concepts of capitalism like creative destruction. But central banks refused to allow market forces to take over. They don’t want a complete collapse of the economy and the markets.”
Numerous investors have warned about a potential market reckoning from the Fed’s involvement. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, has been particularly vocal in his objections, envisioning among other things an extreme bubble in corporate bonds. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Peter Gailliot said the Fed is “crossing some lines” and cautioned about potential moral hazard. Some are concerned that the stock market’s recovery might reduce appetite for further fiscal stimulus measures out of Washington.

But Krosby argued that things could have been very different if the Fed had stayed out of the way.
“You trade in the market you have, not the one you want,” Krosby said. “Yes, it created zombie companies but it also opened the credit markets, and that’s key for the future.”
The Fed by a 1977 law was assigned the goals of “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates,” but has also been charged by Congress with promoting financial stability.
“You’ll hear, ‘oh, this is artificial.’ Why is this artificial? It is what it is,” Krosby said of the current state of financial markets. “Price is price.”

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mostly higher Wednesday, as some better-than-expected economic data indicated that the economic recovery in Europe is on track, despite lingering concerns about the Covid-19 outbreak both at home and, more acutely, in the U.S.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, France's CAC 40 fell 0.2%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.1%.
German retail sales rose sharply by 13.9% in May, reflecting a rebound in private consumption as restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus were lifted.  Even more encouragingly, German seasonally-adjusted unemployment rose by only 69,000 in June, rather than the 120,000 increase expected.
Additionally, French car sales rose for the first time this year, with passenger car registrations increasing by 1.2% to 233,818 in June compared with the same month last year.
Earlier Wednesday, data from China, the world’s second largest economy and a key export market for Europe, showed factory activity expanding at its quickest since December 2019. 
U.S. manufacturing activity and private jobs data are due later in the session.
However, the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus around the world, particularly in the U.S., the world’s economic engine, threatens to derail this nascent recovery.
The U.S. recorded 47,000 infections on Tuesday, its biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began, and this surge has prompted populous states like California, Texas and Florida to restrict economic activity once more.
Turning back to Europe, J  Sainsbury  (LON:SBRY) stock climbed 2.5% after Britain’s second-biggest supermarket chain said underlying retail sales rose 8.2% year-on-year in its first quarter, driven by stockpiling during the coronavirus lockdown. It was cautious about the outlook for the rest of the year, but said it had repaid 500 million pounds that it had drawn down from a credit facility as a precautionary measure at the start of the outbreak.
U.K.-based budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock dropped 1.4% after saying it’s considering shutting three of its airport hubs because of the steep drop in travel demand.
Rival Ryanair (LON:RYA) fared better, falling just 0.1% after the airline’s boss Michael O’Leary stated the airline is planning around 3,500 job losses if it cannot agree pay cuts with its staff.
Housebuilder  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) has taken the brunt of the first annual decline in U.K. house prices since 2012, dropping 1.2%, as the coronavirus continued to hang over the housing market.
Oil prices pushed higher, helped by American Petroleum Institute data showing a larger-than-expected reduction in U.S. crude stocks last week, and government figures showing that U.S. output fell more sharply in April than expected.
U.S. government  inventory numbers are due out later on Wednesday. 
At 2:45 AM ET, Crude oil WTI futures traded 2.2% higher at $40.14 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.1% to $42.12.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,806.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1228, 0.1% lower.

The dispute emerged earlier this week after a Shenzhen court said it would freeze 16.24 million yuan ($2.3 million) worth of assets belonging to Lao Gan Ma at the request of Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), who had sued the manufacturer for failing to pay advertising fees under a 2019 contract.
Lao Gan Ma in a statement said it never signed such a contract and had reported the matter to police.
On Wednesday, police in the southern city of Guiyang said it had arrested three people accused of forging Lao Gan Ma's company seal - used in China to formalise documents - and pretending to be staff from the firm's marketing department who signed a cooperation agreement with Tencent.
""The aim was to obtain online game package codes that Tencent gave away as part of its promotional activities, which they later resold online to illegally profit,"" Guiyang police said in a statement posted on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account. 
Tencent, China's biggest video game and social media firm, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The topic has become one of most discussed issues on China's Twitter-like Weibo, with over 230 million views.
Lao Gan Ma, which is headquartered in Guiyang and whose name translates to ""old godmother"", is one of China's best-known food brands, selling millions of bottles of its distinctively red labelled chilli oil at home and abroad annually.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>","Stocks adrift, havens sought as virus fears cast shadow over recovery","By Shriya Ramakrishnan
(Reuters) - Asian stock markets struggled to make headway on Wednesday, while safe havens such as gold and the Japanese yen firmed as surging coronavirus infections in the United States took some of the shine off better-than-expected factory activity in China. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched 0.2% higher, led by a 0.8% rise in Chinese blue chips. But Japan's Nikkei fell 0.8%.
S&P 500 futures fell 0.5% and European futures were slightly negative.
Sentiment had been boosted by signs that China's factories are slowly gathering steam, with the Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI rising to 51.2, compared with expectations for 50.5.
That followed firm U.S. housing data earlier this week. But it was accompanied by a surge in U.S. virus cases, a survey showing Japanese business mood souring and fears of growing Sino-U.S. tension over China's crackdown in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong police said they arrested a man holding a pro-independence flag in the first apparent use of new security laws that were imposed by China on its freest city late on Tuesday evening.
Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of the former British colony's return to China in 1997.
Meanwhile, the United States recorded its biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began.
The surge has prompted California, Texas and Florida to shut recently re-opened bars in the last few days, while Australia has locked-down parts of its second-biggest city, Melbourne, to try and stop a spike in cases there.
Markets are looking to U.S. manufacturing activity data due at 1400 GMT for the latest gauge of its economic recovery and expect a rebound. U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Thursday is also eagerly awaited and expected to show hiring.
""Things are turning up, but from very incredibly low levels,"" Robert Carnell, Asia-Pacific head of research at ING said of the recent run of better-than-expected economic data.
Equity investors' hopes for a rebound in corporate earnings looks ""highly questionable now,"" he said.
""The bond market is much more realistic in it's pricing of what is going on, that we are not going to see a substantial improvement anytime soon."" 
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries edged higher to 0.6709% on Wednesday, but had finished last quarter steady while U.S. stocks had their best three months in two decades. (N) 
SIMMERING TENSION
Geopolitical tensions are also rising.
Washington has already begun rolling back Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law following Beijing's imposition of a new security law targeting sedition and subversion.
It was used for the first time on Wednesday when police arrested a man holding a flag advocating independence.
Further instability seems baked into Hong Kong stock prices, with the Hang Seng left behind in last quarter's rally, adding just 3.5% compared with a 17.6% rise in MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index.
But the law seems to herald another round of U.S.-China friction. Global Times editor Hu Xijin said on Twitter that China will announce curbs on U.S. media in the country. 
""It has not taken people by surprise, but it's an unwelcome development,"" Imre Speizer, a foreign exchange strategist at Westpac in Auckland, said of the Hong Kong laws.
""It's one of a number of geopolitical factors which is a negative for some asset classes now."" 
Currency markets shifted to a risk-off mood, with the trade-sensitive Australian dollar slipping and the yen gaining.
The yen rose 0.3% to 107.61 per dollar while the Aussie fell 0.2% to dip below 69 cents to $0.6890.
In commodity markets, gold hovered near an 8-year high at $1783.62 an ounce. Brent crude rose 41 cents or 1% to $41.68 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 1.2% at $39.74 a barrel.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Wednesday, with the second half of the year starting with worries about the Covid-19 outbreak still prominent even as data releases offer hope of a global economic recovery.
At 2:00 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
China's factory activity expanded in June, with the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rising Wednesday to 51.2 from 50.7 in May, marking the highest reading since December 2019. That followed a similarly upbeat reading from the Chinese government's own PMI on Tuesday. 
Throw in strong U.S. housing data and a rebound in consumer confidence in Europe, and the recovery from the coronavirus-inspired slump looks well underway. U.S. manufacturing activity data due later Wednesday is also expected to show a recovery from April’s depths, while the nonfarm payrolls report on Thursday is forecast to show the U.S. economy added 3 million jobs in June.
However, the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus around the world, but particularly in the U.S., the world’s economic engine, threatens to derail this nascent recovery.
The U.S. recorded 47,000 infections on Tuesday, its biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began, and this surge has prompted populous states like California, Texas and Florida to restrict economic activity once more.
""Clearly we are not in total control right now,"" the country's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, told a Senate committee on Tuesday, adding that cases could increase by as much as 100,000 daily if the outbreak is not contained.
Turning back to Europe, German retail sales jumped 13.9% in May, rebounding strongly from April’s 5.3% slump. More indications of the region’s recovery will come in later in the session in the form of manufacturing PMI data and German unemployment numbers.
In corporate news, Ryanair (LON:RYA) could receive a boost Wednesday after Europe's biggest budget airline said it expects to fly more than 4.5 million passengers in July. This would represent a huge increase from April and May when it flew just 110,000 passengers.
On the flip side, U.K.-based budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said it is considering shutting three of its airport hubs because of the steep drop in travel demand.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by American Petroleum Institute data showing a much larger than expected reduction in U.S. crude stocks last week, which suggests a bump up in demand even with the reemergence of the coronavirus in a number of states.
Official inventory data from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration is due out later on Wednesday.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing kept FAA in the dark on key 737 MAX design changes - U.S. IG report,"By David Shepardson, Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) failed to submit certification documents to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) detailing changes to a key flight control system faulted in two fatal crashes, a long-awaited government report seen by Reuters has found.
The flight control system, known as MCAS, was ""not an area of emphasis"" because Boeing presented it to the FAA as a modification of the jet's existing speed trim system, with limited range and use, according to the report.
The 52-page report by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General (IG), dated June 29 and set to be made public Wednesday, laid bare mistakes made by both the planemaker and FAA in the development and certification of Boeing's top-selling aircraft. 
The FAA declined to comment beyond the department's response attached to the report. The IG did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Boeing spokesman said the company had taken steps to enhance safety and was committed to transparency. ""When the MAX returns to service, it will be one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety,"" he said. 
The IG's report is the latest of reports faulting the plane's approval, while the Justice Department has an ongoing criminal investigation.
The 737 MAX has been grounded from commercial flight worldwide since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia over a five-month span. 
Boeing's so-called MCAS stall-prevention system has been faulted in both crashes, when the system repeatedly and forcefully pushed down the jet's nose as pilots struggled to intervene, among a cocktail of factors pinpointed by crash investigators.
The inspector general report details activities from the early phase of the certification process in January 2012 through the second crash. It also details allegations of ""undue pressure"" from Boeing management on workers handling safety certification, though it adds that all ""formally reported"" instances of undue pressure were ""satisfactorily addressed."" 
The IG's office will issue recommendations to the FAA later this year, the Transportation Department said in comments about the draft report submitted on June 8.
The FAA is currently evaluating the MCAS upgrades during a series of certification test flights this week that could pave the way for the jet's return domestically by year end.
REGULATORS IN THE DARK
In response to the report, the Transportation Department said the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX was ""hampered by a lack of effective communication"" between the agency and U.S. planemaker. 
Crucially, that included the ""incomplete understanding of the scope and potential safety impacts"" of changes Boeing made to the jet's flight control system to give it more power and authority, the agency said.
""Boeing did not submit certification documents to FAA detailing the change,"" the report said. ""FAA flight test personnel were aware of this change, but key FAA certification engineers and personnel responsible for approving the level of airline pilot training told us they were unaware of the revision to MCAS.""
The FAA conducted its first-ever detailed review of the system in January 2019, three months after the first crash in Indonesia. The review resulted in documentation that was never finalized, the report said. 
The report also noted that, after the Indonesia crash, the FAA completed a risk analysis that found that the uncorrected risk to the 737 MAX was 2.68 fatalities per 1 million flight hours, which exceeded the FAA's risk guidelines of 1 fatality per 10 million flight hours.
A December 2018 FAA analysis determined a risk of about 15 accidents occurring over the life of the entire 737 MAX fleet if the software fix was not implemented.
After the crashes, Boeing proposed and FAA accepted a redesign of MCAS software that would include additional safeguards against unintended MCAS activation. 
Boeing also created a Product and Services Safety Organization for employees to raise concerns over safety and undue pressure, first reported by Reuters.

Boeing agreed to develop the MCAS software update by April 12 and operators would have until June 18, 2019, to install the software. As Boeing worked on proposed software upgrade for MCAS, a second plane crashed in March 2019 in Ethiopia.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said late on Tuesday it was delaying the reopening of its U.S. offices by around two months because of a surge in the number of coronavirus cases in some states. 
All of Google's U.S. offices will now remain closed at least until Sept. 7, Google spokeswoman Katherine Williams (NYSE:WMB) told Reuters. 
Google said in late May it would reopen buildings in more cities at roughly 10% of their capacity beginning July 6 and scale it up to 30% in September, if conditions permitted.
Williams confirmed a Bloomberg report that cited an internal memo to employees sent by a Google executive.
""For all of you that are working from home, please continue to do so unless you are told otherwise by your manager,"" Chris Rackow, Google's vice president of global security, said in the memo.
""We don't expect this guidance to change until Monday, Sept. 7 (Labor Day) at the earliest,"" Rackow wrote, adding that the recent rise in coronavirus cases in the United States demonstrates that ""COVID-19 is still very much alive"".
The development comes as coronavirus cases in June more than doubled in 14 U.S. states, including California, Florida and Texas, a Reuters analysis on Tuesday showed.
Nationally, cases rose by at least 46% and deaths increased by 21% during the month.
On Tuesday alone, new U.S. COVID-19 cases rose by more than 47,000, according to a Reuters tally, the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic that has claimed nearly 510,000 lives worldwide.

The acquisition, by an affiliate of Carlyle, will give Airtel's Nxtra Data Ltd an enterprise valuation of about $1.2 billion, the companies said in a statement. Airtel will hold the remaining 75% stake in Nxtra.
Nxtra, which is building multiple large data centres across India, will use the proceeds from the deal to scale up its infrastructure, the companies said.
India is seeing a surge in demand for data centres as more businesses choose cloud computing, and consumer demand for digital services such as smartphone entertainment continues to grow, they added.
Cloud and entertainment services represent the next revenue frontier for traditional telecom carriers like Airtel, as voice and data rates in India remain among the cheapest in the world.

This comes after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) last month said the unit faces restrictions on new customers if it does not comply with new licensing conditions related to client money laws.
Societe Generale Securities Australia is the second company this year to face criminal prosecution on charges of breaching client money codes, which ensure that client money is kept in authorised accounts, the regulator said on Wednesday.
The French investment bank in an emailed statement said the unit's plea was in line with ""its responsible and transparent position"".
The securities unit on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the charges brought by ASIC in March which include two counts of making non-permitted payments out of a client money account and two counts of failing to pay money into separate bank accounts, over the period Dec. 8, 2014 to Feb. 8, 2017.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>","UAW leader, U.S. prosecutor discuss independent oversight for union","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers' president met on Tuesday with the U.S. prosecutor heading a federal investigation into corruption at the union, and the two said they discussed reforms including possible independent oversight of future labor agreements.
In a joint statement, union chief Rory Gamble and Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said they discussed the ""concept of an independent monitor... to reduce the possibility of a reoccurrence of corruption.""
They said there are a ""number of reform options that are on the table,"" which they will discuss in the coming weeks. 
Earlier this month, Schneider said the UAW still has much to do to reform itself and that a federal takeover of the union remains an option.
Gamble was appointed UAW president last November when his predecessor Gary Jones was forced out after being linked to the corruption probe. Jones pleaded guilty in early June to charges he embezzled more than $1 million of union funds. 
Gamble promised from the start that he would reform the UAW.
Membership in the UAW rose less than 1% to 398,829 in 2019, after falling 8% in 2018, according to regulatory filings. 
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appointed a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, and a five-year transition period followed.
The Federal Bureau of Investigations has been investigating alleged illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican airline Aeromexico said on Tuesday it had begun restructuring under Chapter 11 proceedings, the latest Latin American airline to run into serious trouble as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on tourism and business travel.
In a statement, Aeromexico categorized the Chapter 11 process as ""voluntary"" and said it was sticking to its goals of boosting operations in the coming weeks.
Aeromexico said it was maintaining its plan of quadrupling its international flights and doubling domestic flights next month as the coronavirus lockdown eases.
Tickets, reservations, electronic vouchers and Premier Points remain valid, the airline said.
Aeromexico said it was in talks to obtain new, preferential financing as part of the Chapter 11 restructuring, so-called debtor-in-possession financing.

Investment holding company Aimia Inc (TO:AIM) threw Aeromexico a $50 million financial lifeline on Monday, after loaning it another $50 million in May.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Debt-laden Argentina posted the best stocks returns of the quarter while Angola's bonds outperformed all others as 2020 continues to defy expectations among emerging markets.
For the year, the COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdowns continue to cast a shadow on the second half that extends beyond emerging economies.
In terms of currencies, Taiwan and the Philippines have strengthened the most against the dollar so far this year, but it was Indonesia that powered on in the second quarter. Argentina's capital controls are masking what should be a deeper depreciation of its currency.

The estimated $l8 trillion deployed globally in fiscal and monetary stimulus helped keep interest rates anchored near zero in the developed world, forcing yield seekers far out into the EM universe. China has seen its bonds perform the best throughout the year while Angola, which suffered a massive selloff in the first quarter, gave risky investors the top return over the past three months.

The Papua New Guinea-focused oil and gas producer said full time employees have currently been reduced to 1,222 from 1,649 in mid-March, with another 137 moving out by year end.
The firm expects production costs to be about $10.50/boe in 2020, compared to a previous cost guidance of US$11-12/boe, it said in a statement.

Adjusted profit at Memphis-based FedEx fell by almost 50% to $663 million, or $2.53 per share, for the quarter ended May 31. Revenue slipped to $17.4 billion from $17.8 billion a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.52 per share on revenue of $16.4 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
FedEx said the novel coronavirus pandemic, which is leaving a trail of human and economic damage in its wake, hit virtually all of the company's revenue and expense line items. Executives declined to provide an earnings forecast for fiscal 2020, citing the uncertain timing and pace of an economic recovery.
FedEx is grappling with a flood of coronavirus-related e-commerce shipments as it rebuilds from its split with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), a major customer, and the costly integration of TNT Express in Europe.
Business closures and a profound shift to online shopping are squeezing profits at FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS). Residential e-commerce deliveries, which involve more miles per route and fewer packages per stop, are less lucrative than business deliveries where drivers leave anywhere from a handful to hundreds of pieces at each location. 
FedEx total U.S. domestic residential volume was 72% for the fourth quarter, versus 56% a year earlier, FedEx Chief Marketing Officer Brie Carere said on a conference call with analysts
""Profitability doesn't necessarily improve when you're sending more packages to far-flung places,"" Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said of home deliveries. 
FedEx Ground, which handles more e-commerce home deliveries, reported a 20% revenue increase for the quarter and a 17% drop in operating income. 
Revenue at FedEx Express, which skews toward commercial deliveries, fell 10% and operating income dropped 56%.
FedEx executives said they were attacking residential delivery costs as business-to-business shipments begin to show signs of recovery. 

FedEx shares, which hit a record high of almost $250 in October 2017, were up $13.20 at $153.30 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shorter hours would not be in the best interests of investors or stock markets, European bourses said on Wednesday, dashing hopes at banks and investment firms in London of cutting 90 minutes from the trading day.
The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said shorter hours would be a move in the wrong direction. The current European trading day is 0900-1730 continental European time, longer than in Asia or Wall Street.
This means that share trading spans the Asian market close and the open on Wall Street, and a shorter day could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to rival trading venues in other parts of the world, FESE said.
The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), which is not a member of FESE, held a public consultation earlier this year that found broad backing for cutting the trading day by 90 minutes to improve mental wellbeing and help attract more women onto trading floors.
But without a harmonised approach across Europe, the goals of shorter hours would be harder to achieve given banks have pan-European trading desks, the LSE has said.
London will also be leery of putting itself at any competitive disadvantage to rival bourses on the continent now that Britain has left the European Union.
FESE said the length of the trading day does not have a negative impact on the working culture of trading and that other measures like more shifts were necessary to achieve that.
Britain's Investment Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, reiterated their calls on Tuesday for a cut in trading hours.
Pan-European Exchange Euronext has just completed its own public consultation on market hours. Euronext, which is a vice-president of FESE, has already expressed scepticism about what it has called a ""London proposal"".

While that would be a drop of almost 70% from July last year, it would be a huge increase from April and May when Europe's biggest budget airline flew just 110,000 passengers.
The Irish carrier has operated a skeleton service since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most European air travel in the middle of March and plans to restore almost 90% of its routes from July 1, albeit with fewer flights.
Passenger numbers for June are due to be released in the coming days.
Ryanair is trying to entice passengers back into the sky with lower fares and said a sale introduced on Wednesday represented the lowest fares ever offered by Ryanair during the peak summer months.
""These 1,000 daily flights mark an important turning point for Ryanair and for the tourism industry of Europe,"" Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. ""We expect in July to carry more than 4.5 million customers."" 

Budget rival EasyJet (L:EZJ) resumed flying in mid-June but has said it expects its capacity to be about 30% of usual levels for the busy July-to-September season.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - A stalking horse bid for Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group was dismissed as inadequate by lenders during a Quebec court hearing into the company's restructuring on Tuesday. 
Canada's once high-flying Cirque received initial protection from its creditors, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the famed circus operator to cancel shows and lay off artists. 
Montreal-based Cirque, which grew from a troupe of street-performers in the 1980s to a company with global reach, has slashed about 95% of its workforce and suspended shows due to the pandemic. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.
The company has signed an agreement with its existing investors private equity fund TPG Capital, China's Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656), and Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Québec under which the consortium will take over Cirque's liabilities and invest $300 million to support a restart.
As part of the investment, government body Investissement Québec will provide $200 million in debt financing.
The agreement will serve as the ""stalking horse"" bid in a sale and investment solicitation process, subject to court approval.
Joe Pasquariello with the Goodmans law firm, who acted for first lien and second lien lenders, said the bid is ""not what we’re striving for"" in a stalking horse.
“That agreement with all due respect is pure fiction.” 
Cirque has received six non-binding offers, with a deal eyed by September, the court heard.
Cirque Chief Executive Daniel Lamarre said in an interview ""we're open to any solution that someone can bring to the table that will ensure the future of Cirque du Soleil."" 
Quebec Superior Court Judge Louis Gouin agreed to give the company protection from its creditors for 10 days. Cirque will seek its immediate provisional recognition in the United States under Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court. 
Cirque generated about $1 billion in revenues and $157 million in profits last year before the pandemic, he said.

The company had almost $1.5 billion in liabilities as of December 2019.

Lozoya, 45, who was once a close confidant of former President Enrique Peña Nieto, is wanted in his homeland on charges including bribery and money laundering in cases involving Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht SA as well as a Mexican fertilizer firm.
Lozoya has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
The cases raised questions about how much others in the last government new about his actions, and the extradition should boost President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's contention that he is serious about cracking down on corruption.
In a televised statement, Gertz said on Monday that Lozoya, who was arrested in the Spanish city of Malaga in February, had accepted in writing to a Spanish criminal court to be extradited to Mexico and to turn himself in to Mexican authorities.
Lozoya ""offered his cooperation to establish and clarify"" the charges against him,"" Gertz said.
Lozoya fled Mexico once word had leaked about the case being built against him, and police spent eight months looking for him in Germany, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Russia and Spain before he was caught, the attorney general said.
The Harvard-educated son of a former Mexican energy minister, Lozoya was indicted in Mexico last year. He ran Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, from 2012 to 2016.
It was unclear how soon Lozoya would be back in Mexico, but Gertz said steps would be set in motion for him to be extradited quickly.

Lozoya faces a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty. His lawyers have argued that everything he did while in government was done with the knowledge of then-president Peña Nieto.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS, long the dominant bank in Australian equities markets, has closed this half-year outside the top three for the first time in 15 years, even as a rush of coronavirus-related share sales have generated bumper investment banking fees.
Its slide to fourth place in the equity capital markets (ECM) league table has been attributed by rivals to the departure of a number of senior bankers from the Australian operations, which have opened the way for rivals to target mandates traditionally dominated by UBS (S:UBSG).
Such is the Swiss bank's dominance in Australia, it has only finished the year off the ECM top spot once in the past 15 years. 
UBS's market share in ECM fell from 22.8% in the first half of last year to 12.4% now, ranking it behind Macquarie with 23.4%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) with 17.4% and JP Morgan with 14.8%, according to Refinitiv.
The unit has long been considered a key strength for UBS's broader business and privately acknowledged as such by senior regional executives - an importance demonstrated by a 2012 agreement https://au.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/update-1ubs-head-in-australianz-matthew-grounds-to-leave-bank-at-year-end-1906456 to further extend a protected bonus pool for its top rainmakers that was set up in 2008. 
Key among the recent departures was that of chief executive Matthew Grounds, once touted by billionaire James Packer as a ""rock star"" banker, who retired last year as did his deputy Guy Fowler.
Other senior exits include capital markets boss Robbie Vanderzeil, who left last month to join Jarden, a boutique investment bank where he will also be joined by UBS's former co-head of investment banking Aidan Allen.
UBS declined to comment on its first-half performance.
ECM is a highly competitive business around the world, prized for the fees its generates and the close relationship it can build with clients, who often need the funds in difficult circumstances. 
""ECM remains the most profitable capital markets business ahead of DCM and M&A,"" said Alex Owen, analyst at banking data provider Coalition. ""Its driven by better fees and secondary market activity, while the allocation of sector specialists and research, and low margins associated with bond underwriting, impact the profitability of M&A and (debt capital markets) respectively.""
BUMPER FUNDRAISINGS
Australia's equity markets have seen the busiest start to the year since the global financial crisis with companies so far raising $18.48 billion via share sales, according to Refinitiv data, as firms sought to shore up balance sheets to help weather the economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
That level is more than double the same time in 2019 and the highest since 2009, when $25 billion was raised in the first half, the data showed.
Goldman Sachs Australia chief executive Simon Rothery said the U.S bank had set the target two years ago to increase its share of the domestic ECM in Australia and compete more aggressively.
""ECM has been a major focus for us,"" Rothery said. 

""We have been at the top of the M&A league table for a decade and the ECM fee pool is just as large, so we made it a strategic goal to move to a number one or two position in ECM in Australia.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rallied on Tuesday to finish higher and secure its biggest quarterly percentage gain in more than two decades as improving economic data bolstered investor beliefs that a stimulus-backed rebound for the U.S. economy was on the horizon.
Coming off a drop of 20% in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly decline since the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the S&P rallied more than 19.95% to notch its biggest quarterly gain since 1998, at the height of the tech boom. 
The gains have been fueled by unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus and the easing of restrictions. 
But the S&P 500 is still down about 4% on the year, and gains in June stood at just 2% due to the flare-up in virus cases that has threatened to delay reopenings and derail a tentative economic recovery. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in comments on Tuesday that the path of the economy is ""highly uncertain.""
""What everybody sees is if we can get something that puts an end to the spread or the spread becomes less, there is literally so much money out there that the Fed has put out there that when we turn, it is going to be a rocket ship the other way,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Chicago. 
Still, comments from Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious diseases expert, who said there was no guarantee the United States will have an effective COVID-19 vaccine and warned the virus spread ""could get very bad,"" were a reminder that a full economic recovery could be a long road.
Gains were capped on the Dow, pressured by a 5.75% drop in  Boeing Co  (N:BA), as the airplane maker gave back some of Monday's 14% surge after Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) canceled orders for 97 aircraft and said it would claim compensation. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 217.08 points, or 0.85%, to 25,812.88, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 47.05 points, or 1.54%, to 3,100.29 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 184.61 points, or 1.87%, to 10,058.77.
The 17.78% gain in the Dow marked its best quarterly performance since a 21.56% rally in the first quarter of 1987 while the Nasdaq's 30.63% jump was its best quarter since a 48.18% gain in the fourth quarter of 1999. 
While coronavirus cases continue to surge in many states, the U.S. economy is showing signs of pickup, with data indicating consumer confidence increased much more than expected in June. 
Simmering U.S.-China tensions also remained a possible headwind, with Washington beginning to eliminate Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law in response to China's national security law for the territory. China said it would retaliate. 
All of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors traded higher, with a 2.2% rise in energy (SPNY) stocks leading the pack.
Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) jumped 4.8% as it forecast higher-than-expected current-quarter revenue on strong demand for its chips that power notebooks and data centers. 
The company's results also boosted other chipmakers and lifted the Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) by 2.7%.
Uber (N:UBER) advanced 4.9% after reports that the ride-hailing services company was in talks to buy food-delivery app Postmates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 16 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.72 billion shares, compared with the 13.55 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Tech stocks helped prop markets up again, as Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress that new coronavirus infections could increase to 100,000 a day from 40,000 daily cases now. Fauci, the top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, said infections have risen because some places are reopening too quickly and people are not following guidelines.  
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak could ""force government and force people to withdraw again from economic activity” and ""undermine public confidence, which is what we need to get back to lots of economic activity.""

1. Jobs and Manufacturing In Focus
Payrolls processor ADP will release its monthly report on hiring in the U.S. economy at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT). Analysts expect the economy to have created 3 million jobs, after April and May numbers showed that more than 21 million jobs were lost.
The ISM manufacturing index due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) is expected to rebound sharply, but even if it rises back to the 50 level that separates growth from contraction, the level of activity will still be down sharply from where it was at the start of the year.
Government data on crude oil inventories is due out at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT) and FOMC Meeting Minutes come out at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).

Shares are up 63% after hitting a 2020 low in March. Constellation has been divesting of brands over the past few months. Last week, the company agreed to sell Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy to Sazerac Company, Inc., for $255 million. 
Bubbly water maker FIZZ also reports on July 1, post-market.  National Beverage  (NASDAQ:FIZZ) Corp. is expected to report lower revenue for the fiscal third quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Zacks Equity Research.

 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) also report before the market opens.
The consensus EPS estimate for General Mills is $1.06, up 28% compared to a year earlier, and revenue up 20% to $4.98 billion, according to Seeking Alpha. Shares are up about 17% this year.

""While commercial volumes were down significantly due to business closures across the globe, there were surges in residential deliveries at FedEx Ground and in transpacific and charter flights at FedEx Express, which required incremental costs to serve,"" FedEx said.
""The company also incurred an approximate $125 million increase in operating costs related to personal protective equipment and medical/safety supplies, as well as additional security and cleaning services to protect our team members and ensure we are safely providing essential services for our customers.""
FedEx said it was not providing an earnings forecast for fiscal 2021 as the timing and pace of an economic recovery remained uncertain.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were targeted to be approximately $4.9 billion, a $1 billion year-over-year decline, due primarily to ""reduced vehicle replacement spending and delayed facility investments,"" it added.
FedEx shares are down 7% from the beginning of the year, still down 21.43% from its 52 week high of $178.50 set on July 24, 2019. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is down 4.06% year to date.
FedEx follows other major Transportation sector earnings this month
FedEx's report follows an earnings miss by Carnival ADS on June 18, which reported EPS of $-3.3 on revenue of $700 million, compared to forecasts EPS of $-1.59 on revenue of $773.9 million.
Deutsche Lufthansa ADR had missed expectations on June 2 with second quarter EPS of $-4.98 on revenue of $7.23 billion, compared to forecast for EPS of $-3.13 on revenue of $7.36 blllion.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>","COVID-19 delivery surge strains FedEx service, opening doors for UPS","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A months-long flood of coronavirus-related e-commerce packages is straining service FedEx Corp (N:FDX), giving rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) an opportunity to steal market share, customers and consultants told Reuters.
While every U.S. package carrier is fighting to manage unexpected demand for home deliveries of bicycles, patio furniture, medicine and food, FedEx entered the pandemic in turnaround mode and is grappling with an inflexible business structure that is contributing to service disruptions in California and Michigan. 
FedEx reports quarterly results after the market close on Tuesday. 
Reuters could not immediately determine whether it is suffering similar delays in other states. 
For two Mondays in a row, FedEx told San Bernardino, California-based Pacific Mountain Logistics it would not make scheduled Ground pickups until Thursday, Chief Executive B.J. Patterson said.
The delay is not limited to FedEx's Ground division that focuses on e-commerce packages. Service at FedEx Express - which caters mostly to business deliveries - also is affected, said Patterson, who has been a FedEx customer for a decade.
In an email viewed by Reuters, a FedEx Services account representative cited a ""lack of equipment"" and a ""backlog"" at the delivery company's Rialto, California, hub. 
A corporate spokeswoman, who did not elaborate on the reasons for the delays, said FedEx Ground is experiencing holiday ""peak-like levels"" of residential demand.
""All these guys got caught flat-footed with the volume increase,"" Patterson said, referring to pandemic package surges at U.S. delivery firms. 
""I get it. But to not be able to handle it for almost a week, that's a little insane,"" said Patterson, who is moving some shipments to UPS. 
The volume surge also is causing ""significant"" FedEx Ground delays in parts of Michigan, according company service alerts. Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting services at Logistics Trends & Insights, said it appears to have started in late May. 
WDIV-TV reported that FedEx was addressing Detroit-area delays by hiring package handlers and drivers, and diverting packages from its Oak Park facility. 
The pandemic is blurring the lines between FedEx's distinct Ground and Express businesses. It is also heaping additional operational challenges on company executives, who already were wrestling with last summer's split with Amazon.com (O:AMZN), a major customer, and the problem-plagued TNT Express merger in Europe. 
Business closures forced FedEx to reroute deliveries from shuttered offices to workers' homes, said Trevor Outman, founder of San Diego-based consultancy Shipware.
FedEx responded to the coronavirus spike by putting caps on the numbers of FedEx Ground packages customers could send. That prompted Patterson and others to shift some excess volume to the pricier Express network.
Over the years, FedEx got kudos for outsourcing costly Ground deliveries to lower-cost contractors. But now experts say the pandemic is highlighting the competitive advantage of UPS's single package network.
That unified model is more efficient and ""allows UPS to manage unplanned volume better,"" said Dean Maciuba, a former FedEx executive. 
Chase Flashman, CEO of consultancy ShipSights, said the disruptions open the door for UPS to woo FedEx customers, much in the way the 1997 UPS strike left an opening for FedEx. 
""They're going to gain some market share,"" Flashman said of UPS. ""It won't be a short-term shift.""

Investing.com – Wall Street surged in the final hours of trading on Tuesday, closing out its best quarter in more than two decades following a soft first quarter.  
TheS&P 500 gained 1.53%, taking gains for the second quarter to over 20%. The Dow rose 0.84%, or 215 points, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.87%.
The positive end to the day for the broader market comes despite further signs that the pace of Covid-19 infections is accelerating, forcing several states including California and Texas to roll back plans to lift restrictions on reopening businesses.
Cases in the U.S rose by at least 43% and deaths increased by 20%, a Reuters analysis on Tuesday showed.
Following the rise in cases, airlines and cruise operators were under pressure, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) trading lower.
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak could ""force government and force people to withdraw again from economic activity ... and ""undermine public confidence, which is what we need to get back to lots of economic activity."" 
Tech, which has recently taken a breather, resumed its climb higher, buoyed by a jump in chip stocks following positive earnings reports from companies in the sector.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rose 4.8% after its fiscal third-quarter results and guidance topped consensus estimates, led by growth in cloud demand. ""We do believe that cloud demand in the second half of the calendar year will continue to be healthy for us,"" said Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron’s chief executive, on a conference call.
Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) jumped 7% after raising its fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance. The company said it now expects revenue of $720 million to $734 million, after previously guiding revenue in a range of $660 million to $720 million.
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were also among the biggest gainers, pushing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up more than 2%.
Energy, however, lagged the move higher in the broader market, paced by a 1% fall in oil prices settled as worries over crude demand persisted.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 5.8% giving up some of its gains from Monday, after Norwegian Air canceled orders for 97 Boeing 737 Max and 787 jets, and said It would seek compensation for the grounding of the 737.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, surged to all-time highs, up 7%, ahead of its the second quarter delivering and production numbers expected later this week.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Cannae  Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) and Senator Investment Group, which are trying to buy CoreLogic Inc, said on Tuesday they own enough of the data and analytics firm to call a special meeting and that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is sure it can arrange financing for the deal.
The investment firms said in a regulatory filing they jointly hold a 15% stake in CoreLogic. This includes 8.2% of common stock, shares of common stock underlying share contracts equal to 1.8% of the common stock and cash settled swaps referencing 5% of the outstanding shares, according to the filing, made on Tuesday.
The stake is big enough for the two to ""call a special meeting of the stockholders,"" the filing added.
Cannae and Senator on Friday made an unsolicited bid to buy the property data and analytics company for $65 a share in cash and said the proposal was ""well in excess of what the company can achieve under its current plans.""
CoreLogic is reviewing the bid and will update shareholders on the outcome ""in due course,"" it said in a statement. The company also said its board and management team were ""laser-focused on increasing growth and profitability to drive shareholder value,"" citing its recent announcement of significantly higher revenue and guidance on Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for the second quarter.
CoreLogic's shares edged down 16 cents to $68.21 shortly before midday.
Tuesday's regulatory filing also detailed the two investors' financing plans. Bank of America provided Cannae with a ""highly confident letter dated June 28, 2020 indicating that BofA Securities is highly confident of its ability"" to arrange and syndicate the credit facilities in connection with the planned takeover, the filing said.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Global hedge fund liquidations surge as coronavirus hurts returns: data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - More hedge funds went out of business during the first three months of 2020 than at any other time since 2015 as the coronavirus led to heavy losses and investors pulled out billions in assets.
Hedge Fund Research reported on Tuesday that 304 funds liquidated around the world in the first quarter, marking the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2015 when 305 funds shut down. The number of closures is 50% higher than it was during the last three months of 2019 when 198 funds were liquidated, HFR data show.
Managers grappled with gyrating markets in late February and March as investors worried about the virus' death toll, shuttered economies and rising unemployment rates. Investors pulled $33 billion out of hedge funds in the first quarter, HFR reported earlier, marking the fourth-largest outflows ever.
At the same time only 84 new funds opened for business in the first quarter of 2020, the slowest pace of new launches since the financial crisis when 56 new funds opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2008, HFR said. The pace of new launches fell off even from late 2019 when 89 funds opened in the last three months of the year.
This leaves 8,081 hedge funds and 1,167 funds of hedge funds, where managers create a portfolio of hedge funds for their clients, for investors to choose from.
Hedge funds have struggled to deliver top returns over the last years which has made fund raising tough. Law firm Seward & Kissel reported that travel restrictions during the pandemic have had a dramatic impact on fund raising. Some long-closed funds have agreed to take in new capital and investors have expressed interest in funds that specialize in credit, healthcare, and municipal bonds, the firm's recent surveys found.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) investment bank formed a new group to increase its recruitment and hiring of Black employees and improve career development and retention among existing Black employees, according to a memo sent on Tuesday that was seen by Reuters. 
A Goldman spokeswoman, Nicole Sharp (OTC:SHCAY), verified the contents of the memo and said the new group will work on honing and improving diversity targets set in 2019 specifically for the investment bank. 
The newly formed Council for Advancement of Racial Equity will also develop better division-wide education and training on avoiding bias and improving management to promote wider racial inclusion in the bank's leadership.
The investment banking division co-heads Gregg Lemkau and Dan Dees will meet with the group bi-weekly and aim to have ""specific recommendations for tangible actions ready by this fall,"" according to the memo, signed by Lemkau and Dees.
""Our divisional efforts are focused on increasing the representation of Black talent and training programs around people management and avoiding bias,"" the two wrote. 

The group was launched in response to the spotlight put on systemic racism in the U.S. after the killing of George Floyd in May. 
In 2019, Goldman set a goal that 11% of all new analysts and entry-level associates hired in the U.S. and 9% hired in the U.K. be Black professionals. The bank said it also aimed for 14% to be Latino professionals and half to be women.
It also began requiring that at least two diverse candidates be interviewed for any job opening for more senior positions. Management's pay decisions would include scrutiny of whether these targets were met, the bank said at the time.

666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Airbus Starts Record Restructuring With 15,000 Jobs to Go","(Bloomberg) -- Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) embarked on the most extensive restructuring in its history, setting plans to cut 15,000 jobs worldwide to steer the planemaker through the crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
The European manufacturer will eliminate more than 10,000 positions across its main bases in Germany and France, part of an 11% reduction in global headcount, according to a statement on Tuesday. Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury has said the company’s output will be 40% lower than expected for two years due to a dramatic slump in demand for aircraft, and has previously warned it is bleeding cash.
“The crisis the aviation sector is facing will be of a length and magnitude that calls for more structural and wide-ranging actions,” the CEO said in a video message. “We need to act now by adapting our workforce to reflect the new situation.”
Airbus will look to cut 1,700 jobs in the U.K., 900 in Spain and about 1,300 in other countries by mid-2021 at the latest, the jet maker said. Voluntary measures such as early retirement will be the main part of the process, with compulsory cuts a “last resort,” Faury said.
The plans will be subject to agreement with the relevant unions, and faced almost instant opposition by the French government. The extent of the job cuts is “excessive,” the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that the company must do all it can to limit the number of forced retrenchments.
Aircraft Slump
Caught in an aircraft-market slump that could last as long as five years, Airbus is striving to bring down costs while avoiding political and labor tensions in its home nations. Airbus has about 135,000 employees globally, with almost 81,000 of those in the hard-hit commercial-aviation division.
The move marks the latest step in adjusting a business that had been expanding for more than a decade before the rapid spread of Covid-19 ushered in widespread travel bans and the subsequent grounding of airline fleets. While some countries are beginning to reopen borders, travel isn’t expected to return to pre-crisis levels before 2023 at the earliest, Airbus said.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Top U.S. health experts on Tuesday criticized American Airlines (O:AAL) and other carriers for filling planes to capacity, saying it sends the wrong message as the country grapples with a rise in coronavirus outbreaks.
American Airlines said on Friday it will no longer restrict the number of seats sold on flights beginning on Wednesday. United Airlines (O:UAL) is also selling planes to capacity though both notify passengers of full flights and allow them to re-book.
Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a Senate hearing that there was ""substantial disappointment"" with American, given many airlines are keeping middle seats open. 
""We don't think it's the right message,"" Redfield said.
Some lawmakers want Congress to require open seats on commercial flights. 
Among other large U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) are limiting the number of seats sold on their flights through at least September.
American Airlines said on Tuesday it has ""multiple layers of protection in place ... including required face coverings, enhanced cleaning procedures, and a pre-flight COVID-19 symptom checklist."" 
The company said it knows ""customers are placing their trust in us to make every aspect of their journey safe, and we are committed to doing just that.""
Senator Bernie Sanders wants the CDC to tell airlines that filling planes is ""unacceptable behavior - they are endangering the lives of the American people.""
COVID-19 cases more than doubled in June in at least 10 U.S. states, including Texas and Florida, a Reuters tally showed.
Redfield urged individuals to social distance on airplanes, trains and buses ""to the degree that's feasible and at least have a reliable face covering.""
Also addressing the panel, top U.S. infectious diseases official Anthony Fauci called American's decision ""of concern.""
U.S. airlines recently stepped up enforcement of mask wearing on flights. This week they also said they will begin requiring passengers to disclose during check-in whether they have any COVID-19 symptoms or been exposed to the virus within 14 days.
They urged government-administered temperature checks during the airport screening process, but the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said on Tuesday that no decision has been made.

While passenger traffic has been severely depressed due to the pandemic, people screened by TSA reached 633,810 on Sunday. That was the most since March 19 but significantly below the 2.6 million people screened a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - British proposals to give the City of London access to the European Union are ""unacceptable"" because they seek to maintain the benefits of the single market without the obligations, the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Tuesday.
EU policymakers worry that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by easing financial rules, but Britain has said it would maintain high standards of regulation.
Barnier said Britain would like to make it easy to continue to run EU financial services businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.
Many banks and insurers based in Britain have opened hubs in the EU to continue serving customers there irrespective of what deal London seals with Brussels.
""I will be blunt: its proposals are unacceptable. There is no way member states or the European Parliament would accept this,"" Barnier told a Eurofi conference.
Britain's finance ministry had no immediate comment on Barnier's comments.
London and Brussels have an end of June deadline for completing ""equivalence"" assessments for determining access to each other's financial markets.
Barnier said Britain has only responded to 4 of 28 questionnaires for assessing if UK financial rules are similar enough to those in the bloc to allow direct market access.
""So we are not there yet,"" Barnier said.
Britain has said it has introduced all EU rules into UK law. 
Barnier said the assessments are particularly challenging given that Britain has said it wants to diverge from EU rules once its transition period ends in December.
""This is even one of the main purposes of Brexit,"" said Barnier, a former EU financial services commissioner.
Equivalence-based access to the EU is not available in areas like insurance, commercial bank lending or deposit-taking.

""Nothing in the agreement that we are negotiating will change this,"" Barnier said.

Investing.com --  Hologic Inc  (NASDAQ:HOLX)shares rose more than 5%, hitting a record, after Cowen upgraded the medical device maker on demand for Covid-19 testing. Shares have almost doubled since March.
Analyst Chris Lin upgraded Hologic to outperform from market perform and boosted his price target to $64 from $55, according to GenomeWeb. Hologic should place a greater number Panther diagnostic systems this year.“While these placements are primarily driven by Covid-19 testing needs in the near term, we believe labs will continue to utilize these instruments once Covid-19 testing abates,” said Lin, who estimates Hologic will generate more than $1.5 billion from SARS-CoV-2 test revenue through the end of fiscal 2021.
Hologic has the capacity to manufacture more than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 tests per week, and management expects that capacity to ""meaningfully increase"" later this year, Lin said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Emergency Use Authorization for Hologic's Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay in March and for its Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay running on the Panther system in May. In the second quarter, molecular diagnostics revenue of $191 million increased about 14%, the division’s highest growth rate since 2012, which included $3.4 million of sales from the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay. Hologic scaled up manufacturing and is now producing nearly 600,000 Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 tests a month, representing a 12-fold increase in capacity for similar tests that run on the Panther Fusion system.The company withdrew its financial guidance in April, saying that the Covid-19 pandemic would likely have a significant negative impact on future revenue and operating income."

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Monday it would submit itself to an audit of how it controls hate speech in a bid to appease a growing advertising boycott of the platform, as it prepared to address a group of advertisers on Tuesday.
The move comes as major advertisers such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and Starbucks (O:SBUX) have signed on to the ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign started by U.S. civil rights groups, which urges brands to pause their Facebook ads in July to pressure the social media giant to do more to take down hate speech. 
Media Rating Council (MRC), a media measurement firm, will conduct the audit to evaluate how it protects advertisers from appearing next to harmful content and the accuracy of Facebook's reporting in certain areas. 
The scope and timing of the audit were still being finalized, Facebook said. 
Facebook hosted a call with advertisers on Tuesday, which included Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global marketing solutions, Guy Rosen, vice president of integrity, and Neil Potts, public policy director. 
The executives told the group Facebook would include a new data point about the prevalence of hate speech in its Community Standards Enforcement Report, which details how the company takes down content that violates policy, said Barry Lowenthal, chief executive of ad agency The Media Kitchen, who attended the call. 
Lowenthal said while he believed Facebook had taken many steps toward tampering down hate speech, the problem has become so large that it may require more drastic measures to fix.
""Maybe they should hit pause on the platform entirely,"" Lowenthal said, whose agency works with clients like Vanguard and Loews (NYSE:L) Hotels. ""How much more can society handle?""
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Coca-Cola (N:KO) are among companies that said they would pause advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days.
Facebook announced last week it would label ""newsworthy"" content that violates its policies, but the move failed to satisfy organizers of the boycott, who plan to call on more global advertisers to join the campaign.

689,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Fauci Balances Vaccine Hope With Realism as FDA Sets Vaccine Standards,"(Bloomberg) -- Infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci told a Senate panel he’s “aspirationally hopeful” that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be ready in early 2021, while the Food and Drug Administration laid out standards for approving an inoculation.
The FDA said that any candidate would have to be at least 50% more effective than a placebo. Several drugmakers are racing to complete clinical trials of vaccine candidates, with some expecting to wrap up in months studies that under previous circumstances have tended to take years.
Some health experts have expressed worry that FDA will rush to approve a vaccine before enough is known about safety or efficacy but the agency sought to allay those fears with the guidance.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned though that there is no guarantee that a safe vaccine will be developed. He also told the Senate health committee on Tuesday that he’s “quite concerned” by the recent increase in cases in southern and western states.
Several states are experiencing surges in new coronavirus cases, prompting many to roll back reopening plans. On Monday, Arizona paused operations at bars, gyms and movie theaters. Texas has delayed moving into new reopening phases as the state becomes the new epicenter of the pandemic. New York leaders are considering pushing back plans to allow indoor dining as they watch the rest of the country warily.
Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that in addition to the rise in new cases, hospitalizations are up in 12 states. The U.S. has recorded nearly 2.7 million Covid-19 cases in total, with almost 130,000 deaths from the virus.
Read the FDA guidelines here
Redfield and Fauci appeared before the committee for a hearing on reopening U.S. businesses and returning students to school. Fauci said schools may need to consider online classes or staggered schedules to safely bring students back. The CDC will issue guidance for schools on Tuesday.
As for airlines, while the CDC hasn’t focused on their plans, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc.’s announcement on Friday that it would resume selling flights to capacity on July 1 rather than capping passengers to keep them socially distanced caused “substantial disappointment” among public health officials, Redfield said.
American Air to Book Full Planes, Shelve Social Distancing
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with comments on wearing masks, saying the issue shouldn’t be as politicized as it’s become and that he’s asked President Donald Trump to wear a mask to set an example. Vice President Mike Pence appeared in Texas over the weekend in a mask and spoke about the value of covering your face in protecting against the virus.
Fauci told the panel, “I think we need to emphasize the responsibility we have as individuals and as part of a societal effort to end the epidemic and we all have to play a part in that.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is appearing before House lawmakers Tuesday. He plans to testify that the U.S. is at a crucial point in a potential economic recovery and must contain the virus.
“The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,” Powell said in prepared testimony.

Investing.com -- Workhorse Group Inc (NASDAQ:WKHS) soared 32%, to $19, an all-time high, after announcing financing of $70 million. Shares were trading at $1.47 in mid-March
The electric van maker has entered into a financing agreement with a single institutional investor for a $70 million senior secured convertible note. The proceeds will be used for current operating working capital and other general corporate purposes.
""With this note in place, we have much greater financial flexibility to support our current and future production needs,"" said Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes. ""Heading into the second half of the year, we'll be looking to meet our previously stated annual delivery target, which should have us in a strong position to accelerate our production ramp into 2021.”
Workhorse has four buy ratings and no sells or holds, with an average price target of $11.13, according to MarketWatch.
The company recently received federal approval for its all-electric vans. After being delayed because of the coronavirus, Workhorse said earlier this month that it had successfully completed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) testing for its C650 and C1000 delivery vans.
The note will rank pari passu with Workhorse's senior secured convertible note issued in December 2019 and senior to all other debt and is convertible into common stock by the investor at $19 per share, or 131% of the closing price of Workhorse's common stock on June 29.
The note matures on July 1, 2023 and contains a 4.5% annualized coupon to be paid quarterly in either cash or stock beginning October 1, 2020. In addition, Workhorse may be required to redeem up to $3.5 million of principal in monthly installments in either cash or stock beginning October 1, 2020.
“This financing will also allow us to continue to pursue a credit revolver, which we believe is the best financing vehicle for ramping up production,” Workhorse CFO Steve Schrader said in a statement. “We expect these proceeds to provide corporate operating funds for the foreseeable future.”"
691,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Rainy day hastens sovereign wealth funds' refocus to home,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Famed for snapping up glitzy real estate and stakes in troubled international banks during the global financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds are investing more at home, a trend set to accelerate in the wake of the economic carnage wrought by COVID-19.
Some of these state-owned entities, such as Singapore's Temasek Holdings, already acted more as development funds aimed at supporting their countries' economies, but many of them are considered ""rainy day"" funds - meaning they will have a big role in helping governments to manage the fallout from the pandemic.
There has been a flurry of recent domestic deals, such as Turkey's fund injecting 21 billion lira ($3.1 billion) into three state banks and Temasek supporting a $1.5 billion rights issue by Sembcorp Marine.
That's in addition to withdrawals from the Nigerian and Norwegian funds to help their governments deal with the economic impact of the virus.
While the lion's share of sovereign fund investments is still overseas, domestic deals are on the rise. They accounted for 21% of private equity deals in 2019 - already a doubling from 2015 levels, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF).
GRAPHIC: Sovereign wealth fund direct investments - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprrrolpe/swf.png
""I'd expect greater levels of investment in domestic economies going forward,"" said Will Jackson-Moore, global private equity, real assets and sovereign funds leader, PwC.
""That said, the best opportunities in international markets are going to be in the next 18 months. If there's demand for short-term emergency funding (from governments) then that could be more of a conflict and it will come down to how governments and sovereign wealth funds balance that.""
Analysts say returns at home may not necessarily be poorer, particularly if funds can cherry pick deals. Also, many are located in emerging markets, where expected gains can be larger. The rub comes if their remit also includes aiding the development of local economies, in which case some of the payback can flow to the economy as well as the fund.
Qatar made its name more than a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when its sovereign fund vehicles snapped up stakes in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) at a time when illiquidity meant many asset prices were low.
This year, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages over $300 billion in assets, is making similar waves, last month disclosing stakes in  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Marriott.
Still, the PIF is redoubling its domestic focus, said a source familiar with the fund. Its aim is to ensure its portfolio of local assets under management sits at 75% by the end of 2020. PIF did not respond to a request about its current weighting.
It's a not dissimilar story for other funds.
""Many sovereign wealth funds will support national budgets to finance the recovery or support healthcare systems,"" said Javier Capape, director of sovereign wealth research at the IE Center for the Governance of Change, pointing to the examples of the sovereign funds of Iran, Kuwait and PIF.
Ireland's fund formed a rescue package for small and medium-sized enterprises, while Temasek has helped accelerate the production of a vaccine. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala was set to play a key role in propping up neighbouring Dubai's economy by linking up assets in the two emirates, sources said last month.
Mubadala declined comment at the time.
RAINY DAY
While the financial pain caused by the virus is undoubtedly the rainy day sovereign funds have been built for, governments are having to weigh their use of resources now against the prospect of providing windfalls for future generations. That dilemma is especially stark in the case of oil wealth funds as hydrocarbon revenues are expected to wane in future years.
Even before the coronavirus and the plunge in oil prices, drawdowns from Kuwait's General Reserve Fund, managed by the country's sovereign fund, meant its assets are estimated by Fitch Ratings to have fallen for the sixth year in a row.
The Kuwait Investment Authority didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not an oil-based fund, will raise the liquidity of its portfolio to ensure it can provide funds for maintaining Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, while meeting the government's needs in withdrawing fiscal reserve deposits to deal with the epidemic, a spokesperson said.
A recent IFSWF survey of oil and non-oil sovereign funds found only two out of 10 said their governments had sought funds, with the same number saying they had received requests to support additional government projects.
Instead of tapping their rainy day funds, several governments including Gulf states and Kazakhstan have tapped debt capital markets to cover budget shortfalls. Mubadala last month raised $4 billion in bonds.
""It is interesting the use of leverage to finance the buying spree, it makes sense that sovereign wealth funds prefer to go to the debt markets than withdrawing private equity valuable positions at a loss nowadays,"" said Capape.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Precious metals, biotech among second-quarter fund winners as markets rebounded","By David Randall and Simon Jessop
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Funds that rode the market's rally to generate the highest second-quarter returns included those invested in assets such as mining stocks, energy and technology.
Global financial markets staged an impressive rebound in the second quarter despite deepening economic pain from the coronavirus pandemic, with the U.S. equity benchmark S&P 500 index clocking its strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 1998.
That helped an overwhelming number of funds generate a positive return over the last three months, even as they remained down in the year to date.
Many sectors that suffered the steepest losses as broad parts of the global economy went under lockdown during the first three months posted the largest comebacks.
U.S. energy funds, as well as those domiciled in Europe, Asia and Africa, jumped around 30% during the quarter, alongside a 24% surge in industrial commodities and a 27.7% gain in U.S.-based small-cap funds, according to Morningstar data.
Despite those gains, each sector remains down 3% or more for the year to date.

While equity markets rebounded, investors remained cautious that unprecedented economic stimulus measures by global central banks would spark inflation.
U.S-based precious metal funds soared nearly 54% during the quarter, the most of any asset class, and are up nearly 13% for the year through June 28, according to Morningstar.
Overall, 282 out of 293 non-U.S.-domiciled global fund categories tracked by Morningstar posted gains in the second quarter, with agriculture funds suffering the worst loss with a 4.4% decline.

For the year to date, only 86 fund categories have a positive return, led by a 15.8% gain in precious metals funds and a 15.7% gain in biotechnology funds.

In the U.S., only 2 out of 107 fund categories - bear market funds, and managed futures - posted negative returns during the quarter. For the year to date, 71 fund categories are in the red, led by the 40% decline in energy equity funds.
""The market very quickly embraced that there was going to be a deep recession and investors are now looking forward to what that healing process will look like,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management Multi-Asset Solutions team.
A recent surge in U.S. coronavirus cases will likely not push financial markets into another panic because of gains in controlling the spread of the virus in Asia and Europe, Jacobsen said. The U.S. now accounts for a quarter of all coronavirus infections.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 was up as much as 25% at one point in the second quarter before pulling back to post a 16% gain, mirroring its 20% decline in the first three months.

Those gains helped bolster funds such as the GMO Special Opportunities fund, which led all actively managed equity funds with a 151% advance in the second quarter.
The managers of the fund, which has its largest positions in consumer companies such as  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) and communications firm Cardlytics (NASDAQ:CDLX) Inc, declined comment.
The top-performing fixed-income fund, meanwhile, was the Braddock Multi-Strategy Income fund, which invests mainly in mortgaged and other securitised debt, with a 32.6% gain. The fund remains down 34.4% for the year to date.
Among fixed-income funds in general, U.S.-based emerging market debt funds returned 12.7% while high-yield bonds gained nearly 9%. U.S.-based government bond funds, meanwhile, gained 0.6% or less as Treasuries edged off of historic low yields.

693,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>","Microsoft, LinkedIn to Retrain Unemployed Workers for In-Demand Jobs","(Bloomberg) --  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and its LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) unit will provide free job training to help unemployed workers prepare for in-demand jobs as the global pandemic pushes U.S. joblessness to levels as bad as those during the Great Depression.
The program uses LinkedIn data to find the jobs that employers most want to fill, and offers free access to content that helps workers develop the required skills. The company will also cut the cost of its certification exams and offer free job-seeking tools. Microsoft aims to provide additional skills to 25 million people globally by the end of the year through the program for such jobs as software developer, customer-service specialist and graphic designer.
Microsoft said its calculations show global unemployment may reach a quarter of a billion people this year. The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% in May, the highest level since 1940, as the coronavirus shut down stores, restaurants and bars, with higher rates of joblessness among Black and Latino workers. While parts of the economy are starting to reopen in the U.S., companies are also shutting down, filing for bankruptcy or announcing permanent job cuts to adjust to a long-term slowdown. 
In January, Microsoft began working on a plan for a smaller program to highlight tools to address a long-term move to jobs that are becoming increasingly digital. When Covid-19 hit, the company decided to expand the program to reach more workers faster, Microsoft President Brad Smith said in an interview. 
“Covid-19 sent so many people home, if they had the good fortune to keep their job and work from home,” Smith said. “It became clear that in order to get back into the workplace, many people would not be able to return to the job they left —  they might need to get a new job  — or even their old job required a lot more digital skills than before.”
Microsoft used data from LinkedIn to come up with 10 roles with the greatest number of job openings, steady growth for the last four years, “livable” wages and skills that can be learned online, the company said Tuesday in a blog post. These include: software developer, sales representative, data analyst, customer service specialist and graphic designer.
One piece of the original program that has been broadened in the wake of the pandemic is funding for nonprofit groups to reach out to people who otherwise won't know about the program or who can’t do everything online. Microsoft will spend $20 million in cash grants for global nonprofits with a goal of helping 5 million unemployed workers this year. The effort will focus in particular on people with disabilities, workers from low-income communities, women and minorities. A quarter of the money will be earmarked for grants to 50 U.S. community-based nonprofit organizations led by and serving communities of color, Microsoft said. 
“Someone who is unemployed needs to know what to learn. We give them the access to that learning material for free to areas where we know there are recruiters and hiring managers on the other side waiting to hire them,” said Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive officer. 
LinkedIn also plans to provide its own labor market data and information on in-demand skills for free to governments. The data will include popular job openings in a region, the top skills required for those jobs and data on which employers are hiring the most in a particular geography. The data will be available at opportunity.linkedin.com.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Nasdaq's $1.2 trillion biotech index draws Europe's COVID drug hunters,"By Inti Landauro and Abhinav Ramnarayan
MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Spain's Pharma Mar (MC:PHMR) is looking at listing on New York's Nasdaq market, joining a flurry of biotech companies aiming to tap investors' voracious appetite for the sector as it tests one of its therapies to treat COVID-19.
The move comes several weeks after the company started mid-stage human trials of cancer drug Aplidin in COVID-19 patients.
The preliminary tests were ""super encouraging"", although the sample is still too small to be statistically significant, Chairman Jose Maria Fernandez Sousa-Faro told Reuters.
Pharma Mar's Madrid shares have almost tripled to 7.51 euros ($8.41) since mid March, taking its market valuation to 1.67 billion euros ($1.87 billion).
The pharma industry's search for a treatment for COVID-19 has sparked a parallel hunt among investors for the companies most likely to succeed. 
That has seen the Nasdaq's biotech index (NBI) soar about 25% in the second quarter, its best quarterly performance in nearly 20 years, to reach a total value of $1.2 trillion. 
It has also opened the door to initial public offerings (IPOs), in marked contrast to the broader financial market where the pandemic has sapped interest in new issues.
Global IPO volumes - at $53.7 billion in the first six months of the year - are at their lowest level since 2016, while European IPO volumes are at eight year lows, according to Refinitiv data.
""There's a number of midsized biotech firms in the UK and elsewhere in Europe that are in preliminary talks with investors in New York about a potential listing there,"" said one banker involved in the discussions.
""There is a sophisticated pharma investor base on Nasdaq that goes beyond anything we have here in Europe at the moment, and the sector is red hot.""
Shares in Nasdaq-listed U.S. firms  Moderna  (O:MRNA),  Novavax  (O:NVAX) and Inovio Pharmaceuticals (O:INO), which are testing potential vaccines against COVID-19, have soared this year.
Other European drugmakers including Sanofi (PA:SASY) also have Nasdaq listings, and German drugmaker CureVac is planning a U.S. IPO next month as it starts trials of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.
Earlier this month, Royalty Pharma launched the second-largest pharmaceutical listing ever. 
(Graphic: Nasdaq biotech shares soar, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxrxwlvx/biotech.PNG) 
BETTER UNDERSTANDING
A U.S. presence would give Pharma Mar better access to investors who understand biotech cycles and value research and development more than in Spain, where investors put greater focus on profits, Fernandez said.
Rather than listing directly, Pharma Mar is considering buying a rival in the United States, which could then provide a way to join the Nasdaq, he said.
The company could use revenues of as much as $1 billion it stands to make by 2026 from a deal with  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  (O:JAZZ) for lung cancer treatment Lurbinectedin in the United States, he said.
""We could buy an anti-tumour drugmaker in the U.S. or in Japan or a biotech in the U.S.,"" Fernandez said, though he added he hadn't spoken to any outside advisers yet.
""It's a very recent idea,"" he said.
The potential target could also be an anti-viral drugmaker.
Given its cash position, Pharma Mar doesn't plan a public offering in New York, though Fernandez doesn't rule it out if the acquisition target required more money than the company has.

Investing.com -- Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). rose 6%, to $52.12, on Tuesday after fiscal third quarter results beat estimates, prompting a slew of analyst price target boosts.
Micron reported earnings per share of 82 cents and revenue of $5.44 billion, up from $4.8 billion a year earlier.
The memory-chip maker said sales surged in the third quarter as the pandemic forced more companies to expand their cloud computing capabilities. Sales should remain strong in the second half of the fiscal year. The company forecast fiscal fourth quarter revenue in a range of $5.75 billion to $6.25 billion.
According to MarketWatch and TipRanks, Micron received the following price target increases:

696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Posts Biggest Increase Since Late 2011,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer confidence rose in June by more than forecast as optimism increased amid business reopenings, though sentiment remained well below pre-pandemic levels.
The Conference Board’s index jumped by 12.2 points to 98.1, the biggest one-month gain since late 2011, according to a report Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists had called for a reading of 91.5.
The group’s subindex of expectations, based on consumers’ outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, rose to a four-month high of 106. Attitudes about the present situation gained 17.8 points to 86.2 -- the largest one-month gain since 1974.
The rise in confidence shows Americans are regaining optimism as more businesses reopen, especially in hard-hit states like New York, though the improvement was concentrated among higher-income individuals. New outbreaks in states on the West Coast and in the South, which have already resulted in closures of some bars and beaches, could dampen confidence moving into July.
The cutoff date for the Conference Board’s preliminary survey results was June 18, suggesting some responses were prior to the surge in virus cases that began in the third week of the month. That means the results likely show sentiment from the more optimistic weeks of state reopenings.
“Faced with an uncertain and uneven path to recovery, and a potential Covid-19 resurgence, it’s too soon to say that consumers have turned the corner and are ready to begin spending at pre-pandemic levels,” Lynn Franco, the Conference Board’s senior director of economic indicators, said in a statement..
Data last week showed the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index also climbed in June, but was still well below pre-pandemic levels.
The share of Conference Board respondents expecting better business conditions in six months was a record 42.6% though was little changed from the prior month, while the proportion expecting more jobs fell slightly to 38.4%.
At the same time, 15.1% of respondents said they expected their incomes to increase in the next six months, compared to 14.6% in May.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",India's Chinese app ban seen jolting $1 billion expansion of ByteDance,"By Aditya Kalra and Pei Li
NEW DELHI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - An Indian ban on dozens of Chinese apps following a border clash between the two nations has possibly derailed a $1 billion India expansion plan of China's ByteDance, while also sparking an uproar from users of its popular TikTok video app.
TikTok was blocked on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) app stores in India after New Delhi said on Monday night it was among the 59 apps which it believed posed a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity"". Late on Tuesday, TikTok's already downloaded versions on phones in India stopped showing any videos. [nL4N2E63K0]
The government order didn't name China, or cite the border clashes. App analytics firm Sensor Tower said all the 59 apps named were of Chinese origin, including Tencent's WeChat and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s UC Browser.
""If this is not rolled back, these companies would be constrained to cut back their operations in India, potentially resulting in a loss of employment,"" said a lawyer who advises a Chinese company whose app has been banned in India. 
China's foreign ministry said it was ""strongly concerned"" about India's decision. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said it suspected the move violated WTO rules.
The biggest casualty appears to be ByteDance, which has since last year hired several senior executives and laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. India is TikTok's top growth market and accounts for 30% of its 2 billion downloads worldwide.
TikTok said in a statement the Indian government had invited the company to respond to the ban and submit clarifications, adding that it complies with all data security and privacy requirements. It did not comment on the fate of its expansion plan.
""Our managers say there is no need to panic and it's business as usual. But we all are concerned about losing jobs,"" one ByteDance content reviewer in the southern city of Hyderabad told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
'HOW WILL I LIVE NOW?'
Following the ban order, many TikTok users posted videos expressing their displeasure before the app stopped showing content on Tuesday. 
One user @omkarsharma988 posted a video in which he throws utensils to the ground, hits a chair and weeps, with a Hindi song playing ""You've left me, how will I live now?"" The video had been liked 218,000 times, as the app still functions on phones on which it is already downloaded.
When TikTok was banned briefly last year after a state court said the app encouraged pornography, the company told the Supreme Court the ban cost it roughly $15 million a month.
Several Indian lawyers said chances of a success through a legal challenge this time were slim given the government had invoked national security concerns, meaning the Chinese companies can only hope to lobby India to reverse the decision.
""From a legal perspective, it (the ban) is sound because grounds like national security are difficult to challenge,"" said Santosh Pai of Link Legal, which advises Chinese companies.
The ban has also disappointed Tencent, which has apps on the market and is also a major investor in Indian startups, two sources aware of the company's concerns told Reuters. New Delhi in April mandated screening of incoming investments from countries like China, hitting the likes of Tencent.
While its WeChat messaging app is not that popular in India, the company fears the government could impose a ban later on the mobile version of its blockbuster game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, said one of the sources. Tencent declined to comment.
Two games of China-based firms, ""Mobile Legends"" and ""Clash of Kings"", were among those banned on Monday.
Sensor Tower said the 59 banned apps had recorded roughly 4.9 billion downloads in India since January 2014.

On June 15, Indian and Chinese troops brawled for several hours on their disputed Himalayan border, killing 20 Indian soldiers and wounding at least 76, India said. China has not disclosed how many casualties its troops suffered.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",How coronavirus became a market inferno and what was done to douse it,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - From a January lockdown in a Chinese province to 10 million infections worldwide, the coronavirus' march across the globe has buffeted markets at every step these past six months, roiling the very plumbing of the global financial system.
Market panic and economic devastation from lockdowns elicited an unprecedented response from policymakers, sowing seeds of recovery.
The following charts aim to capture some of the milestones.
1)CHINA: WARNING SIGNS AND ACTION
On Jan. 21, there were reports of a ""flu-like"" virus in China and soon after the city of Wuhan closed urban transport and suspended outgoing flights.
By Jan. 27, the World Health Organisation declared an emergency in China, hitting the yuan and Chinese equities. 
On Feb. 3, China's central bank stepped up with a $174 billion liquidity injection, the first of many such actions worldwide. On Feb. 17, it cut interest rates and infused more cash into the system.
In early April, Wuhan started to ease its lockdown.
2) MARKETS ABLAZE
On Feb. 10 , the WHO called the virus ""a spark that becomes a bigger fire"". But world stocks still hit record highs on Feb 19.
On Feb. 24, as deaths mounted in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, European shares suffered their worst day since 2016.
On March 9, the S&P500 posted its largest one-day drop since 2008 and 30-year Treasury yields fell below 1% for the first time ever.
The following week, Wall Street's VIX volatility gauge surged above 85, versus month-ago levels around 15. 
World stocks hit 3-1/2 year lows on March 23 before recovery kicked in. On June 4, Nasdaq tech shares surpassed pre-COVID record highs.
3)""WHATEVER IT TAKES-2""
Market panic galvanised the Fed into an emergency interest rate hike on March 3.
On March 11, the Bank of England slashed rates to 0.25%. The Fed went to 0% too in an unscheduled March 15 move, triggering more policy easings worldwide.
On March 19, the European Central Bank launched a 750 billion euro ($841 bln) emergency bond buying scheme.
On March 23, the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to buy corporate bonds, including select junk securities, for the first time ever. U.S. corporate yields tumbled 80 bps in a week and are now at record lows.
4) EUROPEAN U-TURNS
The crisis forced a U-turn on budget frugality, notably in Germany which on March 23 announced a spending package of up to 750 billion euros. Britain also reversed ""austerity"", with 133 billion pounds in pledges.
On May 18 came a proposal with potential to change euro area fortunes: a 750 billion euro European Union recovery fund, to be financed via joint debt issuance. The move, pivotal for European cohesion, has seen 10-year borrowing costs for euro zone weak link, Italy, tumble 50 bps.
5) DOLLAR CRUNCH
The March meltdown fuelled a dash for dollars, blowing out swap premia for the greenback. Euro-dollar three-month swap spreads surged above 120 bps on March 17, the widest since 2011. Between March 9-20, the dollar jumped 9%.
Strains eased after the Fed opened dollar swap lines with major central banks, later expanding the facility. In early June, the dollar had slipped to March 10 levels.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, ahead of another key session of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12 points or 0.1% at 25,583 points. TheS&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Trading is expected to be influenced by quarter-end window dressing, at the end of stocks’ best quarter in over a decade – although that performance is overwhelmingly due to the collapse in the first quarter that was stemmed by massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. The market was left cold as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index rebounded by less than expected in June, to a level of only 36.6. 
The threat of fresh lockdown measures in the U.S. also refuses to go away, as a surge in new cases across the South and West led Dr. Anne Schuchart, the principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to say on Monday that the virus is spreading too quickly and too broadly to be brought under control. Various counties in California and Florida have already said their beaches will remain closed over the July 4th weekend.
Among individual stocks, Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 4.2% after  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) canceled an order for 97 aircraft, almost all of which was accounted for by the 737 MAX. Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 3.8% after reports that it's in talks to buy meal delivery service Postmates for around $2.6 billion.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.1% to its lowest in six weeks on concerns that it will have to write billions of dollars off the value of its assets. Rival major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) earlier Tuesday said it would take impairments of up to $22 billion in the second quarter to reflect expectations of lower oil and gas prices for the next three years, following a path already beaten by BP (NYSE:BP), Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Hess (NYSE:HES) and Occidental (NYSE:OXY).
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) ADRs were down 4.3%. U.S. Crude oil prices, which were also knocked by Shell's update, were down 0.6% at $39.45 a barrel.
Elsewhere, Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock hit a new all-time high, rising 2.7% after an internal e-mail was leaked in which founder and CEO Elon Musk still held out hope that the company - which has a valuation of $187 billion - would break even in the three months to June.

The French company - the world's biggest manufacturer of beauty products, including brands Maybelline and Garnier - said last week it would change its labelling after a similar move by Unilever (AS:UNA).
Unilever and L'Oreal (PA:OREP) are two big players in the global market for skin whitening creams used in many Asian, African and Caribbean countries where fair skin is often considered desirable.
Unilever had come in for criticism for its ""Fair & Lovely"" brand at a time of worldwide focus on racial injustice following protests prompted by the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in the United States. 
L'Oreal CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors on Tuesday that the rethink was targeted at specific products, especially treatments sold in Asia and countries like India aimed at protecting skin from the sun and avoiding dark spots. 
""For a long time these products were called whitening, or fairness, and these labels are increasingly contested and less and less appreciated by local consumers,"" Agon told the shareholder meeting, conducted online. ""We're simply adapting our vocabulary, to meet changing expectations and attitudes.""
Agon said ""glow"" and ""even"" were more appropriate words for these products. He said it was not a question of a blanket eradication of the words ""white"" in all campaigns and products.
L'Oreal's announcement last Friday that it would drop words such as ""white"" from certain products made big headlines across the media.

""There's no need for all the media hype on this. But I recognise we should have explained it better,"" Agon said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the target of EU antitrust investigations into key segments of its business, on Tuesday rejected accusations of market dominance, saying it competes with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930) and other rivals. 
Earlier this month, the European Commission opened investigations into Apple's App Store and mobile payment system Apple Pay, concerned about its role as a gatekeeper to its lucrative platform.
""We compete with a wide variety of companies, Google, Samsung, Huawei, Vivo, LG, Lenovo and many more,"" Daniel Matray, head of Apple's App Store and Apple Media Services, told a Forum Europe online event.
""In fact, Apple does not have a dominant position in any market, and we face strong competition in every category, in tablets, wearables, desktop and notebook computers, maps, music, payments, messaging, and more,"" he said.
Matray defended Apple's App Store, saying the same rules apply to all developers, large and small, with 85% of apps not required to pay a 30% fee to the company which is only valid for those which use its in-app payment service.
The EU is investigating whether this requirement and rules preventing developers from informing users of cheaper products elsewhere are anti-competitive. 
It is also probing Apple's terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites, and also the company's refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.
The EU investigations were prompted by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and an e-book rival.
Matray said the App Store has boosted competition, rather than harmed rivals.

""In the nearly 12 years since the App Store debuted, the best measure of its success is the dynamism it has unleashed and the state of the app economy today,"" he said.

The lawyer, Joerg Zarbl, told Reuters on Tuesday that Braun took out a 120 million euro ($135 million) loan to buy at least 2.5 million Wirecard shares via a holding company in May after a critical audit by KPMG sent its shares crashing in late April. 
Braun's stock buys helped Wirecard's shares recover, Zarbl said. He wants prosecutors to investigate whether Braun's intention was to send positive signals to the market. ""There is a suspicion of market manipulation here."" 
Wirecard was once one of the hottest fintech firms in Europe with a market value of $28 billion at its peak. It filed for insolvency on Thursday owing creditors nearly $4 billion. Its auditor EY said a massive hole in its accounts was the result of an elaborate and sophisticated global fraud.
German prosecutors are already investigating possible criminal offences in connection with the payments firm, as is the Philippine's anti-money laundering agency.
Braun was released on bail after being arrested in Munich last week. His lawyer was not immediately available for comment. Marsalek is missing. His law firm declined to comment.
Wirecard hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit after critical media reports about the financial technology company. KPMG said it was unable to verify 1 billion euros in cash balances and questioned Wirecard's acquisition accounting.
The Vienna prosecutors' office is now checking whether it is the right jurisdiction to receive the claim against the German company, a spokesman said.
Zarbl said he filed the claim in Austria as Braun and Marsalek were Austrians and his clients had bought Wirecard shares via Austrian banks.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares picked up on Tuesday after a weak start, extending the optimism of the Asian session, and oil prices steadied as investors looked for signs of an economic recovery in the second half of 2020. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up about 0.1% at 1056 GMT, after Asian shares rose on strong data from the U.S. housing market and Chinese factories. European shares continued the rally.
World shares are down around 8% so far this year, having slumped 35% between Feb. 20 and March 23 in the most destructive sell-off since the Great Depression. But the world equity index is up 17.5% this quarter - on track for its biggest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 2009. (Graphic: Global markets and the tale of two quarters, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxrrxwpx/Pasted%20image%201593105658002.png) 
Rising COVID-19 cases continue to show signs of a second deadly wave of the pandemic, but markets still expect a global economic recovery with lockdown measures easing.
Los Angeles has become a new epicentre in the pandemic as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations surge there despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's orders requiring bars to close and residents to wear masks in nearly all public spaces.
The World Health Organization (WHO) will ""read carefully"" a Chinese study on a new flu virus found in pigs, a spokesman said, adding that the findings underscored the importance of influenza surveillance during the current pandemic.
""Asset markets are looking beyond COVID stats,"" said Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho Bank. ""There's some expectation of containment and then, further down the line, an expectation of some form of measure to combat the virus.""
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the outlook for the world's biggest economy was ""extraordinarily uncertain"". (Graphic: World financial markets in 2020, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopajllwva/Pasted%20image%201593383581288.png) 
European shares edged up, with the Euro STOXX 600 up 0.1% at 1102 GMT having been relatively range-bound for the past two weeks. Germany's DAX was up 0.3%.
London's FTSE 100 was down 0.6%. Britain's economy shrank by the most since 1979 in early 2020 as households slashed their spending, according to official data that included the first few days of the lockdown. 
Supported by end-of-quarter flows, the dollar rose to 97.722 against a basket of currencies, up 0.3% on the day.
""I would expect overall dollar demand to continue as we go into July,"" Mizuho's Neil Jones said.
""If there's a summer lull then we may see a dollar sell-off into the elections but as we run up to the end of the year I would expect to see a resurgence of dollar demand,"" he added.
The euro was down around 0.3% against the dollar, at $1.1208, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars also edged down.
Oil prices slipped as traders took profits after sharp gains the previous session and Libya's state oil company flagged progress in talks to resume exports, potentially boosting supply. Prices then recovered partially. 
U.S. crude was down 0.6% at $39.15 a barrel, having hit as low as $39.00, while Brent crude slipped 0.6% to $41.16 per barrel. 
China's parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong in response to last year's pro-democracy protests. The United States, Britain and other Western governments have said the legislation erodes the autonomy the city was granted at its 1997 handover. Market reaction was limited.
Demand for safe German debt was little changed, with the 10-year government Bund yield at -0.478% (DE10YT=RR). 

Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 0.3% in June from a four-year low of 0.1% in May, beating forecasts for no change and supporting the European Central Bank's expectation that a negative reading may be avoided.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Cautious global funds favor bonds over equities in June: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Increasingly cautious global funds recommended an increase to bond holdings in June to the highest since early 2010 at least at the expense of equity allocations, which were cut to the lowest in over 3-1/2 years, a Reuters poll showed.
While world stocks have risen sharply since late-March troughs on hopes for a quick economic recovery, the pandemic has shown few signs of abating. In the United States, states like California and Florida have reversed their re-openings, with Arizona also ordering the closure of bars and gyms.
Reuters polls of economists, long-term investors, as well as foreign exchange, fixed-income and property market analysts over the past few months have suggested the recovery from the global economic recession would be slow and long. [ECILT/WRAP][ASSET/WRAP][EUR/POLL][US/INT]
""Financial markets, especially world stocks, have completely dismissed how bad the coronavirus' impact will be on economies around the globe after an initial shock reaction in March and instead diverted attention to a fairy-tale ending - calling for a V-shaped recovery,"" said a global chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company.
""The evidence so far though has clearly pointed to the opposite. But that recovery debate should start later and everyone should be paying more attention instead to the economic devastation from the coronavirus, as it is not a done deal yet.""
The June 15-29 poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers across North America, Europe and Japan showed a recommended cut to equity allocations to an average 44.2% of their model global portfolio from 45.1% in May. That would be the lowest since November 2016.
But over 70% of fund managers who answered an additional question, or 17 of 24, said equity markets would not revisit this year's lows over the next six months.
With unparalleled fiscal and monetary policy support expected for years, the poll suggested an increase to bond holdings to the highest since the poll series started in early 2010, to 44.3% from 42.4% in May.
That lines up with the findings of a separate Reuters poll of fixed-income analysts published on Tuesday, which showed sovereign bond yields would linger around current low rates over the coming year. [US/INT]
When asked if U.S. Treasury yields would retest this year's lows by end-December, nearly two-thirds of asset managers, or 15 of 24, said that was likely.
""With the Federal Reserve's bond buying programme restraining yields, a shock to markets such as a second wave of COVID-19 driven lockdowns could drive 10-year Treasury yields briefly below their March lows given their current depressed levels,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
Over 90% of funds, or 22 of 24, said the U.S. central bank's gloomy economic outlook was ""about right"", which was reiterated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell late on Monday. That lines up with separate Reuters polls of economists published last week. [ECILT/US]
""The Fed's assessment reflects the current recessionary environment and weak inflation outlook. We expect short-term lowflation, if not disinflation risks, and then higher likely but not hyperinflation,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi, in Paris.
But in the latest poll, 54% of fund managers, or 13 of 24 said they would increase equity allocations over the next three months, while 38% said they would trim stock holdings further.
The remaining 8% said they would either trim bond holdings or move into non-traditional assets.
""With interest rates and bond yields at all-time lows - and the likelihood they will remain so for some time to come - makes equity markets the only real game in town,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
""The coronavirus sell-off in March saw money funds balloon in size but at some point, this money will return - and the reality is that it will return to the equity markets which look better in value than sovereign bonds.""

710,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Slumping fleet sales weigh on U.S. auto market,"By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Collapsing demand from rental car companies, corporations and government agencies has sapped U.S. auto sales during the coronavirus pandemic and a recovery will likely be slow, threatening auto workers whose jobs depend on fleet sales.
Weak fleet orders are expected to hurt June sales, which automakers will report on Wednesday. Cox Automotive forecasts fleet sales will fall nearly 56% to 1.3 million vehicles after plunging 83% in May and 77% in April.
In the short term, fleet sales are not a major concern for automakers focused on ramping up production to beef up anemic dealer inventories for higher-profit sales to consumers. They will become a challenge when inventories are replenished, however, since production must be maintained to keep automakers profitable.
Any sustained production cuts could trigger job cuts in an industry that accounts for roughly one fifth of U.S. retail sales.
""If we don't see a rebound in 2021, this will be a problem for automakers,"" said Zohaib Rahim, economic and industry insights manager at Cox Automotive. ""But right now they're using all their production to supply dealers."" 
Commercial sales are seen coming back in 2021, but government orders may take a hit next year once the pandemic's impact on tax revenue becomes clear. 
The rental car industry - where  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ) filed for bankruptcy protection in May - faces a deeply uncertain future. Around 62% of nearly 2.8 million vehicles sold to fleet buyers in 2019 went to rental car companies. 
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, says the car models facing greater risk because of their reliance on lower-margin rental fleet sales include Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) Altima and General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet Malibu.
U.S. fleet sales are dominated by GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Nissan and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) and accounted for 16.4% of new vehicle sales in 2019.
https://tmsnrt.rs/2NvNd7D
In 2019, fleet sales accounted for nearly 22% of GM's sales, with about half going to rental fleets and the other half to corporations and government agencies. Fleet sales accounted for nearly 28% of Nissan's 2019 sales, with almost 93% of those sales going to rental car companies.
John Ruppert, Ford's general manager of commercial and government fleet sales, said the impact on commercial sales has been mixed. Ford is the market leader for higher-margin commercial and government fleet sales.
On the positive side, Ruppert said work-from-home policies have boosted orders from telecommunications companies and created new demand for delivery vehicles.
However, after a historic decline in oil prices, Ruppert said it ""could be some time in 2021"" before industry-wide vehicle orders from oil and gas producers recover. 
Contract talks for commercial fleet orders usually begin March or April, but did not this year as the economy shut down.
""We're seeing those contract talks happening now in earnest,"" Ruppert said. Some orders could be delayed a quarter or two, he said, meaning overall commercial fleet sales should recover some time in 2021. 
Ruppert said government orders are based on the previous year's tax base, so 2021 orders will reflect this year's pandemic.
FCA is ""bullish"" on fleet sales in the second half of 2020 thanks to commercial and government purchases, U.S. head of sales Jeff Kommor said. 
""Despite vehicles sitting idle for a few months in 2020, most commercial and government fleet operators have a schedule they adhere to maximize their residual value,"" he said. 
The Kansas City, Kansas, plant where GM makes the Malibu will be shut down for an extra week this summer, which a spokeswoman said reflected both consumer and fleet demand. GM does not intend to halt Malibu production, she said.
""Rental companies have been an important customer of ours,"" she added. ""We expect that to continue in the future, when the rental market recovers.""
The Malibu and Altima sedans have both seen a long decline in consumer demand. Nissan spokeswoman Lloryn Love-Carter said the Japanese automaker ""continuously considers a number of opportunities to drive efficiencies within our manufacturing operations.""

Nissan declined to comment on fleet sales.

(Reuters) - As world stock markets end a turbulent six months near record highs, investors appear to be betting heavily that economies will recover quickly from the coronavirus crisis, fuelled by zero interest rates and abundant monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Despite the economic ravages of the pandemic, the total market capitalization of global stocks is now 52% of expected global economic output -- the highest such ratio in 25 years.
(Graphic: Global market cap to GDP ratio, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjlreopr/Global%20market%20cap1.jpg) 
If investors seem to be overlooking the prospect that business earnings may not recover in time to justify such lofty stock valuations, it is because of a lack of alternatives, a fear of inflation and the cheapness of stocks, analysts say.
""First, new, mostly young investors have been lured into the market by cheap commissions and a gamblers' mentality,"" said Tim Bain, president at Spark Asset Management in Statesville, North Carolina.
Bain said global stocks at this year's troughs were down roughly 35%, which was the average decline in bear markets since the Great Depression. 
""At that point the risk/reward shifted in favour of risk takers, and the stocks of companies deemed essential that had fallen as much as any other stock all of a sudden looked cheap.""
The rally has been narrow, however, with investors preferring well-established large-cap stocks to smaller ones.
According to Refinitiv data, large-cap stocks have risen over 12% in the past two months, while small- and mid-cap firms added just 6%.
(Graphic: COVID-19 cases vs World index's performance this year, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwwwgqvw/COVID%2019%20cases%20vs%20World%20index%20performance.jpg) 
The disconnect between the markets and economies could continue until large-cap names reach bubble levels, Spark's Bain said, adding that defining those bubble levels was subjective.
The drop in bond yields has added allure to equities, despite worries over earnings and the hit to revenues this year, analysts said. 
Earnings yield, which measures how much a stock investment may earn for investors, was much higher than bond yields in most markets, Refinitiv data showed. 
(Graphic: Top economies' profit growth and YTD price performance, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgporrmwvd/Profit%20growth%20and%20YTD%20price%20performance.jpg) 
""With bond yields near zero, stock prices look attractive,"" said Robert Johnson, a professor of finance at Creighton University's Heider College of Business. 
He pointed to 10-year U.S. Treasury yields at around 0.68% implying a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 147 for Treasuries. 
""By contrast, the S&P 500 PE ratio of 25 times earnings seems like a bargain,"" Johnson said.
Some analysts expect the disconnect between markets and real economic indicators could persist as long as stocks are perceived to be a hedge against inflation in stimulus-flooded economies. (Graphic: Earnings yield vs 10 yr benchmark yield, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrrrjlve/Earnings%20yield%20vs%2010%20yr%20benchmark%20yield.jpg) 
""For most situations, the place to avoid incoming inflation is equities,"" said Clem Chambers, chief executive officer at ADVFN in London.
""The apparent disconnect between the world economy and stock prices comes from the fact the latter are not rising because the market thinks companies are going to do well -- instead it's because money is going to nosedive in value.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open slightly lower Tuesday, as investors react with caution given the storing gains this quarter and as a number of states reconsidering their opening of businesses with Covid-19 cases mounting. 
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 13 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract fell 75 points, or 0.3%. 
These cash indices are all on course for a positive June. The DJIA and the S&P 500 are set for their best quarters since the fourth quarter of 1998 and the Nasdaq Composite since the first quarter of 2001. 
Deaths from the virus have surpassed 505,000 worldwide and confirmed cases have exceeded 10 million in the six months since the World Health Organization became aware of the novel coronavirus. 
More and more U.S. states are pushing back or suspending reopening plans heading into a holiday weekend. New Jersey joined the crowd on Monday, postponing the reopening of indoor restaurants, Arizona ordered bars and gyms to close, while parts of California and Florida are shutting beaches. 
And the “worst is yet to come” given a lack of global solidarity, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Geneva Monday. 
Yet the latest economic data has tended to be positive, with Monday’s pending home sales soaring 44.3% in May, the largest monthly increase since the National Association of Realtors started the index in January 2001. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday about the economic stimulus unleashed in response to the virus, a day before the Federal Reserve publishes the minutes of its June rate-setting meeting.
U.S. data due include the Chicago PMI at 9:45 AM ET and the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment index for June at 10 AM.
In corporate news,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) is likely to be in focus Tuesday after the bank confirmed late Monday that it will have to cut its third-quarter dividend as the result of the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test.
Additionally, Boeing (NYSE:BA) could struggle after Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC)announced the cancellation of a big 737 MAX order and a suit for damages.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, amid concerns that the second wave of coronavirus cases will hit demand for fuel, as well as by the prospect of a resumption of Libyan exports after a six-month blockade caused by the country's civil war. That said, the oil market has nearly doubled in price in the second quarter.
Eyes will be on inventories data due on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute industry group, and from the U.S. government on Wednesday.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $39.23 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $41.43.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,782.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1209, down 0.3%.

“Price/earnings multiples in sectors with strong secular growth, such as Info Tech, show little correlation with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields since 2011; their valuations can move higher in low-rate environments (because of their long duration) or high-rate environments (because of their high near-term growth expectations),” strategists led by Ryan Hammond wrote in a note June 29.
Growth expectations for the near-term become more important when rates rise in a low-rate environment, Goldman said, noting that the firm’s rates strategists see expansion expectations lifting 10-year U.S. Treasury yields by 45 basis points through year-end. That boosts cyclical shares, insulates long-duration equities with high growth, and weighs on defensive stocks.
Goldman sees net upside risk to S&P 500 multiples and prices if monetary policy remains loose and growth expectations improve, which it envisions as the most likely scenario.
“High multiples of Software & Services appear supported by fundamentals, while Household & Personal Products valuations are stretched,” the strategists said.
Goldman also looked at U.S. stocks’ valuations based on factors including their equity duration, near-term growth expectations and margins. Those trading at the biggest discounts to their modeled valuation include Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co.,  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI). and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC)., they said. Those trading richest versus the models included  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc., Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) Corp. and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., they said.

(Reuters) - A stock rebound marked by Wall Street's strongest quarter in more than two decades has slowed in recent weeks, as a resurgence in coronavirus cases threatens to derail the economy's recovery from a deep downturn. 
With the S&P 500 up 18% in the quarter ending on Tuesday and just 10% below its February record high, investors are parsing an array of factors that could weigh on stocks in the months ahead, including potential delays in reopening parts of the U.S. economy and sky-high stock valuations. 
(Graphic: Soaring stocks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgolgzvq/Pasted%20image%201593450985927.png) 
The S&P 500's strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 1998 -- during the dot-com boom -- was driven by gains in April and May, followed by an overall flat June after Wall Street gave back gains in the second half of the month. Globally, MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) has rallied to within 10% of its February record highs.

After new cases of the coronavirus trended lower in May, they climbed again in June, denting investors' enthusiasm that the U.S. economy would recovery relatively quickly from the crisis. Investor enthusiasm had been driven in part by recent economic data that were better than expected.
(Graphic: COVID-19's growing potential economic impact, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbmoyevq/Pasted%20image%201593451205707.png) 
A spike in virus infections in Southern and Western states last week spooked investors. Florida, Texas, California and Arizona, which were the top four states with the most new cases, account for nearly a third of U.S. economic output. California's government on Sunday ordered bars in several counties to close due to the coronavirus rebound, while San Francisco put plans to reopen businesses on hold.
Much of Wall Street's gains in recent months has been driven by the trillions of dollars in stimulus from Congress and the Federal Reserve and by investors' confidence that the Fed is prepared to take additional measures to support the economy and financial markets. 
Still, the rally has exacerbated some investor concerns, including the high stock valuations. The S&P 500's forward price/earnings ratio, a closely followed valuation metric, now stands at 22, its highest level since the dot-com boom.
(Graphic: S&P 500 forward PE hits dot-com high, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmgaozpr/SPX%20PE.jpg) 
Driving much of Wall Street's strong second-quarter were shares of companies benefiting from the millions of people staying home. Amazon (O:AMZN) and other retailers with a strong online presence outperformed. Major technology companies with strong balance sheets and the resources to weather a deep economic downturn have also been favored by investors.
(Graphic: Amazon and tech drove Wall St's gains in Q2, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqeyjzpx/FGHEd-amazon-and-tech-drive-wall-street-s-recovery.png) 
With yields on Treasuries tumbling in recent months due to uncertainty about the pandemic, dividends stood out as an additional reason to buy stocks. At nearly 2%, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 remains attractive compared to the 10-year Treasury, at 0.63%. 
(Graphic: S&P 500 dividends vs Treasuries, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjlnkmpr/Div%20Yield.jpg) 
However, the outlook for dividends has worsened. After S&P 500 dividends hit a record high $127 billion in the first quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, several companies have suspended or cut their dividends. Last week, the Fed capped bank dividends and barred banks' share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter due to uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.

""We have turned neutral on equities on a strategic horizon given the challenging backdrop for earnings and dividend payouts,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said in its 2020 Midyear Investment Outlook.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - As many bankers fled Italy's financial capital for second homes in the mountains or lakes at the start of a coronavirus lockdown in March, Victor Massiah rushed instead to rent a house within walking distance of UBI Banca's Milan offices. 
And that is where the 61-year-old CEO has since spent most of his waking hours, battling not only to pull the bank through a pandemic that devastated its core areas in Italy's industrial north, but also to see off a takeover he opposes. 
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) CEO Carlo Messina sprang the bid onUBI days before the coronavirus outbreak, seeking a deal he hopes will hasten a wave of European consolidation that the European Central Bank has been calling for. 
And what would be the biggest bank takeover in Europe for more than a decade is now approaching a finale, with Intesa's offer to UBI shareholders set to run from July 6 to July 28.
The bid needs the approval of at least 50% of UBI investors plus one share to be valid, a control threshold which the ECB cleared earlier this month. 
But while markets have priced in the deal going ahead, Massiah is firmly against UBI being a takeover target and he is banking on small investors, whose choice will be critical. 
Instead he wants UBI, which was itself formed by a merger of local banks in 2007, to instigate any deal-making.
Following aborted efforts in recent years to negotiate deals involving rivals Banco BPM and Monte dei Paschi, only weeks before Intesa's incursion, Massiah had tried but failed to clinch a merger with smaller peer BPER Banca, a person involved in the talks said. 
Since Messina informed him of the offer with a late-night call in mid-February, Massiah has been working with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on an alternative plan, with the backing of local shareholders, many of which are long-standing small business customers of UBI and say the bid undervalues their bank. 
UBI investor Domenico Bosatelli, owner of Bergamo-basedelectric components maker Gewiss, has said that while the offer makes sense for Intesa and strengthens its competitiveness, it does not for UBI, as its ""mission would disappear"".
While institutional investors holding 40-50% of UBI sharesare largely expected to back the deal, attracted by the prospect of bigger dividends, it is the bank's core investors that willdecide whether Intesa secures more than its minimum goal.
Sources close to UBI say its retail customers, who accountfor 15-20% of its share capital, may decide to hold ontostock which has been handed down over generations. 
This is despite many analysts saying it would make littlesense for UBI investors to shun Intesa's bid, which was at a 24%premium to UBI's share price on the day it was announced. 
Although the premium has since evaporated, analystssay UBI shares would likely tank if the bid fell through. 
Local dynasties like the Bombassei family, owner ofBergamo-based brake maker Brembo, or the Beretta family ofgunmakers belong, like Bosatelli, to the CAR shareholder pactwhich holds 19% of UBI and calls Intesa's bid ""unacceptable"". 
A smaller group with 1.6% of UBI shares also opposes theoffer, while a bigger one holding 7.7% has not expressed a view. 
CHARM OFFENSIVE 
Prevented by takeover rules from mounting an active defence, UBI has sought to challenge Intesa in court and with regulators, saying it is solely interested in taking out a competitor. 
Despite its ties with a chronically stagnant economy,Italy's second largest bank boasts one of the highest payouts inEurope thanks to lean costs, a focus on fees earned throughwealth management and insurance and deals such as therecent sale of its retailers' payments business. 
To defuse UBI's legal threat, Intesa has waived a clausethat would have given it a right to walk away due to thecoronavirus crisis, making it harder to back out. 
Intesa has also responded with a charm offensive that hasseen executives interviewed by tiny regional papers in theshareholder heartlands and meet with local authorities.
It has pledged to provide an extra 10 billion euros a year in credit to UBI's core areas and keep lending decisions largely local, while rushing to donate to local institutionsin its target's stricken Bergamo and Brescia provinces.
""We've publicly committed to lending and social initiatives on a scale that UBI simply can't match. Local investors will value both the economic and community benefits of our offer,"" said a spokesman for Intesa, which has also enlisted the services of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) as its leading adviser.
The Milanese power broker has underwritten a cash call for BPER Banca in a parallel deal which Intesa struck for antitrust purposes. And as Generali (MI:GASI)'s main investor, Mediobanca has also backed a capital injection by the insurer at rival Cattolica. 
This may assist Intesa's bid given Cattolica and one ofits leading shareholders are members of the CAR investor group, two people familiar with the matter said. Cattolica and its Fondazione Banca del Monte di Lombardia declined to comment. 
Italy's market watchdog has cleared the bid prospectus pending a pivotal antitrust ruling due only in late July.
Intesa has vowed to hit profit goals even if a low take-up stops it from merging with UBI, curbing cost cuts.
Yet such an ending may not provide the best remedy for Italy's fragmented banking sector, said Stefano Caselli, banking and finance professor at Milan's Bocconi University. 

""An outcome that prevented Intesa from incorporating UBIwould weaken the rationale for the deal and lessen itsadvantages for both the banks involved and the system as awhole,"" Caselli said.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Airbus set to announce thousands of job cuts, unions say","By Julie Rimbert and Johanna Decorse
TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Airbus is set to announce on Tuesday a restructuring involving thousands of job cuts as it deals with the fallout from impact of the coronavirus crisis, union officials said.
Airbus, which has said it will announce fresh action by the end of July after introducing temporary furloughs, declined to comment. Its shares rose 1%.
Reuters reported on Monday that the company's bigger-ever plan to shrink operations and staff was imminent.
Industry sources have predicted between 14,000 and 20,000 job cuts, though it remains unclear how much will be achieved through early retirements in Airbus's 135,000-strong workforce, heavily populated by veterans of its original A320 development.
Unions oppose the cuts.
""Airbus will announce measures that could have strong employment consequences,"" CGT union official Xavier Petrachi said, adding the union would oppose outright redundancies.
The health of the group is on the agenda for a European works council being held on Tuesday.
The company will brief unions on the status of orders and aircraft cancellations as it prepares to keep production lower than previously planned for up to five years.
Exceptional secrecy surrounds the politically sensitive restructuring affecting jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, the company's key backers in a fierce contest with U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) for orders and industrial clout.
Airbus is expected to juggle its response to the industry's worst crisis with pressure to keep cuts to a minimum after France and Germany announced plans to support aerospace.
Michel Pierre, representing the CFDT union at Airbus, said Airbus had refused direct state intervention in its capital, upholding corporate governance reforms in 2013. Compulsory sackings would therefore be ""totally unacceptable,"" he said.
Industry sources say Airbus is basing the restructuring on a 40% drop in underlying aircraft production for two years.
The company's programmes chief, meanwhile, said it was slowing a push into high-margin services as a result of a slump in air travel but maintaining its diversification strategy.

Some industry sources say Airbus has all but abandoned a goal of more than doubling services revenue to $10 billion this decade and transferred some staff to other roles.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Life  Aberdeen (SLA) (L:SLA) Chief Executive Keith Skeoch will step down after five years at the helm and former Citi executive Stephen Bird will replace him, the British asset manager said on Tuesday. 
The announcement marks the end of a 14-year career as an SLA director for Skeoch, during which he oversaw the 2017 merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management to create one of Britain's biggest fund managers.
His period as CEO, a job he originally shared with former Aberdeen chief Martin Gilbert, has not always been smooth.
Heavy underperformance in the year after the merger drew criticism from some investors, something Chairman Douglas Flint looked to respond to quickly after joining the company last year, ditching the co-CEO structure and ultimately paving the way for Gilbert to leave the firm.
""With integration well progressed and having built significant balance sheet strength, this appointment launches the next phase of evolution aimed at developing and expanding the revenue opportunities available to SLA,"" the company said.
At 0912 GMT, SLA's shares were up 3.3% in a weaker FTSE 100 (FTSE).
""I was a little surprised by this news,"" said Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services. ""That said, they always described the integration of the two businesses as a 3-year journey and that is now at an end.""
Bird will join the board as CEO-designate on July 1 and Skeoch will serve out the remainder of his contract, which runs until July 2021, as non-executive chairman of Aberdeen Standard Investments Research Institute.
""The current crisis has highlighted the importance of active asset management as well as building greater resilience into personal financial planning,"" Bird said.
""SLA's leading asset management, platforms and wealth capabilities give great scope to help clients and customers navigate these challenges; this is what attracted me to the company.""
SLA said it expected the transition to take place by the end of the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval.
Bird spent 21 years at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and most recently served as CEO of its Global Consumer Banking business from 2015 to November 2019. 
Prior to that, he was CEO for Citigroup's Asia Pacific business, including India and China.

""He is an inspiring leader with a great track record and experience in leading businesses to harness digital technology to improve both productivity and the client and customer experience,"" said Flint.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has postponed its target of building a $10 billion services business amid the coronavirus crisis, but is sticking with a strategy of supporting airline operations, a senior executive said as the company heads for a broader shake-up.
Airbus (PA:AIR) has said it wants to boost services revenues to $10 billion by 2030 compared with over $4 billion in 2019, mirroring a push by rival Boeing (N:BA).
But the coronavirus travel crisis has hit demand for services such as spare parts and maintenance data-crunching.
""It is postponing the ambition a little in terms of timing, but the strategy is still relevant. We still think developing services makes sense,"" Philippe Mhun, executive vice-president programmes and services, told Reuters.
""It is still a scale we can look for, but it is a question of timing and how this crisis will transform our industry, and it's too early to say,"" he said of the $10 billion target.
Industry sources say Airbus has effectively dropped the goal and is restructuring its services business, re-allocating some staff elsewhere. Wider job cuts are also imminent.
""Aircraft are being grounded and this impacts services as much as the aircraft (manufacturing) business. Some (services) projects were paused and postponed,"" Mhun said, adding Airbus was being more cautious about inventory of parts.
Despite cash pressures, Airbus is pursuing plans to build the world's longest-range narrow-body plane, the A321XLR. 
""This is a project we have really protected. It is performing as per the initial plan,"" with first flight in 2022 and entry to service in 2023, Mhun said.
Engineering sources say the project to expand fuel capacity and therefore range by installing a special tank is challenging. 
Getting the design right is essential to ensuring the plane - a key weapon in the contest with Boeing - does not fall short on promised range.
Also prioritised are plans to put more seats in the A350, drawing on part of an A350-2000 variant that was never built.
Sources say the ""Step 7"" project aims to reduce a size gap between the A350-900 and larger but shorter-range Boeing 787-10.
Airbus has cut monthly A350 output by 36% to six due to weak sector demand, sending the programme back into loss and raising questions whether Airbus should revive plans, previously rejected, to redesign some parts to cut production costs.
Such ""design-to-cost"" modifications require re-investment.
""If there are some design-to-cost activities that make sense from a business standpoint we will do it, but our focus today is more on going down to (the new rate) and finding the right cost reductions,"" Mhun said.
He rejected suggestions that Airbus is over-dependent on the A350-900, which has 80% of orders for the two-variant A350.
""I am really comfortable that after weathering the crisis the combination of A350-900 and -1000 will bring a lot of value to the market,"" he said.
Mhun defended the A330neo, an upgraded model pitched as a low-priced entry point to wide-body operations for airlines not needing the newer A350, but which has patchy orders.

""We need to be ready for when we experience a demand ramp-up. We have a good aircraft, a (low-cost) aircraft, a reliable aircraft. I see a good future for the A330,"" Mhun said.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Coronavirus strikes down global M&A as companies keep their distance,"By Joshua Franklin and Pamela Barbaglia
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global M&A activity tumbled to its lowest level in more than a decade in the second quarter, according to data provider Refinitiv, as companies gave up on expansion plans to focus on protecting their balance sheets and employees in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Chief executives were reluctant to explore transformative deals without more certainty about the financial outlook of their companies, deal advisers said. Instead, they seized on favorable financing conditions to raise capital by selling stock and borrowing cheaply, driving equity and debt issuance to record highs. 
""It was the quarter for capital market activity. Companies are making sure their balance sheets are strong and durable for what comes next,"" said Michael Carr, global M&A co-head at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
Global M&A totaled $485.3 billion in the second quarter, down 55% from a year ago and its lowest since the third quarter of 2009, according to Refinitiv. This was based on 8,272 deals, the lowest quarterly number since the third quarter of 2004.
Most of the decline was driven by the United States, where M&A plunged 85% from year-earlier levels to $94.3 billion as U.S. coronavirus cases surged. It marked the first time since the third quarter of 2009 that United States has not led the rankings.
Europe and Asia saw more modest declines of less than 10%, to $182 billion and $150 billion respectively.
Dealmakers said the economic uncertainty wrought by the pandemic had curtailed the ability of many companies to initiate and successfully complete M&A negotiations. 
""The main challenge to get deals done is that buyers have to be prepared to pay a full price while the current business performance is still well below pre-COVID-19 level,"" said JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co global co-head of M&A Dirk Albersmeier.
The biggest deals of the quarter came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) agreed last month to merge their British businesses, Virgin Media and O2, in a $38 billion deal that will create a powerhouse in mobile and broadband.
National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia’s biggest lender, said last week it would buy smaller lender Samba Financial Group for as much as $15.6 billion. 
""Many of the deals you see now are between companies that already knew each other or were talking before the pandemic,"" said Andrew Bednar, co-president of investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP.
European food-ordering firm Just Eat Takeaway.com NV this month agreed to buy U.S. peer Grubhub Inc in a $7.3 billion all-stock deal - one of only a few cross-border deals inked in the quarter.
""Doing cross-border deals requires a level of confidence and optimism that has taken a knock this year, especially when it comes to transactions across continents,"" said Nick O'Donnell, a partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. 
Even as some deals were announced, others that had been signed but were not yet completed, unraveled.
Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), the biggest U.S. mall operator, said this month it was ending its $3.6 billion deal to buy Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO) Inc, citing the beating the retail sector has taken during the coronavirus outbreak.
Last month, private equity firm Sycamore Partners ended its $525 million deal to acquire lingerie brand Victoria's Secret from L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB), while Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp dropped its agreement to fund a $3 billion tender offer for additional shares in co-working company WeWork.
""It does require more courage to do a deal in this environment. You need a CEO with a lot of credibility with investors, and they need to be doing something very strategic,"" said JPMorgan global M&A co-head Anu Aiyengar.
GRADUAL RETURN OF APPETITE
Some dealmakers say they are seeing a gradual pick-up in M&A activity as companies adapt to a post-coronavirus reality. 
""Right now we are seeing significant pick-up in client dialogue, just in the past three to four weeks,"" said Goldman Sachs global M&A co-head Dusty Philip.
""Many of our clients are starting to think big and outside of the box, asking themselves what has changed and how do I adjust my strategic priorities to reflect the pandemic we have all been living through.""
Companies and their advisers are also getting accustomed to negotiating and carrying out due diligence digitally. 
""Nearly all of the management presentations and expert sessions - from a diligence standpoint - are being done by video conference. That is true for most board meetings. We are also seeing companies employ drones and (camera crews) filming in place of site visits for due diligence,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) head of global M&A Patrick Ramsey.
While many companies are struggling to regain their footing, some have taken advantage of advances in technological innovation and are poised to emerge from the downturn stronger and with an appetite to pursue acquisitions, dealmakers said.

""The companies that survive the crisis will largely be those with balance sheet and cash flow strength which position them to be industry consolidators,"" said Cary Kochman, global co-head of M&A at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) investor Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) said it has questions about the bank's support for China's new security law for Hong Kong, the second investor in Europe's biggest bank in recent weeks to voice concerns about the lender's stance. 
""We expect companies to support improvements in protections for citizens and not back their removal,"" said Roland Bosch, lead engager for financial services at Federated Hermes's stewardship and engagement team. 
The new law could have an adverse impact on human rights, he said.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, another leading HSBC shareholder, said earlier this month it was uneasy about the bank's show of public support for the law. 
China's parliament passed the new national security legislation for Hong Kong on Tuesday, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony's way of life since it returned to Chinese rule 23 years ago. 
Details of the law are due out later on Tuesday, amid fears the legislation will crush the global financial hub's freedoms and reports that the heaviest penalty under it would be life imprisonment.
Senior politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have criticised HSBC's stance. 

The bank's Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Peter Wong signed a petition backing the law earlier this month, which also drew ire from human rights groups.

722,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Shell Takes Another Massive Hit From Pandemic,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The bell tolled again for Big Oil on Tuesday as Royal Dutch Shell said it would write down its assets by as much as $22 billion in the second quarter to reflect expectations of a lasting hit to oil and gas prices from the pandemic.
The news comes only a couple of months after the Anglo-Dutch giant cut its dividend for the first time since World War 2. It again underlines the risk that much of its asset portfolio may never be economically viable again, given the determination of many governments to ‘build back better’ after the pandemic, i.e., to use the crisis to accelerate the transition to low-carbon fuels.
There’s a certain irony, then, in the fact that Shell’s gas portfolio is taking the biggest hit, at between $8 billion and $9 billion. The company had paid top dollar to bolster its position in gas only four years ago with the acquisition of BG Group, believing that it was destined to displace both coal and liquids in the global energy mix.
The gas impairments will affect mostly its assets in Australia, which are in essence a play on future Asian demand.
By contrast, the upstream portfolio will be written down by ‘only’ $4 billion to $6 billion. That will affect mainly its operations in Brazil and its shale assets in the U.S.  The downstream assets will be written down by between $3 billion and $7 billion.
While the company has stuck to its long-term oil price forecast of $60 a barrel, it believes that average prices won’t return to that level until 2023. For the current year, it sees prices averaging $35, rising to $40 a barrel next year and $50 in 2022.  Shell also expects refining margins to be 30% lower on average over the long term than it had expected before the pandemic.
Ominously, having cut its precious dividend and suspended share buybacks to preserve its balance sheet, Shell said on Tuesday that it still expects gearing (net debt relative to total capital) to rise by  much as three percentage points.
 Royal Dutch Shell A  (LON:RDSa) shares fell 2.9% in London on the news, despite the fact that the market has already wiped over $100 billion off the company’s valuation this year in anticipation of exactly such moves. It’s down by 41% year-to-date, underperforming not only the benchmark FTSE 100, but also the Stoxx Oil and Gas index, which is down only 31%.  
While the challenges of the pandemic and de-carbonization affect all companies in the sector, that underperformance suggests the market is losing confidence in Shell’s historic ability to at least deliver best-in-class returns, epitomized by the now-reduced dividend.  
Rival BP (NYSE:BP) was able to boast after its $5 billion deal to sell its petrochemicals business to Ineos on Monday that it was at least ahead of schedule in meeting its target for asset disposals. Shell, by contrast, still seems wedded to scale: it said no word of intentions to slim down any further in its release on Tuesday. Until it can shed the assets in greatest danger of being stranded, the risk of being perceived as behind the curve seems likely to grow."
723,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Cerberus wants well over 7,000 Commerzbank job cuts: source","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Cerberus wants Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) to cut far more than a reported 7,000 jobs as part of plans by Germany's second biggest bank to reduce costs, a person familiar with the matter said.
The U.S. activist investor, one of Commerzbank's largest shareholders with a stake of more than 5%, has been pressing for big changes, with a dramatic restructuring a concern for German banking unions.
Cerberus plans to present Commerzbank with a ""succinct view"" on measures it should take on headcount and other moves in the coming weeks, the person said on condition of anonymity, adding that job cuts should be ""definitely beyond"" 7,000.
A spokeswoman for Commerzbank, which at the end of 2019 employed around 48,500 workers, plans to announce details of cost-cutting measures by August at the latest, said:
""Currently, different options and scenarios are being discussed. No decisions have been taken.""
Commerzbank's supervisory board was set to discuss the possibility of a further 7,000 redundancies, in addition to the more than 4,000 job cuts announced last autumn, the business daily newspaper Boersen-Zeitung reported on Tuesday.
""A strategy that is influenced by Cerberus is definitely not in the interest of employees,"" said Stefan Wittmann, who represents labour on the supervisory board and is an official at Germany's Verdi union.
Citing finance industry sources, Boersen-Zeitung said Commerzbank, under pressure from shareholders over its strategy and leadership, was now considering closing 400 of its 1,000 German offices, or double the number previously mentioned.
A meeting of Commerzbank's supervisory board planned for Wednesday will not take place as worker representatives wanted to have time to study documents detailing proposals by the bank and these had not been provided, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported.

Cerberus sought to invoke quicker change at Commerzbank, which rejected its demand for two supervisory board seats.

(Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Tuesday, with banks and energy firms leading the losses at the end of a strong quarter, while UK markets took a hit from a worse-than-expected GDP reading.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) looked set to post a more than 12% rise in the quarter - its best since March 2019 - as unprecedented stimulus, hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine and relatively fewer virus cases in Europe powered a rebound from March lows. 
Still, the index is down 13.6% for the year. 
Asian stocks gained after data showed China's factory activity expanded at a stronger pace in June as the government lifted lockdowns and stepped up investment, helping the exporter-heavy German DAX (GDAXI) rise in early trade.
Chipmakers STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies (DE:IFXGn), ASM International (AS:ASMI) rose between 1.9% and 3.6% following an upbeat revenue forecast from U.S.-based Micron Technology (O:MU).
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell about half a percent, with banks (SX7P) and oil & gas firms (SXEP) falling more than 1.5%. 
""The biggest quarterly drop in UK GDP in more than a generation helped contribute to a downbeat feel for the markets,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""Combined with the warning from the World Health Organisation that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was yet to come, it's easy to see why investors would be feeling nervous."" 
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday the pandemic is not even close to being over, with many U.S. states marking a record spike in new COVID-19 infections. 
UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) underperformed as data showed Britain's economy shrank by the most since 1979 in the first quarter of 2020 as households slashed their spending.
Also weighing on the blue-chip index, Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) fell 2.1% after saying it would write down the value of its assets by up to $22 billion after lowering its long-term outlook on oil and gas prices.
Investors will focus on testimony by the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later in the day for hints on more U.S. stimulus.

Todd Hohn, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, was detained in September in the southern city of Guangzhou after he piloted a FedEx freighter aircraft. Chinese authorities said at the time they had found suspected air gun pellets in his luggage.
Hohn ""on June 27, 2020 departed Guangzhou, China and has reunited with his loving family,"" his lawyer Theodore Simon said in a statement sent to Reuters on Tuesday.
""After this lengthy legal process, his innocence was demonstrated and ultimately recognised,"" he said.
Hohn had remained free on bail since 2019 and it was officially determined that no formal criminal charges would be brought against him.
""It should be noted that Todd, despite the ordeal, states he was treated with courtesy and respect and holds no animosity towards China, the authorities or the people of China and looks forward to returning there one day.""
Hohn's detention occurred at a time when U.S. delivery giant FedEx had become one of the most high-profile corporate brands to get caught up in the U.S.-China trade dispute and other frictions.
The Memphis-based company had last year been the target of Chinese ire over shipping mistakes involving several packages, including parcels addressed to China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which Washington has put on an export blacklist.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>",Shell to write down as much as $22 billion after coronavirus hit,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the energy price outlook.
The Anglo-Dutch company has already been preparing a major overhaul after CEO Ben van Beurden laid out plans in April to reduce Shell's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.
Global travel restrictions to prevent the virus spreading affected more than 4 billion people at one point, taking cars off the roads and grounding planes, driving down fuel demand.
Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, said it expected a 40% drop in sales in the second quarter from a year earlier to about 4 million barrels per day (bpd), although that is more than its earlier prediction of a drop to 3.5 million bpd.
In its update before second-quarter results on July 30, Shell said upstream oil and gas production was expected to average 2.35 million bpd in the three months to June, down from 2.71 million bpd in the first quarter.
Shell, which has a market value of $126.5 billion, said it would take an aggregate post-tax impairment charge of $15 billion to $22 billion in the second quarter.
Its shares were down 2% by 0820 GMT.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Thomas Adolff said the second quarter would be the toughest for many companies and Shell had sent a ""wake up call.""
Shell's move follows  BP 's (L:BP) decision to wipe off up to $17.5 billion from its assets, as it responds to the coronavirus crisis and shifts to low-carbon energy.
Shell responded to the epidemic by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War Two and cutting spending in 2020 to a maximum of $20 billion from $25 billion. It aims to announce its restructuring plan by the end of 2020.
Graphic: Shell Q2 fuel sales https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnpwwakypw/Pasted%20image%201593497604954.png 
LOWER PRICES
Shell reduced its expected average benchmark Brent crude price for 2020 to $35 a barrel from $60, and cut its 2021 and 2022 forecasts to $40 and $50, respectively, also down from $60. 
Shell said its long-term oil price outlook was now $60. That compares to BP which cut its long-term Brent forecast to $55 from $70, while other rivals still have higher projections.
The Anglo-Dutch group cut its long-term refining profit margin outlook by 30% and set its long-term natural gas price at $3 per million British Thermal Units (BTUs).
Shell's integrated gas business will account for $8 billion to $9 billion of the writedowns, while the upstream division will account for $4 billion to $6 billion. Downstream refining and marketing will account for another $3 billion to $7 billion.
The impairments will raise Shell's debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, by 3%. Gearing stood at 28.9% at the end of March.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",BMW to source battery cells produced using renewable energy,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) on Tuesday said its electric cars will use battery cells produced using renewable energy, a step which will compel the biggest suppliers to source more non-coal generated electricity.
""We now have a contractual agreement with our cell manufacturers that they will use only green power to produce our fifth generation battery cells,"" BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said on an interview published on the company's website. 
Last year, BMW ordered more than 10 billion euros' ($11.07 billion) worth of battery cells from Chinese battery cell maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) (SZ:300750) and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400).
CATL is building a battery cell production plant in Erfurt, Germany, and has said it aims to produce 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) worth of cells a year from 2026 onwards.
BMW is preparing to launch the electric BMW iX3 this year, and the BMW iNEXT and BMW i4 next year. 

As production volumes of electric BMW cars increase, the use of green power will save around 10 million tonnes of CO2 over the next decade, BMW said, adding that this is equivalent to the annual carbon dioxide emissions produced by a city of over a million inhabitants.

Investing.com - European stock markets consolidated Tuesday, helped by healthy manufacturing data out of China but weighed down by mounting concerns about the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Losses in oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) dragged the FTSE 100 lower.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.1%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.5%.
Early Tuesday, China's official purchasing managers' index showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy grew for a fourth straight month in June, offering hope that the global economic recovery is still on course despite the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
This followed on from Monday’s strong U.S. housing data, which helped Wall Street post substantial gains overnight.
That said, deaths from the Covid-19 virus have surpassed 500,000 worldwide and confirmed cases have exceeded 10 million in the six months since the World Health Organization became aware of the novel coronavirus. 
And the “worst is yet to come” given a lack of global solidarity, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Geneva Monday. 
Dragging the FTSE 100 even lower was the news that Royal Dutch Shell will write down the value of its assets by up to $22 billion after lowering its long-term outlook on oil and gas prices.
Shell carries a significant weighting in the index, and its stock price dropped 1.7%.
Adding to the uncertainty, China is reported to have approved a contentious law that would allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activity in Hong Kong. This could prompt trade restrictions with the U.S., and potentially other western countries, increasing tensions between the two superpowers.
Turning back to Europe, euro area flash consumer inflation for June is due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), while French private consumption showed a strong rebound in June.
In other corporate news, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) stock climbed 5.8% after it notified Boeing (NYSE:BA) that it will cancel a deal to buy nearly 100 remaining planes, and is suing over losses related to the grounding of the 737-Max and 787 engine issues.
Wirecard stock jumped 82% from very low levels after the U.K.'s regulator lifted the suspension on the troubled company's U.K. operations that it imposed last week.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, amid concerns that the second wave of coronavirus cases will hit demand for fuel as well as signs that Libya may be able to break a six-month blockade on its exports caused by the country's civil war.
Eyes will be on inventories data due on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute industry group, and from the U.S. government on Wednesday.

Carriers globally added 8.2 million seats to schedules for this week, a 21% jump from the previous week, analyst John Grant said. India and Europe saw strong growth as many major airlines -- including IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., and Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc -- raised capacity.
“The arrival of July and the summer season has a feeling of optimism at last for the aviation industry,” Grant wrote in his weekly blog. “Talk of travel corridors from the U.K. over the weekend resulted in a surge of booking activity.”
Grant cautioned that there could be a high rate of cancellations, however, as airlines wait for demand to respond to the increased seat numbers.
Some regional markets have capacity back to at least 25% of their levels in January, and the overall number of scheduled seats is 41% of the same week last year, Grant said.
China has bounced back from the lockdown in Beijing, with nearly 1 million seats added this week, he said. Chinese domestic capacity is 86% of pre-pandemic levels.

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>","U.S. Stocks Have ‘Considerable’ Upside, History Suggests to Leuthold","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock gains from the late-March bottom are in line with previous new bull markets, which could assuage concerns that the market has risen too far too quickly, according to the Leuthold Group LLC.
A comparison with the early stages of bull markets in 1982, 1987, 2003 and 2009 -- selected because they followed bear markets with declines of 30% or more -- shows similarities to the current period -- and particularly to 1982 and 2009, Leuthold strategist James Paulsen wrote in a note June 29.
The sharp rebound in equities in the second quarter has stoked anxiety about a disconnect with the likelihood of a long path to recoup economic losses from the coronavirus. Even so, history shows the S&P 500 started climbing in the 1982 and 2009 episodes when the economy was still many months away from making up for prior contractions.
“There is potential for considerable upside in the coming year,” Paulsen wrote. “It is worth noting the similarity of today’s rally to past bull markets, which provided investors with additional healthy returns.”
The S&P 500 has rallied 36% from its low at the March 23 close. That gain has prompted some strategists to recommend paring back on risk as valuations rise, though others cite everything from big cash piles on the sidelines to a continued “fear of missing out” as reasons the advances should continue.
Paulsen cautioned that investors should expect “frequent and sometimes substantial” corrections along the way, and recommended planning to exploit continued volatility ahead. But over a longer horizon, he sees a strong argument for further gains.
“In the near-term, the S&P 500 could decline by about 5% to reach the average bull market at this point of the run,” Paulsen said. “However, if stocks continue to trace the average of the past four bull markets represented in this analysis, they could deliver a +14% total return in the coming year, and almost +27% over the next two years (assuming a 2% dividend return).”

735,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Joshua Wong Quits Party Ahead of China Law: Hong Kong Update,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong was bracing for China to hand down sweeping security legislation, as the U.S. took steps to roll back special trading privileges that help maintain the former British colony’s status as an international commercial hub.
China’s top legislative body approved the measure at the end of three-day meeting in Beijing. Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, declined to comment on the legislation, much of which wasn’t immediately released to the public. She did, however, hit back at the U.S., saying that Hong Kong wouldn’t be “scared” by threat of sanctions.
The national security law was expected to take effect by Wednesday -- the 23rd anniversary of the city’s return to China and a day usually marked by mass protests. The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy demonstrations, was expecting an appeals hearing later Tuesday against a police decision to ban the march. Activist Joshua Wong quit his political party.
Key Developments:
Here’s the latest (all times local):
Joshua Wong quits his political party (11:14 a.m.)
Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong announced on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that he would withdraw from Demosisto, the Hong Kong political party he founded, and continue activism in his personal capacity. While Wong didn’t say why he was quitting the group, he said activists needed faced a grim fate after the security law’s passage, citing concerns the measure could lead to in prison or even extradition to the mainland.
Other founding members of the group, including Nathan Law, Agnes Chow and Jeffrey Ngo, also announced their withdrawal from the party.
Law to take effect soon (10:50 a.m.)
The Hong Kong government planned to publish the national security law Tuesday for it to take effect the same day, the Ming Pao newspaper reported, without citing anyone. The Chinese government in Beijing will hold a news briefing later Tuesday to discuss the decision, Ming Pao said.
Separately, Broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong reported that the legislation would take effect Wednesday.
Pompeo blasts visa threat (10:45 a.m.)
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo hit back at Beijing’s imposition of visa restrictions for Americans who “behave badly in Hong Kong affairs,” saying it was China’s crackdown on the former British colony that prompted Washington to “retool its relationship with the territory.”
“The Chinese Communist Party’s threats to retaliate by restricting visas for U.S. citizens exposes once again how Beijing refuses to take responsibility for its own choices,” Pompeo said in a statement.
Lam declines to comment on law (10 a.m.)
“The National People’s Congress is still in a meeting and on the agenda today there’s the relevant national security law for Hong Kong,” Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters at a weekly briefing minutes after news of the law’s passing broke. “At this moment it is inappropriate for me to respond to any questions or give any explanations.”
Lam -- who has publicly defended the measure -- did acknowledge there were many concerns about the legislation. She also said she wasn’t scared by the threat of U.S. sanctions. “We are not going to be deterred by such actions,” she said.
Law approved, media reports (9:35 a.m.)
Hong Kong media, including Now TV, the South China Morning Post and others, reported that China’s top legislative body -- the National People’s Congress Standing Committee -- had unanimously approved the security law for Hong Kong at the end of a three-day meeting in Beijing. Much of the legislation remained secret and details weren’t immediately released.
Trump administration takes action (5:03 a.m.)
The Trump administration made it harder to export sensitive American technology to Hong Kong, suspending regulations allowing special treatment to the territory over dual-use technologies like carbon fiber used to make both golf clubs and missile components.
“With the Chinese Communist Party’s imposition of new security measures on Hong Kong, the risk that sensitive U.S. technology will be diverted to the People’s Liberation Army or Ministry of State Security has increased, all while undermining the territory’s autonomy,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, providing little detail on specific impacts.

HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Arnott's, maker of Tim Tam biscuits and other snacks, is shedding about 50 staff, a representative told Reuters, the first such cuts since U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) bought one of Australia's best-known brands last year.
Arnott's, which also makes Monte Carlo, Mint Slice and SAO biscuits, had made management changes which meant ""a small number of employees will be departing our business"", a spokeswoman said, without disclosing which positions were being cut.
The cuts would give Arnott's the ""right organisational structure to ensure its success as a stand-alone company"", the spokeswoman said in an email.
The cuts would involve about 2% of the workforce, she added, equating to roughly 48 of the company's 2,400 employees.
The move comes a year after KKR bought Arnott's from  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) as part of a $2.2 billion deal that also included the U.S. snack giant's international and ""fresh"" units. [https://reut.rs/2BNIRGo]
Buyout specialists such as KKR routinely cut costs of portfolio companies to improve profitability and prepare for resale in periods of typically four years.
KKR declined to comment on Arnott's job cuts.
Arnott's has factories in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane and has been foreign-owned since the 1990s.

The spokeswoman said the 155-year-old company ""must re-adjust and build its capabilities in order to remain competitive against overseas exports and continue to grow"".

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.47% by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 1.50%, boosted by the country reporting a better-than-expected manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index of 50.9 for June. The figure indicates a second consecutive month of growth, with May’s manufacturing PMI of 50.6.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 0.91%, retreating slightly from earlier gains after the National People’s Congress Standing committee passed national security laws for the city earlier in the day. Investors will be monitoring the U.S. reaction, with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saying on Wednesday that the U.S. would suspend preferential treatment regulations for Hong Kong, which include export license exceptions.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.59%. The country’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported a drop of 8.4% month-on-month in May’s industrial production earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.38% and Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 1.46%.
The positive data from China was balanced with ever-rising COVID-19 numbers. Over 10.2 million cases globally as of June 30 according to Johns Hopkins University, and there is no forthcoming cure.
“It’s not clear what trajectory coronavirus is heading... but I also think because we’re into quarter-end, there’s been some re-balancing. So I’m kind of in the camp that any weakness is short-lived.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority are collaborating with the Singapore Police Force’s Commercial Affairs Department, which already has an ongoing criminal investigation into Wirecard, the MAS said in a statement late Monday.
“MAS has been in touch with relevant financial institutions to determine if there had been any abuse of Singapore’s financial system for illicit purposes,” it said. “We will take firm action if we find evidence of criminal behavior or serious lapses in anti-money laundering controls.”
Wirecard filed for court protection from creditors in Germany last week following revelations that 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) was missing from its balance sheet. The MAS has told Wirecard’s local entities to ensure that all customer funds from its domestic payments processing business in Singapore are kept in local banks.
“MAS requires financial institutions to report all suspicious transactions, including transactions that are large, complex or present unusual patterns with no apparent economic or lawful purposes,” it said.
Singapore is home to Wirecard’s Asia-Pacific headquarters and the company has been expanding aggressively in the region. Its primary business activities in the country are to process payments for merchants and help companies issue prepaid cards.
Last year, Singapore police raided Wirecard’s local offices after an employee in the city-state alleged that a member of the company’s finance team engaged in accounting breaches.
The probe by the CAD -- the police’s financial crimes office -- began in February 2019 and is “extensive and ongoing,” the MAS said in the statement. The monetary and accounting authorities will work with the CAD to examine “other possible aspects of the case,” it said. Authorities have reached out to counterparts abroad and stand ready to assist them.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",Japan's fussy food shoppers finally go online amid pandemic,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus has forced Japan's notoriously fussy food shoppers to abandon doubts about online grocery stores, sending retailers such as Aeon Co (T:8267) scrambling to meet a surge in delivery demand.
Although Japanese shoppers aren't alone in going online during the outbreak, the shift is remarkable for a country that had been expected to take years to embrace online food shopping because of a zeal for fresh and perfectly presented produce. 
""I think that this pandemic has triggered an inflection point in the adoption of grocery e-commerce,"" said Luke Jensen, executive director of  Ocado Group  (L:OCDO), hired to build a grocery e-commerce business for Japanese retail giant Aeon.
Most companies won't disclose numbers, but retail executives and analysts estimate internet sales now account for about 5% or more of Japan's total grocery sales, compared with 2.5% before the pandemic. 
Although that is still lower than some pre-crisis estimates of 15% in China and even 7% in broadband laggard Britain, it challenges a long-held belief that Japanese shoppers will always on shopping daily and in person, checking the goods first-hand.
Yuri Ohtaka, a graphic designer living in Tokyo's western suburbs, began ordering from multiple online supermarkets in March after seeing shoppers emptying shelves at a nearby store.
Although fears of shortages have subsided, online deliveries have made it easier as she works from home, making three meals a day for her family, including her 3-year-old son. She's also happy to avoid stores amid fears of infections.
""There's no need for face-to-face, dealing with registers, or standing in line,"" she said, adding that she's also persuaded her parents to go online. ""They were shopping every day in the supermarket, and I really didn't want them to.""
As more households have two people working, analysts say, people want to spend less time shopping. But they still have exacting standards for service and produce quality, which have perplexed previous foreign entrants such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Tesco  (L:TSCO). 
Such changes are closely watched as Japan is one of the world's most valuable grocery markets, worth over 50 trillion yen ($466.42 billion) a year. Per capita, only countries such as Switzerland, Norway and Israel spend more on food. 
SUDDEN DEMAND 
Major Japanese supermarkets, despite talking about online services for years, have only recently begun large-scale spending on e-commerce infrastructure. 
Most have struggled to meet the spike in demand, and would-be-shoppers on Twitter have complained of difficulty securing delivery slots throughout the crisis. 
Aeon hired British online grocery pioneer Ocado in November to build state-of-the-art robotic warehouses, aiming to fend off rivals such as Amazon (O:AMZN), Seven & i Holdings' (T:3382) Ito-Yokado and a venture between Walmart-owned (N:WMT) Seiyu and e-commerce giant  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755). 
But the first of those warehouses won't start operating until 2023. In the meantime, Aeon said it is hiring more staff to help pack online grocery orders, although it is having difficulty hiring more delivery drivers. 
Despite such constraints, Aeon expects online grocery sales to grow 50 percent and account for about 10 percent of sales by the end of its financial year ending next February, according to company executives.
That is not an official target unveiled to investors, but the company confirmed President Akio Yoshida, who was appointed to the top job in March, set it as a goal.
Executives expect the shift to last.
""When people increase their use of online, they stay with it rather than going back. In Japan we'd expect there to be a step up in the growth of e-commerce,"" said Ocado's Jensen, who is also chief executive of the group's Ocado Solutions technology business. 
SMART WAREHOUSES VS MOM AND POP
Analysts say the shift is also likely to favour bigger retailers who can invest in high-tech warehouses capable of handling large volumes rather than just having store staff pick items from retail shelves and package them for delivery. 
That could put smaller supermarkets and mom-and-pop stores, already struggling to match the likes of Aeon and Ito-Yokado in pricing, at a further disadvantage.
But Violetta Volovich, who has researched global grocery industry trends for e-commerce consultancy Edge by Ascential, said remote and costly high-tech fulfilment centres were not the answer for all retailers.
Instead, she envisions many retailers adopting automating more jobs in existing brick-and-mortar stores and embracing features such as ""click and collect"", in which shoppers pick up online purchases at the stores.
She also said the rise in food e-commerce didn't mean an end to traditional grocery shopping.

(Reuters) - Social media site Reddit on Monday shut down r/The_Donald, a forum which long served as a popular online home base for fans of President Donald Trump, saying it violated the site's hate speech rules.
Other sites also conducted high-profile sweeps: Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) live-streaming platform Twitch temporarily banned Trump's official channel, saying it violated Twitch's policy on hateful speech, while Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube suspended six leading white nationalist accounts.
Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said in a post detailing changes to the company's content policies that communities and users promoting hate would be barred. Reddit was banning about 2,000 subreddits, the majority of which were inactive, he said. 
In response to the actions by Reddit and Twitch, a Trump campaign spokesman directed people to Trump's campaign app ""to hear directly from the president."" He did not directly address the sites' actions. 
Huffman said earlier this month that Reddit would strengthen its content policy, after Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian resigned from the firm's board and former CEO Ellen Pao criticized its handling of r/The_Donald. 
Reddit had ""quarantined"" the forum last year, citing threats of violence.
The new list of banned subreddits also included the left-wing r/ChapoTrapHouse, which Huffman said consistently hosted rule-breaking content. It had an average of 42,949 daily active users, according to Reddit.
Reddit's list showed r/The_Donald had an average of 7,780 daily active users, down from its heyday around the 2016 presidential election when it regularly drew hundreds of thousands of visitors each day.
Only about 200 of the banned forums listed by Reddit had more than 10 daily users.
""All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity,"" Huffman said.
IN THE SPOTLIGHT
Social media companies' content policies have been in the spotlight this month, as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) faced an employee walkout and an ad boycott over its hands-off handling of inflammatory posts amid nationwide anti-racism protests and ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
Earlier this month,  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) began placing some of Trump's messages behind warning labels, while  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) said it would no longer promote Trump's account in its Discover section.
YouTube said Monday it was terminating six accounts widely credited with building support for far-right views online over hate speech violations, including channels run by Richard Spencer, Stefan Molyneux and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
Molyneux tweeted in response that YouTube had suspended ""the largest philosophy conversation the world has ever known."" Spencer said he would appeal the decision.
Twitch, a site primarily used for video game livestreaming which Trump joined in October, said it had identified two streams from Trump's account that violated its policies.
One was a rebroadcast of a 2016 rally in which Trump said Mexico was sending rapists to the United States. The other was of his rally in Tulsa earlier this month, when he hypothesized about a ""very tough hombre"" breaking into a woman's house.
A Twitch spokeswoman said the platform had told ""the president's team"" last year that there were no exceptions on the site for political or newsworthy content that broke its rules. 
In May, Twitch announced a new advisory council to improve safety, focusing on areas like harassment and protection of marginalized groups.

Last week, it said it would begin issuing permanent suspensions as part of investigations into allegations of sexual abuse and harassment involving Twitch streamers.[L1N2CW0LE]

742,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>","Norwegian Air cancels 97 Boeing MAX and Dreamliners, claims compensation","By Gwladys Fouche and Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) has cancelled orders for 97 Boeing (N:BA) aircraft and will claim compensation from the U.S. plane maker for the grounding of the 737 MAX and for 787 engine troubles that hit its bottom line, the Oslo-based carrier said on Monday.
The airline cancelled 92 of the 737 MAX jets, five 787 Dreamliners and so-called GoldCare service agreements related to both aircraft, just as Boeing on Monday began a crucial set of flight tests of the 737 MAX in an effort to gain regulatory approval for it to return to the skies.
""Norwegian has in addition filed a legal claim seeking the return of pre-delivery payments related to the aircraft and compensation for the company's losses related to the grounding of the 737 MAX and engine issues on the 787,"" the airline said.
Norwegian did not specify the amount it would seek to claim from Boeing, which it had been in talks with about compensation, and was not immediately available for comment.
Boeing said it was working with Norwegian on a path forward in a challenging time as it was with other operators but it would not comment on commercial discussions.
The problematic Trent 1000 engines, used on the Dreamliners, were made by Rolls-Royce (L:RR), which Norwegian has been in a dialogue with about compensation. Monday's statement did not say whether Norwegian would file a legal claim against Rolls-Royce. 
The European budget carrier, which revolutionised transatlantic travel by offering cheap fares, was struggling before the COVID-19 pandemic brought the airline industry to its knees. 
One reason was the grounding of the 737 MAX in March 2019 following the second of two fatal crashes that together killed 346 people. Norwegian had 18 MAX passenger jets in its 163-aircraft fleet at the time.

Originally a small regional airline in Scandinavia, Norwegian made its breakthrough on the global stage with a multi-year order in 2012 for up to 372 aircraft, of which 222 were from Boeing and 150 from Airbus (PA:AIR).

The court struck down one part of the new regulation, finding that using certain payments to third parties to determine a drug's regulated price went beyond the government's authority, but upheld the bulk of the rules.
Canada published the final regulations in August last year, despite strong opposition from drug companies. The lawsuit was filed in federal court and is led by Innovative Medicines Canada (IMC), which represents major drugmakers in the country.
The new rules will save money for patients, employers and insurers including the government at the expense of drug company profits.
The Canadian reforms could spill into the drugmakers' most lucrative market, the United States, where policymakers have suggested importing less expensive Canadian drugs or basing some prices on drug costs in other countries, including Canada.
The plaintiffs included the Canadian units of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Corp,  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc, Novartis AG and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co.
The new regulations, which take into account cost-effectiveness of medicines and their impact on government budgets, apply only to drugs approved by Health Canada.

The regulations which were to go into force on July 1, have been deferred until Jan. 1, 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) has already boosted capital measures and is working to meet the Federal Reserve's benchmark for October, the Wall Street bank said in a statement on Monday.
Investors and analysts were eager to hear Goldman's announcement because the bank fared worse than rivals on the Fed's stress test last week, sending its share price tumbling.
The Fed examined big banks' balance sheets to see if they had enough funds on hand to handle losses during two years of severe economic and market stress. 
Goldman's loan portfolio suffered much higher hypothetical loss rates than peers. Its key measure of common equity capital as a portion of assets dropped to 12.5% in March compared with the Fed's requirement that it have 13.7% by the start of October.
The bank has already bolstered that measurement, known as a ""CET1 ratio,"" to ""above 13%"" so far this quarter, Chief Executive David Solomon said in the statement.
""We have a track record of rebuilding capital when necessary,"" he said.
Goldman's shares rose 0.7% to $194.73 in after-hours trading on Monday. They had dropped 8.6% on Friday following the stress test news.
Although Goldman's improved ratio is a good sign, it does not satisfy all the outstanding concerns, analysts said.
The bank has been trying for years to transform itself into a full-service commercial bank: unveiling a consumer brand called Marcus, launching a cash-management business and promising to generate more, and less-volatile, revenue from its investment banking and trading arms.
Those changes remain a work in progress with an unclear trajectory, analysts said.
Goldman is still so exposed to trading that its recent success in the business probably helped it build capital so quickly, Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak said. It also still has meaningful exposure to private equity and leveraged loans, which were treated more harshly in this year's stress test, he noted.
""Goldman didn't have the best mix for this year's test,"" Chubak said.
Goldman was already pulling back on private equity and leveraged loans. Speeding up that process would help meet the Fed's capital measure, but also hurt earnings.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Betsy Graseck estimates that Goldman's balance sheet shrinkage could ding earnings per share by about 6% next year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks closed higher on Monday and the S&P 500 was poised to clinch its biggest quarterly percentage gain since 1998 as investors hoped for a stimulus-backed economic rebound, while a surge in Boeing shares helped boost the blue-chip Dow.
The planemaker's (N:BA) shares jumped more than 14% after a 737 MAX took off on Monday from a Seattle-area airport on the first day of certification flight testing with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and company test pilots, a crucial moment in Boeing's worst-ever crisis.
A spike in virus infections in Southern and Western states last week sent the S&P 500 down nearly 3%, but the threat of a deeper-than-feared recession has led investors to expect more stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve or Congress.
But the sting of rising infections was blunted by the pricing of the antiviral drug remdesivir, which has been shown to alter the course of COVID-19, by Gilead Sciences (O:GILD). The company also agreed to send nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months.
While the S&P 500 is up more than 17% for the quarter, the index is down slightly for the month, as stocks have been buffeted by signs of progress in battling the coronavirus and a recent resurgence in cases.
""For all the up, for all the down, volatility isn’t going anywhere,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""Maybe that is the lesson of June, these one-day moves seem impressive but you string 20 of them together and you’ve got nothing.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 580.25 points, or 2.32%, to 25,595.8, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 44.19 points, or 1.47%, to 3,053.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 116.93 points, or 1.2%, to 9,874.15.
Each of the 11 major S&P sectors was in positive territory, led by industrial (SPLRCI) stocks.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) has rebounded about 36% from its March 23 closing low. Monday's gains pushed the index above its 200-day moving average, a technical support level it had fallen through with last week's decline.
Data on Monday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded by the most on record in May, suggesting the housing market was starting to turn around. Later this week, investors will focus on employment and consumer confidence data. 
Still, Wall Street was looking for more stimulus measures to buttress the economy. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said a further injection of cash was critical to the bank's thesis for a ""V""-shaped U.S. economic recovery.
The BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute downgraded U.S. equities to ""neutral,"" citing risks of fading fiscal stimulus, an extended epidemic as well as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. 
Although a $3 trillion aid bill was passed by the House of Representatives in May, the Republican-controlled Senate has not taken up the package and lawmakers are not expected to move toward another coronavirus bill until sometime in July. 
 Coty Inc  (N:COTY) jumped 13.4% after the company said it would buy a 20% stake in Kim Kardashian West's makeup brand for $200 million.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.96-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 17 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.57 billion shares, compared to the 13.54 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - Unions representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, are suing three casino properties based on allegations of dangerous working conditions.
The Culinary Workers Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 filed the lawsuit on Monday against Harrah's Las Vegas, owned by  Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR), and the Bellagio and Signature Condominiums, both subsidiaries of MGM Resorts International (N:MGM).
The lawsuit claims the companies have not sufficiently protected workers and their families from the spread of COVID-19, and that the current rules and procedures for responding to workers who contract COVID-19 have been inadequate.
Among other claims, the lawsuit alleges the companies failed to immediately inform employees about co-workers who tested positive, and only “encouraged” guests to wear face masks while in public areas until June 24, the day the Nevada governor ordered guests to wear them. 
“We have offered free testing to all employees before they report to work and require it if they exhibit symptoms or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive and we have made available tests in other circumstances that do not dictate that a test is required,” an MGM Resorts International spokesman said in a statement.
“We have worked to train our managers in our incident response protocols and we work very closely with the health department officials in their efforts to contact trace.""
Caesars Entertainment did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
At least 19 union members and their families have died from the coronavirus since March 1, according to the lawsuit, which seeks injunctive relief. 
The Las Vegas gaming industry reopened on June 4 with new safety protocols, after being closed for more than two months due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Workers in other U.S. tourism hubs are also pushing for greater protections as the industry begins to reopen. On Saturday hundreds of Disneyland Resort employees and  Disney  unions protested from their cars, saying the Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) had not agreed to adequate protections for employees when the Anaheim, California resort reopens.

Petitioners are also pressing Disney to delay the July 11 reopening of Orlando-based Walt Disney World, citing recent spikes in COVID-19 cases in Florida.

The Tuscan bank said in a statement the deal with state-owned bad loan manager AMCO included spinning off a package of gross bad loans worth 4.8 billion euros and unlikely-to-pay loans worth 3.3 billion euros.
It also included more than 1 billion euros in equity and 3.2 billion euros in debt from bridge loans granted by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS.
Italy's Treasury, which owns 68% of Monte Paschi, has been looking for ways to help the bank cut its bad loan pile without imposing heavy losses to make it a more attractive merger partner.
Rome signed up to an 8-billion euro-bailout package for the lender in 2017 to save it from sinking under problem debts and a derivatives scandal. It must present a strategy soon, perhaps next year, of how it intends to exit the bank.
Under the complex deal with AMCO, the Treasury's stake in Monte Paschi could fall to as low as 63.879% when completed, the bank said.
The operation is expected to be wrapped up and operational as of Dec. 1, Monte Paschi said, but added a precondition was the green light from the European Central Bank.
In May the European Union's competition chief Margrethe Vestager said Monte Paschi's plan to create a bad bank to manage its soured loans was not state aid.

(Reuters) - In the midst of a raging pandemic, Belal Bilto, 26, a sales executive and a Manhattan resident bought a midsize pickup Jeep Gladiator this month for just over $48,000, lured by a discount of about $5,000 on the list price and a seven-year, no-interest loan.
For Bilto, who was laid off in March, and his fiancé Sabrina Moller, 28, a private chef, a car seemed a safer option to travel around during the virus outbreak. Most importantly the truck's purchase is a business expense for the couple to support their new boutique mobile catering venture, platedate.
""We went specifically for the Gladiator because the model was (being offered at) employee pricing and we also got free service after 1,000 miles and a free repair offer for a serious accident,"" Bilto told Reuters.
U.S. automakers are scheduled to report June and second-quarter car and light truck sales on Wednesday. Analysts are forecasting June sales will fall by 25% from a year earlier. That's an improvement from the declines in April and May, reflecting a slow recovery in retail demand hit by coronavirus shutdowns.
The second-quarter numbers reflect a peak for the U.S. auto industry's efforts to use consumer discounts, low interest loans and other incentives to prop up demand during the pandemic.
Since March, U.S. automakers have rushed to prop up demand with rich incentives to keep sales moving. The deals have been good enough and over the next few months, industry officials and analysts say sales could be hurt because of tight inventory.
""The speed at which the (automakers) stepped in to support the franchised dealer network as well as the retail consumer is historically significant,"" auto retailer Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD)' Chief Executive Officer Bryan DeBoer said.
On a per vehicle basis, spending on discounts was at record levels for June at about $4,441 per unit, a significant 12% increase from $3,966 per unit for June 2019, according to automotive consultancy firm J.D. Power.
In April, a month after automakers halted production due to the coronavirus outbreak and a massive 40% decline in sales, per vehicle spending peaked at about $5,000 for the year, jumping about 40% from the same period last year.
""The top three automakers have packed in aggressive incentives with extended financing at 0% rate for 84 months in addition to payment deferrals for up to six months,"" said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power.
""Before COVID, only 7% of all sales represented loan terms for 84 months. That metric shot up to 21% during the peak,"" Jominy said. ""That's unprecedented.""
Lower sales volumes mean automakers can offer hefty discounts per vehicle, while still shrinking overall spending.
Total incentives offered by automakers since March until June end are estimated to be down about 12% to $18.6 billion, from a year earlier, as sales volume have fallen 28%, according to J.D. Power.

Shares of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles closed up between 1.5% and 2.5% on Monday.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) chief Elon Musk in an internal email called on employees to work hard to allow the electric car maker to break even in the second quarter despite the coronavirus pandemic.
The rallying cry has become a familiar theme in recent quarters at Tesla, with Musk calling on employees to quickly build and deliver vehicles at the end of the quarter to achieve specific targets.
""Breaking even is looking super tight. Really makes a difference for every car you build and deliver. Please go all out to ensure victory!"" Musk wrote in the Monday email seen by Reuters.
Electric vehicle site Electrek first reported the news. Tesla shares rose 5.2% to close at $1,009.35 on the Nasdaq on Monday.
The automaker is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week. 
Analysts on average expect the company to deliver roughly 74,000 vehicles in the months from April to June, according to Refinitiv data.
Much of the United States was under some form of lockdown orders during that time, which caused auto sales to plummet. 
Tesla in April surprised investors when it said production and delivery of its new sport utility vehicle, Model Y, was significantly ahead of schedule despite the virus outbreak. The company delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter.

Production at Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory in California was shut down for more than six weeks from the end of March to early May due to local lockdown orders aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.

(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) has named Rob Santangelo as a global co-head of its healthcare investment banking group, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday. 
Santangelo, who is based in New York, will report to Robin Rankin, the Swiss bank's coverage and advisory head of global healthcare, retail and consumer products, and Latin America, the memo said. Santangelo will work alongside David Kostel, who remains a global co-head of the healthcare investment banking division. 
Santangelo, who has been with Credit Suisse since 2007, was previously global head of equity capital markets (ECM) origination, and earlier in his career focused on the oil industry. Santangelo has also been named vice chairman of ECM to continue his coverage of certain energy clients, according to the memo. 
A spokesperson for Credit Suisse confirmed the contents of the memo while declining to comment further. 
Santangelo's appointment comes after Credit Suisse doubled the number of managing directors in its life science practice late last year in an effort to bulk up its expertise in healthcare.

Investing.com - The Dow made a strong start to the week, powered by surge in Boeing (NYSE:BA) as the aircraft maker's 737 MAX took its first steps toward recertification after Federal Aviation Administration got testing of the much-maligned jets underway.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.32%, or 579 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.20%.
The Federal Aviation Administration initiated its recertification flight for Boeing's 737 MAX jets, marking a key step toward getting the planes, which have been grounded since March last year, back in operation, sending the aircraft maker's shares soaring 12%.
The test, which will take place over three days, would also examine whether the flaws in the 737 MAX's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - that many blame for the two crashes that killed 346 people – have been remedied.
The move higher in Boeing lifted sentiment across airlines as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) rose sharply. 
Also adding to positive sentiment on airlines, Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) to buy from sell and raised its price target on the stock to $47 from $35 per share, citing the carrier's domestic focus and better-than-expected cash management in the airline industry. 
Yet,  demand remains the overarching concern for airlines at a time when Covid-19 cases continued to mount.
Coronavirus cases worldwide passed 10 million over the weekend, driven by an ongoing spread of the virus in the U.S., where the death toll has topped 125,000 with as many as 2.6 million confirmed infections.
“Although many countries have made some progress, globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual news conference.
The sharp jump in cases has added a sense of urgency to the development of treatments and vaccines.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), up 1%, said its coronavirus treatment, Remdesivir, would cost hospitals $3,120 for patients with private health insurance.
U.S. health secretary Alex Azar has warned that ""the window is closing"" on the country’s chance to contain the coronavirus.
Energy, meanwhile, also lent support to the broader market, underpinned by rising oil prices as better-than-expected industrial data from China, the largest oil consumer, suggested its economic recovery remained on track.
In technology, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cut losses to end nearly 2% higher despite Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), joining the growing list of companies temporarily pausing social media advertising.   
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended 2% higher, with news that The New York Times has ended its partnership with Apple News drawing a muted reaction. 
Elsewhere,  Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 9% after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight, as an uncertain outlook for restaurant industry and a recovering meat supply chain are expected to weigh on growth.
On the economic data front, pending home sales rose a record 44.3% in May following a 34.6% decline in April, topping economists forecasts for a 19.3% increase in May."

Investing.com -- Industrial stocks starred during Monday's session, riding Dow Jones Industrial Average component Boeing's rise as testing to bring its sidelined jets back into service began.
 Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) jumped 12% on optimism about its 737 MAX jets, and that lifted airline stocks in general. But other big companies also benefited, including 3M Company (NYSE:MMM),  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). It's a reversal of the tech-dominated trend in the market earlier this month.
Company earnings will begin to flood out in the next few weeks, and investors will be studying them to measure the extent of the damage from Covid-19 lockdowns and subsequent off and on again re-openings.
Several Federal Reserve officials have testimony and other scheduled speeches this week, and could give more insight on what the central bank is thinking in terms of managing the recovery.
There are three things to watch tomorrow.
1. Fed Chair Powell Testifies A Day Ahead of Fed Minutes Release
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify Tuesday in Congress a day before the release of the central bank's minutes of its last policy meeting earlier this month, when it decided to hold interest rates steady near zero.
Investors and lawmakers will be parsing Powell's words for any change in his outlook for the recovery as states and cities around the country have to enforce new restrictions because of spiking cases of coronavirus.
2. ConAgra Sets Stage for Flood of Consumer-Oriented Earnings
ConAgra Foods Inc (NYSE:CAG), home to brands such as Duncan Hines cake mixes, Reddi Wip topping, and Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, is seen as a big beneficiary of stay-at-home orders, which forced households to stock their pantries and stop eating out multiple times a week.
The company is scheduled to report earnings Tuesday morning, with analysts tracked by Investing.com forecasting per-share profit of $0.67 on revenue of more than $3 billion.
ConAgra could set the stage for other consumer-oriented companies set to report later, including Constellation Brands Inc Class A (NYSE:STZ),  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS), and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) later this week.
3. Investors Digest News of More States Putting Reopening Activities on Hold
Entertainment and travel stocks got a bounce on Monday, but that could turn later this week as investors digest news about more states pushing back or suspending reopening plans heading into a holiday weekend. New Jersey joined the crowd on Monday, postponing the ability of people to dine at indoor restaurants. The movie chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC), which was up nearly 6% on Monday, already moved back the date of its theater reopenings to the end of July, and Hollywood studios continue to push back the dates of big movie releases.
If travel becomes more restricted again, also expect to see pressure in shares of airlines, car rental companies, hotels, tour operators, and casinos."

The media company said publishers should be fairly compensated for their content and Apple News did not align with its strategy of building direct relationships with paying readers.
NYT, which has more than four million subscribers for its news product, added a record 468,000 paid subscribers in the last reported quarter.

The Montreal-based entertainment company, which runs six shows in Las Vegas, has struggled to keep its business running amid coronavirus restrictions that started in March, forcing it to lay off about 95% of its workforce and temporarily suspend its shows.
""With zero revenue since the forced closure of all of our shows due to COVID-19, the management had to act decisively to protect the company's future,"" Chief Executive Officer Daniel Lamarre said.
The company has signed an agreement with its existing investors private equity fund TPG Capital, China's Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656), and Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Québec under which the group will take over Cirque's liabilities and invest $300 million to support a restart. 
As part of the investment, government body Investissement Québec will provide $200 million in debt financing. 
TPG, Fosun and the Canadian pension fund, which have held a majority stake in the entertainment company since 2015, will also be responsible for a $15 million employee fund to provide financial assistance to laid-off employees.
Cirque said it will seek protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), and its application will be heard on Tuesday by the Superior Court of Quebec. It will also seek its immediate provisional recognition in the United States under Chapter 15. 
The company also said the artists and show staff of resident shows in Las Vegas and Orlando, which are expected to resume before the rest of its shows, would not be impacted by the lay offs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Probably the best thing to say about world financial markets so far this year is simply that it has been quite a ride. 
If somehow you missed the coronavirus slamming the global economy like a wrecking ball, current market levels certainly do not reveal the wild swings that unprecedented events unleashed.
Sure, world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) are down nearly 9% for their worst start to a year in a decade, some big emerging market currencies are down over 15% and super low-risk U.S. government bonds and gold  have returned 16%. But none of that is exactly unique.
In fact some bits look distinctly bullish. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is near a record high thanks to those fantastic FAANGs again, Chinese stocks (CSI300) are now up for the year as are Italian bonds, which might all suggest nothing serious has gone on. Wrong! 
The reality is that it has been one of the most turbulent six months ever seen. Having slumped 35% between Feb. 20 and March 23 in the most destructive sell-off since the Great Depression, MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) has rallied to within 10% of February record highs and Wall Street has had it best quarter since 1998.
For a graphic on World financial markets in 2020:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopajllwva/Pasted%20image%201593383581288.png
It has all been fuelled by $l8 trillion worth of fiscal and central bank stimulus, interest rates slashed to 0% or below in most major economies, and massive debt buying programmes. Borrowing costs for high-grade U.S. companies are now below January levels despite rising numbers of firms going bust.
Oil markets have been even more dizzying. Brent might be down nearly 40% for the year overall, but its second-quarter rebound of 80% is its best since 1990 when markets were worrying about the first Gulf War. 
""It has been a bit crazy,"" said Hans Peterson, veteran global head of asset allocation for Sweden's SEB investment management, who has never experienced a market as unpredictable as in the last six months. 
""The initial drop (in asset prices) was so quick that I think a lot of people got skewed in their portfolios and they had to rebalance,"" whereas the rebound came in the wake of the ""extreme support"" from governments and central banks, he said.

A breakdown of the best- and worst-performing stocks also tells the story of the pandemic, which has claimed over half a million lives and sent unemployment spiralling.
The boom in video chat has made Zoom's (O:ZM) 277% surge the best in the world so far.  Moderna  (O:MRNA), one of the drug firms in the race for a vaccine, is up over 200% too, and sit-on-your-sofa stocks like Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) have jumped 36% and 45%. 
At the other end, cruise ship companies Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) have plunged 69% and 66%, and scores of airlines have been battered, though the biggest loser is scandal-hit German payments firm Wirecard which has lost 99% of its value.

FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS
Ultra-safe U.S. government bonds and far more risky emerging market government debt have both made double-digit returns as the Federal Reserve has chopped U.S. interest rates to effectively zero, leading a charge of almost 150 cuts globally.
As a result, the dollar has given back all of the gains against big currencies like the euro but with the Fed also scooping up companies' bonds, global corporate debt is up 8% for the second quarter having skidded 5% in the first quarter. 
In emerging economies, where some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks are now happening, the damage is still heavy in stocks.
Russian equities, which top-performed globally last year, have been routed 23% in dollar terms, although the loss was 40% at one stage. Brazil and Colombia, where infection rates are now soaring, shares have plunged 40% and 50%, and Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia are all down over 25% for the year.

In March alone, international investors withdrew more than $80 billion from EM economies, the largest single-month capital outflow on record, although money has started to trickle back again.
Ecuador's bonds have made a world-beating 75% since the country's creditors agreed to debt relief. Angola's bonds have leapt over 50%, and in China where the virus first struck, blue-chip stocks (CSI300) are now up 2.7%, having been down 16% in March. 
""This has been a huge quarter because you had some recovery from the March sell-off,"" said Kevin Daly at emerging market specialist Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""Markets are looking through the COVID cases now and taking the view that in six months time, if we do see a rebound, high yield and EM assets are going to do very well.""
Among the major currencies there have been some milestone moves too. Australia's dollar, which is often seen as a proxy for China's fortunes due to the metals Australia sells there, has had its best quarter since 2010. 
The euro made its first quarterly gain versus the safe Swiss franc (EURCHF=) in over two years as the eurozone cooperated on a recovery fund, while the stellar rebound in oil and low COVID numbers gave the Norwegian crown its best quarter against the euro and dollar in a decade.  (EURNOK=) 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Global Chief Investment Officer Michael Strobaek said that after such a strong rebound and with so much uncertainty ahead, including what is likely to be a bitter U.S. presidential election in November, markets will face another rollercoaster six months.
""We are fastening our seatbelts for the ride ahead,"" he said. ""Investors are well-advised to do the same,""

Aeromexico's shares tanked earlier in June after a newspaper column said it was considering filing for bankruptcy, though the airline later clarified it had not decided whether to seek Chapter 11 protections in the United States.

""An additional $50 million advance to Aeromexico by PLM through pre-purchases of award tickets was provided with the execution of the amendments to the commercial agreement. This financial support totals $100 million and is secured by Aeromexico's stake in PLM,"" the firms said.
Aeromexico and Aimia said they will explore options to leverage PLM's debt-free balance sheet and cash flows to provide additional resources to shareholders, including a potential leveraged recapitalization of PLM's balance sheet.
""We are very pleased to be in a position to utilize the robust cash flow and financial attributes of PLM to support our airline partner during this challenging time,"" said Aimia's Chief Executive Phil Mittleman.

766,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Gig Economy ETF Pays Off With Thematic Bet In Time of Covid,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- The gig economy is doing better than you think it is. Take the SoFi Gig Economy ETF (NASDAQ:GIGE)-- the thematic fund is up 70% since hitting a low in March.
The notion of staying in one job and at one employer for a 50-year career no longer exists, said David Dziekanski, portfolio manager and partner at Toroso Investments, which advises the fund. Companies will have a core workforce, and freelancers with special skill sets will fill in the gaps.“The person you hire today is not necessarily the best person to do the job tomorrow,” Dziekanski said in a phone interview. “The online marketplace for freelancers allows companies to source workers with specific talents for projects versus having a massive employee base.”
The gig economy immediately brings to mind two recent and unimpressive IPOs: Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT). Both have tumbled since they went public last year.
But the gig economy is much more diverse than those two companies, Dziekanski said. The SoFi fund includes investments in platform companies like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA); service and transaction businesses, like DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU); marketing services, like Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY); and ancillary providers, like  Healthequity Inc  (NASDAQ:HQY).
The active ETF brings together companies that otherwise might not be sector-aligned, from online payment group  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) to China e-commerce platform  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and freelance marketplace  Fiverr International Ltd  (NYSE:FVRR). It’s becoming harder to classify companies into traditional sectors, creating a new opportunity for different baskets of stocks based on commonality.
“We view it as the next generation of the world of sectors,” Dziekanski said.The coronavirus situation keeping people at home instead of at work accelerated the move toward flexible working situations and even more e-commerce adoption, Dziekanski said.
And even though Uber and Airbnb aren’t the biggest winners right now, there is hope for the future, Dziekanski said. When people do return to work, even if just a couple times a week, there’s less exposure to germs in an Uber than on a train. And given the new work-from-home norm, Airbnb has been benefiting from families seeking to escape to more secluded areas for longer stays."
767,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 02:54PM ET</span>",No One Can Agree on Where The Stock Market Will Be in Six Months,"(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to the future of the stock market, investors’ predictions are all over the map.
When asked where the S&P 500 Index would end the year, a fifth of respondents to a survey conducted by DataTrek Research said the benchmark will close out 2020 up more than 10% from current levels. That’s roughly the same number who predicted the index will finish down more than 10%.
“Every option from ‘really bad’ (down +10% from here) to ‘really good’ (+10%) got basically the same number of votes,” Nicholas Colas, DataTrek’s co-founder, wrote in an email. “And we’re only talking about the next six months.”
Such dispersion is perhaps understandable after the stock market’s fastest-ever fall into a bear market gave way to the quickest 50-day rally in nine decades. While investors are hopeful for a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the outlook is foggy as cases continue to rise and new risks emerge. Investors also have a wary eye on November’s U.S. presidential election and the potential for volatility around that time.
According to the survey -- which attracted 341 responses from June 22 through June 28 -- 48% said they expect Joe Biden to win the presidency, compared to 43% who foresee a Donald Trump victory. According to Colas, political expectations weighed heavily on investors’ general market views.
“Respondents who said they believed Trump would win were twice as likely to think U.S. equities would rally by double digits into the year end,” Colas wrote.
Wall Street strategists are also split on the future for stocks. As of Friday, the gap between the highest and the lowest year-end S&P 500 price targets stood at 28%, the second widest at this time of year since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
To Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), much of the uncertainty is derived from a lack of data and earnings guidance from companies.
“No one knows what’s going to happen with the virus -- we don’t know if we’re going to have more effective therapeutics, we don’t know if we’re actually going to get a vaccine,” Frederick said by phone. “We’ve got two full quarters potentially of it being as volatile and uncertain as it is now.”

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 02:46PM ET</span>","Gilead prices COVID-19 drug remdesivir at $2,340 per patient in developed nations","By Michael Erman, Ludwig Burger and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) on Monday priced its COVID-19 antiviral remdesivir at $2,340 per patient for wealthier nations and agreed to send nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months. 
The price tag is slightly below the range of $2,520 to $2,800 suggested last week by U.S. drug pricing research group the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) after British researchers said they found that the cheap, widely available steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality among severely ill COVID-19 patients.
Remdesivir is expected to be in high demand as one of the only treatments so far shown to alter the course of COVID-19. After the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial, it won emergency use authorization in the United States and full approval in Japan.
The drug is believed to be most effective in treating patients earlier in the course of disease than dexamethasone, which reduced deaths in patients requiring supportive oxygen and those on a ventilator. Still, remdesivir in its currently formulation, is only being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalization as a five-day treatment course.
The company is developing an inhaled version that could be used outside a hospital setting. 
For U.S. patients with commercial insurance, Gilead said it will charge $3,120 per course, or $520 per vial. That is a 33% increase over the $390 per vial Gilead said it will charge governments of developed countries and U.S. patients in government healthcare programs.
'OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR A VERY MODEST DRUG'
In an open letter, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said the price is well below the value it provides given that early hospital discharges could save around $12,000 per patient in the United States.
Patient advocates have argued that the cost should be lower since remdesivir was developed with financial support from the U.S. government.
U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said it was ""an outrageous price for a very modest drug, which taxpayer funding saved from a scrap heap of failures."" 
Remdesivir had previously failed as an Ebola treatment and has not shown that it can reduce COVID-19 deaths. 
Gilead also said it agreed to continue to send most of its supply of remdesivir to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the agency and states set to manage allocation to U.S. hospitals until the end of September.
There are currently more cases of COVID-19 in the United States than in Europe, with several U.S. states hitting new records for numbers of cases. 
HHS has been distributing the drug since May and was due to run out after this week. A senior HHS official said the agency expects the drug will soon be a scarce resource, and so it wanted to remain involved in allocating it.
The agency said it secured more than 500,000 remdesivir courses for U.S. hospitals through September. That represents all of Gilead's projected production for July and 90% of its production in August and September, in addition to an allocation for clinical trials, HHS said.
Once supplies are less constrained, HHS will stop managing the allocation, Gilead said. The company did not discuss its supply strategy for developed nations outside the United States.
Remdesivir's price has been a topic of intense debate. Experts have said Gilead would need to avoid appearing to take advantage of a health crisis for profits.
Gilead shares were about flat on Monday.
Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada forecast the drug could generate $2.3 billion in revenue 2020, helping offset more than $1 billion in development and distribution costs. They said additional profits could be limited because vaccines and better treatments are on the horizon.
The European Union's healthcare regulator last week recommended conditional approval of the drug when used in the critically ill.
Gilead has linked up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, including Cipla Ltd and Hetero Labs Ltd, to make and supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries.

Cipla's version is priced at less than 5,000 Indian rupees ($66.24), while Hetero Lab's version is priced at 5,400 rupees ($71.54).

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 01:51PM ET</span>","Merkel, Macron hope for EU summit deal on budget, recovery fund","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday held out hope that European Union member states will overcome their differences on a multi-year budget of more than 1 trillion euros ($1.12 trillion) as well as a recovery fund at a summit of leader next month.
""Myriad talks"" remain to be held, Merkel told a joint news conference with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron, but added: ""We hope we can find a solution, even if there is still a long way to go.""
EU leaders agreed earlier this month that urgent action was needed to haul their coronavirus-hit economies out of the deepest recession since World War Two.
They will seek to bridge differences at their summit on July 17-18 over a proposal by the European Commission, the bloc's executive, to borrow 500 billion euros from the market for a new recovery fund that would help revive economies hardest hit by coronavirus, notably Italy and Spain.
With more than 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, the EU is keen to demonstrate solidarity after months of bickering that has dented public confidence and put the bloc's global standing at risk.
Macron reiterated his position that a deal on the EU budget and recovery fund could be found at the July summit. He said the fund should include 500 billion euros of grants to the hardest-hit countries.
""The chancellor and I put it on paper: It's our absolute priority,"" Macron said. ""Without this, Europe wouldn't rise to the challenge."" 
Merkel, who had initially rejected a proposal by Macron for a recovery fund, dropped Germany's long-held opposition to mutualising debt to fund other member states when it became clear that the pandemic was an existential threat to the EU.
""It will not fail because of us,"" she said of summit talks on the recovery fund.

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX took off on Monday at 12:55 p.m. EDT (0955 PDT/1655 GMT) from a Seattle-area airport on the first day of certification flight testing with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and company test pilots, a crucial moment in the planemaker's worst-ever crisis.
Boeing Flight 701 departed King County International Airport, which is also known as Boeing Field, the FAA confirmed, saying it will conduct three days of tests. The plane is scheduled to land two hours later at Moses Lake airport, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
The plane is then scheduled to depart Moses Lake soon afterward, arriving back in Seattle at 1:22 p.m. PDT.
Boeing shares were up 10% at $186.86 on the news.
Reuters first reported the long-awaited certification test flights were set to start on Monday.
The FAA said on Monday the flights will ""evaluate Boeing’s proposed changes to the automated flight control system on the 737 MAX"" and ""will include a wide array of flight maneuvers and emergency procedures to assess whether the changes meet FAA certification standards.""
The agency said it will take the time needed ""to thoroughly review Boeing’s work. We will lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.""
Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the airplane's certification.
After the flights are completed, the FAA must still approve new pilot training procedures, among other reviews, and would not likely approve the plane's ungrounding until September, sources said. 
If that happens, the jet is on a path to resume U.S. service before year-end, though the process has been plagued by delays for more than a year.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Will office buildings ever be the same? Empire State offers clues,"By Imani Moise and Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Empire State Building has been a symbol of America's economic might for almost 90 years. Of late, it's also become a symbol of its struggle with the coronavirus.
The once jam-packed 102 stories of the 1,454 ft (443m) Art Deco skyscraper sit mostly empty in a city in shock from the country's worst outbreak of COVID-19. Its spire has been lit up with red-and-white flashes to honor emergency workers, a siren in Midtown Manhattan.
A week into New York's second phase of post-lockdown re-opening, dozens of the companies with office space in one of the world's most famous buildings are trying to figure out when, how - even whether - to come back.
The same quandary is being played out across the United States, and the world. Something so normal as working in a big office block has abruptly become almost unimaginable for many.
The June 22 reopening allowed office buildings to invite tenants back, as long as maximum occupancy stayed below 50%. But most companies based in the Empire State Building, which range from tech firms like LinkedIn Corp (NYSE:LNKD) and luxury watch brand Bulova to nonprofits like the World Monuments Fund, have opted to extend work-from-home arrangements.
Based on a tenant poll, management expected just 15% to 20% of the building's usual 15,000 worker population to return at the second phase of reopening.
Yet even among those who plan to maintain a presence when the time comes, few expect to ever return to a workplace like the one they knew before coronavirus, according to Reuters interviews with several people who work or run companies there.
Global Brands Group (HK:0787), which owns the likes of Calvin Klein, signed a 15-year lease for six floors of office space in 2011 but has already told employees based in New York that they will never be required to come back to the office. 
The allure of working in ""unbelievable corporate headquarters"" has been dulled by the pandemic, Rick Darling, chief executive of the apparel and marketing firm, told Reuters.
""I think they become less important,"" he said. ""If your people are dispersed, really the performance of your company becomes the prestige point.""
The company has not yet made any decisions on office space and will need showrooms for fashion launches, Darling said.
'GO BACK TO WAY IT WAS'
Such shifting attitudes could spell trouble for Empire State Realty Trust Inc (N:ESRT), which owns and manages the building, as well as for other major commercial real-estate companies across the city and beyond. 
New York City office property values have likely fallen 10% during the pandemic, said Daniel Ismail, lead analyst at real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. 
Empire State Realty shares are down nearly 53% since the end of 2019, versus a 25% fall this year in the FTSE Nareit Equity Office <.FTFN47U> index which tracks office real estate investment trusts (REITs). 
Ismail pointed to pressuring factors for the company, including the COVID-19 shutdown of the Empire State Building's observatory - a tourism magnet that last year generated more than a fifth of revenue for the group, which also has other office and retail spaces across the city.
Even so, CEO Anthony Malkin remains optimistic.
His family has been involved with the Empire State Building since the 1960s, and he is convinced its status as a famed piece of the New York skyline will outlast the temporary, if painful, impact of the coronavirus.
""Since COVID, we've only had people sign leases, we haven't had anyone move out,"" Malkin said in an interview, noting that  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) signed a lease for a three-level store on March 15. ""In a post-COVID treatment, vaccine, herd-immunity world, everything's going to go back to the way it was.""
Empire State Realty drew down $550 million from a revolving credit facility the in the first quarter to make sure it would have cash on hand if tenants fell behind on payments, but so far it has received the bulk of dues.
April rent collection dropped to 73% initially but rebounded to 83% by June 1, according to an investor presentation. The company offered deferral to a small portion of tenants which helped keep overall occupancy stable at around 96%. 
'YOU'RE REAL, HAPPENING'
Some tenants say they have no intention of leaving.
For instance,  Shutterstock  Inc (N:SSTK), which signed an 11-year lease in 2013, is following orders from authorities about when and how to return, said Heidi Garfield, the company's general counsel and interim chief human resources officer.
The creative content platform has 85,000 square feet, with an open-plan layout that includes a large café, a library, a terrace, an exercise studio and lounge areas. Before coronavirus, employees' main gripes were when taps for cold-brew coffee or kombucha went down, Garfield said.
Officials from smaller non-profit tenants like the Human Rights Foundation and Human Rights Watch said the iconic building lends credibility with donors and potential partners, regardless of where staff work.
""Being in the Empire State Building was a solid component of our reputation,"" said Human Rights Foundation President Thor Halvorssen. ""People immediately assume that you're solvent and you're real and you're happening."" 
But other tenants are less confident. Unsure what the future of work might look like, they questioned whether it makes sense to spend big dollars for office space when remote operations have been working just fine.
It cost an average of $65.19 per square foot to lease space in one of Empire State Realty's Manhattan buildings pre-COVID-19, according to the company, compared with an average of $81.64 across Manhattan as of late May, according to U.S. real estate firm  CBRE  Group Inc (N:CBRE). 
Pricing has not changed much during the pandemic because of few new listings, said CBRE Director Nicole LaRusso, adding the reopening process might see ""more revisiting on pricing."" 
NO MASK? YOU CAN'T COME IN
Visitors to the Empire State Building are immediately confronted with the new reality.
Anyone entering the building must wear a mask and carry their own hand sanitizer, Malkin said.
Management closed non-essential entrances and retrofitted retail space downstairs as temperature-check and sanitization stations, tenants said. The elevator lobby has stickers on the floor that people waiting must stand on to ensure social distancing. 
Similar stickers line the sidewalks outside the main entrance, in preparation for the re-opening of its observatory next month. The attraction, which allows visitors to take pictures on top of the building, raked in over $125 million in revenue for the company last year.
Some companies are reevaluating leases.
This month, for example, beauty-products company  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) signed over 50,000 square feet of its Empire State Building space to LinkedIn, owned by  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Travel site  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE), which occupies 9,000 square feet on the 72nd floor, said it had deferred ""several real estate capital projects"" to preserve liquidity.
Representatives for Coty, Expedia and LinkedIn did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Even once the pandemic is past, the office market is likely to remain irrevocably changed, according to analyst Ismail at Green Street Advisors.

""Major companies have found an increased level of comfort with people working from home, which I think will likely accelerate in the future.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's efforts to kickstart economies hit by COVID-19 has prompted BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute to upgrade its view on European stocks to ""overweight"", while warning of a risk that the U.S. policy response could be scaled back too soon.
""The region (Europe) is exposed to a cyclical upside as the economy restarts, against a backdrop of solid public health measures and a galvanizing policy response,"" BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said in its mid-year outlook.
The same applied to Japanese stocks, which BlackRock upgraded from ""underweight to ""neutral"". 
This came at the expense of U.S. stocks, for BlackRock reduced exposure to ""neutral"", citing risks of fading fiscal stimulus, an extended epidemic and renewed China-U.S. tensions. 
""The U.S. was strong in its monetary policy response, its fiscal response,"" Mike Pyle, global chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, said during a mid-year media briefing. 
""As we look out over the coming 6-12 months, we think there are significant risks around the U.S. retrenching too soon the policy support,"" Pyle added. 
World stocks have been on a rollercoaster ride in the first half of 2020.
Having slumped 35% from Feb. 20 to March 23, they are now within 10% of February's record highs thanks to lashings of fiscal stimulus, interest rates reduced to 0% or below in most major economies and massive quantitative easing by central banks.
European stocks (STOXX) are down almost 14% since the start of the year, while the S&P 500 (SPX) has slipped 6% over the same period.
In fixed income, BlackRock said it liked U.S. Treasuries and expected long-term bond yields to fall further than other developed market peers. 
BlackRock also downgraded both hard currency debt and equities in emerging markets to ""underweight"", citing limited policy space to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

DETROIT (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday stayed a lower court's order requiring officials from General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) to resolve GM's racketeering lawsuit.
""In order to provide sufficient time to consider the matters raised in GM’s petition, and having considered the relevant factors, we conclude that a temporary stay is appropriate,"" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a court filing.
GM said in a statement that it looked forward to the appeals court's review and decision. Officials with FCA were not immediately available to comment. 
On Friday, GM asked a U.S. appeals court to allow it to continue pursuing its civil racketeering lawsuit against FCA, rejecting U.S. District Court Judge Paul Borman's belittling of the complaint. The No. 1 U.S. automaker called Borman's order ""unprecedented"" and ""a profound abuse"" of judicial power.
GM's appeal came less than a week after Borman called its lawsuit a ""waste of time and resources"" at a time when both automakers should be focused on surviving the coronavirus pandemic.
Borman ordered GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and FCA CEO Mike Manley to meet by July 1 to negotiate a resolution, and later amended his order to allow other officials in their place. On Monday, Borman said in an order that the July 1 call would simply entail the executives answering ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether the case had been resolved.
GM sued FCA last year, accusing the Italian-American company's executives of bribing United Auto Workers union officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage. FCA is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department as part of a wide-ranging probe of UAW corruption.

GM's accusations came as FCA and French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) were in the early stages of preparing for a merger. FCA has said the suit was aimed at disrupting that deal. GM has said the suit has nothing to do with the merger.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Commission is preparing measures to protect the European Union as it faces threatened U.S. sanctions, which could break international law, on a link to carry gas directly from Russia to Germany, the EU's foreign policy chief said.
U.S. senators this month announced a bill tightening sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed by Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP).
Washington says the link, due to begin operation early next year, will boost Moscow's economic and political influence in European countries.
""The EU's position on U.S. sanctions against European companies that carry out legitimate and lawful activities under European law is unequivocal. They are unacceptable and contrary to international law, and the Union firmly opposes them,"" Joseph Borrell said in a written response dated June 25.
""The Commission is preparing the ground for the adoption of an enhanced sanctions mechanism that will improve Europe's resilience to the effects of extra-territorial sanctions imposed by third countries.""
Borrell did not say what form the mechanism would take, or when it would be introduced.
He was replying to a question from EU lawmaker Emmanuel Maurel regarding initial U.S. sanctions on the project imposed in December.
By damaging the European Union's economic interests, U.S. sanctions would weaken the two parties' show of unity against Russia's actions to destabilise Ukraine, after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in 2014, Borrell said further.
The U.S. sanctions threat has prompted the German parliament's economic committee to hold a hearing on July 1 and German business lobbies have called for rescue funds for companies affected.
Timm Kehler, head of gas lobby Zukunft Erdgas, in a statement to the committee published before the event, said such a precedent of ""extra-territorial sanctions"" must be avoided.

""The adoption of such a tightened and retroactive sanctions law would be an unacceptable encroachment on the EU sovereignty and energy security of Western Europe,"" he said.

Coty (NYSE:COTY) is buying 20% of Kim Kardashian West’s beauty line, KKW. The deal values the brand at $1 billion.
A lot of money, but less than the $1.2 billion value that Coty put on half-sister Kylie Jenner’s business. It bought a stake in that back in January.
Coty is partnering with brands endorsed by celebrities with huge social media followings. It hopes that will help sell its products to millennials who prefer less mainstream brands.
Kim launched KKW in 2017, two years after Kylie began her foray into business. Now a lot is riding on the deal for Coty. The owner of Rimmel and CoverGirl is saddled with billions of dollars of debt, and struggling with a turnaround.
It hopes to close the new deal in the third quarter of next year.
On Monday, Coty shares jumped over 8 percent in early trade."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed President Donald Trump more authority over a federal agency charged with protecting consumers in the financial sector, empowering him to fire its director at will and ruling that the structure it was given by Congress violated the U.S. Constitution.
The court, in a 5-4 decision, stopped short of the much more drastic solution of invalidating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency set up in 2011 under Democratic former President Barack Obama that long has been criticized by Trump and his fellow Republicans. The justices ruled in favor of California-based law firm Seila Law LLC, which challenged the agency's structure after being investigated by it.
""The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on behalf of the majority.
Trump has sought to undermine the CFPB. Kathy Kraninger, named by Trump to head the agency, took office in 2018 over the objections of Democrats and consumer advocates.
The legal fight focused on whether the agency's director, a presidential appointee who serves a five-year term, has too much power because the president has only limited authority to remove that individual. The law firm had argued that this CFPB structure violated the Constitution's separation of powers provisions that vest executive authority with the president and limit the power of Congress to encroach in that area.
Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that established the CFPB, the president could terminate a director only for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office."" Lawmakers wanted the agency to be independent from political interference.
Seila, which brought one of several similar legal challenges to the agency, lost in lower courts and appealed to the Supreme Court.
The law firm, which specializes in resolving consumer debt issues, sued in response to a 2017 CFPB request for information and documents during an investigation into whether it had violated federal consumer financial law. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the CFPB's structure did not violate the Constitution.
Trump's administration and the current CFPB leadership agreed with the challengers in the case, although administration lawyers stopped short of arguing that the entire agency should be struck down. The Democratic-led House of Representatives intervened in the case in defense of the agency.

The ruling is likely to affect a similar challenge to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also led by a single director.

Investing.com -- Intercept Pharmaceuticals shares (NASDAQ:ICPT) tumbled 39%, to their lowest in seven years on Monday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the benefits of its new liver disease drug are uncertain and don’t outweigh potential risks.
The FDA’s Complete Response Letter regarding Intercept’s new drug application for obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis requested additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data in support of potential accelerated approval.
“At no point during the review did the FDA communicate that OCA was not approvable on an accelerated basis, and we strongly believe that the totality of data submitted to date both meet the requirements of the Agency’s own guidance and clearly support the positive benefit-risk profile of OCA,” said Mark Pruzanski, the head of Intercept. “We are disappointed to see the determination the Agency has reached based on an apparently incomplete review, and without having provided medical experts and patients the opportunity to be heard at the anticipated Adcom on the merits of OCA.”
Intercept said it plans to meet with the FDA to discuss the letter and “discuss options for an efficient path forward to approval."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday that Wirecard was addressing its concerns but restrictions on the collapsed German payments company's services would remain in place for now.
Several British fintech firms have been forced to suspend services following the FCA's restrictions on Wirecard, leaving hundreds of thousands of accounts blocked.
""We cannot lift the restrictions without reassuring ourselves that the firm has been able to satisfy all our concerns, for example that all clients' money is safe. We hope to be able to issue an update soon,"" the FCA said in a statement.
Wirecard said on Saturday it would proceed with business activities after filing for insolvency and an administrator was appointed on Monday.
The FCA said its teams have been working with Wirecard and other international and UK authorities over the weekend.
A spokeswoman for Wirecard UK said it was working with the FCA to lift the suspension as quickly as possible.
Firms providing finance to poorer and vulnerable Britons who have difficulty accessing mainstream banking are among those hit, including Pockit and U Account, part of subprime lender Morses Club.
The government said anyone worried about not being able to receive welfare payments should contact its helplines.
Wirecard's woes have forced some firms to accelerate existing projects to switch to other services, including card provider Curve which said on Monday its services were back online.
But industry forum Emerging Payments Association (EPA) warned it could take months for others to do the same and urged the FCA to lift its Wirecard freeze as soon as possible.
""We predict dozens of corporate failures, hundreds of job losses and significant reductions in tax payments, unless it is removed right away,"" EPA said in a letter to the FCA.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week higher as the resumption of test flights for Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX flights gave support in particular to the Dow, where the aircraft maker is heavily weighted. 
Boeing stock rose 6.5% on reports that the Federal Aviation Administration had approved the start of test flights for the plane after having various fixes applied during a 15-month hiatus. Airline stocks made more modest gains as they moved a step closer to having a large part of their fleet cleared to fly again.
There was also a trace of renewed optimism in the air as regards the spread of the Coronavirus, with new infections in the U.S. having fallen for two straight days from Friday's record tally of over 42,000. That said, weekend numbers have often shown a dip in the U.S. and other countries as the process of collating information slows down.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 272 points, or 1.1% at 25,287 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite, which was the best performing of the three major indices last week, was giving up some of its outperformance with a 0.1% drop, with social media stocks in particular under pressure against a backdrop of a spreading boycott by advertisers.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was down 3.1%, while Twitter stock was down 1.5%.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock was also under pressure after two-notch downgrade from analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), who argued that the traditional meat supply chain had bounced back after struggling through the first wave of the pandemic. The stock fell 10.5% to its lowest in a month.
Another loser was Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK), which fell 6.4% to a two-week lower after reports that Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) was developing a messaging system for its base of corporate clients aimed at competing with it. Slack, one of many stocks that had a good second quarter on perceptions that it would profit from growth in remote working, posted deeply disappointing quarterly figures that showed it struggling to turn user growth into cash.
Among the gainers,  Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock rose 2.3% after announcing the prices for its Covid-19 drug candidate Remdesivir. while Nikola rose 9.0% on reports that it had been able to attract $5,000 deposits for its hydrogen-powered trucks - despite not even having a working prototype. 
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks were mixed after shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy at the weekend. The company has secured $925 million of debtor-in-possession financing that will allow it to continue some operations. Analysts expect some 200 shale companies to go bust due to this year's collapse in prices.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Airbus fine-tunes job cuts as CEO confirms 40% output drop,"By Tim Hepher and Johanna Decorse
PARIS/TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) was finalising an imminent restructuring plan expected to include thousands of job cuts on Monday as its chief executive confirmed plans to hold output down by 40% for two years.
Europe's largest planemaker could set out its largest ever reorganisation plan by Wednesday, union sources said ahead of meetings early this week with Airbus, which declined to comment.
Airbus needs to move swiftly to counter the damage caused by a drop of some 40% in its 55-billion-euro jetliner business during the coronavirus crisis, industry sources say.
It has said it will announce job plans by the end of July, but needs to brief unions and governments on any major overhaul before a two-week ""quiet period"" ahead of its July 30 earnings.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury set out a bleak backdrop when he confirmed in a German newspaper interview that Airbus was planning for a two-year drop of 40% in jetliner output.
""For the next two years - 2020/21 - we assume that production and deliveries will be 40% lower than originally planned,"" Faury told Die Welt.
Output will return to normal by 2025, while depressed deliveries are expected to catch up with production by the end of 2021, Faury added in the interview published on Monday.
Reuters reported on June 3 that Airbus was looking to hold underlying jet output at 40% below pre-pandemic plans for two years as the basis for any restructuring. 
It has until now said it was cutting by a third on average.
The latest figures do not imply any immediate new production cut after Airbus reduced output in April pending further review.
But industry sources say the 40% cut in underlying output, based on a weighted internal scale called ""single-aisle equivalent"" production, is expected to drive the restructuring.
Sources have predicted phased cuts of between 14,000 and 20,000 jobs based on the 40% target, which takes account of the number of workers needed to build different types of jetliner.
One person familiar with the Airbus layout said anything below 25,000 cuts could be seen as conservative in the light of output plans. Unions have warned against over-reaction, however.
Helicopter and Defence divisions, which manufacture some parts on behalf of the jetliner parent, will be affected.
Faury did not comment on specific restructuring plans but said the company would leave no stone unturned to reduce costs.
""It's a brutal fact, but we must do it. It is about the
necessary adjustment to the massive drop in production. It's
about securing our future,"" Faury told Die Welt. 
Airbus is expected to rely heavily on early retirements, with some 37% of its total workforce of 135,000 scheduled to retire over the next decade.

Airbus has its main plants in France, Germany, Spain and Britain. Laws in some of those countries require voluntary schemes to be exhausted before any forced redundancies. Faury told staff in April all available measures would be studied.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Monday, consolidating after Friday’s sharp losses amid caution as Covid-19 cases mount worldwide. Volumes are likely to be limited given the holiday-shortened week and with key economic releases and verbal interventions from Federal Reserve speakers due. 
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, higher, Nasdaq Futures down 23 points, or 0.2%. The Dow Futures contract rose 91 points, or 0.4%. 
The major indices all lost around 2.5% on Friday, and the month of June has seen a period of consolidation after the strong gains since the March lows. The S&P 500 and the DJIA are on course to post losses, but the Nasdaq is still set to have a positive month. 
Dragging on sentiment has been the resurgence of coronavirus cases globally. The World Health Organization reported almost 190,000 new cases for the 24-hour period through early Sunday, a new high. This means the total number of global Covid-19 cases has now topped the 10 million mark, with more than 500,000 deaths recorded globally.
The U.S. has recorded over a quarter of these cases, with a number of populous states such as Texas and Florida having to re-impose some - but by no means all - restrictions. 
Still, the last two days have seen the number of news cases falling, and mortality rates are much lower than during the first wave of the pandemic, mainly because the new infections have been largely confined to younger people.
With this in mind, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday about the economic stimulus unleashed in response to the virus.
The Fed will also publish the minutes of its June rate-setting meeting on Wednesday.
Economic data are thin on the ground Monday, with pending home sales the only release of note. However, the week will also see the key nonfarm payrolls release on Thursday, a day earlier than usual due to Friday’s U.S. holiday, with economists forecasting an additional three million jobs in June after a shock 2.5 million gain a month earlier. 
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be in focus after the aircraft manufacturer set for a crucial flight test Monday to see if its 737 Max jet can take to the skies again. The 737 Max had been Boeing’s best-selling plane but was grounded last year after two crashes together killed all 346 people on board. 
Oil prices have stabilized Monday, after earlier losses as an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases threatened to curtail the recovery in oil demand.  The recovery in prices since March has come too late to save shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over the weekend.
At 07:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $38.64 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $41.05.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,785.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1280, up 0.6%.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India plans incentives for auto companies to boost exports - sources,"By Aditi Shah and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is drawing up an incentive scheme for the autos sector aimed at doubling exports of vehicles and components in the next five years, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Department of Heavy Industries (DHI) has sought feedback from auto industry groups on the initial proposal, which suggests giving incentives over five years to increase local production and procurement for export, the sources said.
The incentives would be based on the sales value of vehicles or components and eligible companies would need to meet certain conditions, including a minimum revenue and profit threshold and presence in at least 10 countries, two of the sources said, adding the form the incentives would take had not been decided. 
DHI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The move is part of India's effort to create 'champion' sectors to attract investment, generate jobs and boost manufacturing, and comes amid calls by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be self-reliant as a nation.
India wants to promote exports and has identified some sectors, including autos and textiles, for which incentive plans are being designed, said a senior government official.
""For autos the government has engaged with various stakeholders. We have to see what needs to be done in the global context,"" said the official, adding that even though talks are in early stages and details have not been finalised there is a plan to give a ""big push"" to the sector.
India's auto sector exports touched $27 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2019, led by companies including Ford Motor (N:F),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Bosch  (NS:BOSH), which analysts say stand to gain the most.
The push, however, comes at a time when auto sales globally have been battered because of the coronavirus pandemic and demand may take a while to recover.
To make it a success in the present scenario, India needs to ensure the proposal is not complicated by too many conditions and is not based on sales targets, said Vinay Piparsania, consulting director, automotive, at Counterpoint Research.
""Having a liberal trade policy will allow companies to bring in new and global technologies which will increase their scale and India's competitiveness as an export hub,"" he said.
LARGE COMPANIES
The initial scheme has been designed to incentivise large companies and in turn benefit smaller players in the supply chain, making the auto sector more competitive overall, one of the sources said.
To be eligible, automakers must have revenues of at least 100 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) and an operating profit of at least 10 billion rupees ($131 million) in three of the last five years, one of the sources said, adding they must also have earnings from outside India and commit to spending on research. 
The terms for auto part makers are the same except that the revenue and profit thresholds are lower, at 20 billion rupees and 2 billion rupees, respectively, the person said.
One proposal is to have a production-linked incentive under which companies will get benefits proportionate to the distance between the factory and point of sale to compensate for higher warehousing and logistics costs, said the source.
Another proposal is to give incentives to increase production of specific car models but only if 80% of them are exported, the person said.
Inputs on this have been sought from trade bodies such as the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and Auto Components Association of India (ACMA), the sources said.

SIAM, ACMA did not respond to emails seeking comment.

798,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",‘A Ton of Volatility’ Lies Ahead For Canada’s Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The wild ride of Canada’s stock market in 2020 shows no signs of abating soon.
That’s the message from strategists who are expecting choppy months ahead as investors worry about a second coronavirus wave and plunging corporate profits amid a global recession, trade tensions and U.S. elections.
“Now that we’re coming into the summer, it’s going to be more of a second guess of really what’s going on because we’ve still got a ton of volatility ahead of us,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. “We’re not out of the woods of volatility. It’s already been a volatile year for markets, but I don’t think it’s going to end anytime soon.”
As quickly as the Canadian market plunged into bear-market territory in March, it surged even more rapidly into a bull zone. Since the March 23 bottom, the S&P/TSX Composite Index has climbed 35% -- with plenty of bumps along the way. It’s still down 11% for the year.
Market swings paint a picture of a volatile first half. The TSX has moved 1% or more in either direction 54 days so far in 2020, the most since 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There have been eight such days in June, though the gains and losses have mostly canceled each other out: the index is flat this month.
That doesn’t mean that shares won’t go higher.
“While the largest laggards during the bear market have been among the best performing names since the trough, only 20% have seen a percentage recovery greater than the overall market, suggesting to us that these names still likely have plenty of room for recovery,” Brian Belski, chief market strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a report.
He noted that some of the sectors with the biggest influence on the benchmark, such as energy and financials, haven’t recovered even half of their bear-market declines. Investors are reluctant to price in a recovery in the price of crude, and they might still be waiting for the “mortgage deferral cliff.”
“We believe that as investors gain clarity and facts, these sectors stand a very good chance to be key drivers of TSX performance over the next few quarters,” he said.
There might also be more room for gold miners to rise as investors continue to seek haven assets, with the price of the precious metal rallying more than 16% this year.
“This raises the question for portfolio managers and asset allocators: Is it too late for gold or are things just getting started?” strategists led by Richardson GMP’s Craig Basinger said in a June 22 report. “Over the past couple of years, we have been, and remain, fans of gold exposure for investors.”
U.S. elections could be a big source of stress for markets, which in turn could be positive for the price of gold and mining companies, Taylor said. “Gold stocks have had a really good year, and could see some consolidation over the summer. But I think they’re set up for a really good run into the end of the year.”

800,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, June 29th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Worldwide Covid-19 infections top 10 million on the back of last week's surge in the Americas and India, but two days of declines in new infections in the U.S. are helping stocks to a mixed opening. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s ad boycott troubles deepen, while there's a shaft of light in the sky for Boeing (NYSE:BA). In the oil and gas sector, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) files for bankruptcy while BP (NYSE:BP) exits the petrochemicals business. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, June 29th
1. Covid cases top 10 million but U.S. new cases edge down
The number of coronavirus infections worldwide topped 10 million, with over 501,000 reported deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data.
New infections in the U.S. fell for the second straight day on Sunday after hitting a record of over 42,000 on Friday, a surge that led Texas to order the closure of bars and suspend elective surgery at its hospitals to free up capacity for Covid-19 cases.
Alongside the southern and western U.S., the steepest increases continued to be in Latin America, notably Brazil and Mexico, and in India.
2. Facebook's boycott troubles
The number of large advertisers boycotting Facebook’s two big social media platforms because of its perceived failure to address the spread of hate speech and disinformation keeps on rising.
Over the weekend,  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and drinks group  Diageo  (LON:DGE) (the maker of Guinness and Johnny Walker) all said they would pull their ads from Facebook’s networks, joining consumer giant Unilever (NYSE:UL), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Coca Cola and others who took the step last week.
Facebook stock, which fell over 8% on Friday, lost another 2.3% in premarket trading.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; 737 MAX test lights to resume
U.S. stocks are set to open mixed, amid cautious relief at two days of falling numbers of new Covid-19 cases.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 83 points while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.3%.
Among stocks likely to be in focus Monday will be Boeing, after reports that the Federal Aviation Administration will allow test flights for the 737 MAX to resume as early as Monday after a 15-month grounding.
In addition, there will also be data on pending home sales at 8 AM ET and the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank’s regional business survey, which may shed light on the stress in the state’s oil and gas sector and, perhaps, its healthcare system.
4. Chesapeake goes under, BP ditches petchems
The stress in the shale patch was in full view over the weekend, as Chesapeake Energy, a pioneer in fracking, finally collapsed under the weight of its debts after enduring years of low natural gas prices.
The company, which has paid the price for not pivoting to more lucrative oil prospects, has some $11.8 billion in debts, according to its Chapter 11 filing.
In Europe, meanwhile, BP continued to sell assets to reduce leverage and keep its dividend payout going. The U.K. major said it would exit the petrochemical business by selling out to U.K.-based Ineos for $5 billion. That’s one-third of its total targeted asset sales by the end of 2021.
5 Oil stabilizes after Covid-19 fears hit demand outlook 
Crude oil prices stabilized after falling over the weekend due to fears that the further spread of the coronavirus will weaken any global economic recovery.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were up 0.1% at $38.56 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was flat at $40.09 a barrel.
Prices were depressed earlier by a report saying that five of the biggest Chinese oil importing firms will join forces to buy collectively, aiming to improve their bargaining power with producers. The news comes amid record levels of crude being stored off the Chinese coast in tankers, amid haggling over prices."
801,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Latin America's airline apocalypse signals a future with weak competition,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Bankrupt LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) are dramatically retrenching their once grand ambitions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing competition in Latin America as they mull once-unthinkable cooperation with rivals. 
Since May, LATAM has exited Argentina, partnered with rival  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) in Brazil and cut back domestic operations in Chile, while Avianca has departed Peru.
LATAM is now open to a deeper alliance with Azul, even as the two airlines usually control a combined 60% of Brazil's domestic market. 
The scaling back could reshape air travel in Latin America, weakening competition regionally and driving up ticket prices while also helping some carriers survive. The moves show how the industry is already shrinking through attrition, as airlines are too cash-strapped to consider buying the competition. 
""More than consolidation, many airlines will disappear,"" said Eliseo Llamazares, an aviation consultant at KPMG. 
Latin American governments increasingly recognize there is a new reality, and have shifted their priorities to keeping local airlines alive instead of attracting new players.
Attrition has also occurred in Ecuador, where TAME shut down, and in Mexico, where Interjet has scaled back. 
""If this trend is allowed to continue, connectivity around the region will be affected,"" said Peter Cerda, vice president for the Americas at IATA, an airline industry group. ""Less connectivity means less choice, and less choice usually translates into higher prices."" 
All airlines in Latin America face some risk of disappearing, analysts say. 
Dominant LATAM and Avianca have filed for bankruptcy protection, while auditors for Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4) are seeking to include a formal warning in the airline's financial statements that the carrier risks disappearing.
Azul and  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) have hired restructuring advisers, while Panama's Copa Holdings (N:CPA) has not flown since late March, straining its finances. 
One airline that could stand to benefit is Chile-based JetSMART, which is considering entering Brazil's domestic market. 
JetSMART's expansion is backed by deep pockets at private equity firm Indigo Partners, which also holds stakes in Frontier, Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) and Mexico's Volaris. 
Indigo Partners founder Bill Franke told Reuters he expects to look into helping finance Avianca's restructuring. That could bring Avianca closer to JetSMART, keeping the Colombian airline's markets safe from competition. Avianca declined to comment. 
'DIVIDING THE MARKET' 
If JetSMART expands to Brazil, it would arrive as competition is diminishing. Last year, LATAM and Gol fought to keep Azul from entering a key Sao Paulo airport. 
""JetSMART in Brazil would wreak havoc on the current players,"" said an air industry executive. 
But the coronavirus has turned competition into a secondary concern, evidenced by the lack of pushback against the LATAM-Azul code-share. 
The code-share ""would have been untenable before,"" said Carlos Ozores, an aviation consultant at ICF. 
The current partnership applies only to non-overlapping routes, but LATAM said it is ""open to evaluating the possibility of the eventual future expansion of this code-share"" to overlapping routes. 
""They are dividing the market for themselves,"" an executive at a rival airline said of LATAM and Azul. 
Gol CEO Paulo Kakinoff said code-share agreements - in which two or more airlines publish and market the same flight sharing one aircraft - will reduce air-travel supply, ""which will benefit all of us."" 
The LATAM-Azul partnership has led to speculation about the future. 
""It could be the first step for deeper integration, even a merger,"" said Andre Castellini, an aviation consultant at Bain & Company.
LATAM and Azul deny merger talks, but a source familiar with the code-share talks said it is ""possible."" 
More than mergers, so-called joint business agreements are in vogue. Recently, LATAM signed one with Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), while Avianca, Copa and United (O:UAL) have announced a rival one. 
The agreements allow for deep route integration, without all the expenses and red tape of an actual merger.
LATAM was born out of the difficult merger of Chile's LAN and Brazil's TAM, which saddled the new carrier with big expenses. 
Not long ago, LATAM and Avianca had their planes in almost every corner in Latin America, controlling a combined 60% of the domestic markets in Colombia, Chile and Peru. 
But Avianca pulled out of Peru in May, calling the domestic market unprofitable, surrendering to LATAM, which has dominated travel there since the 1990s. 
LATAM, in turn, departed Argentina earlier this month after losing an accumulated $350 million since 2012. 
What it shows is airlines willing to surrender market share that they fought hard in normal times to maintain. 

""To talk about competition in this context makes no sense, this is a fight for survival,"" Bain's Castellini said. ""Airlines are going to prioritize their survival over their market share.""

802,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>","‘FOMO’ Is in Early Stages With Plenty of Cash for Dips, DBS Says","(Bloomberg) -- The fear of missing out and the lack of appealing alternatives will continue to boost stocks, according to DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Ltd.
“‘FOMO’ is in its early innings” with lots of cash on the sidelines that could eventually find its way into equities, Chief Investment Officer Hou Wey Fook said in a webinar Monday. “There is capacity to buy whenever there are corrections in the equity markets.”
Stocks have emerged as the TINA (there is no alternative) play because of the low or zero returns offered by bonds and cash, Hou said. Also, retail investors have become “a force to contend with” as they’re more knowledgeable and are driven by higher liquidity, high savings rates, and zero commissions at many brokerages.
DBS’s remarks come as the MSCI all-country stock index sits a full 34% above its March 23 closing low when uncertainty about the impact of Covid-19 was near its peak. The gauge is still down 8% from where it started the year, but the rebound has been fast, thanks to the stimulus from central banks and governments globally.
DBS continues to recommend a “barbell” strategy, with assets placed to benefit from divergent market outcomes, and maintains a preference for sectors like e-sports that can benefit from Millennial and Gen-Z wealth, and from pandemic-related changes in behavior.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","Stocks hit two-week lows, oil slides on virus surge","By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares hit two-week lows and oil fell nearly 2% on Monday as the relentless spread of the coronavirus curbed optimism on the global economy, prompting investors to take shelter in safe-haven bonds and gold.
European stocks opened slightly lower, after Asian shares ended deep in the red playing catch up with Wall Street's ugly close on Friday as some U.S. states reconsidered their reopening plans.
The global death toll from COVID-19 reached half a million people on Sunday, with one quarter of those in the United States, where cases have surged in a handful of southern and western states.
MSCI's world shares index was off 0.2%, hitting its lowest level since June 15 dragged down by Japan's Nikkei shedding 2.2% and Chinese blue chips off 0.9%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were up 0.1%.
""The market is caught in a real battle between recovery optimism and news of increasing cases in certain geographical areas such as the U.S,"" said John Woolfitt, director of trading at Atlantic Capital Markets.
""I think this battle will remain until the U.S. get a handle on it.""
Sovereign bonds benefited from the shift to safety with yields on U.S. 10-year notes near 0.64%, having briefly been as high as 0.96% early in June. German government bond yields clung to one-month lows on Monday.
The U.S. dollar has generally gone in the opposite direction, rising to 97.334 against a basket of currencies from a trough of 95.714 earlier in the month.
It had less luck on Monday, easing back to 107.18 yen, though it remained well within the recent range of 106.06 to 107.63. The euro stood at $1.1245 having found solid support around $1.1167. 
""Financial markets remain extremely fragile, having to weigh worsening virus news against improving economic data,"" said Marija Veitmane, senior strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
It is an important week for U.S. data with the ISM manufacturing index on Wednesday and payrolls on Thursday, ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is also testifying on Tuesday.
""U.S. economic data will reinforce that the economy is through the worst of the recession in our view,"" said CBA currency analyst Joseph Capurso.
""But a double‑dip recession is possible if widespread restrictions are reimposed, leading to a surge in the dollar.""
In commodity markets, gold held near its highest since early 2012 at $1,773 an ounce. 
Oil prices slipped amid concerns the pandemic would slow the reopening of some economies and thus hurt demand for fuel. 
Brent crude futures fell 69 cents to $40.33 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 62 cents to $37.87.

804,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Commerzbank's Pain Will Be Deutsche's Gain,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Just because Germany’s new generation of finance firms isn’t all it claimed to be doesn’t make the old generation any better.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), the country’s second-largest private-sector bank by assets, is preparing to cut another 7,000 jobs and close some 400 branches, stepping up its (so far unsuccessful) efforts to restore profitability, according to Bloomberg.  The bank has not confirmed the report.
The news agency reported that the new plans drawn up by under-fire chief executive Martin Zielke may be discussed at a supervisory board meeting in the middle of the week. The new comes after private equity firm Cerberus, Commerzbank’s biggest private shareholder, for “swift and decisive action” to stop a downward spiral.
“Management’s ill-conceived and poorly executed attempts to prevent Commerzbank’s demise display a level of negligence and arrogance we are no longer willing to tolerate,” Cerberus wrote in a supposedly ‘confidential’ letter that mysteriously found its way into the Financial Times.
To a large degree, this can be seen simply as a howl of pain from an investor that is just ‘long and wrong’. Cerberus bet on Commerzbank back in 2017, when the outlook for the eurozone economy was much brighter and it was easier to believe that the massive discounts offered by banking shares could be closed by growth and sector rationalization.
Since then, the growth story has unraveled and the prospects for rationalization – at least on any terms that would benefit Commerzbank’s private shareholders – have exploded. With no prospect for a turn in the interest rate cycle, with management's hands tied by the high degree of labor protection the workforce enjoys, and with every chance of another painful wave of souring loans (starting with a 9-digit exposure to Wirecard), it is hard to see what Zielke can propose that would steer the bank away from the rocks. 
His shareholders have already tried, and failed. The government - Commerzbank’s largest shareholder since its bailout in 2008 - leaned on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last year to merge with it. However, Deutsche’s management successfully resisted what would have been a huge distraction while it puts its own house in order, and Chistian Sewing’s team has been rewarded by a 19% rise in the share price this year, the best performance of any European bank.
Sewing’s discipline may yet yield even greater rewards. When, as seems inevitable, Commerzbank’s supervisors at the ECB run out of patience with its inability to turn a profit, Deutsche will almost certainly have another chance to snap up its best parts on more advantageous terms. In 2017, when Air Berlin collapsed, the government was quick to finance a solution whose top priority was to strengthen Lufthansa in the domestic market. Similar principles are likely to apply both in this case - and in many others in the post-Covid wave of corporate restructuring (and not just in Germany)
Commerzbank shares rose more than Deutsche Bank shares on Monday, gaining 2.9% to Deutsche’s 1.8% (the benchmark DAX rose 0.5%, while the Stoxx 600 eked out a 0.1% gain). However, the ultimate benefit of any pruning at Commerzbank in the near term will more likely accrue to Deutsche’s shareholders in the long run."

Consumer stocks such as Unilever (AS:UNA),  Danone  (PA:DANO) and L'Oreal (PA:OREP) also weighed, falling between 1.2% and 2.6%.
European markets have climbed in recent weeks, helped by the region's relative success in reopening its economy and the European Union's proposed 750 billion euro ($841.73 billion) recovery fund.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are set to meet later in the day to discuss the fund. 
""Equity markets are under some pressure given fears of a spike in COVID-19 cases in the United States and as the month ends, many investors have to sell some equities to rebalance their portfolios,"" said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
""This pressure should ebb as we start a new month while data should start to show some signs of an economic recovery."" 
Data showed profits at China's industrial firms rose for the first time in six months in May, suggesting the recovery is gaining traction. Euro zone consumer confidence data is due at 1000 am GMT.

Wirecard also said it would proceed with business activities after filing for insolvency.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed largely higher Monday, amid confidence in the global economic recovery despite an ever-rising number of Covid-19 cases.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.1%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was flat.
The profits of Chinese industrial enterprises rebounded in May for the first time since November 2019, data confirmed Sunday, signaling the world’s second-largest economy is continuing to recover from the coronavirus shutdowns.
This is important news for Europe, and particularly Germany, as China is one of the largest export markets for European goods.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to host French President Emmanuel Macron for talks later Monday. The two leaders are likely to discuss how to get agreement on the recovery fund for the region given opposition to the Franco-German inspired plan to distribute the funds to hard hit areas as(repayable) loans, or as grants. The International Monetary Fund weighed into the debate, with Chief Economist Gita Gopinath saying in Der Spiegel that a substantial part of the European Union's package of measures must consist of grants.
Still, worries remain over the spread of the coronavirus, with the World Health Organization reporting almost 190,000 new cases for the 24-hour period through early Sunday, a new high. 
This means the total number of global Covid-19 cases has now topped the 10 million mark, with more than 500,000 deaths recorded globally. Despite the spite in infection numbers, mortality rates are much lower than during the first wave of the pandemic, mainly because the new infections have been largely confined to younger people.
The EU-U.K. free trade negotiations are also scheduled to restart this week in Brussels, with time running out and few signs of any progress made in the negotiations over the future relationship.
Economic data centers around the European economic confidence indicators for June, due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), along with preliminary inflation data for June from Germany and Spain, and consumer and mortgage lending from the U.K.
In corporate news, Airbus (PA:AIR) stock climbed 1.3% despite CEO Guillaume Faury stating the aircraft manufacturer is assuming a 40% drop in production over the next two years due to the coronavirus crisis. He added that the company intends to announce possible job cuts before the end of July, thus cutting costs.
Oil prices fell back Monday, amid worries that the increase in the number of global Covid-19 cases which has led some countries to resume partial lockdowns could hurt fuel demand. Years of low natural gas prices finally forced Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years over the weekend.

The country's seven major automakers sold a total of 1.47 million vehicles last month, down sharply from 2.38 million units a year ago, according to Reuters calculations based on sales data released by these companies. But the decrease was smaller than the 50% tumble posted in April.
Global production at these automakers fell 62% to 918,974 units in May, compared to a production slump of 55% in April.
Car demand has plummeted globally since March as people were forced to stay indoors in most countries due to lockdowns to control the outbreak, leading to deep uncertainty about the longer-term economic impact.
Many countries have been easing their lockdown measures, but industry experts anticipate that it would take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels. 
Japan's biggest automaker Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) sold 609,460 vehicles in May, down 34% from a year ago. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's (T:7201) sales fell 37.3% on year to 272,873 units, while sales at Honda Motor Co (T:7267) slipped 29% to 327,000 units.
Vehicle sales fell in nearly all regions, with North America and Europe being the worst hit. China was the only bright spot, where Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) reported higher sales. 
Most automakers are preparing for a big financial hit from the pandemic due to the lockdowns in the United States and Europe. Toyota has said it expects an 80% profit slump this year, its lowest in nine years.

The pandemic has piled more pressure on Nissan, which had been struggling with falling sales and profitability even before the outbreak, forcing it to roll back on an aggressive expansion plan by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Monday, with investors displaying a cautious tone as the ever-rising number of Covid-19 cases threatens the global economic recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
The World Health Organization reported almost 190,000 new cases for the 24-hour period through early Sunday, a new high. This means the total number of global Covid-19 cases has now topped the 10 million mark, with more than 500,000 deaths recorded globally. Despite the spite in infection numbers, mortality rates are much lower than during the first wave of the pandemic, mainly because the new infections have been largely confined to younger people.
The U.S. has registered over a quarter of the 10 million global cases, with Texas, the second-most populous U.S. state, fast becoming the new center of the pandemic in the country. That said, other states, like Arizona and Florida, are in similar positions, and this second wave could threaten the recovery of the world’s economic engine. 
""The increase in U.S. COVID-19 infection rates has dented momentum across markets despite the improvements in the global economy, which continues to beat most data expectations,"" wrote analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note, reported by Reuters.
In Europe Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to host French President Emmanuel Macron for talks, with the two leaders likely to discuss what strategy to employ to get agreement on the recovery fund for the region.
The EU-U.K. free trade negotiations are also scheduled to restart this week in Brussels, with time running out and few signs of any progress made in the negotiations over the future relationship.
Economic data centers around the European economic confidence indicators for June, due at 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT).
In corporate news, Airbus (PA:AIR) will be in the spotlight after CEO Guillaume Faury stated the aircraft manufacturer is assuming a 40% drop in production over the next two years due to the coronavirus crisis.
Oil prices fell back Monday, amid worries that the increase in the number of global Covid-19 cases which has led some countries to resume partial lockdowns could hurt fuel demand.
The damage the collapse in oil prices has done to the U.S. shale industry was laid bare Sunday, when Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) became the largest U.S. oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years as it bowed to heavy debts.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% lower at $37.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2% to $40.11.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,787.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1256, up 0.3%.

Investing.com – Japanese tech giant Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group said on Monday that it will repurchase up to JPY200 billion ($1.86 billion) of its domestic unsecured corporate bonds.
The purchases will be made between June 30 to July 17 and is part of the company’s ongoing plan to pay down debt. Softbank’s Chief Executive Masayoshi Son launched an ambitious $41 billion asset monetization program to fund share buybacks and reduce the debt burden after some sour investments led the company to report a record annual loss earlier in the year.
These investments include a $3 billion tender offer for co-working spaces provider WeWork, which was withdrawn in April.

Ghosn's 2018 arrest in Japan on financial misconduct charges has led to much speculation that the move was orchestrated by Nissan executives who opposed closer ties with partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). 
""I know that in books and the media there has been talk about a conspiracy but there are no facts whatsoever to support this,"" Motoo Nagai, chairman of Nissan's auditing committee, told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting.
Responding to demands from a shareholder to address the speculation, Nagai argued that the investigation into Ghosn was conducted both internally and by outside law firms. 
Monday's meeting lasted almost two hours - twice as long as planned, as shareholders grilled Chief Executive Makoto Uchida on how he planned to restore trust in the company following the Ghosn scandal, and revive sales in the United States and China. 
Uchida, who took the helm in December, told shareholders he would stick to his promise to step down as leader if he fails to deliver on a turnaround plan for the Japanese automaker, which last month reported its first annual loss in 11 years.
Seeking to slash costs and downsize after years of excessive spending in the pursuit of market share, Nissan plans to cut its model range by about a fifth and reduce production capacity, shuttering plants in Spain and Indonesia and laying off workers in countries including Mexico. 
It now aims to sell 5 million vehicles a year, far fewer than past ambitions of 8 million.

813,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",Chesapeake’s Collapse Is Latest in Long Line of Shale Disasters,"(Bloomberg) -- The shale bust has reached a grim milestone by claiming the pioneer of America’s drilling renaissance. But Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK)., which filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, is just the latest in a long list of casualties.
More than 200 North American oil and gas producers, owing over $130 billion in debt, have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2015, according to a May report from law firm Haynes & Boone. This year alone, at least 20 have gone under after oil prices plunged amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
The shale boom spearheaded by the likes of Chesapeake a decade ago was fueled by debt. Profitability and shareholder returns have been consistently disappointing, and investors had already grown wary of throwing more money into shale before this year’s oil crash. The rate of default on high-yield energy debt stood at 11%, Fitch Ratings said in a June 11 report, the highest level since April 2017.
Here are four other notable shale bankruptcies so far this year:
Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL)
An oil explorer focused on the Bakken Shale in North Dakota,  Whiting Petroleum Corp  . was already facing headwinds prior to 2020. Last year, the Denver-based company announced it would fire a third of its workforce and scale back production targets after posting a surprise quarterly loss.
Crude prices had their worst quarter ever in the first three months of 2020, with oil heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Russia failing to agree on supply cuts just as worldwide lockdowns wiped out demand for fuel. That was enough to push Whiting, saddled with $3.6 billion in debt, into bankruptcy on April 1.
But not before the board approved $14.6 million in cash bonuses for top executives in order to “ensure the stability and continuity of the company’s workforce and eliminate any potential misalignment of interests that would likely arise if existing performance metrics were retained,” the company said in a filing the same day it filed for Chapter 11 protection.
Extraction Oil & Gas
Another Colorado driller, Extraction Oil & Gas Inc. focused exclusively on the Denver-Julesburg Basin in the Rockies. It filed for Chapter 11 on June 15, offering to ease its debt burden of roughly $1.5 billion by giving note holders 97% of new common stock to be issued.
Extraction had withdrawn its 2020 guidance in May and warned it may have to file for bankruptcy. Then, in early June, the company announced plans to pay 16 executives and senior managers a total of $6.7 million in return for staying with Extraction ahead of a possible default on its bond payments.
Ultra Petroleum
Once wasn’t enough.
Ultra Petroleum Corp. filed for its second bankruptcy in May, four years after its first. Listing $2.56 billion in debt and $1.45 billion in assets in its Chapter 11 filing, the Englewood, Colorado, driller reached a deal with most of its senior creditors that would slash $2 billion in debt, while looking to restructure within three months.
In its struggles to stay afloat, Ultra went so far as to suspend its drilling program in January to bolster free cash flow and focus on paying down debt. The explorer first filed for bankruptcy in 2016 and emerged the following year, just as the shale patch was beginning to crawl out of what had been the worst oil industry crash in a generation -- until this year.
Sable Permian Resources
Soon after his ouster from Chesapeake in 2013, co-founder Aubrey McClendon went to work building a new empire, American Energy Partners. But after McClendon died in a car crash three years later, the company shut down.
Part of that business, American Energy - Permian Basin, merged with Sable Permian Resources LLC last year. That particular business was widely seen as having among the best assets of a half dozen oil-and-gas acquisition vehicles that McClendon set up during his brief tenure at American Energy Partners.
Sable filed for bankruptcy last week in Houston alongside affiliates, listing at least $1 billion of assets and liabilities each.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Monday morning, with grim milestones in global COVID-19 figures putting a dent in the start of the week for investors.
 
The total number of global COVID-19 cases topped the 10 million mark, whilst more than 500,000 deaths have been recorded globally as of June 29, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
 
The numbers have also dented expectations of a quick victory in the war against COVID-19, with some investors expecting a much slower and uneven economic recovery.
 
“The recovery is going to be much slower and much more uneven than most people believe... markets are priced for a much sharper V-shaped recovery which we don’t think is likely,” David Hunt, president and CEO of PGIM Inc., told Bloomberg.
 
Investors will also be looking to the testimonies of both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday for further clues on the U.S. economic recovery.
 
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.54% by 10:40 PM ET (3:39 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.38%. China’s National Bureau of Statistics will release the country’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for June on Tuesday, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a score of 50.4.
 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Indedx fell 0.49%, with China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee widely expected to pass national security laws for both Hong Kong and Macau on Tuesday.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",Shale pioneer Chesapeake Energy files for bankruptcy,"By David French and Rama Venkat
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday, becoming the largest U.S. oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years as it bowed to heavy debts and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on energy markets.
The filing marks an end of an era for the Oklahoma City-based shale pioneer, and comes after months of negotiations with creditors. Reuters first reported in March the company had retained debt advisers.
Chesapeake was co-founded by Aubrey McClendon, an early and high profile advocate of shale drilling who died in 2016 in a fiery one-car crash in Oklahoma while facing a federal probe into bid rigging. Over more than two decades, McClendon built Chesapeake from a small wildcatter to a top U.S. producer of natural gas. It remains the sixth-largest producer by volume.
Current CEO Doug Lawler, who inherited a company saddled with about $13 billion in debt in 2013, managed to chip at the debt pile with spending cuts and asset sales, but this year's historic oil price rout left Chesapeake without the ability to refinance that debt.
""Despite having removed over $20 billion of leverage and financial commitments, we believe this restructuring is necessary for the long-term success and value creation of the business,"" Lawler said in a statement announcing the filing.
Lawler last year spent $4 billion on an ill-timed push to reduce Chesapeake's reliance on natural gas. The purchase sent its shares lower and this year the value of Chesapeake's oil and gas holdings fell by $700 million this quarter. The company last month warned it may not be able to continue operations. 
Chesapeake plans to eliminate approximately $7 billion of its debt, the statement said. A separate court filing indicated that Chesapeake has more than $10 billion in liabilities and assets, respectively.
Chesapeake's outlook plunged this year as the coronavirus outbreak and a Saudi-Russia price war sharply cut energy prices and drove its first-quarter losses to more than $8 billion. On Friday, its stock traded at $11.85, down 93% since the start of the year, leaving it with a market value of $116 million. 
The company has entered into a restructuring support agreement, which has the backing of lenders to its main revolving credit facility - some of which are providing $925 million of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to help fund operations during the bankruptcy proceedings.
The agreement also has backing from portions of other creditors, including those behind 87% of its term loan, and holders of 60% and 27%, respectively, of its senior secured second lien notes due 2025, and senior unsecured notes.
While the statement does not name Chesapeake's creditors, investment firm Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) is among the most significant. On June 15, Reuters reported that Chesapeake's impending restructuring would turn over control of the company to creditors including Franklin.
Chesapeake also has agreed the principal terms for a $2.5 billion exit financing, while some of its lenders and secured note holders have agreed to backstop a $600 million offering of new shares, to take place upon exiting the Chapter 11 process, the statement added.
Chesapeake's filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas makes it the largest bankruptcy of an U.S. oil and gas producer since at least 2015, when law firm Haynes & Boone began publishing data on restructurings.

Chesapeake's advisers are investment banks Rothschild & Co and Intrepid Partners, law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, and turnaround specialists Alvarez & Marsal.

Verdi said on Sunday that the strike would last at least 48 hours, under the motto 'Good and healthy work', to denounce what it called a lack of transparency by the U.S. retail giant after workers tested positive for COVID-19.
""We have information that at least 30 to 40 colleagues were infected,"" said Verdi representative Orhan Akman.
Amazon has faced a long-running battle with unions in Germany over better pay and conditions for logistics workers, who have staged frequent strikes since 2013.
Verdi said the strikes will hit Amazon sites in Leipzig, Bad Hersfeld, Rheinberg, Werne and Koblenz. It said Amazon was putting profit ahead of the safety of its workers.
Amazon rejected the accusations in a statement and said that as of June it had invested $4 billion on measures to protect its global workforce and clients from the risk of COVID-19 infections.

In Germany, its biggest market after the United States, Amazon has since February ordered 470 million hand disinfection bottles, 21 million pairs of gloves, 19 million masks and other face protection gear and 39 million boxes of disinfectant wipes, a spokesman for Amazon in Germany said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Reforms to the global financial system following the banking crisis a decade ago have cut the risk of taxpayers having to rescue lenders again but some gaps still need plugging, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Sunday. 
After the crisis the FSB, which coordinates regulation for the Group of 20 rich and emerging economies (G20), introduced rules that require the world's biggest banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), to issue special debt that can be written down in a markets meltdown.
This and other reforms sought to prevent banks being ""too big to fail"" - when governments ride to their rescue if they are in serious trouble.
Bundesbank Vice-President Claudia Buch, who chaired an FSB evaluation of whether the new rules lessened the likelihood of taxpayers having to rescue banks, said the reforms appear to be working, but there is still work to be done.
""The FSB encourages full implementation of the resolution reforms. Supervisors... have much better information now but there is still room for improvement in reporting and in disclosures,"" she told reporters in a media call. 
Funding costs for banks have risen in a reflection that banks are more likely to write down the special debt rather than be rescued by taxpayers, the evaluation showed.
It estimated that gross benefits of the reforms would total $216 billion to outweigh gross costs of $65 billion.
But there may be gaps in the information available for evaluating whether the reforms work, such as who owns the debt for regulators to assess the potential impact of a bail-in on the financial system, it said
Under the reforms, only three systemically important banks have been ""resolved"" in recent years, or wound down smoothly without disruption to the wider financial system, the evaluation said.

Some countries like Italy have continued to use public money to help ailing smaller banks, examples described by regulators as idiosyncratic and not undermining the thrust of the too-big-to-fail reforms.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier is demanding pay cuts of up to 20% and changes to work practices across Europe.
It has said it plans 3,000 job cuts and a reduction in staff unit costs, but faces union resistance in a number of markets. 
In the memo sent on Friday, Ryanair director of operations Neal McMahon told pilots the union council representing Irish pilots had walked away from talks on Wednesday, something the Forsa trade union denied. 
McMahon said a union request for an extension of a 30-day consultation on job cuts represented ""stalling tactics"". 
Instead, the memo sent on the company's internal messaging system, asked pilots to click a button to accept proposals including a 20% pay cut that would be reversed gradually within four years, a spreading of available work via job shares and unpaid leave, and ""productivity improvements"".
It said the number of job losses, and whether bases at Cork and Shannon airports remained open would depend on the number of acceptances. 
A Ryanair spokeswoman said she had ""nothing further to add to that memo"".
Trade union Forsa, in a memo to pilots on Friday, said Ryanair's latest proposal was unacceptable as it would effectively leave pilots temporarily on zero-hour contracts and provided no guarantee job losses would be avoided.
Forsa said it had requested third-party mediation, but had not received a reply. 
Ryanair, which is reopening much of its network on July 1, says it needs to cut staff costs to compete with rivals that have received state bailouts.

Union representatives have pointed to management comments about expansion opportunities likely to be triggered by the retrenchment of rivals in the wake of COVID-19.

In May, Iberia and Vueling, both part of IAG, secured 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of government-backed loans to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has tipped the airlines industry into its biggest ever crisis.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing 737 MAX certification flight tests to begin on Monday - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pilots and test crew members from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) are slated to begin a three-day certification test campaign for the 737 MAX on Monday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The test is a pivotal moment in Boeing's worst-ever corporate crisis, long since compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic that has slashed air travel and jet demand.
The grounding of the fast-selling 737 MAX in March 2019 after crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia triggered lawsuits, investigations by Congress and the Department of Justice and cut off a key source of Boeing's cash.
After a preflight briefing over several hours, the crew will board a 737 MAX 7 outfitted with test equipment at Boeing Field near Seattle, one of the people said. 
The crew will run methodically scripted mid-air scenarios such as steep-banking turns, progressing to more extreme maneuvers on a route primarily over Washington state. The plan over at least three days could include touch-and-go landings at the eastern Washington airport in Moses Lake, and a path over the Pacific Ocean coastline, adjusting the flight plan and timing as needed for weather and other factors, one of the people said.
Pilots will also intentionally trigger the reprogrammed stall-prevention software known as MCAS faulted in both crashes, and aerodynamic stall conditions, the people said.
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment.
The rigors of the test campaign go beyond previous Boeing test flights, completed in a matter of hours on a single day, industry sources say.
The tests are meant to ensure new protections Boeing added to MCAS are robust enough to prevent the scenario pilots encountered before both crashes, when they were unable to counteract MCAS and grappled with ""stick shaker"" column vibrations and other warnings, one of the people said.
Boeing's preparation has included hundreds of hours inside a 737 MAX flight simulator at its Longacres facility in Renton, Washington, and hundreds of hours in the air on the same 737 MAX 7 test airplane without FAA officials on board.
At least one of those practice flights included the same testing parameters expected on Monday, one of the people said.
After the flights, FAA officials in Washington and the Seattle-area will analyze reams of digital and paperwork flight test data to assess the jet's airworthiness. 
Likely weeks later, after the data is analyzed and training protocols are firmed up, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a former F-15 fighter pilot who has promised the 737 MAX will not be approved until he has personally signed off on it, will board the same plane to make his assessments, two of the people said. 
If all goes well, the FAA would then need to approve new pilot training procedures, among other reviews, and would not likely approve the plane's ungrounding until September, the people said. 
That means the jet is on a path to resume U.S. service before year-end, though the process has been plagued by delays for more than a year.
""Based on how many problems have been uncovered, I would be stunned if the flight tests are 'one and done,'"" said another person with knowledge of the flight plans.
""(The FAA will) make sure they find enough stuff wrong to demonstrate they are putting this jet through its paces. The last thing the FAA or Boeing wants is for the Administrator to do his own flight and say 'it's not ready.' Boeing wants Dickson's flight to be a coronation."" 
Regulators in Europe and Canada, while working closely with the FAA, will also conduct their own assessments and have pinpointed concerns that go beyond the FAA. They may require additional changes after the 737 MAX is cleared to return to service.

""This is new territory,"" said one industry source with knowledge of prior Boeing tests. ""There's a lot more play between regulators, and certainly a lot more pressure and public attention.""

A pilot scheme could involve at least two of China's largest banks getting the green light from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to conduct investment banking business on the mainland, according to Caixin.
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398) (HK:1398), the country's top lender, submitted a plan to CSRC in late 2018 seeking to set up a securities unit with registered capital of 100 billion yuan, Caixin reported. 
In contrast, Chinese brokerage giant  Citic  Securities (SS:600030) has registered capital of 13 billion yuan. 
ICBC declined to comment. CSRC didn't return an emailed request for comment.
Regulators' desire to break the wall between commercial and investment banking was fueled by mounting competition from foreign players, according to Caixin.
China scrapped foreign ownership caps in the brokerage business earlier this year as part efforts to fully open its $40 trillion financial industry. Global investment banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) have won regulatory approval for majority stakes in their Chinese ventures.
Currently, investment banking is off-limits to most Chinese banks, though Bank of China and China Development Bank control brokerage businesses onshore under special arrangements by the government. 

In addition, many Chinese banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) (CCB) and Bank of Communications (BoCom), operate investment banking through their Hong Kong subsidiaries.

COMAC said in a statement on Sunday that Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd (SS:601111), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp Ltd (SS:600115) and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) had received the aircraft, which has a 90-seat capacity, and would each take delivery of three ARJ21 aircraft this year.
Last August, the three carriers announced on the same day deals to each purchase 35 ARJ21-700 regional jets from COMAC, with deliveries scheduled from 2020 through 2024. 
The ARJ21 entered commercial operations four years ago and is China's first domestically manufactured airliner. 
COMAC has two other passenger jet programmes in development - the C919 narrowbody aircraft programme which is currently undergoing flight testing, and the CR929 widebody programme in collaboration with Russia.
China Eastern Airlines earlier this year launched a subsidiary - OTT Airlines - to operate ARJ21 and C919 airliners. It is slated to be the first customer for the C919, once the 160-seater plane receives airworthiness certification from the Chinese aviation regulator.
The C919 is a much more high-profile programme, that will place COMAC in direct competition with Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) in the single-aisle market. The United States earlier this year considered whether or not to block the sales of LEAP-1C engines to the programme, but it later relented.

The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on international travel has decimated the order books of both Airbus and Boeing.

The University of California, Los Angeles promised to fight the move.
The Baltimore-based company said in an emailed statement that it made the decision to terminate the agreement with UCLA - a member of the Pac-12 athletics conference - because ""we have been paying for marketing benefits that we have not received for an extended time period.""
The agreement with UCLA allowed the company to terminate the deal in such an event and it is exercising its right, Under Armour added.
""We are exploring all our options to resist Under Armour's actions,"" UCLA said in a statement. ""We remain committed to providing our hard-working staff and student-athletes with the footwear, apparel and equipment needed to train and compete at the highest level.""
Under Armour has competed with other leading apparel makers for agreements with major intercollegiate sports programs.
In May 2016 the company had hailed the agreement, which took effect in 2017, as ""the largest apparel deal in the history of the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association), reaffirming UCLA's status as a world-class institution and Under Armour's position as a global leader committed to collegiate athletics.""
Under Armour also has apparel deals with schools including Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Auburn, Texas Tech and Utah, according to its website. 
Company officials could not immediately be reached to comment on whether it would seek to end similar deals with other universities. 
Major peers that also have apparel deals with schools include  Nike  (N:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGn). Representatives of those two companies were not immediately available for comment outside normal business hours.

As part of the partnership, Under Armour was to have exclusively designed and supplied the footwear, apparel and equipment for training and game-day uniforms for all UCLA's men's and women's varsity athletic teams, the company had said.

(Reuters) - Workers at California's Disneyland Resort protested from their cars on Saturday, arguing that the Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) has not agreed to adequate protections for employees when the destination reopens to the public amid a pandemic.
The company had planned to welcome guests back to Disneyland and neighboring California Adventure starting July 17 but delayed the restart date indefinitely. 
Disney said this week that it would set a new opening date after the state issues guidelines on how theme parks can return to business safely amid the global coronavirus outbreak. 
On Saturday, about 200 cars formed a caravan outside the resort in the protest staged by the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions, a group of 11 unions that represent 17,000 Disneyland workers.
The unions have called on the company to commit to providing onsite testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
""When Disney does reopen, we want it to be as safe as possible for cast members, for the guests, and for the families that cast members have to go back to,"" said Maria Hernandez, a union member who attended the rally.
Disney said in a Saturday statement that it has reached agreements on coronavirus protections with 20 union affiliates that include additional sick pay, face coverings for guests and cast members, and reduced park capacity. 
In a letter to unions earlier this week, a Disney representative said existing COVID-19 testing was not recommended by U.S. health authorities for routine screening.
Instead, health officials recommend focusing on physical distancing, face coverings, hand washing and sanitization, the letter said. 

Disney began shutting its theme parks in January as the coronavirus spread. It has reopened parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to a limited number of guests. The company plans to open Walt Disney World in Florida on July 11.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) expects to have between 10% and 20% more workers than needed in July 2021, Chief Executive Doug Parker told employees at a town hall this week, and said that avoiding furloughs will be difficult.
Weathering a sharp hit to business due to the coronavirus pandemic, American and other U.S. airlines have warned of furloughs in October, which is when government payroll aid for airlines expires, but said they were hoping to avoid them. 
""It's going to be even harder than I thought,"" Parker said at an employee town hall on Wednesday, adding that ""revenue is not coming back as fast as we'd like."" 
A video recording of the town hall, which showed Parker wearing a protective face mask, was reviewed by Reuters.
As of the end of last year, American had 133,700 employees, more than any other U.S. airline. 
In October, American expects to have between 20% and 30% more workers than needed, Parker said, while adding that furlough decisions could revolve more around the July 2021 forecast of 10% to 20% excess workers, with potentially less pain for pilots than other employees such as flight attendants.
""It really makes zero sense to go furlough a pilot in October if you're going to need that pilot again in July,"" Parker said, noting the costly training needed to bring a pilot back from a furlough.
American's management has shared the job numbers with unions and was working on solutions, Parker said. The number of extra flight attendants is expected to be in the higher ranger, Parker added.
Under the CARES Act that gave the U.S. aviation sector a $32 billion bailout to cover payroll, airlines cannot force any involuntary furloughs before October and have been trying to encourage employees to accept voluntary exit deals.

Major aviation unions have asked the U.S. Congress to consider extending the payroll support package through March.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said late on Friday it will soon send warning notices to about 2,500 pilots regarding possible furloughs at the airline, as the industry takes a huge blow after the coronavirus pandemic slashed air travel demand. 
""In an effort to best prepare our pilots should furloughs be needed, Delta will send required notices to approximately 2,500 pilots,"" a Delta spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the so-called 'WARN' notices will be sent next week. 
Delta also reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) labor union on a pilot-specific voluntary early retirement option. 
The early-out plan is a meaningful step as the carrier is working to manage the impact of the pandemic and align staffing with expected flying demand, the company said.
A spokesperson for ALPA said after reaching the tentative agreement, Delta sent a letter, detailing pilot furloughs and early retirement option, that has been 'received poorly' by the pilots.
""Early retirements alone likely won't be enough to avoid pilot furloughs altogether, Senior Vice President of Flight Operations at Delta, John Laughter, said in the internal memo on Friday, adding that the carrier hopes it will not have to reduce jobs involuntarily.
The airline will continue its discussions with the union on an all-inclusive agreement that would contain a no-furlough commitment for two years, Laughter said. 
On Thursday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian had informed employees that the company is planning to add about 1,000 flights in August but not many more for the remainder of 2020. 

""While it's encouraging to see flights returning ... we likely remain at least two years away from a return to normal,"" Bastian said.

""The management board is of the opinion that continuation is in the best interests of the creditors,"" it said in a statement. ""Whether insolvency proceedings will be opened is still under review.""
Wirecard collapsed on Thursday owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The insolvency filing did not include the company's Wirecard Bank unit, which holds an estimated 1.4 billion euros ($1.57 billion) in deposits and is already under emergency management by BaFin, the German banking regulator.
""It is being continuously reviewed whether insolvency applications also have to be filed for subsidiaries of the Wirecard Group,"" the statement said. ""With the exception of a small development branch office, no insolvency applications have been filed by Group companies at present.""
The company said its bank would continue to carry out payments to merchants and that it was in contact with regulators and credit card companies.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed a number of requirements on Wirecard, including not to dispose of any assets or funds, and not carry out any regulated activities.
The company said it was in talks with the FCA about its Wirecard Card Solutions Ltd unit and was hopeful that it will implement measures that allow it to resume operations.
The European Union is investigating BaFin over the collapse of Wirecard, a rare measure that heaps embarrassment on Germany days before it is due to take over the EU's rotating presidency.

Investors want to know why EY did not spot problems in Wirecard's finances earlier.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil announced on Saturday that it had signed a $127 million agreement to start producing locally an experimental vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) that has shown promise to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The AstraZeneca vaccine is considered the world's leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development to obtain licensure and become an official vaccine against the disease, according to the World Health Organization.
The British drugmaker is already carrying out large-scale, mid-stage human trials of the vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Oxford University.
Elcio Franco, Brazil's No.2 public health official, said in a press conference that the country will initially produce some 30 million doses of the vaccine, half by December and half by January of next year. 
Franco said Brazil is paying for the vaccine but is aware of the risk, in case the vaccine does not pass all necessary licensure requirements or another vaccine obtains approval faster. 
The vaccine will be produced by Brazil's Fundação Osvaldo Cruz, also known as Fiocruz, the country's leading public health organization, Franco said. 
Brazil is the world's second most affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 1.2 million confirmed cases as of Friday and more than 55,000 deaths. 
Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for this response to the pandemic. He has dismissed the severity of the disease and has shown indifference to the rising death toll while also pushing treatment using an unproven anti-malaria drug.

Investing.com -- The FAANG stocks have had a good coronavirus crisis, but investors should start thinking about whether these gains can continue. Peter Nurse argues that the group is behaving like the dotcom's in 1999, before the bursting of that first internet bubble. Yasin Ebrahim makes the case that the group offers investors a chance to buy the dip amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus lockdowns. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bear Case
While the U.S. economy has struggled to recover from the mass unemployment and output collapse caused by the social distancing measures used to combat the virus, Wall Street has bounced back strongly from the initial crash, powered by all-powerful tech stocks.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), or the so-called Fab 5, making up 40% of the Nasdaq Composite Index, have shown to be big winners when the world goes into lockdown.
Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have all hit record highs this month, while Google owner Alphabet isn't far removed.
These stocks now have a combined market capitalization of over $4.7 trillion, meaning the market cap of the Nasdaq Composite is concentrated in the five largest stocks to a degree not witnessed since the peak of the Tech bubble at the turn of the century.
“The market has favoured these companies and they have been flavour of the month since the Covid pandemic erupted,” said Zehrid Osmani at Legg Mason affiliate Martin Currie. “The risk now is that these obvious beneficiaries of lockdown have been bid up a lot, and now it’s a question of what is in the price going forward.”
And they are starting to look expensive.
For example, Netflix is currently trading on a price/earnings ratio of around 94, which compares with 78.35 at the end of last year when the Covid-19 outbreak was not a consideration in any investors’ thought process. Amazon’s current P/E stands around 131, versus 80.31; Apple above 28, versus 23.20 and so on.
These companies are also all now facing a number of pressing fundamental issues.
Amazon and Google face the hard stare of regulatory scrutiny for possible anti-competitive business practices. Netflix is competing with a number of new rivals in streaming video as well as having to cope with the extremely expensive business of producing new content.
European competition officials have already announced investigations into both Apple’s App Store and its payment platform, Apple Pay, while the U.S. Department of Justice has long been rumoured to be on the verge of doing something similar.
Facebook and Google have already had to cope with a sharp drop in advertising spending during the coronavirus pandemic, and are going to have to compete with the major broadcasters for likely reduced advertising budgets going forward.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that U.S. advertising spending is expected to plunge by 13% this year, according to research from GroupM, a unit of advertising giant WPP (LON:WPP) PLC. It was only in December it was forecasting U.S. ad spending would rise by 4% in 2020.
The social media companies, including Facebook, have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order to roll back their legal protections after accusing them of trying to silence conservative voices.
On the flip side, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) announced Thursday it was pulling its advertising from Facebook, the biggest name so far in a growing movement to boycott the social network for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.
On top of this, Facebook and Google have been criticized for lack of data privacy and security.
Despite their valuations increasing during the crisis, the profits at the tech giants have actually fallen along with the rest of the market, said Societe Generale’s ultra-bear Albert Edwards in a research note late last month, and unless a cyclical recovery is on the cards this is set to continue.
“I personally suspect that this recession will ultimately expose these and the tech sector to be far more cyclical than appreciated. And it will be difficult in that environment to maintain their 32x forward PE,” Edwards added.

The SEC said in a statement on Friday it had obtained court approval of the settlements with Telegram and its TON Issuer subsidiary.
Telegram neither admitted to or denied the SEC's allegations.
The agency has been seeking to crack down on the fledgling cryptocurrency industry. SEC has taken the position that initial coin offerings are securities offerings and therefore subject to SEC offering rules, which require companies to file registration and disclosure documents.
""New and innovative businesses are welcome to participate in our capital markets, but they cannot do so in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws,"" said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's cyber unit.

The automaker's filing with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals comes less than a week after U.S. District Court Judge Paul Borman called GM's suit against Fiat Chrysler a ""waste of time and resources"" at a time when both automakers should be focused on surviving the coronavirus pandemic.
Borman ordered GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley to meet by July 1 to negotiate a resolution.
""As we have said from the date this lawsuit was filed, it is meritless,"" FCA said on Friday.
""FCA will continue to defend itself vigorously and pursue all available remedies in response to GM's groundless lawsuit. We stand ready to comply with Judge Borman's order,"" it added. 
In its motion, GM asked the appeals court to throw out Borman's order and reassign the case to a different district court judge. It called Borman's order ""unprecedented"" and ""a profound abuse"" of judicial power.
GM sued Fiat Chrysler last year, accusing the Italian-American company's executives of bribing United Auto Workers union officials to secure labor agreements that put GM at a disadvantage. Fiat Chrysler is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department as part of a wide-ranging probe of UAW corruption. 
GM's accusations came as Fiat Chrysler and French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) were in the early stages of preparing for a merger. Fiat Chrysler has said the suit was aimed at disrupting that deal. GM has said the suit has nothing to do with the merger.
In a statement, GM rejected Borman's characterization of the suit as a ""distraction"" and defended its decision to press the case.

""We filed a lawsuit against FCA for the same reason the U.S. Department of Justice continues to investigate the company: former FCA executives admitted they conspired to use bribes to gain labor benefits, concessions and advantages. Based on the direct harm to GM these actions caused, we believe FCA must be held accountable.""

840,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>","Investors eye economic data, stimulus measures as stocks rally stalls","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Upcoming U.S. economic data and deadlines for renewing some fiscal stimulus measures in July could prove key tests for an equities rebound that has wavered in recent weeks.
The benchmark S&P 500 has risen about 34% from its late March lows. But those gains have slowed in June, as investors weigh expectations of further stimulus and improving data against a resurgence in coronavirus cases in the United States.
Investors will look to a raft of U.S. data next week - including reports on employment, consumer confidence and manufacturing - for clues on whether a nascent rebound in the U.S. economy remains intact. 
Improvements in some economic indicators, such as home sales, manufacturing activity and an unexpected bounce in employment data last month, have bolstered investor confidence and helped extend the rally in stocks. But others, including scant declines in jobless claims, reflect a still-tentative recovery.
""There's some evidence that the economy is expanding, but how robust it will be is an open question,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP).
Market participants are also looking for clues on whether lawmakers are likely to push through more fiscal stimulus measures in coming weeks. 
The House of Representatives passed another $3 trillion aid bill in May, but the Republican-controlled Senate has not taken up the House package and lawmakers are not expected to move toward another coronavirus bill until sometime in July.
One component of Congress' fiscal aid, a $600 per week supplement to unemployment insurance payments, is set to expire at the end of July.
Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said that bill is critical to the bank's thesis for a ""V""-shaped U.S. economic recovery.
""Our outlook for the economy is probably going to have to change"" without further stimulus, he said. 
The looming deadline has added to a cluster of worries that have limited stocks' gains this month. U.S. stocks tumbled this week, including a more than 2% drop on Friday, in response to a resurgence in the number of cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Even with that recent pullback, stock valuations, as measured by forward price-to-earnings ratios, are near their highest level since the 2000 dot-com boom.
Other sources of worry include a potential flare-up in U.S.- China trade tensions and political uncertainty stemming from the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Some investors have already begun preparing for a potential market downturn by lightening their stock positions.
Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management, said he recently sold shares of some tech-related companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., in order to raise his cash allocation. Likewise, Richard Grasfeder, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private, has moved to a slight underweight position in U.S. equities.
In Grasfeder's view, it could take longer than expected to see the impact of additional stimulus in economic data and corporate earnings.
""It's going to take a while for those funds to flow through the economy,"" he said.
Nonetheless, many on Wall Street remain confident that further aid will pass, given the presidential and congressional elections this November, and that will help prop up investor sentiment. 
""My suspicion is it will happen before the July expiration,"" said Ameriprise's Joy. ""You wouldn't want to alienate your constituents unnecessarily.""
At the same time, some investors believe expectations that the Federal Reserve is ready to step in with further monetary support should the economy begin to falter will limit the downside in stocks and other risk assets. 
Still, expectations for future market gyrations, as reflected by the Cboe Volatility Index, have remained elevated. Some volatility watchers believe markets could be choppier than usual this summer as investors await the passage of further stimulus and additional signs of economic recovery.

""It's going to end up being a more volatile summer than traditionally is priced into the market,"" said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes tumbled more than 2% on Friday as several U.S. states imposed business restrictions in response to a surge in coronavirus cases.
Some U.S. states that were spared the brunt of the initial coronavirus outbreak or moved early to lift restrictions are seeing a resurgence in new infections. On Friday, Texas and Florida ordered bars to close down again.
""You're seeing a pretty dramatic increase in cases,"" said Kevin Grogan, managing director of investment strategy at Buckingham Strategic Wealth in St. Louis. ""If people start feeling again like it's not safe to eat out or go shopping, that could have a really negative impact on the stock market.""
A Wall Street Journal report that the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal could be at risk placed additional pressure on U.S. stocks. According to that report, Chinese officials warned that ""meddling"" in Hong Kong and Taiwan could lead Beijing to back away from its commitment to purchase U.S. farm goods.
""It added another log into the risk aversion fire,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, of the report on China.
Among sectors, financial, communication services and energy shares outpaced the broader S&P 500 in declines. S&P 500 bank shares plummeted 6.1% after the Federal Reserve limited dividend payments and barred share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter following its annual stress test.
Renewed concerns over the novel coronavirus pandemic have threatened to derail a strong rally for Wall Street that has erased much of the S&P 500's steep losses from March. The benchmark index ended below its 200-day moving average, an indicator of long-term momentum. 
The uptick in coronavirus cases likely triggered a test of that technical level, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 730.05 points, or 2.84%, to 25,015.55, the S&P 500 lost 74.71 points, or 2.42%, to 3,009.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.78 points, or 2.59%, to 9,757.22.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.87%, the Dow lost 3.31%, and the Nasdaq shed 1.87%.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares shed 8.3%, weighing the most on the S&P 500, after Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) joined an advertising boycott that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares dropped 7.6% as the footwear maker, hurt by store closures due to the pandemic, posted a surprise quarterly loss.
Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) shares surged 18.8% after the retail chain entered a 10-year deal with rapper and fashion designer Kanye West to create a line of clothing under his Yeezy brand.
Friday also marked the reconstitution of the FTSE Russell indexes, including the large-cap Russell 1000 and small-cap Russell 2000. Daily trading volume is often among its highest levels of the year during the reconstitution, though volume this year has spiked on several occasions amid steep market sell-offs.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.43 billion shares, compared to the 13.44 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 28 new lows.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",EU investigating German watchdog over Wirecard collapse,"By Jan Strupczewski and Huw Jones
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is investigating Germany's financial regulator over the collapse of payments company Wirecard in a rare move that heaps embarrassment on Berlin days before it is due to take over the EU's rotating presidency. 
Wirecard's implosion on Thursday, owing creditors almost $4 billion, is shaping up to be one of Germany’s biggest corporate scandals, and regulator BaFin has come under fire at home and abroad for not spotting problems sooner.
The European Commission has asked the EU's markets watchdog to assess if BaFin's responses to allegations of improprieties at Wirecard, which stretch back years, were adequate to protect investor confidence in EU markets, according to a letter from the Commission to the EU watchdog. 
News of the letter, seen by Reuters, came as the Philippines justice minister said Wirecard's former operations chief, under suspicion in Germany over the accounting scandal, was in the Philippines this week, but had left for China.
Separately, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Japanese investor SoftBank was planning to sue Wirecard's long-time auditor EY over the scandal. EY declined to comment and SoftBank had no immediate comment. 
Wirecard, which disclosed a $2.1 billion hole in its books, is the first member of the DAX stock index to go bust, barely two years after winning a spot among Germany's top 30 listed companies.
EY said the hole in the company's books was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
Auditors KPMG said in a review published in April it was unable to verify 1 billion euros in cash balances, questioned Wirecard's acquisition accounting and said it could not trace hundreds of millions of euros in cash advances to merchants.
In its letter to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Commission asked ESMA to undertake a ""fact-finding analysis"" into BaFin's response to the allegations and report back no later than July 15. 
It also asked ESMA to assess if there was any evidence of ""administrative or legal obstacles"" that hampered the enforcement of reporting requirements.
Germany will take the EU's rotating presidency on July 1. 
Allegations of financial impropriety have swirled around Wirecard for years and its implosion has triggered calls for an overhaul of corporate supervision. BaFin boss Felix Hufeld has described the scandal as a ""total disaster"".
BaFin could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
ESMA confirmed it had been asked to look at how BaFin enforced the EU's transparency directive, which covers financial reporting requirements for listed companies.
EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis could use the findings from ESMA's analysis to order a formal ""breach of union law"" investigation, requiring BaFin to provide information to ESMA.
If a breach is found, BaFin could be ordered by Brussels to make changes to its practices, an embarrassing situation for a national regulator.
Separately, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday it had imposed a number of requirements on Wirecard, including that it must not dispose of any assets or funds, and not carry out any regulated activities.

Wirecard, which is authorised by the FCA to issue e-money and provide payment services, must also say on its website that it is no longer permitted to conduct any regulated activity.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Friday it will start labeling newsworthy content that violates the social media company's policies, and label all posts and ads about voting with links to authoritative information, including those from politicians.
A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed its new policy would have meant attaching a link on voting information to U.S. President Donald Trump's post last month about mail-in ballots. Rival Twitter had affixed a fact-checking label to that post. 
Facebook has drawn heat from employees and lawmakers in recent weeks over its decisions not to act on inflammatory posts by the president.
""There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I'm announcing here today,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.
Zuckerberg also said Facebook would ban ads that claim people from groups based on race, religion, sexual orientation or immigration status are a threat to physical safety or health.
The policy changes come during a growing ad boycott campaign, called ""Stop Hate for Profit,"" that was started by several U.S. civil rights groups after the death of George Floyd, to pressure the company to act on hate speech and misinformation. 
Zuckerberg's address fell short, said Rashad Robinson, president of civil rights group Color Of Change, which is one of the groups behind the boycott campaign.
""What we've seen in today's address from Mark Zuckerberg is a failure to wrestle with the harms FB has caused on our democracy & civil rights,"" Robinson tweeted. ""If this is the response he's giving to major advertisers withdrawing millions of dollars from the company, we can't trust his leadership.""
Shares of Facebook closed down more than 8% and Twitter ended 7% lower on Friday after Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC said it would stop its U.S. ads on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the rest of the year, citing ""divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.""
More than 90 advertisers including Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co Ltd's U.S. subsidiary, Unilever's Ben & Jerry's,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and The North Face, a unit of VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), have joined the campaign, according to a list by ad activism group Sleeping Giants. 
One of Facebook's top spenders, consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble Co, on Wednesday pledged to conduct a review of ad platforms and stop spending where it found hateful content. P&G declined to say if it had reached a decision on Facebook.
The campaign specifically asks businesses not to advertise on Facebook's platforms in July, though Twitter has also long been urged to clean up alleged abuses and misinformation on its platform.
""We have developed policies and platform capabilities designed to protect and serve the public conversation, and as always, are committed to amplifying voices from under-represented communities and marginalized groups,"" said Sarah Personette, vice president for Twitter's Global Client Solutions.
""We are respectful of our partners' decisions and will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this time.""
In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman pointed to its civil rights audit and investments in Artificial Intelligence that allow it to find and take action on hate speech.

""We know we have more work to do,"" she said, noting that Facebook will continue working with civil rights groups, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, and other experts to develop more tools, technology and policies to ""continue this fight.""

(Reuters) - Albertsons Cos Inc (N:ACI) saw its shares fall in its New York Stock Exchange debut on Friday, a day after the U.S. supermarket operator downsized its initial public offering to $800 million.
Shares in the Boise, Idaho-based company ended trading 3% below their $16 per share IPO price, at around $15.51. 
It capped a disappointing stock market debut for Albertsons and its private equity owner, Cerberus Capital Management LP, which has been an investor in the company for 14 years and has been trying to take it public for five years. 
Albertsons on Thursday sold 50 million shares in the IPO at $16 apiece, missing its target of 65.8 million and below a $18-$20 target price.
Cerberus senior executives held discussions late Thursday with Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), one of Albertsons' IPO advisers, who advised them that $16 per share was as good a deal as they were likely to get in the current environment, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
JPMorgan declined to comment. Cerberus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The Albertsons listing ended the IPO market's longest streak of a deal not pricing below a company's targeted range since 2009, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks IPOs.
""Things are so volatile in this market,"" Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said in an interview. 
""Our perspective was that we are in for the long term,"" Sankaran added. 

The COVID-19 pandemic gave a boost to Albertsons' revenue as consumers stocked up on food during lockdowns. However, rival supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) has warned the surge in demand for essential goods it saw during the coronavirus outbreak was fading.

Other states, including Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, have reported a record daily increases in infections this week, taking the tally of new cases nationwide to 40,000  on Thursday, the highest one-day rise since the pandemic began.
Stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening, including energy, industrials, and financials were among the worst hit, with latter coming under added pressure amid slump in bank stocks.
The Federal Reserve voted to prevent banks from buying back stock and limit their dividend payments in the third quarter, after stress tests – design to test the liquidity of banks under extreme adverse economic events – flagged concerns that ""several banks would approach minimum capital levels"" under a worse case pandemic scenario.

Investing.com -- San Francisco is delaying reopenings that were scheduled for Monday as Covid-19 cases rise rapidly throughout California. The news came hours after officials in Florida and Texas also pumped the brakes on reopening efforts in those states.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 765 points, and closed down 730 points, to 25,015, as cities and states took action to rein in the spread of the coronavirus as infections hit an all-time high Thursday of 40,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. People under 40 are accounting for an increasing number of cases, which is why officials are focusing on gathering places like bars and restaurants.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed said the businesses scheduled to reopen Monday will not be opening on that day. And separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom recommended that Imperial County, near the Mexican border, reinstate its stay-at-home order.Florida, which attributed the new cases to young adults gathering at drinking establishments over the past month, confirmed almost 9,000 new cases of Covid-19 infections on Thursday, compared to the previous record a day earlier of 5,500. The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation said on Twitter that drinking alcohol at bars has been suspended statewide.
And in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott ordered bars closed as of Friday. “The targeted, measured directives in the executive order are based on links between certain types of businesses and services and the recent rise in positive cases throughout the state,” according to a statement. Hospitalizations have soared in the state.
“We want this to be as limited in duration as possible. However, we can only slow the spread if everyone in Texas does their part,” Abbott said in a statement. “I know that our collective action can lead to a reduction in the spread of COVID-19 because we have done it before, and we will do it again.”
Texas said bars and similar establishments could stay open for delivery and take-out, including alcoholic beverages, and restaurants can have dine-in service but not over 50% capacity. The state also closed rafting and tubing businesses and said outdoor gatherings of 100 or more people must be approved by local governments, with some exceptions.

Unilever (NYSE:UL) said earlier on Friday it will stop advertising on Facebook, as well as  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), for the rest of the year, citing hate speech and divisive content. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) joined the Facebook boycott on Thursday. Ad Age reported that Verizon spent $850,000 in ads on Facebook in the first three weeks of June. Honda spent $1.1 million in ads on Facebook in 2019, CNBC reported.
Facebook and Twitter shares both fell more than 7% to their lowest in more than a month.
Mark Zuckerberg posted a statement in the afternoon saying that Facebook would create a higher standard for hateful content in ads, though ""there is a public interest in allowing a wider range of free expressions in people's posts than in paid ads."" The company will also label some content and will remove anything that incites violence or suppresses voting, including if posted by a politician or government official. Facebook will also ramp up its Elections Operations Centers in the 72 hours leading up to election day to remove false claims about polling conditions, including any posts regarding false claims that immigration enforcement agents will be checking for immigration papers at polling places. 
The Anti-Defamation League accused Facebook of using $70 billion to allow “incitement to violence against protesters fighting for racial justice in America,” and for allowing for voter suppression.

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - A fast-track visa program that Canada launched in 2017 has attracted a growing number of tech workers, and U.S. President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown is set to further boost intake once COVID-19 restrictions ease, lawyers say.
The number of successful applicants to Canada's Global Skills Strategy (GSS) program rose five-fold over its first three years, with more than 23,000 workers approved under the top five tech categories, data provided to Reuters by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) shows.
More than 2,300 applications for those same top five tech roles were approved from January to March 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 shutdowns that led to border closures and a sharp drop in immigration. The program boasts a two-week processing time.
Immigration lawyers told Reuters they were broadly in favor of the program, which some described as transparent and consistent, and an example of how Canada has been able to take advantage of Trump's immigration stance since he entered the White House in 2017.
""There are employers who have non-U.S. employees in the U.S. who are definitely looking seriously at Canada,"" said Kyle Hyndman, a partner with McCrea Immigration Law in Vancouver, who was contacted this week by a ""major"" company about bringing employees to Canada.
On Monday, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers from entering the United States on certain visas, which a Trump administration official said would create 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers.
""The fact that people started contacting me pretty much the next day is perhaps a suggestion that there are going to be more people interested,"" Hyndman said.
U.S. technology companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) have in recent years expanded their Canadian operations, although most companies declined to comment on their GSS usage or how Trump's recent announcement will impact their hiring plans.
Tobi Lutke, the chief executive officer of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), was quick to tout the Canada's attraction following Trump's immigration move.
The program ""has made it possible to hire top talent beyond our borders,"" said Sandeep Anand, senior lead on the global mobility team at Shopify, adding that it has helped relocate employees to Canada.
The majority of approved applicants to the fast-track visa program were computer programmers and interactive media developers, followed by information systems analysts and consultants, the IRCC data shows. 
Indian citizens accounted for 62.1% of successful applicants to the fast-track program, followed by Chinese citizens. Nearly 1,000 U.S. citizens also have seen their applications approved.
The GSS data only covers the period up to March of this year, just before broader immigration in Canada fell off a cliff due to border closures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Lawyers, however, don't expect it to last.
Betsy Kane, one of the founding partners of Capelle Kane Immigration Lawyers in Ottawa, said the program is going to see a surge of applications.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a driver in a gig economy case that paves the way for a class action suit calling for Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc to recognize drivers in Canada as company employees.
UberEats driver David Heller had filed a class action suit, challenged by Uber, aiming to secure a minimum wage, vacation pay and other benefits like overtime pay. Drivers are now classified as independent contractors and do not have such benefits.
Heller's attorney said the decision allowing him to sue was important, but only a small first step in a case that will probably take years to litigate.
The ride-hailing company's contract allows arbitration, but not class-action lawsuits. After the ruling, an Uber spokeswoman said the company would amend its contracts ""to align with the court's principles"", without giving details.
""Going forward, dispute resolution will be more accessible to drivers,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement. 
Two days ago, California said it plans to ask a state court judge to force Uber and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) to classify their ride-hail drivers as employees rather than contractors.
Canada's 8-1 Supreme Court ruling dismisses an Uber appeal to an Ontario high court ruling that said the Uber's arbitration clause violates provincial labor rules and is ""invalid and unenforceable."" 
The arbitration process, which must be conducted in the Netherlands where Uber has its international headquarters, costs about C$19,000 ($14,500). Heller earned between C$21,000 and C$31,000 per year.
""This was an access to justice case,"" said Michael Wright, one of Heller's lawyers. The court essentially ruled that ""a stronger party was taking advantage of a weaker party in an unfair manner,"" said Wright.
Now Heller can restart his class action suit, Wright said, but the matter will not be settled soon. 
""This is the first round in a series of rounds,"" said Wright, a labor and employment lawyer with Wright Henry LLP in Toronto, adding that it could take ""a few more years.""

Uber shares were down 2.7% around noon Eastern Time.

858,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>","For Wells Fargo, New Scrutiny From the Fed Puts Dividend at Risk","(Bloomberg) -- Of all the banks facing stricter oversight after the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, none is feeling the pressure more than  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
New rules limiting dividends and stock buybacks in response to the Covid-19 pandemic leave the San Francisco-based company most exposed to potential payout cuts. That’s because the restrictions base dividend calculations on recent earnings, and Wells Fargo’s slumped 89% in the first three months of the year after multiple quarters of legal costs driving down profit.
“This only impacts WFC,” John Heagerty, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote in a note, referring to the company by its stock symbol. A Wells Fargo dividend cut “would not be an unexpected development.”
The new Fed requirements follow almost four years of the bank struggling to emerge from a series of scandals, beginning with the 2016 revelation that employees opened millions of potentially fake accounts to meet sales targets. Problems multiplied across business lines, burning through the firm’s ranks and keeping it in Washington’s crosshairs. In 2018, the Fed limited Wells Fargo’s growth until it addressed its lapses to the regulator’s satisfaction.
A growing chorus of analysts and investors were already predicting Wells Fargo would have to reduce its payout this year. The firm has offered the highest dividend yield of the largest U.S. banks in the last 12 months, and paid out $2.1 billion in dividends in the first quarter even as profit tumbled to just $653 million.
Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 6.5% to $25.58 at 1:04 p.m. in New York, compared with a 3.7% decline for the S&P 500 Financials Index. They’re down 52% this year.
A company representative declined to comment on the stress tests. The Fed has asked banks not to make statements until Monday.
New Formula
The central bank said Thursday that a bank’s dividend can’t exceed average quarterly earnings for the previous four quarters. Earnings power at Wells Fargo has declined with the economic meltdown. Unlike its biggest rivals, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., Wells Fargo doesn’t have a sizable trading operation benefiting from market volatility to soften the blow of the pandemic.
Wells Fargo earmarked $4 billion -- the most in a decade -- for soured loans in the first quarter, and Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said earlier this month that Wells Fargo will set more aside for bad loans in the second quarter than it did in the first three months of the year.
Still, there’s a chance the lender could keep paying its dividend. If second-quarter income matches the first quarter, its average for the past four quarters would be $2.2 billion, clearing it to continue paying out $2.1 billion in dividends.

Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said last month that the timing and pace of the economic recovery, as well as Wells Fargo’s ability to improve its results, will dictate the appropriate dividend level. He said that while the firm’s capital base is strong, earnings were weak in the first quarter and will remain so in the second quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A key step in the return to service of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX could take place as soon as early next week, two people briefed on the matter said on Friday.
 Boeing Co 's (N:BA) best-selling plane has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. A certification flight test, which is expected to last at least two days, is likely to take place starting as early as Tuesday but has not been finalized. The Federal Aviation Administration would then need to approve new pilot training procedures and complete other steps and would not likely approve the plane's ungrounding until September, the sources said.
A decision on the timing of the FAA's certification test flight could come by the end of the day on Friday, the sources said. 
Boeing shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading.
The FAA said on Friday that ""the team is making progress toward FAA certification flights in the near future. The FAA is reviewing Boeing’s documentation to determine whether the company has met the criteria to move to the next stage of evaluation. We will conduct the certification flights only after we are satisfied with that data.""
Reuters reported on June 10 that Boeing aimed to conduct a key certification test flight by late June.
Boeing also notified airlines of a fix to address safety concerns about the placement of wiring bundles on the aircraft earlier this month.
In March, Reuters reported that Boeing would separate 737 MAX wiring bundles, flagged by regulators as potentially dangerous, before the jet returns to service.
In early April, Boeing confirmed it would make two new software updates to the 737 MAX’s flight control computer. But it said software issues that prompted the updates were unrelated to a system known as MCAS that was faulted in both fatal crashes. Boeing is also adding new safeguards to the MCAS anti-stall system.

Investing.com - Wall Street fell sharply Friday, and is on track for a weekly loss as the spread of Covid-19 continues across to accelerate, forcing some states to pump the breaks on reopening efforts.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.15%, or 554 points, the S&P 500 lost 1.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.62%.
A sea of red washed over stocks on Friday as investor hopes of quicker economic recovery were dealt a blow after a surge in coronavirus cases prompted Texas and Florida to scale back reopening efforts.
Texas' Governor called a temporary halt to its reopening on Friday, shutting bars back down and scaling back restaurant capacity to 50%.
That drastic move followed similar measures to combat the outbreak in Florida.
Florida suspended the consumption of alcohol on the premises at bars statewide. 
Other states, including Alabama, California, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, have reported a record daily increases in infections this week, taking the tally of new cases nationwide to 40,000  on Thursday, the highest one-day rise since the pandemic began.
Stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening, including energy, industrials, and financials were among the worst hit, with latter coming under added pressure amid slump in bank stocks.
The Federal Reserve voted to prevent banks from buying back stock and limit their dividend payments in the third quarter, after stress tests – design to test the liquidity of banks under extreme adverse economic events – flagged concerns that ""several banks would approach minimum capital levels"" under a worse case pandemic scenario.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell more than 5%, while Goldman  (NYSE:GS) slipped more than 7%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. banks dropped on Friday, with  Wells Fargo 's (N:WFC) stock falling more than 6% and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) down 7%, after the Federal Reserve capped dividend payments and barred share buybacks until at least the fourth quarter after its annual stress test.
The S&P 500 banks index <.SPXBK> was down more than 5% and the S&P 500 financials index (SPSY) dropped nearly 4%, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500 (SPX) in Friday's broad market selloff.
The drop in bank shares is in part tied to worries about how well the economy is likely to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""Overall it does suggest that the Fed is concerned about the strength of the recovery, and the effect it will have on banks. I think it was expected by the market but not to this extent,"" Krosby said.
""The market is focused on anything that could jeopardize the economic recovery,"" she said.
The S&P 500 was down about 2% at midday Friday, with worries about a surge of new coronavirus cases in the United States also hitting the market. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) all were down roughly 5%. 
The Fed announcement late on Thursday followed a day of gains in bank shares after U.S. banking regulators unveiled new rules that will make life easier for large banks with complex trading and investment portfolios.
Wall Street analysts said some of the banks being hit the hardest on Friday, including Wells Fargo and  Capital One  Financial (N:COF), down 8.3%, have been viewed as among the most at risk of having to cut their dividends. 
Chris Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott, said Wells Fargo has been projected to pay out more in the third quarter than its average earnings from the previous four quarters.
But he said banks overall had already suspended share buybacks and the Fed limit on dividends as a percentage of past income will not affect all banks.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Customers of several British digital finance companies were unable to make payments or access their money on Friday after the collapse of German payments firm Wirecard caused disruption across borders.
Wirecard's implosion on Thursday, owing creditors almost $4 billion, led Britain's Financial Conduct Authority to impose restrictions on the company's UK unit.
That in turn forced firms that had been relying on Wirecard services to temporarily suspend their own, leading scores of customers to complain on social media about losing access to vital services - and money.
""Is my money safe? When can I get it back? Won't let me withdraw or pay a supplier. What the hell is going on???"" tweeted a customer of business account provider ANNA.
""It's awful I need my money as due to reopen my business next week,"" said another ANNA customer.
ANNA said in a statement that it had had to temporarily suspend customer cards and accounts and was working to restore services as soon as possible.
Card provider Curve said it had seen a temporary disruption to services and advised customers to use alternative payment methods, while account provider Pockit told its customers accounts would be inaccessible for a short period and it was working with the FCA to find a solution.
The FCA said so-called safeguarding rules protect and return customer money if a firm were to fail.
""Wirecard is required under the Electronic Money Regulations to maintain appropriate measures to safeguard customers' money,"" the UK financial watchdog said.
Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS, said the knock-on effects of Wirecard's collapse posed a big test for digital firms that often rely on backend services provided by bigger players.

""This could rebound not only on the companies in question, but also on the wider fintech industry as consumers question the newer providers they have recently adopted in large numbers.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks look poised to make up ground on Wall Street in the second half of 2020 as Joe Biden consolidates his lead over Donald Trump ahead of the November U.S. presidential election and a surge of new COVID-19 cases threatens the U.S. economic recovery.
The U.S. stock market has consistently outperformed Europe since the 2016 election of Trump, which was followed by a rally widely dubbed the 'Trump bump'.
Fund flows suggest a shift in sentiment. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s latest weekly report on Friday showed $6.6 billion left U.S. equity funds, the largest exodus in seven weeks, while $800 million made their way into European ones.
The pan-European STOXX 600 has outperformed world stocks by about 1.5% in the last month, while Wall Street's S&P 500 (SPX) has underperformed by the same extent.
Among factors boosting European assets is Europe's relative success in gradually reopening its economy and the European Union's proposed 750 billion euro ($841.73 billion) recovery fund to help countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. 
The spending plan, which could be approved in July, would bring the EU closer to a fiscal union and as such has boosted sentiment and soothed recurrent worries about peripheral euro zone countries such as Italy. 
The common currency has risen 4% since France and Germany unveiled a joint proposal for the recovery fund on May 18.

""The strengthening of the euro reinforces the appeal of European equities, particularly for U.S. investors"", said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
""There's a very strong re-rating potential for the European market which has long been underinvested and undervalued.""
Before the COVID-19 financial crash, the S&P 500 (SPX) had gained over 60% since November 2016, about twice as much as the pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX). 
""We are warming up to European assets as the region steps up its policy response and demonstrates relative success in tamping virus growth,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, told its clients on Monday. 
Similarly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its rating for Europe to ""overweight"" for the next three months, citing ""a combination of favourable tailwinds"".
Investors were pleasantly surprised this week when IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, reached 47.5, moving closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Meanwhile, the U.S. newsflow was less favourable, with record COVID-19 infections and jobs data suggesting the labour market could take years to recover. 
Opinion polls give Biden a substantial lead over Trump both nationally and in key states, and betting odds currently give the Democrat candidate a 60% chance of winning.
Goldman Sachs said the possibility of a Biden victory - and the possible reversal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts - wasn't fully priced into markets.
Given the uncertainty of the race and bearing in mind the surprise win of Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, many may choose to stay on the sidelines and wait for the dust to settle.
""European equities may get an edge over their U.S. peers as we get closer to the U.S. election,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s head of cross-asset strategy Andrew Sheets told Reuters.

Investing.com -- Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) jumped 31% to the highest in more than two years after providing guidance that outstripped expectations.
The discount retailer forecast second quarter adjusted EPS in a range of of $2.50 to $2.75 versus the current consensus of $0.84, and compared to $0.53 of adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2019.
Strong demand that started in mid-April is continuing with quarter-to-date comparable sales through fiscal June increasing well ahead of expectations. For the second quarter, the company expects comparable sales to be up by a mid-to-high 20%.
“Our strong liquidity position will support our ability to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases, while continuing to invest in high-return growth initiatives,” said CEO Bruce Thorn.
Big Lots reported net income of $49.3 million, or $1.26 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $37 million, or $0.92 per share a year earlier.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Friday that it will no longer restrict the number of seats sold on flights beginning July 1, in an effort to come back from the impact of the coronavirus.
The announcement comes before a meeting between the chief executives of major U.S. airlines, including American, and senior U.S. officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, at the White House to discuss several virus-related travel issues and to press for government-administered temperature checks for airline passengers. 
U.S. airlines are bleeding cash as travel suffers in the pandemic and some have warned capping seats sold on each flight to allow for more space between passengers is not viable.
American previously limited its seating capacity at 85% on each flight, or roughly 50% of the main cabin middle seats.
The company will notify customers if their flight will be full and allow them to move to more open flights when available, mirroring a United Airlines (O:UAL) policy.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) have said they will continue limiting seating capacity through September.
The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines' pilots, wants the government to subsidize empty seats to reassure people about flying.
American's shares lost 5%.
Airlines are touting deep cleaning and hospital-grade air filters. American said it had teamed with Vanderbilt University Medical Center on health and cleaning matters and will begin asking customers June 30 during the check-in process to certify they have been free of COVID-19 symptoms for 14 days.
U.S. passenger numbers have rebounded from lows reached in April, but there is growing concern about the impact of a fresh spike in coronavirus cases in many U.S. states, including Texas, where American is based.

U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Commitee, wants airlines to keep seats open, noting Congress awarded them $25 billion to cover payroll through Sept 30. ""Through that time period they can afford to operate with spacing,"" he told Reuters.

World stocks have been on a rollercoaster ride in the first half of 2020. Having slumped 35% from Feb. 20 to March 23, they are now within 10% of February's record highs thanks to lashings of fiscal stimulus, interest rates slashed to 0% or below in most major economies, and massive amounts of QE. Borrowing costs for high-grade U.S. companies have in fact fallen below January levels.
So what happens over the rest of the year? Much depends on whether another coronavirus wave comes crashing down, further testing policymakers. And if an effective treatment or a vaccine is found, the severest global recession in living memory could also turn out to be the shortest.
Nevertheless, the crisis has exposed weaknesses such as companies' high debt levels and their over-reliance on share buybacks.

2/LINES OF CONTROL
Asian market anxiety levels look set to rise another notch in coming days due to geopolitical tensions.
Hong Kong will be in the Chinese parliament's sights when it meets on June 28-30 to finalise a security law aimed at tackling separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
After a year of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests, the focus is on how far-reaching the law is, what activities constitute such crimes and what the punishment would be. Investors also want to know whether the laws will be retroactive or create new avenues for asset seizures.
China and much of Asia will also publish manufacturing surveys. But as North Korea's military threats ebb and flow and troops amass on both sides of a disputed part of the Indo-Chinese border, geopolitics will likely trump other factors.

3/PLEASANT SURPRISE
After the dire numbers of April and May, recent U.S. economic dataflow has delivered good news for the most part, helping keep stock markets within 10% of their pre-coronavirus levels.
On the heels of comebacks in employment and retail sales, Citi's U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which tracks economic data relative to economists' expectations, is at a record high.
Now the focus is on whether the rebound remains in force. Consumer confidence on Tuesday, manufacturing data on Wednesday and U.S. employment figures on Thursday - both weekly and monthly - are among reports due.
Non-farm jobs actually rose 2.5 million in May, versus April's record 20 million-plus plunge. Another improvement could allow markets to push higher - bar further coronavirus-linked lockdowns.

4/INFLATION WATCH
Economies are bouncing back from the COVID-19 shock, so will inflation follow? Preliminary June euro area data may offer clues.
Already, inflation expectations are reacting to data showing the worst of the economic gloom has lifted; a long-term gauge of where markets see euro zone inflation headed is just above 1% -- near its highest since early-March and almost 40 bps above record lows hit that month.
Some investors are already buying gold and other inflation hedging assets. But others say that if you dig deeper into activity indicators, they suggest little evidence of inflationary pressures picking up. And until that happens, expect the ECB to keep its foot on the stimulus pedal.

5/EUROPE'S TURNING TIDE
Is the U.S. share juggernaut slowing? Seems like it. In the past month, U.S. equities have underperformed world stocks by 2.5%; Europe outperformed by a similar margin. European stocks enjoyed investment inflows in three of the past four weeks, BofA says.
Behind the shift perhaps are the growing odds of a presidential election victory for Democrat Joe Biden, worsening U.S./China ties and the continued rise in U.S. coronavirus infections that prevent economic activity from fully resuming.
Europe, meanwhile, has largely controlled the virus spread, economies are turning the corner quicker than expected and a proposed EU recovery fund is speeding up euro zone integration.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are among those recommending clients shift focus towards European stocks, which lagged U.S. peers throughout the previous economic cycle due to a paucity of ""growth"" stocks.
European outperformance looks likely until at least November's U.S. election. Longer-term though, U.S. firms, such as tech names, may face headwinds from higher taxes especially from a Democrat administration. And in a world where investors attach increasing importance to environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, Europe's higher ESG scores will be a plus.

886,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Nikola’s Surge Puts Power in Company Hands to Force Warrant Call,"(Bloomberg) -- As Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) watchers wait to see how many pre-orders the company can rack up for its Badger pickup truck, a different countdown is set to begin for investors.
The upstart company trying to compete with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission early last week. When that filing is declared effective, a timeline will be set in motion that would allow Nikola to force investors to redeem outstanding public warrants early. The registration, declaration of effectiveness and forced early redemption are events with the potential to weigh on shares -- building tension between the company and warrant holders, and drawing a taut line between Nikola fans and short-sellers.
Attention on Nikola has been intense with its stock more than doubling since its merger with blank-check acquisition vehicle VectoIQ on June 4. The shares are a particular darling of the commission-free day-trading set, raising questions about how much of its quirky structure is understood by newly minted retail stock dabblers.
Shares of Nikola have “taken on a life of their own,” said George Kaufman, investment banking head at Chardan Capital Markets. “Volatility in the shares isn’t related to fundamental changes in the business.”
One lens into the pressures surrounding the stock focuses on publicly traded warrants that were a part of equity units sold at VectoIQ’s public debut. Once a registration statement governing the warrants is declared effective, it becomes possible for holders to give the company $11.50 to get one Nikola share. The stock opened at $72.09 on Friday.
Trading freely at $36, and incorporating the $11.50 exercise price, owning a warrant would seem to leave a lot of potential profit with shares trading at around $70. The gap between the two shows the stock’s stomach-churning volatility and the risk something happens to it between now and when the warrants are exercised.
The prospect of the warrants being declared effective may be one of the factors behind that gap. Already skittish after such a powerful rally, Nikola holders have shown themselves sensitive to the potential for fresh stock to hit the market.
Investors should expect a “near-term pull-back,” as the price discovery process is underway and the volatility seen in shares following its SPAC merger is “illustrative of the challenges involved,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Paul Coster said in an initiation report earlier this week. Coster has a neutral rating on shares and a price target of $45.
“In the very short term, we believe registration of the SPAC Warrants could lead to sale of about 30 million shares, and share registration should enable shorts to borrow stock, countering the effect of recent retail accumulation,” he said.
Wariness of that risk was on display in after-hours trading on June 15 when the registration statement was filed and shares fell as much as 12%, prompting founder and CEO Trevor Milton to explain on Twitter. That selloff was immediately reversed, with shares trading higher again within an hour.
As of Thursday, the registration statement had not been declared effective. The prospectus registered up to 23,890,000 shares of common stock underlying both public and private warrants. Nikola currently has 360.9 million shares outstanding, with about a third of that freely available to trade.
A company spokeswoman declined an emailed request to comment.
While bears have spent a lot of ink warning of the implicit danger of the warrant exercise, the possibility of it happening has never been a secret. Nikola’s shares have sat securely above $60 for nearly three weeks, even as discussion of possible dilution became common in chatrooms and other places where retail investors congregate.
Complicating matters, when the registration is declared effective, an event called a forced cash call can come into play, Chardan’s Kaufman said. If common shares close above $18 for 20 days within a 30-day period, Nikola can force warrant holders to pay $11.50 in cash per warrant in exchange for one share of common stock or surrender their warrants for essentially nothing.
“Short-sellers saw some relief and long-only investors saw some potential risk in the S-1 filing, believing the SEC would declare it effective quickly,” Kaufman said. “In most cases, the filing and the effectiveness of said filing can put downward pressure on shares, which may not be temporary.” Chardan was among the underwriters of the VectoIQ SPAC IPO that resulted in Nikola.
In effect, the sustained rally in Nikola shares puts power in the company’s hands to call the warrants once the SEC green-lights its registration statement and hurdles are met.
“Generally, a holder would want to hang onto the warrant rather than exercising it, so the ability to force the exercise is a pro-issuer provision,” Carol Anne Huff, co-head of Arnold & Porter’s capital markets transactions practice, said.
From Nikola’s perspective, a forced cash warrant exercise would give the company an injection of additional capital, but a short squeeze could make that kind of forced redemption trickier to pull off. Stock borrow fees spiked to a high of more than 700% last week due to a lack of shares to loan out, S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky said. And shares remain at lofty levels. Those who are hedging their warrants would be short the underlying common shares.
If shares continue to run, the company could alternatively force holders to exchange the warrants for a reduced number of shares without requiring a cash payment, or just leave the warrants out there. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc., whose shares also shot skyward after its public debut via a SPAC merger, did a cashless redemption. Virgin’s warrant holders received 0.5073 of a common share for each warrant surrendered.
Nikola can decide to take the dilution for no cash, which could result in warrant holders who fully hedged their position being short more shares than they would receive upon a cashless exercise. This could result in them having to top up in the public markets, exacerbating any short-squeeze, Kaufman said.
That would also open up the possibility for an additional equity offering, which, assuming shares stay aloft, could fetch more cash per share.
“Why use the cash call when there is a battleground between the shorts and longs, with the shorts losing? That’s a fair question,” Kaufman said. “This could be one of the instances where not forcing the cash out of these warrants has merit, but that would be a middle finger to warrant holders, many of whom are or were regular shareholders before the run-up.”

891,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Pandemic aid watchdog steps into partisan war over bailouts,"By Lawrence Delevingne, Chris Prentice and Koh Gui Qing
(Reuters) - Brian Miller would have one of the toughest jobs in Washington even without the cutthroat politics all around him. As America’s inspector general for pandemic relief, he’s charged with rooting out fraud in the spending of trillions of dollars in emergency aid.
But before even starting work, he was blasted by Democratic lawmakers who say he’ll be more of a lapdog than watchdog, citing his recent history as a lawyer in Donald Trump’s White House. And Trump himself - who in recent months has ousted a raft of inspectors general, prosecutors and other officials - signaled that he’ll keep Miller on a tight leash, forbidding him from reporting to Congress without “presidential supervision.”
How Miller, a Trump appointee, handles such pressures will test the administration’s willingness - or lack of it - to demand accountability in pandemic relief spending. Miller’s response also could make or break the reputation the veteran prosecutor and inspector general has built over decades.
Reuters interviewed more than two dozen people who know Miller or have insight into the job confronting him to understand how he might tackle it. Supporters from across the political spectrum expect Miller to investigate aggressively and impartially. They say he has prosecuted high-profile cases and weathered political controversy as an inspector general - including an uproar over an investigation he led that forced the resignation of the Republican chief of the General Services Administration (GSA).
But the new post - Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery - poses far higher logistical and political hurdles for the 64-year-old attorney, a Presbyterian elder who married his high school sweetheart and lives in a modest ranch house in Fredericksburg, Va.
Miller declined to comment for this story. He acknowledged that the position will be “very challenging and demanding” during his Congressional vetting on May 5.
Gordon Heddell, who has served inspector-general stints at the Labor and Defense departments, called Miller’s work “outstanding” in his job at the GSA. Still, Heddell said, any inspector general under Trump has to expect “a day of reckoning.”
White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews declined to comment on concerns that Miller’s independence could be compromised by his recent White House work and Trump’s record of firing inspector generals.
Miller’s appointment, announced in April, places him at the center of a roiling battle over transparency in pandemic spending. The administration initially fought to keep secret the names and loan amounts of recipients in a $660 billion program offering forgivable loans to businesses. The Treasury Department has since agreed to disclose information for awards over $150,000 - a threshold Democratic critics say will still hide most payments. The administration has said it will balance transparency concerns with protecting what it calls confidential business information.
The White House also took heat from lawmakers for issuing guidance they said allows federal agencies to ignore legislative mandates to collect and report details on how aid recipients spend the money to save jobs. The legislation calls for reporting that information to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee - of which Miller is a member. [nL1N2DV1ZA]
Miller's remit focuses immediately on a $500 billion portion of the aid package administered by the Treasury Department, such as airline bailouts and funding for Federal Reserve emergency lending. But the law opens the door for him to oversee other bailouts, including the business loan program.
Skeptics of Miller mostly cite his most recent job, as a senior associate White House counsel starting in December 2018. While he generally kept a low profile, Miller angered Democrats with a letter denying a Congressional watchdog agency’s information request related to the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.
“Trump is making appointments based on loyalty,” said Virginia Canter, ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a former White House lawyer under two Democratic presidents. “So you have to ask yourself: Can you commit yourself to representing the public interest when your past job was being the president’s lawyer?”
Democratic lawmakers have been more blunt. Trump “put a fox in charge of the henhouse,” said Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in a statement.
FROM THEOLOGY TO LAW
Former colleagues describe Miller as a serious and unpretentious veteran attorney. Before entering the law, Miller had planned a career in the church. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, and dual master’s degrees from nearby Westminster Theological Seminary. When he didn’t immediately find a position, he went to law school at the University of Texas, graduating in 1983.
Miller is active at the small Presbyterian church in the Washington suburbs, where his son is the pastor. His minister at a previous church, Bob Becker, calls Miller humble and grounded, with a “heart of service.”
After a few years in private practice, Miller in 1987 joined the Washington-based U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and in 1990 moved to the Justice Department, where we worked for 15 years. Some of his best-known work came as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, a high-profile outpost dubbed the “rocket docket” for its fast-moving cases.
During that time, Ed Gibson was a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent investigating money-laundering cases. He remembers Miller pulling him aside when he wanted a more severe punishment for a white-collar conviction. Miller asked Gibson something that sticks with him today: “Ed, is that really what you want? Isn't it justice you are seeking?”
Miller embraced difficult cases, including the complicated prosecution of a physician accused of overprescribing opioids - known as “Dr. Feelgood” - and that of Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the September 11, 2001 attacks.
“He was just tremendous,” said Gene Rossi, a fellow prosecutor at the time who credits Miller’s calm diplomacy with saving the opioid case.
TERRORIZING REPUBLICANS
Former colleagues say Miller didn’t hesitate to take on the Republican leadership of the GSA, a sprawling agency coordinating billions in spending.
During nine years there as inspector general, starting in 2005, Miller was an aggressive watchdog - so much so that the agency's chief, Lurita Doan, once suggested he and his staff were practicing a form of terrorism, according to a Washington Post report at the time.
Doan froze hiring in Miller’s office and tried to cut its spending. GSA staff filed complaints against Miller, and Congress members called on President George W. Bush to fire him, according to Congressional hearings and reports.
Undeterred, Miller revealed that Doan had steered a GSA contract to a friend, among other interventions. Congress excoriated Doan, who resigned under pressure in 2008. Doan denied wrongdoing at the time; she did not respond to a request for comment.
""What ultimately came out vindicated Brian,” said Ted Stehney, the former head of audits in Miller’s GSA office.
Miller later drove an investigation into a lavish GSA staff event near Las Vegas that resulted in the resignation of the agency's new chief, Martha Johnson, an appointee of President Barack Obama.
Ex-GSA chief Johnson - who was not directly involved in planning the conference and supported Miller’s investigation - called him a diligent auditor but said his passions could be small-minded. While he unearthed the conference spending abuses, Johnson said, “It was like 'really’?' GSA is in the thick of all-of-government spending - federal, state, local, tribal, war theater - and this is what he was fussing with?”
Miller is as parsimonious in his personal life as he expects others to be in government. Stehney, the former GSA colleague, said Miller has always wanted a Cadillac but never bought one.
“He loved to ride in mine, but he still drove his Honda hybrid,” he said.
'DUTY TO SERVE'
Some associates were surprised when Miller departed from his usual nonpartisan practices by taking a White House job.
Miller told a friend he wanted to get back to public-sector work after a stint in private practice, defending clients from government investigations. Miller told the friend that he “felt a duty to serve” when approached about the White House job.
The few details that have emerged from Miller’s White House work have fueled concerns over his independence.
Democrats called Miller’s denial of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) request regarding the impeachment inquiry improper. Miller downplayed the letter in the May Congressional hearing as “answering the mail,” saying he merely referred the matter to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which had previously responded, providing some information but denying other requests.
He also received an ethics waiver allowing him to continue working with current GSA head Emily Murphy after taking his White House role. While in private practice, Miller had advised Murphy during a GSA inspector-general probe into the cancellation of a relocation of the FBI’s Washington headquarters. The move could’ve hurt revenue at Trump's nearby hotel.
A friend of Miller from Washington legal circles, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he understood the raised eyebrows over Miller’s White House work.

“If I didn’t know Brian, I would be suspicious given what Trump has done with the IG community,” the friend said. “But he’s Brian. He will do his job, and if it means he gets fired for it, he gets fired for it.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday and were on course to end the week down, after a rise in new Covid-19 cases and a blast from the Federal Reserve reminded investors of the obstacles to a quick recovery.
The Fed had announced the results of its annual stress tests late on Thursday and had ordered banks not to buy back stock in the third quarter and capped their dividend payouts, aiming to ensure that they strong enough to absorb up to $700 billion in loan losses as a result of the pandemic.
As such, bank shares led the two old-economy indexes lower on Friday. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock all fell by between 4% and 5%.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 291 points, or 1.1% at 25,454 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite – unburdened by large-cap banks – was also down 0.8%.
The day's biggest gainer was Gap (NYSE:GPS), which soared 33% after announcing a ""multi-year"" partnership with rapper Kanye West to sell a Yeezy line of clothing, offering items such as hoodies, basics, T-shirts and joggers The new line is expected to appear in Gap stores and on Gap.com in 2021, the two parties said. West will keep sole ownership of the Yeezy brand.
After losing over 80% of its value since the start of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018, Gap stock has now nearly doubled from its March low, on hopes that it may escape the general apocalypse engulfing Main Street retail.
Earlier, the market was left cold by numbers showing that personal spending rebounded by a record 8.2% in May - albeit that was short of expectations of a 9% increase after the equally-record-breaking 12% drop in April. The rise is unlikely to be sustained due to the continuing high level of unemployment: jobless claims only just dipped below 20 million two weeks ago, according to data released on Thursday by the Labor Department.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.4% amid reports that the company had terminated two employees for failing to return to work as its Fremont factory reopened, even though it had previously given them leave to remain at home. Tesla was reported as saying it couldn't contact the employees in question.
In other markets,Crude Oil  futures and Gold Futures both drifted on profit-taking after big run ups in the last week as the week's news flow slowed to a trickle.

The consultancies estimate total U.S. vehicle sales to fall about 25% to about 1.09 million units in June, slowing from an over 40% plunge in April and a 29% decline in May.
""The industry continues to show signs of recovery in June,"" the consultancies said in a statement on Friday.
""The combination of pent-up demand, states relaxing coronavirus-related restriction and elevated incentives are all providing a tailwind for the industry.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - An external review panel in South Korea recommended that prosecutors should not indict Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee over a 2015 merger and alleged accounting fraud, the Supreme Prosecutors' Office said on Friday.
The recommendation could help pave the way for Lee's attorneys to challenge the justification for the prosecution's case to try him on charges stemming from the merger of two Samsung affiliates. 
The panel comprised 15 experts from fields including legal circles, academia, media and civic groups. Its recommendation is not binding, but the prosecutors have followed such panels' advice in all eight previous instances, legal experts said. 
""The majority of the external review panel composed of 14 members as one member did not attend the meeting, voted to recommend prosecutors not to indict Lee and halt the investigation against him,"" a spokesperson at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office said, 
Prosecutors said in a statement they plan to examine their final decision after evaluating their investigation's results and the external panel's decision.
Attorneys for Lee said in a statement they appreciated the decision from the panel. 
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office has the option to form such a panel when either prosecution or a defendant requests a review of experts, the ministry of government legislation said.
The recommendation is a boost for Lee's defence because the precedent of the panel review is in their favour, a criminal defence lawyer not involved in the case said.
""The prosecutors have to be affected by the panel's decision because now they're going to need to further justify their reasoning to bring Lee to a trial,"" the lawyer said. 
A Seoul court this month denied an arrest warrant request for Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.
Prosecutors had asked the court to issue an arrest warrant for Lee, 52, as part of a probe into alleged accounting fraud involving a Samsung drugs affiliate and a merger of two other affiliates.
They said fraudulent accounting and alleged stock manipulation helped facilitate Lee's plan to assume greater control over the Samsung Group. Lee's attorneys have denied the allegations. 

Lee was jailed for about a year, until his release in February 2018, for his role in a bribery scandal. He was accused of giving horses to the daughter of a confidante of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye to win government support for the merger of the two affiliates.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A New York court has sent subpoenas to Etihad and ratings agency Fitch this week seeking a document at the centre of a battle over $1.2 billion in debt issued by the Abu Dhabi carrier and airlines it partly owned, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters. 
Investors, including fixed-income specialist BlueBay Asset Management, are seeking access to a ""debt assumption agreement"" signed by Etihad and Alitalia, the Italian carrier, in 2016, before Alitalia went bankrupt.
Etihad issued bonds in 2015 and 2016 through an Amsterdam-based special purpose vehicle, EA Partners (EAP), which then distributed the money to Etihad and other airlines, including Alitalia. 
According to EAP filings with the London stock exchange and a Fitch report in May 2017, Etihad agreed to cover the debt owed by Alitalia under the debt assumption agreement.
The investors believe the document will help them recover part of the money they invested in the bonds and sought access to it in a lawsuit filed on June 16 with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Reuters reviewed a copy of the lawsuit. 
Judge P. Kevin Castel approved their request and subpoenas were hand delivered to registered agents of Fitch and Etihad in New York ordering them to disclose the debt agreement, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters.
Etihad and Fitch declined to comment. They each have until July 7 to respond to the order or object, said a source familiar with the matter. Alitalia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for BlueBay referred a request for comment to the investor group, which said it had been looking to engage consensually with Etihad and its affiliated airlines.
""We are exploring our options, but remain open and willing to engage with Etihad,"" the group said in an emailed statement.
The bondholders' request follows previous attempts to find solutions to restructure the debt, including a proposal submitted in April, to which Etihad has not responded.

The state-owned Abu Dhabi carrier spent billions of dollars on airline acquisitions that failed to deliver expected returns. Some of the airlines that Etihad went into partnership with have since gone bankrupt and the bonds issued in 2015 and 2016 now trade at around 45 cents in the dollar.

Climate advocates have increased the pressure on Africa's largest bank by assets in recent weeks after it declined to table two climate-related resolutions from activist shareholder, JustShare, at the AGM. 
Activists from JustShare and other groups flooded the virtual meeting with questions and concerns about Standard Bank directors with ties to fossil fuels, its climate-related disclosures and its involvement in projects including a Ugandan crude oil pipeline and gas developments in Mozambique.
""Please can you explain how the development of massive new oil and gas projects in Africa, many of which Standard Bank is involved in funding, are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement?"" Tracey Davies, director of JustShare, wrote, referring to the 2015 pact signed by almost 200 countries.
In response, David Hodnett, group chief risk and ethics officer, said that agreement recognised that the transition to a greener economy will take longer in Africa especially where access to affordable energy constrains development. 
South African lenders have not kept pace with international peers on issues including the end of funding for coal-fired power projects, leaving some concerned they were not being proactive enough on climate change.
Standard Bank CEO Sim Tshabalala said it was firmly and irrevocably committed to tackling the climate emergency, and that work was underway on some of the issues at the centre of the resolutions proposed by JustShare. 
The bank told Reuters after the meeting it aimed to make its first climate-related financial disclosures in the next three or four months, and outline a policy on lending to oil and gas projects by the end of the year. 
JustShare also recently sent letters to shareholders calling on them to vote against the re-election of five non-executive directors because of their links to fossil fuels, such as holding board positions at energy companies. 

Shareholders voted in favour of the re-election of all five directors on Friday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN), fresh from settling U.S. charges over alleged kickbacks to doctors, is preparing for a key meeting next week with U.S. prosecutors that could lead to the resolution of a decade-old bribery scandal.
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $346 million agreement from Novartis to settle U.S. criminal and civil charges that they bribed doctors, hospitals and clinics in Greece and Vietnam.
While Novartis said the package resolves all its pending Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, another, potentially larger payment is looming: A decade-old whistleblower case in which the U.S. government accuses it of paying millions in kickbacks to doctors to prescribe its drugs. 
A Novartis spokesman declined comment on a possible settlement and on its meeting with U.S. prosecutors.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe has ordered a July 2 conference in that case, for both lawyers and the public, which would be the first court-ordered meeting in the matter since mid-2019 as the two sides discussed a settlement. Novartis has set aside $700 million.
Novartis's deal this week brings outlays in alleged corruption cases to about $1 billion over the last decade, and is a reminder of the Basel-based drugmaker's struggles to exit an era when it regularly tangled with prosecutors over its sales force's behavior. [https://reut.rs/2BeTbqV]
""This is not good for the company's momentum,"" said Michael Nawrath, a Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst who rates Novartis shares ""overweight."" ""Often Novartis is the one dealing with such breaches. We'll see to what extent Novartis will be free from future violations.""
Novartis shares were down 0.13%, the worst performer on the Swiss benchmark index, with almost all other companies and the broader European Health Care index (SXDP) trading positive by 1057 GMT.

Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan has during his 2 1/2 year tenure had to grapple with what he has termed ""legacy"" ethics issues including fallout from hiring U.S. President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen as a consultant and U.S. generics price fixing, which resulted in a $195 million settlement in March.

China in April passed a law, taking effect in September, that holds carriers and importers responsible for the return and disposal of solid waste that fails to meet import requirements.
It plans a blanket ban on solid waste imports by end-2020 for environmental reasons.
""This legislation is applicable to all solid waste cargo such as waste paper, waste plastics, waste metals, waste chemicals etc,"" said a June 12 Hapag-Lloyd notice to customers, a copy of which a company spokesman provided in an email.
Any violation ""will result in a customs-ordered return of shipment and possible fine may be imposed,"" it added.
Hapag-Lloyd is the latest shipping line to confirm it will stop accepting China-bound solid waste shipments after MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company said it earlier this month it had instructed its shipping agents worldwide to reject such bookings.

Solid waste purchased under approved quotas can still enter China by the end of the year but the prompt action by shipping lines raises the prospect of disruption to supply in the latter months of 2020.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","U.S. lenders, businesses brace for disclosure on small business pandemic aid","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans will soon get a first full look at which businesses received $515 billion of taxpayer funds when the government, after initial resistance by President Donald Trump's administration, releases borrower data for one of its highest- profile pandemic aid efforts.
The colossal data set for the Paycheck Protection Program, to be released by the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration in the coming days, will provide transparency for a first-come-first-served program that from the outset was plagued by technology, paperwork and fairness issues.
That could make life uncomfortable for borrowers that broke the spirit or letter of the rules, and for banks that shoveled the money out the door. The aim of the $660 billion program was to help cash-strapped companies keep workers employed and make rent. 
""There's a level of anxiety,"" said Suzie Saxman, a partner at Chicago-based law firm Seyfarth Shaw. ""I've said to everybody: Prepare to be disclosed, prepare to be audited.""
The Treasury and SBA said they will release a swath of information, including the names, addresses, loan amount ranges and jobs supported for businesses that received $150,000 or more. That should account for roughly 75% of the dollars granted, but only 15% of the 4.7 million loans.
The agencies have not said when they will release the data. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin initially refused to release the data, saying it included proprietary business information. But under pressure from lawmakers, he agreed to shine a light on large borrowers.
""The opportunities for waste, mismanagement, abuse and corruption are enormous, and we just can’t know unless we have the information,"" said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president at the Washington-based government watchdog group Public Citizen.
BACKLASH
Launched in April, the program allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply for a forgivable government-backed loan from a bank, the largest-ever of its kind. 
In the scramble to distribute funds, the program was beset by technology glitches, documentation snags and revelations that some banks prioritized their most profitable clients. As a result, more affluent companies got funds, while less well-heeled borrowers missed out.
Those revelations left lingering questions on whether the most needy benefited. 
To date, the SBA has released broad distribution figures for states, industries and the largest lenders. But the new data will paint a much more detailed demographic picture of which local communities and sub-sectors received support and whether it helped save jobs. 
While that is important data for economists and policy wonks, businesses and banks are preparing for more backlash. 
""The industry understands the need for transparency around this program but believes SBA, Treasury and Congress should treat the release of this information carefully,"" said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association.
On Monday, the National Federation of Independent Business asked Mnuchin to halt the data release. 
Beyond the risk of negative headlines or regulatory scrutiny, businesses worry that securing aid could scare off clients and vendors, or that companies working from their home address could be exposed, said Seyfarth Shaw's Saxman. 
For others, the data will be insufficient. 

Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), Democratic chair of the House Financial Services Committee, this week said the data would provide ""minimal disclosure"" since, while covering the majority by value, it would not include most of the loans issued. She called for the full data set, adding: ""We must ensure the administration’s transparent and responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.""

""Only with our own e-architecture can we fully exploit the advantages of an electric vehicle,"" Manfred Schoch told Der Spiegel magazine.
Schoch said a dedicated electric platform is needed if the German luxury carmaker is not to be overtaken by competitors from California - like electric car company Tesla (O:TSLA) - or from China.
Spiegel said Schoch's call comes after some BMW managers have pushed for a new electric strategy internally for some time.
Those managers hope that the company will now quickly shift to develop a pure e-platform, which would make cars lighter and give them a longer battery range and a bigger interior.
Asked about the report, a BMW spokesman said the company was currently ""optimally positioned"" and declined to comment on speculation about internal discussions.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Friday, amid caution as the country battles mounting numbers of Covid-19 cases, hampering efforts to reopen the economy. Bank stocks will be under pressure after the Federal Reserve imposed new restrictions on the sector.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 30 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 19 points, or 0.1%. 
Wall Street closed higher Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.2%, while the S&P 500 index added 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.1%. The DJIA and S&P 500 are on course to record their second losing week in three, but the Nasdaq is still set to post its fifth positive week in six.
At least 20 million people in the US may already have been infected with Covid-19, according to the latest estimate by the Centers for Disease Control, around 10 times higher than the reported figure.
This comes as the states of Texas and Florida halted their reopening as infections and hospitalizations surged. The U.S. registered a new daily record of over 37,000 new cases on Thursday.
Banks will be in focus Friday after the Federal Reserve said late Thursday that it would impose a cap on dividend payments as well as halting share repurchases for the next three months. 
The limits were imposed after the central bank’s latest stress tests on the sector showed significant capital losses for lenders when tested against the economic impact of Covid-19. All banks were also required to resubmit their capital plans later in their year.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) reported its first quarterly loss in two years after hours Thursday, with a sales decline of 38% year-over-year. Digital sales soared 75%, representing about 30% of total revenue, as shoppers were channeled by lockdowns to Nike’s website for sneakers and workout gear. 
Economic data will center around U.S. personal income and spending Friday. Personal income in May is expected to have declined by 6% compared with a jump of 10% for the previous month, while spending figures may show an increase of 9% compared with a 14% retraction in April as some U.S. states started to reopen. 
Oil prices rose Friday, helped by signs of fuel demand recovering globally, with traders tending to overlook the increase in coronavirus infections in many U.S. states and the recent build in inventories which suggest a revival in U.S. crude production.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $39.03 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $41.53.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,773.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1229, up 0.1%.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) said on Friday it is planning to slash up to 1,680 jobs in Europe, confirming what two sources familiar with the matter had previously told Reuters.
One source said the cuts would be carried out over three years. The sources declined to be identified because the plan had not been announced officially.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Sanofi was considering cutting hundreds of jobs and would discuss potential steps with staff representatives on Friday and June 29.
A source said Sanofi would be focusing on efficiency gains through increased digitalisation and IT outsourcing.
The plans are part of a broader strategy outlined in December by the group's chief executive Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD), who joined Sanofi in September last year.

In December, Sanofi said it was targeting 2 billion euros ($2.24 billion) in cost savings by 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is seeking the final documents to complete an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), said three sources familiar with the probe, which is expected to end with a lawsuit this summer.
State attorneys general have separate probes into Google, and the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has ongoing investigations into Google, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
The department has requested information by the end of June from companies concerned about Google's abuse of its advertising clout, as well as those with data that could be used to support a complaint against Google, the sources said, noting that the deadline could be extended. 
They did not say what the complaint would allege.
Justice Department officials and some state attorneys general will hold a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the probe, a person briefed on the matter said.
Google, which provides free web searches, email and other services, makes money through advertising. Google controls a third of the world's online ad spending but 90% of the market for some ad tech tools. This includes Google Ad Manager, software that publishers use to sell space for display ads.
Google has also been accused of abusing its dominance of Android, its smartphone operating system. Platforms such as  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) say Google favors its own products in search results.
The Justice Department declined to comment. Google had no immediate comment.
The dozens of state attorneys general led by Texas which are also investigating Google will certainly be asked to join the federal lawsuit, and many will likely do so, one of the sources said.
""They're not joined at the hip but there is a lot more coordination,"" the source said.
Google's defenders, like Washington-based tech trade group NetChoice whose members include Alphabet, say digital ad prices have fallen sharply in the past decade as competition has increased. 
The state attorneys general focusing on Google are considering going after the company for privacy lapses by using statutes that bar deceptive practices, according to one source.
State laws barring unfair and deceptive practices can be interpreted broadly and sometimes carry heavy financial penalties, especially if the number of violations is large. Arizona and New Mexico already have sued Google over allegedly deceptive privacy practices this year, seeking $10,000 and $5,000 respectively per violation of their state statutes.
The government's probes of Google bear striking similarities to its probe of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in the 1990s when it provided the dominant operating system. Like Microsoft, Google was first investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. In both instances, the Justice Department and the states then began their probes.

The Justice Department won a trial against Microsoft in 1998 which was overturned on appeal and remanded. The two sides settled in 2001.

914,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: FTSE Leads Europe Higher as U.K. Abandons Quarantine Plan,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are ending the week on a strong note after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said that the worst of the pandemic is over.
""We probably are past the lowest point and I say that with some trepidation, because of course there could be a severe second wave,"" Lagarde told an online event.
That view underlines one of the major reasons why, for once, Europe may be set for a spell of outperformance vis-à-vis the U.S. market: its success in bringing the coronavirus under control.
According to data from the European Center for Disease Control, infection rates have stabilized at low levels in Europe this month, despite a general relaxation of the lockdown measures that were imposed in March and April.  Isolated outbreaks – such as the one in German meat-packing plants that led to a fresh lockdown in the Guetersloh district of North Rhine-Westphalia – have been just that: isolated.
That’s not to say that the continent’s success has been uniform. The U.K. and, especially, Sweden are paying the price for earlier misjudgments in their policy response.  And scenes from Britain's beaches on Thursday - with massive crowds and no sign of social distancing, will certainly stoke fears that the U.K. could experience the same fate as the U.S. since Memorial Day.
But the U.K. is still confident (or desperate) enough to have ordered the reopening of most service-sector entities this week, and on Friday abandoned its plans for a sweeping quarantine of all visitors from abroad, a plan that had drawn outrage and threats of legal action from the beleaguered travel sector.
The FTSE 100 was the best performer of the major indices on Friday, rising 1.4%, while the Stoxx 600 rose 0.9% and the German DAX rose 0.7%. U.K. tourism-sensitive stocks were among the biggest gainers: IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, rose 3.5%, while EasyJet, fresh from its capital raising exercise earlier this week, rose 3.3%.
That’s not enough to stop most European markets being down on the week, however: a result of the drag on world markets caused by the surge in new Covid-19 infections in the U.S.  Lagarde, ominously, warned that the rebound would be ""uneven"", ""incomplete"" and ""transformational"", meaning some companies in industries such as air travel and entertainment would never recover although others would come out stronger."

The company sold just over 423 million shares at $9.50 apiece to raise about $4 billion, while a separate, previously announced equity units offering raised just under $1.20 billion, giving it net proceeds after costs of around $5.15 billion.
The share offering was at a 2.4% discount to the stock's Thursday close.
The fund raising took place days after a U.S. bankruptcy court approved the company's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, taking it a step closer to exiting from bankruptcy.

Earlier this month, PG&E had said that it would be raising $5.75 billion from public offerings.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Investors see 'king of distress' Apollo having its best ever crisis,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A credit crunch is hitting many indebted companies, and Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) never had it so good. 
The private equity firm's shares hit an all-time high earlier this month, outperforming its peers, as investors bet it can invest its $40 billion of unspent capital in cash-strapped companies that are struggling in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Central banks and governments around the world have unveiled a raft of credit support and economic programs to help businesses. However, aid is often limited for companies with weak credit ratings, driving many of them into the arms of Apollo and other private equity firms. 
Since the onset of the crisis, Apollo has invested $1.2 billion alongside Silver Lake Partners in  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE), whose online booking business was hit hard by the coronavirus-induced stay-at-home orders and travel bans. Apollo also provided $250 million to U.S. pipeline operator  NGL Energy Partners LP  (N:NGL) to refinance existing loan facilities. 
While other private equity firms, such as Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and Ares Management Corp (N:ARES), are also very active in this space and have seen their shares rally, Apollo's stock has outperformed because of the New York-based firm's record of capitalizing on such opportunities, analysts and investors have said. 
""The market has a fair amount of confidence in Apollo's ability to invest in credit,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Gerald O'Hara, who has a ""buy"" rating on Apollo's stock. 
Inspiring this confidence are some of Apollo's returns. Apollo Fund VII, a private equity fund launched during the 2008 financial crisis, generated a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 24% as of March this year. 
By comparison, an index measuring the net IRR of U.S. private equity funds gained 14.4% over the most recent 10-year period, according to data compiled by investment adviser Cambridge Associates LLC. 
Unlike many of its peers, Apollo has the ability to carry out leveraged buyouts and credit investments from its flagship private equity funds. It also had dedicated credit funds managing $210 billion in assets as of the end of March, $105.6 billion of which is devoted to corporate credit. 
By comparison, peers Blackstone, KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) had credit fund assets of $129 billion, $68 billion and $49 billion, respectively, as of the end of March.
Apollo also generates a higher fee-related earnings margin than its peers, because half its assets under management are in permanent capital vehicles as opposed to funds it has to replenish. It manages the investment portfolios of insurance companies such as reinsurer  Athene Holding Ltd  (N:ATH). ""Their fee-related earnings have held up well,"" O'Hara said.
Mitch Rubin, chief investment officer at RiverPark Funds, said the reliability of Apollo's fees revenue was a key consideration in his decision to acquire shares of the private equity firm following the coronavirus outbreak.
""When the market saw that Apollo's investment in Athene wasn't going to be a drag, the stock rebounded strongly,"" said Rubin. RiverPark Funds is also an investor in Blackstone and KKR.
CLAWBACKS 
Apollo's shares dropped more than its peers in the market downturn before outperforming them in the rally. This is because the stock market bounceback boosted the value of Apollo's assets and eliminated any need for the firm to return some of the performance fees it was paid by its fund investors, according to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Bill Katz. 
The fact that these fees can no longer be clawed back has made Apollo's shares more attractive to investors. 
""The clawback risk has been erased because of the market coming back,"" said Katz, who recently downgraded Apollo's stock from ""buy"" to ""neutral."" 
Analysts cautioned that there is no certainty that Apollo shares will sustain their rally given that a resurgence of coronavirus infections and a new slump in global markets could cause the threat of clawbacks to resurface or derail its fundraising. 
""Even though its shares have rebounded, Apollo has had severe pressure on its investment performance and its stock touched lows when the market was at its lowest point,"" said JMP analyst Devin Ryan.

917,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Chinese Firms Are Pricing Their U.S. IPOs Above Range,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors seem to be brushing off the headwinds for Chinese companies looking to list in the U.S.
Rising tensions between the U.S. and China as well as the spectacular downfall of a high-profile Chinese startup amid allegations of accounting fraud had clouded the outlook for companies from the Asian country looking to list in New York. But in the past month, four Chinese companies have priced their initial public offerings above their ranges, a sign of strong demand.
The latest was Agora Inc., a developer of real-time video and voice communications software, which raised $350 million after pricing its U.S. IPO at $20 per share, $2 above the upper half of its range. Biotech firms Genetron Holdings Ltd, Burning Rock Biotech Ltd. and Legend Biotech Corp -- a spinoff from Hong Kong-listed Genscript Biotech Corp. -- also priced their IPOs above their indicative ranges.
The strong appetite for these deals ends a more than one-year hiatus for Chinese firms pricing U.S. listings above their ranges, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last company to price higher than expected was ATIF Holdings Ltd. in May 2019, which has since dropped 62% from that price.
Last year was notable for reduced deal sizes and poor performance among Chinese firms listing in the U.S. as investor appetite for the companies waned. Of the 33 companies from China that listed in the U.S., 14 had to cut their deal size, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Large investment banks began to scale back their work on some of these IPOs, worried about reputational risks and reduced fees.
After Starbucks-challenger  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) Inc. plunged in April when it revealed an internal investigation into the fabrication of hundreds of millions of dollars of sales, the sentiment around Chinese companies became even less positive. On top of that, relations between the U.S. and China have been deteriorating sharply and threatening to affect Chinese companies’ access to the deep U.S. capital markets.
The recent above-range pricings can partly be attributed to a widespread boom in demand for health-care and biotech companies, which are riding a peak of investor interest globally. Genetron also boosted the number of shares it sold in its IPO -- it is rare to see a company price above the range and sell more shares -- although judging by its 16% drop, it may have pushed the envelope too hard. Other Chinese firms to have completed successful U.S. IPOs since the Luckin scandal are in different sectors than the former high-flying startup, be it cloud computing or online delivery, suggesting investors are open to select companies.

LONDON (Reuters) - Markets showed signs of optimism on Friday, with European shares opening higher and oil prices rising despite a record number of new COVID-19 infections in the United States.
They rose across the U.S. by at least 39,818 on Thursday, the largest one-day increase of the pandemic. The governor of Texas temporarily stopped the state's reopening on Thursday as infections and hospitalisations surged. 
But European shares opened higher, with the Stoxx 600 up 0.8% (STOXX) and London's FTSE 100 up 1% at 0736 GMT (FTSE).
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.3%, extending gains from late on Thursday.
""Even though we continue to see some pretty scary virus numbers coming out of the U.S., it's not really dented sentiment – not to any sustained degree at least,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Graf said that recent temporary downward corrections of market optimism have had very little follow-through.
The possibility of a second coronavirus wave and renewed lockdowns has limited market impact because if lockdown measures resume then markets expect this to raise the likelihood of more fiscal support for economies.
""There is a disconnect between what you feel should be the case looking at virus numbers and equities and riskier currencies holding up relatively well and volatility receding, but at the same time we've never seen a policy response like this, not in the last 80 years at least,"" Graf said.
Having risen between 0500 and 0700 GMT, the dollar fell in early London trading to 97.317 against a basket of currencies by 0745 GMT (=USD).
The riskier New Zealand dollar was up 0.2% , having spent most of June at the level it was at before the coronavirus crisis for markets peaked in March.
Oil prices rose on Friday, extending gains on optimism about a recovery in fuel demand worldwide, despite signs of a revival in U.S. crude production.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) futures gained 26 cents, or 0.7%, to $38.98, while Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose 36 cents, or 0.9%, to $41.41.
The U.S. Senate passed legislation that would impose mandatory sanctions on people or companies that back efforts by China to restrict Hong Kong's autonomy, in another potential Sino-U.S. flashpoint.
To become law it must also pass the House and be signed by President Donald Trump. Support for pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong has slipped, though retains the backing of a slim majority, a survey conducted for Reuters showed.
But demand for safe euro zone government debt was little changed, with Germany's 10-year Bund yield close to monthly lows, at -0.479% (DE10YT=RR).
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) was steady at 0.6725%. Gold  edged up slightly to $1,763.65 an ounce. US/ GOL/

The pandemic is more likely to leave a legacy of weak or falling prices for goods and services than to trigger higher global inflation, according to a majority of over 160 economists polled by Reuters.
The euro zone is ""probably past"" the worst of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Friday, while urging authorities to prepare for a possible second wave.

""There's still a belief that the unemployment that we see is temporary, there's still a belief that businesses will be able to get back to normal, but it's probably right to think that that's a little too simple,” said State Street's Graf.

LONDON (Reuters) - The trade union battling British Airways (BA) has met investors in its parent company IAG (L:ICAG), seeking to ramp up pressure on the airline over plans to cut staff, pay and conditions.
BA plans to cut 12,000 staff, or more than a quarter of its workforce, to tackle the coronavirus crisis and has also angered unions by proposing new contracts for the workers it keeps. 
Unite, the union which represents BA cabin crew, has responded by lobbying for law to be changed to allow BA to be stripped of some valuable take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport if it proceeds with it plans. 
Sharon Graham (NYSE:GHM), Unite's executive officer, told Reuters it had won significant political backing for its campaign and met investors this week to highlight the risks to BA's profits if it lost key airport slots. 
She said Unite had support from 90 lawmakers from several parties. A minister said earlier in June that BA's slots could be reviewed.
Graham forecast the battle with BA could last a year and said its significance went beyond the airline industry. 
""If we let this company get away with this, then other companies will follow suit. There'll be things people would like to do and they'll use the crisis to do it,"" she said. 
Under historical rights, BA operates over 50% of slots at Heathrow and losing any would hurt its profits. 
At the moment, about 22,000 BA staff are furloughed. 
Unite says the 30,000 staff it plans to keep are being given new contracts, some with pay cuts of up to 70%. BA says it has proposed pay cuts to a maximum of 20%.
The union says other airlines including easyJet (L:EZJ), Ryanair (I:RYA) and Virgin Atlantic have all agreed that pay cuts and other changes would be temporary. 

Alex Cruz, BA's boss, told staff in June that if slots were removed, more jobs would go.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Credit-rating firm Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service on Friday revised its outlook for SoftBank Group Corp to ""negative"" from ""ratings under review"", three months after making a two-notch downgrade that caused a public spat with the tech conglomerate.
The revision to the outlook represents a doubling-down by Moody's after it cut SoftBank deeper into junk territory in March - leading to the indebted conglomerate taking the unusual step of asking for its rating to be withdrawn.
SoftBank in a statement said it ""has provided no information to Moody's"", and that it is ""unclear what Moody's intention is"" or ""what information it uses"" to make its assessment.
On Thursday, SoftBank said it has raised $35 billion by selling down assets including part of its stake in China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd to fund share buybacks and pay down debt - a figure representing 80% of its planned total.
""Major asset sales have been announced but given the structured nature of the transactions, cash proceeds may not all yet have been received or applied towards debt reduction,"" Moody's said.
SoftBank's preference for complex financial transactions like collateralised margin loans ""signals a heightened tolerance for risk and financial complexity,"" Moody's continued.
The concerns follow peer S&P Global Ratings which earlier this month said SoftBank's 2.5 trillion yen ($24 billion) buyback plan - launched to stabilise the firm's stock price after its tech investments faltered - raised doubts about ""financial soundness and creditworthiness"".

New owner Yew Tree will pick up 25% of the offering, with Prestige Motors, which has steadily reduced its holding in the company having previously been the main shareholder, planning to buy about 8%, the company said.
Aston Martin, which in May posted a deep first-quarter loss after sales dropped by nearly a third, also said its retail sales and wholesales are expected to fall further in the second quarter compared with the first.
The company has been cutting jobs and streamlining its operations as it seeks to bring its cost base in line with its move to reduce sports car production levels.
""We are making very good progress on my first priority, the rebalancing of supply and demand and reducing dealer stock as we reset the business and restore exclusivity,"" said Chairman Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire who took over the role earlier this year after taking a 20% stake in the company. 
Aston Martin, famed for being James Bond's carmaker of choice, also said it had received approval for a Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) loan of 20 million pounds ($24.83 million).
The company has been plagued with the coronavirus crisis, much like other carmakers, with lockdown to prevent the spread of the disease leading to a 97% annual plunge in British new car sales in April to the lowest level of any month since February 1946.
The stock opened 5.8% lower at 68 pence on the London Stock Exchange.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The CEOs of major U.S. airlines are set to hold a meeting Friday to discuss several coronavirus-related travel issues, including a push to convince the federal government to mandate temperature checks for passengers, three people briefed on the matter said.
The meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and other senior U.S. officials is expected to include the chief executive officers of American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), United Airlines (O:UAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), the sources said.
The White House confirmed Pence would meet with airline executives Friday afternoon, but did not identify the companies.
The discussions will also include potential extended European Union travel restrictions on U.S. travelers, contract tracing of passengers and the impact of COVID-19 on travel demand, among other issues, the sources said.
The airlines declined to comment on the meeting.
U.S. airlines are pushing the Trump administration to require temperature checks for passengers in a bid to reassure customers about the safety of travel in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. airlines, said on Thursday its members voluntarily pledged to refund tickets for passengers with high temperatures during federal screenings.
Reuters reported May 9 the U.S. government has been studying imposing temperature checks at airports, but two U.S. officials said on Thursday no decision has been made - and the government still has not decided what agency would conduct tests.
Many believe the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) would conduct tests, but questions remain including whether passengers with high fevers would be reported to public health authorities.
""Nobody wants to be the person that tells a flying, paying customer they can't fly that day,"" United Executive Chairman Oscar Munoz said during a video conference Thursday.
U.S. officials said temperature checks would not eliminate coronavirus risks but could deter unwell people from traveling.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported the White House wants a plan in place by Sept. 1 for airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers after convening a high-level White House meeting.
The White House tasked a interagency working group with adopting an interim solution by June 30 and ahead of any potential coronavirus second wave.
In February, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued an interim final rule to require airlines to collect five contact data elements from international passengers and electronically submit them to Customs and Border Protection to facilitate contact tracing.
In the face of airline opposition the CDC plan has not taken effect.

Airlines for America said earlier this month airlines ""strongly support a contract tracing solution that will provide the most secure data to the U.S. government in a timely and efficient manner.""

FLORENCE/MILAN (Reuters) - With unsold luxury handbags and clothing gathering dust in their workshops, Italy's artisans fear for their future as brands cut orders and in some cases demand discounts and payment delays.
Italy accounts for around 40% of global luxury goods manufacturing and has been hit hard by a dramatic drop in demand triggered by the coronavirus crisis, with several artisans saying they have no new orders beyond the summer.
German fashion group  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) and Italian company Max Mara both wrote in May seeking price reductions on existing orders of 8% and 7% respectively, suppliers told Reuters, which also saw emails detailing the requests.
This illustrates how some mid-size luxury brands are attempting to protect their margins to make up for sales lost during weeks of lockdowns.
""Everybody is affected and has to take actions to have the possibility to come through the crisis and to survive,"" Markus Knisel, Hugo Boss's senior head of procurement for menswear, said in one email seen by Reuters. 
Hugo Boss and Knisel did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Max Mara declined to comment.
Reuters spoke to half a dozen Italian artisans supplying top luxury brands who said they had seen a cut in orders of between 20% and 50% in May and June compared with last year.
Hugo Boss has also asked for payments to be delayed to 120 days after delivery, from 10 days in normal times, one of the group's Italian suppliers, who asked not to be named, said.
Production cuts and price negotiations now threaten the survival of thousands of small and medium artisan workshops tanning leather, sewing handbags and shoes and weaving fabrics.
""If things don't go back to normal in the next couple of months, the worry is that from September onwards the situation will deteriorate further and that many luxury suppliers, particularly the smaller ones, will go bust,"" David Rulli, head of fashion at business lobby Confindustria in Florence, said.
Luxury brands shut shops and idled manufacturing sites as the coronavirus first emerged in China, a key market for the sector, and then spread to the rest of the world.
With major economies facing recession, demand for high-end clothes and accessories is expected to fall by up to 35% this year and revenues may take until 2022-23 to return to an estimated 2019 level of 280 billion euros ($314 billion), according to consultancy Bain.
Labels are grappling with piles of unsold stock and in most cases the prospect of widespread markdowns. 
Top brands from Chanel to LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton and  Kering 's (PA:PRTP) Gucci have raised prices of some of their most coveted products in a bet they can still lure the wealthy.
However some houses, including Gucci and Michael Kors, are scrapping or delaying new collections and say luxury should stop mimicking fast fashion's hectic delivery cycles. 
""We have enough orders to keep going until July but I am very concerned about the second part of the year which for us is crucial,"" Filippo Baldazzi, CEO of silk manufacturer Serica 1870 which works with Brunello Cucinelli, Kering and French rival LVMH, told Reuters.
""At this time of the year I would be presenting my fabrics for next year's fall and winter collections but no one is thinking about that now. Plus you can't show fabrics by video, people have to touch it,"" he said.
Two U.S. clients had cancelled orders because they could not pay and others had asked for payment delays, Baldazzi added.
SUPPLIER SUPPORT
While Italy's government has earmarked more than 20 billion euros ($22.5 billion) to help fund temporary layoffs, many small businesses say they have yet to receive the money. 
Some luxury labels say they are juggling their own goal to reduce production and keep a lid on costs with the needs of struggling suppliers who they cannot afford to lose.
Chanel has scaled back orders ""while trying to maintain a minimum level of activity with suppliers in France and Italy to make sure they don't go bankrupt,"" its finance chief Philippe Blondiaux told Reuters in a recent interview.
Italy and France are between them by far the two main producers of European luxury goods.
Dior, one of the LVMH conglomerate's biggest labels, also pointed to the need to support suppliers as it said this week that it was sticking with its 2020 fashion show programme.
Some executives in the industry, which in Italy alone employs 400,000 people, say the crisis could accelerate a trend where big brands snap up artisan workshops to tighten their grip on the supply chain and ensure prized manufacturing skills do not vanish.

""Real luxury is in the small details. I think many groups, including foreign ones, have realised that once those artisans are forced to close, that kind of sophisticated work ends with them,"" Baldazzi said.

Investing.com –  Virgin Australia  Holdings (ASX:VAH) administrator Deloitte has chosen Bain Capital as the preferred bidder for the troubled airline.
The U.S. private investment firm said on Friday that it will buy the airline for an undisclosed sum, to be raised via private equity in addition to distressed and special situation funds.
Bain Capital beat a bid from Cyrus Capital Partners as well as a recapitalization proposal submitted at the last hour by Virgin Australia bondholders to be selected. But Cyrus Capital Partners said earlier in the day that it had pulled out of the bidding process.
The deal‘s finalization will require approval from 50% of the airline’s creditors, both by value and number. Once finalized, Bain Capital will strengthen Virgin Australia’s regional routes and entice leisure passengers with good deals, said Mike Murphy, a managing director at the firm.
With Bain Capital’s selection, Deloitte ends its search of over two months for a buyer for the airline. Virgin Australia entered administration in April with debts of nearly AU$7 billion ($4.8107 billion) to its creditors. It is the second largest airline in the country, behind Qantas Airways (ASX:QAN)."

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, with markets remaining stubbornly upbeat despite the U.S. Federal Reserve setting new capital rules for banks and the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases capping gains.
The Fed said on Thursday that it would impose a cap on bank dividend payments as well as halting share repurchases until the end of 2020. The limits were imposed after the central bank’s latest stress tests on the sector showed significant capital losses for lenders when tested against the economic impact of COVID-19.
Some investors were positive about the Fed’s latest directive.
""Futures are pointing to gains, it's just a question of how they interpret the latest directive from the U.S. Federal Reserve...we could see a flow-on effect of regulators stepping in and making sure banks maintain financial health now that we see the pandemic take on different qualities, with the challenges drawn out over a long period of time,” Tom Piotrowski, CommSec markets analyst, told Reuters.
But other investors held a more negative view.
“The Fed “is going to support this market one way or the other...[still,] I think there are going to be a few more dips to come. It’s amazing, the market doesn’t care about fundamentals or earnings at this point, they care about the pandemic and the pandemic only,” Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co., told Bloomberg.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Thursday unveiled the next generation of its F-150 pickup in an online event, showing a truck with a familiar look but that incorporates the automaker's new strategy for profiting from software and connectivity.
The new F-150 and the soon-to-launch Mach-E electric SUV will be the first Ford vehicles equipped with electronic systems that allow for extensive over-the-air software upgrades. Rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc pioneered the use of smartphone-style updates to improve vehicles and generate revenue long after the sale. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has launched comparable technology on several vehicles.
Now the F-150, part of the best-selling line of vehicles in the United States with annual sales equivalent to Tesla's current volume, will bring upgradeable, fully connected vehicle technology to the mainstream market. Ford will offer a hybrid version of the F-150. An electric model is expected within two years.
The new F-150's design does not shock like the Tesla Cybertruck, with an exterior hard to distinguish from the current model. When it launches this fall, the truck will aim for traditional buyers in the U.S. heartland, down to the American flag stamped into the dashboard.
However, customers who opt to pay for it will be able to download software to enable hands-free driving on highways when it becomes available next year, Ford said. Commercial customers will be offered software that can help with routing or tracking vehicles in a fleet. 
Ford's chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said in an interview that after-sale software upgrades for customers may not be the biggest benefit the company gets from connecting F-series trucks to the cloud. Connected F-150s can tell Ford when there's a problem with engine control software, and enable a quick fix. 
""It’s a gamechanger for us,"" Farley said. The time to detect a warranty problem ""goes from weeks and months to days and hours."" 
Ford will also be able to know what features customers use and how, and what equipment could be safely omitted to cut costs. ""We don't have to guess anymore,"" he said.

(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket operator  Albertsons Companies  Inc (N:ACI) decided to go ahead with a downsized $800 million initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, the culmination of multiple attempts by its private equity owner Cerberus Capital Management LP to cash out.
Cerberus has been an investor in Albertsons since 2006 and has been trying to take the company public since 2015. The grocer's anemic growth had faced pushback from IPO investors, as well as shareholders of  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD), the pharmacy chain it tried to merge with two years ago.
The COVID-19 pandemic buoyed Albertsons' fortunes, however, as consumers stocked up on food while staying at home. Albertsons' sales in March and most of April were up 34% from last year. Yet the scaling back of the IPO on Thursday indicates that some investor skepticism lingers.
Below-target pricing may also signal recent robust investor demand for new listings is softening after U.S. stocks fell sharply on Wednesday amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States. Wall Street's main indexes closed higher in choppy trading on Thursday.
Rival supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) said last week that the surge in demand for essential goods it saw during the coronavirus outbreak was fading, as American households reconsider their needs. 
Albertsons said it sold shares in its IPO at $16 apiece, below its $18-$20 target range. This values the company at around $9.3 billion, excluding its $8.5 billion debt pile as of the end of February. The Boise, Idaho-based company also cut the number of shares sold in the IPO to 50 million from 65.8 million.
The downsizing of the IPO came after heated discussions between the underwriters and Cerberus, which deliberated whether to walk away from the offering at the last minute, as it did in 2015, a source familiar with the deliberations said.
Following the IPO, Cerberus will own around 31.9% of Albertsons, which operates namesake stores as well as U.S. supermarket chain Safeway and grocers Vons and Acme. Last month, buyout firm Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) acquired $1.75 billion of convertible preferred shares in Albertsons, representing a 17.5% stake in the company. 

Albertsons' shares are due to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the symbol ""ACI."" BofA Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the lead underwriters on the IPO.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve caps bank dividend payments after pandemic analysis,"By Pete Schroeder and David Henry
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Thursday it will cap big bank dividend payments and bar share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter after finding lenders faced significant capital losses when tested against an economic slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
In its analysis, the Fed found that the country's largest lenders have struggled to model the unprecedented downturn and ensuing rescue programs, adding to already unprecedented uncertainty about how banks and the economy overall would perform in the coming months.
The Fed did not say how each bank fared under the pandemic analysis, but found the 34 tested firms could suffer as much as $700 billion in aggregate loan losses under the most severe, ""W-shaped"" economic recovery.
Shares of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) tumbled in after-hours trading on the news, having risen earlier in the day.
The Fed determined that although banks could weather a severe, tumultuous and prolonged economic downturn, several would cut close to their minimum capital requirements.
With that in mind, the regulator placed a new limit on how much capital banks could pay to investors in dividends in the third quarter. They cannot pay more than they did in the second quarter, and payments cannot exceed average net income over the last four quarters.
The Fed also said it was barring share repurchases for at least the third quarter. The biggest banks had voluntarily suspended buybacks as the pandemic took hold, but it was not clear how long that would last.
The Fed's actions were unprecedented. It was the first time since the central bank implemented stress tests during the 2007-2009 financial crisis that it had to fundamentally alter its annual exam for a dramatic economic swing.
After releasing some details in February, the Fed had to add last-minute ""sensitivity analyses"" in May to account for actual economic turmoil that exceeded the worst-case officials envisioned in the original test.
The Fed's analysis suggested that some banks are more vulnerable than others. In aggregate, banks saw capital levels fall to 7.7% under the toughest scenario, but some came dangerously close to the 4.5% minimum they are required to hold to be considered well-capitalized.
Without naming any particular bank, the Fed said some relied on ""more optimistic than appropriate"" outlooks and that their capital planning ""has not been thoughtful.""
The biggest banks either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to Reuters on Thursday evening.
The Financial Services Forum, an industry trade group, said the results underscored the industry's strength. The group also highlighted steps banks have taken to support the economy and urged the Fed to be transparent in its process.
Banks privately received their specific results from the Fed on Thursday. They can adjust original plans to get a better assessment, and release those details after the market closes on Monday.
Analysts and investors suggested the Fed's capital limitations - though surprising - were not necessarily a bad thing. Although banks had voluntarily suspended buybacks, they were more reticent to limit dividends, and the Fed's restrictions are forcing them to be cautious.

""It is worth being punished a little bit to ensure the long-term viability of your investments,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, whose fund owns JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. ""I'm not mad at (the Fed).""

937,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Three Things to Watch for June 26,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Bank stocks whipsawed Thursday, surging during the day but falling after hours as coronavirus infections increased across the U.S. and the Federal Reserve released its stress test statement. The Dow was up almost 300 points to 25,744.71, reversing earlier losses. 
Texas reversed plans to reopen after Houston’s intensive-care units reached maximum capacity, while California, Arizona and Florida each saw a surge in new Covid-19 infections. Electives surgeries in Texas's biggest cities have been suspended. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom also declared a budget emergency because of Covid-19 and Disney's delaying its July 17 reopening of Disneyland. And more bad news: Macy’s is laying off 3,900 corporate employees, the government sent $1.4 billion in stimulus checks to dead people and unemployment came in above 1 million for the 14th week in a row. Still, the Nasdaq rose for a ninth day in a row. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Banks, Banks and More Banks
Banks from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) led the charge today, surging thanks to the loosening of the Volcker Rule, which will allow for riskier trades and investments in private equity and hedge funds. The easing of financial crisis-era rules on trading activities, including relaxing margin requirements for certain types of trades, should free up capital.
But after the market close, bank stocks fell on the results of the Fed's annual regulatory stress test. Share repurchases have been suspended for the third quarter and bank dividend payments will be capped at their current levels, with payouts based on a bank's recent earnings. Banks have to reassess their capital plans and may face another stress test later this year, the Fed said in announcing the results of its annual stress tests.
The Federal Reserve's annual stress test of big banks, which started in 2009, is supposed to show what happens to their balance sheets – in terms of losses and capital levels – under an extreme hypothetical scenario. The results give regulators a sense of whether a bank's plan to pay dividends and buy back shares will still leave enough of a buffer behind for it to endure a crisis.
2. U.S. Personal Income & Spending
Personal income in May is expected to have declined by 6% compared to a jump of 10% for the previous month as stimulus checks run out, according to Bloomberg. Spending figures may show increased spending of 9% compared to a 14% retraction in April as some U.S. states started to reopen. Congress may approve a second round of stimulus checks in July.
3. Covid-19 Shuttering Economy, Again
With infections surging in swaths of the U.S., states are closing back down and any personal spending bump from May is likely to come back down. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed 14 stores in Florida. Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI). was one of the few big bright spots in the market today, with CEO Gene Lee shrugging off the impacts of the virus saying it hasn’t had much of an effect on business, but the company’s keeping an eye on the new rise in infections.
 Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) reported that of the 140,000 closures of the businesses on its app since March, 41% are permanent closures. The company also noted that diners had been returning to restaurants in June, as well as malls and wellness centers, like spas.
Why are markets stable amid increasing infection rates? BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that the world is more accepting of higher coronavirus rates.
“I think the market is probably a little ahead of itself at this time, because I still believe we are witnessing real tragedies in the small and medium businesses,” Fink said."

The company's wholesale business, through which it sells merchandise to department stores and footwear retailers, saw a 50% fall in product shipments in the quarter.
Retailers have suffered due to store closures brought in place by government-led lockdowns, forcing many to limit their business to online operations. 
Nike's investments in its digital platform over the years helped the company record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear from the comfort of their homes. 
Net loss came in at $790 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with a profit of $989 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell 38% to $6.31 billion in the quarter ended May 31. Analysts on average had expected $7.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher in choppy trading on Thursday, with bank stocks soaring ahead of annual stress test results and helping to offset investor jitters over alarming increases in new coronavirus cases.
The recently battered S&P 500 banks sub-index led the gainers for the session after U.S. banking regulators eased rules and investors waited for results of the sector's annual stress test, which helps determine dividend policies.
The bank index had fallen 19 percent from its recent high on June 5 to Wednesday's lowest point. It closed up 3.6% on Thursday.
But investors remained nervous throughout the day as the number of new virus cases in U.S. states grew, especially in the West and South. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he was halting his state's phased economic reopening in response to a jump in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations.
And stocks wobbled temporarily late in the session after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it would close 14 stores in Florida again due to rising COVID-19 cases after other re-closures in Houston, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
A flare-up in virus cases in recent days has taken some wind out of a Wall Street rally powered by hopes of a quick economic recovery and massive government stimulus efforts. However, the benchmark S&P 500 still closed less than 9% below its Feb. 19 record.
While bank stocks provided one of the biggest boosts on Thursday, Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said investors were buying the dip after a pullback in stocks on Wednesday.
""None of those issues that caused yesterday's weakness were really resolved today,"" said James. ""You could argue that the market could be a fair amount lower. The reason we're not is there is still some understanding that things are going to have a brighter ending at some point.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 299.66 points, or 1.18%, to 25,745.6, the S&P 500 gained 33.43 points, or 1.10%, to 3,083.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.84 points, or 1.09%, to 10,017.00.
All the three major indexes had opened Thursday's session lower after data showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week, likely as hiring by reopening businesses is being partly offset by a second wave of layoffs.
But the S&P's financial sector, up 2.7%, stayed strong for the session and was the S&P's top percentage gainer. Earlier, regulators had unveiled two rules easing restrictions covering large banks with complex trading and investment portfolios.. 
The Federal Reserve was due to release results of annual bank stress tests after the markets close, potentially indicating how much flexibility banks will have to return capital to shareholders. 
""The risk-reward bias favors a more positive bias into the results this evening because the sector has been such a laggard,"" said Wedbush's James.
The energy sector gained 1.9% as oil prices rose 2% on the day. [O/R] Defensive utilities was the weakest S&P sector with a 1.2% decline.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, down 0.63%, pared losses but still closed down for the second day in a row after it delayed the reopening of theme parks due to the health crisis. A report also said it was considering postponing the July 24 release of ""Mulan.""
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co fell 1% as rival Airbus reached a crucial jetliner production target and smoothed recent industrial problems. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and eight new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.38 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.32 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com -- Banks are in a strong position despite the strain of pandemic-related economic lockdowns, but the Federal Reserve wants the industry to proceed with caution.
Share repurchases have been suspended for the third quarter and bank dividend payments will be capped at their current levels, with payouts based on a bank's recent earnings. Banks have to reassess their capital plans and may face another stress test later this year, the Fed said in announcing the results of its annual stress tests.
""There is material uncertainty about the trajectory for the economic recovery,” Fed Vice Chair Randall Quarles said in a statement. “As a result, the Board is taking action to assess banks’ conditions more intensively and to require the largest banks to adopt prudent measures to preserve capital in the coming months
Bank stocks surged ahead of Thursday's release of the tests, which were designed to see how well the financial system can weather an economic storm, then fell post-market after the Fed's statement.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) shares rose 3.8%,JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) was up 3.5%,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) rose 3.7%, and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) rose 4.8%.
The banks were also higher during trading hours Thursday after regulators indicated they would loosen financial crisis-era rules on trading activities, including relaxing margin requirements for certain types of trades, freeing up capital. The so-called Volcker Rule was put in place a decade ago to limit banks from using their capital to make risky trades and other types of investments, such as taking stakes in private equity and hedge funds. The idea was to prevent another large-scale taxpayer bailout. But bank regulators said Thursday they would soften those rules, according to Bloomberg.
The Federal Reserve's annual stress test of big banks, which started in 2009, is supposed to show what happens to their balance sheets – in terms of losses and capital levels – under an extreme hypothetical scenario.
The results give regulators a sense of whether a bank's plan to pay dividends and buy back shares will still leave enough of a buffer behind for it to endure a crisis.
This year's test includes a sensitivity analysis of coronavirus. Fed officials have said banks entered into the Covid-19 crisis in a strong position, but the duration of the pandemic and the associated lockdowns are uncertain, and that could mean pressure as credit losses accumulate. The Fed said Thursday some firms would approach their minimum capital levels.
Once the stress test results come out, banks can start to announce their plans for dividends and buybacks for the coming year, though that may also be delayed because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic. Some banks have already halted buybacks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The attorney general for the District of Columbia on Thursday filed a lawsuit against  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) , BP (NYSE:BP) Plc,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc for ""systematically and intentionally misleading"" consumers about the role their products play in causing climate change, the latest action by a U.S. attorney general against the oil and gas industry.
The lawsuit brought by Attorney General Karl Racine comes a day after Minnesota AG Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit against the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries for violating state laws barring consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices and false advertising.
""The defendants violated the District’s consumer protection law by concealing the fact that using fossil fuels threatens the health of District residents and the environment,"" Racine said in a statement. 
The intent of the legal action is to ""end these disinformation campaigns and to hold these companies accountable for their deceptive practices,” he said.
Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, said the lawsuit is part of a ""coordinated, politically motivated"" campaign against energy companies.
""The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court,"" he said.
Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron echoed claims about the merit of the case and said the litigation ""distracts"" from its efforts to address climate change.
Anna Arata, a spokeswoman for Shell, said in a statement that ""we’re committed to playing our part"" with regards to addressing climate change and that lawsuits ""impede the collaboration needed for meaningful change."" Shell set goal this year of achieving ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050.
Racine told reporters on Thursday that his office only learned of Minnesota's lawsuit when it was filed yesterday and had been preparing this long before.
Minnesota and D.C.'s lawsuits are the latest in a string of legal challenges by states, cities, and citizen groups targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming. 
Counterparts in California, New York and Massachusetts also filed lawsuits against oil majors but the Minnesota and D.C. lawsuits focus on consumer protection.

Racine said the named companies ""sought to create a false picture"" about the environmental harm that fossil fuels cause, even as they ""pivot their marketing efforts"" to portray their products as clean.

Investing.com - Wall Street closed higher Thursday, as bank stocks jumped ahead of stress tests on reports regulators are set to loosen bank restrictions on investing activities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18%, or 299 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.09%.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 3% after Federal Deposit Insurance Commission officials reportedly said they would loosen restrictions from the Volcker Rule, a post-financial crisis law designed to stop banks - which received federal and taxpayer bailouts - from engaging in risky trading activities. 
Regulators will also ease margin requirements for swaps trades that could free up an estimated $40 billion for Wall Street banks, Bloomberg reported.
The move higher in bank stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test of big banks, which started in 2009 and is supposed to show what happens to their balance sheets – in terms of losses and capital levels – under an extreme hypothetical scenario.
But upside momentum remained challenged on concerns about disruptions to economic reopening efforts as coronavirus cases continue to mount.
Following a recent record rise in daily cases in the state, Texas Governor Greg Abbott put the next phase of reopening on hold.
Coronavirus-related hospitalizations in the state have almost doubled since June 14, when the number was at 2,287.
Concerns are mounting that other pockets of the U.S. including Florida, Arizona, and California could also follow suit as new infections reached 38,115 nationwide on Wednesday, the highest since the pandemic began.
The wave of new infections come as mixed economic data did little to renew expectations over a quick snapback in growth in the second half of the year.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by 60,000 to 1.5 million in the week ended June 12, missing forecasts for a 240,000 decline.
""Today's report does not offer much confidence that we will see a strong jobs number when the June NFP data is released at the beginning of next month,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday core durable goods orders rose 4% last month, beating economist forecasts for a 2.5% rise.
Energy rebounded from a rout a day earlier even as oil prices moved off session lows.
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed up 1.3%. The tech giant announced that it was closing 14 stores in Florida after the state recorded a jump in Covid-19 cases.

LISBON (Reuters) - The Portuguese government will nominate Mario Centeno, who resigned from his role as finance minister this month, as the next central bank governor, the prime minister said on Thursday.
Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in a statement he had submitted a letter to the parliamentary speaker ""expressing the government's intention...to designate Mario Centeno for the position of governor of the Bank of Portugal"".
Centeno, who will also step down in July as head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, still needs to be heard by a parliamentary committee before the government can officially nominate him. 
His nomination as governor has been widely anticipated even though opposition parties voted this month for a bill that would, if it became law, force a wait of up to five years before he could become governor. 
Centeno is credited with reversing longstanding austerity policies while also achieving Portugal's first budget surplus in 45 years in 2019.
But restoring fiscal credibility came at the expense of public investment, which critics say left the country's social and economic infrastructure in a fragile state despite financial indicators improving.
Last week Costa said Centeno was well-equipped to be the next governor, and had all the attributes needed to lead the bank.

The government's intention to nominate Centeno was made by current Finance Minister Joao Leao, who was was due to appoint a successor to governor Carlos Costa, whose term ends next month, according a government statement.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wirecard collapsed on Thursday owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The payments company filed for insolvency at a Munich court saying that, with 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of loans due within a week its survival as a going concern was ""not assured"".
Wirecard's implosion came just seven days after EY, its auditor for more than a decade, refused to sign off on the 2019 accounts, forcing out Chief Executive Markus Braun and leading it to admit that $2.1 billion of its cash probably didn't exist.
""There are clear indications that this was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud involving multiple parties around the world,"" EY said in a statement.
EY said while it was completing the 2019 audit, it was provided with false confirmations with regard to escrow accounts and reported them to the relevant authorities. 
Wirecard declined to comment following EY's statement.
The financial technology company is the first member of Germany's prestigious DAX stock index to go bust, barely two years after winning a spot among the country's top 30 listed companies with a market valuation of $28 billion.
""The Wirecard case damages corporate Germany. It should be a wake-up call for reforms,"" said Volker Potthoff, chairman of corporate governance think-tank ArMID.
Creditors have scant hope of getting back the 3.5 billion euros they are owed, sources familiar with the matter said. Of that total, Wirecard has borrowed 1.75 billion from 15 banks and issued 500 million in bonds.
""The money's gone,"" said one banker. ""We may recoup a few euros in a couple of years but will write off the loan now.""
'TOTAL DISASTER'
The collapse of Wirecard, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, dwarfs other German corporate failures. It has shaken the country's financial establishment with Felix Hufeld, head of regulator BaFin, calling it a ""total disaster"".
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz described the collapse as a ""scandal"", acknowledging it was time to review regulation.
""We must rethink our supervisory structures,"" said Scholz, adding he had asked his ministry to come up with ideas in the next few days.
""If legal, legislative, regulatory measures are needed, we will embrace them and implement them,"" he said. ""A scandal like Wirecard is a wake-up call that we need more monitoring and oversight than we have today,"" he said.
Wirecard shares, which were suspended ahead of an earlier announcement that it would seek creditor protection, crashed 80% when trading resumed. They have lost 98% since auditor EY questioned its accounts last Thursday.

EY, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accountancy and consulting firms, faces a wave of litigation in a debacle that has drawn comparisons with Arthur Andersen's disastrous oversight of U.S. energy company Enron.
German law firm Schirp & Partner said that with Wirecard now effectively sidelined, it would file class actions against EY on behalf of shareholders and bondholders.
""It is frightening how long Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors,"" partner Wolfgang Schirp said. 
Wirecard's new management had been in crisis talks with creditors but pulled out on Thursday morning ""due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness"".
The insolvency filing did not include its Wirecard Bank subsidiary, which holds an estimated 1.4 billion euros in deposits and is already under emergency management by BaFin.
'COMPLETE VINDICATION'
A second source close to talks with creditors said although the company had a healthy core, it had faked two-thirds of its sales. This meant there was no way it could repay all its debt, notwithstanding all the legal challenges it will face.
The ascent of Wirecard, which was founded in 1999 and is based in a Munich suburb, was dogged by allegations from whistleblowers, reporters and speculators that its revenue and profits had been pumped up through fake transactions. 
Braun fended off the critics for years before finally calling in outside auditor KPMG late last year to run an independent investigation.
KPMG, which published its findings in April, was unable to verify 1 billion euros in cash balances, questioned Wirecard's acquisition accounting and said it could not trace hundreds of millions in cash advances to merchants.
""Today is a complete vindication for those that exposed the fraud,"" said Fraser Perring, who bet on a fall in Wirecard's shares and co-authored a 2016 report that alleged fraud.
The Munich prosecutor's office, which is investigating Braun on suspicion of misrepresenting Wirecard's accounts and of market manipulation, said: ""We will now look at all possible criminal offences.""
Braun was arrested on Monday and released on bail of 5 million euros a day later. Former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is also under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to justice officials there.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Thursday that it would close 14 stores in Florida starting Friday due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, bringing its total re-closures to 32 stores in the United States.
The company said earlier this week it would again close seven stores in the Houston area after cases rose there. Last week, it announced a round of shuttering in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Apple has 271 stores in the United States, all of which closed in March as the novel coronavirus spread. The company says it is evaluating whether to open or close each store based on local conditions in each community, with stores sometimes open in one part of a U.S. state but closed in another.

Many but not all of Apple's U.S. stores have reopened since March. After the closures slated for Friday, more than 200 will be open.

Investing.com - Wall Street climbed off lows Thursday, led by financials on reports regulators are set to loosen bank restrictions on investing activities, but investor sentiment remained vulnerable as parts of the U.S. slowed their plans to reopen the economy amid rising Covid-19 infections.
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.07%, or 16 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite was
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 2% after Federal Deposit Insurance Commission officials reportedly said they would loosen restrictions from the Volcker Rule, a post-financial crisis law designed to stop banks - which received federal and taxpayer bailouts - from engaging in risky trading activities. 
Regulators will also ease margin requirement for swaps trades that could free up an estimated $40 billion for Wall Street banks, Bloomberg reported.
The move higher in bank stocks pushed the broader market off session lows, but upside momentum remained challenged on concerns about disruptions to economic reopening efforts as coronavirus cases continue to mount.
Following a recent record rise in daily cases in the state, Texas Governor Greg Abbott put the next phase of reopening on hold.
Coronavirus-related hospitalizations in the state have almost doubled since June 14, when the number was at 2,287.
Concerns are mounting that other pockets of the U.S. including Florida, Arizona, and California could also follow suit as new infections reached 38,115 nationwide on Wednesday, the highest since the pandemic began.
The wave of new infections come as mixed economic data did little to renew expectations over a quick snapback in growth in the second half of the year.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by 60,000 to 1.5 million in the week ended June 12, missing forecasts for a 240,000 decline.
""Today's report does not offer much confidence that we will see a strong jobs number when the June NFP data is released at the beginning of next month,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday core durable goods orders rose 4% last month, beating economist forecasts for a 2.5% rise.
Energy rebounded from a rout a day earlier even as oil prices moved off session lows.
In tech, meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was flat despite Wedbush hiking its price target on the stock to $425 from $375, citing 5G tailwinds and momentum in its services business.
On the earnings front, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) fell 14% after posting mixed quarterly results a day earlier, as revenue fell short of estimates on weaker than expected second-quarter orders."

(Reuters) - Shares of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) dropped 1.8% on Thursday after the media company delayed the reopening of theme parks and resort hotels in California, following a surge in COVID-19 cases in the state.
The reopening of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park that was earlier scheduled for July 17 will be delayed until Disneyland receives an approval from state officials, the company said.
In late January, the pandemic started battering businesses across Disney's global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland.
Disney closed Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida - the company's largest theme park - in March. The park is scheduled to reopen on July 11, although petitioners are pressing Disney for a delay, citing a spike in COVID-19 cases in Florida.
Last month, Disney estimated global lockdown measures aimed at fighting the spread of the contagion slashed its profit by $1.4 billion, mostly from its shuttered theme parks.
In a June 11 report, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger wrote that Disney is losing about $1 billion a month while parks are closed, relative to what it otherwise would have earned.
The coronavirus-ravaged U.S. economy has begun to reopen but there is little clarity either on the pace and durability of the recovery, with new cases in the country continuing to rise. 
“The challenge is twofold: the longer the delay, the more money Disney loses. I also think the larger question is what’s happening to demand - the longer this health crisis goes on, the more people delay their thoughts about travel,"" said LightShed Partners media analyst Richard Greenfield. “If Disneyland is uncomfortable opening, can they really open Disney World?”
Last week, unions representing 17,000 workers at Disneyland expressed concerns to the state's governor that the theme park would not be safe enough to reopen by the company's target date.
Like other major companies, Disney is confronting both the coronavirus pandemic and renewed calls for racial equity. On Thursday it announced it was “retheming” its ""Splash Mountain"" theme park ride, based on the controversial 1946 film “Song of the South.” 

Disney said the ride, at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom park in Florida, would now feature characters from the animated film “The Princess and the Frog,” which starred its first Black princess.

In the other neighbourhoods of the Dutch capital, vacation rentals will be allowed only with a special permit, and only for up to 30 days a year, to groups of no more than four people.
Critics have long complained that the rise of Airbnb-style tourist rentals has torn the soul out of the centre of Europe's best-loved tourist cities, from Edinburgh to Barcelona.
Amsterdam housing councillor Laurens Ivens said in a press release that some 75% of the 780 inhabitants and organisations who had submitted views on a ban had been in favour. The city says one in 15 dwellings in Amsterdam as a whole shows up on online rental platforms.
Amsterdam's left-wing city council has been vocal about curbing mass tourism and the nuisance caused by tourists in the old city centre.
The neighbourhoods where Airbnb will be banned include the 500-year-old red-light district and most of the inner city canal ring, part of a UNESCO world heritage site.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said on Thursday it will renovate its Splash Mountain theme park ride to feature Tiana, the entertainment company's first Black princess and the star of 2009 animated film ""The Princess and the Frog."" 
The announcement follows criticism of the current theme for Splash Mountain, which is based on 1946 film ""Song of the South."" A recent online petition argued that the film promoted racist stereotypes. 
Splash Mountain, ""will soon be completely reimagined"" with a story that features Princess Tiana preparing to attend a Mardi Gras performance, Disney said in a blog post.
""Tiana is a modern, courageous and empowered woman, who pursues her dreams and never loses sight of what’s really important. It’s a great story with a strong lead character, set against the backdrop of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou,"" the company said. 
Hollywood companies including Disney are revisiting works from the past in light of renewed calls for racial justice following the death of African American George Floyd in U.S. police custody.

The petition on Change.org said Splash Mountain was a ""beloved classic"" at California's Disneyland, Walt Disney World in Florida and Tokyo Disneyland. But ""its history and storyline are steeped in extremely problematic and stereotypical racist tropes from the 1946 film Song of the South.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday rejected a call to swap an imprisoned Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] executive for two citizens held by Beijing, saying such a move would set a bad precedent and harm Canada.
Shortly after Vancouver police arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant in December 2018, Beijing detained two Canadian man on security charges. Last week they were charged with suspected spying.
A group of 19 prominent figures, including former cabinet ministers and diplomats, this week wrote a letter to Trudeau urging Ottawa to halt the extradition proceedings against Meng. This, they said, would boosting the chances of China freeing the two men.
Trudeau, who has dismissed repeated calls from China to intervene in the case against Meng, said the signatories were wrong to call for her release.
""(This) would endanger the millions of Canadians who live and travel overseas every single year. We cannot allow political pressures or random arrests of Canadian citizens to influence the functioning of our justice system,"" he told reporters.
The wife of one of the detained men on Tuesday urged Canada's justice minister to consider intervening in the case, saying her husband was in an increasingly dire predicament.
Although Beijing insists there is no connection between the Meng and the two Canadians, Trudeau said there was a clear link.
""We deplore what China did ... and will continue to remain steadfast and strong,"" he said, adding that it would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" to let Beijing think it could get what it wanted by arresting Canadians.
China has also blocked imports of Canadian canola seed and meat products.

Trudeau, asked whether Ottawa might impose sanctions on Chinese officials, said Canada was looking at a range of options but gave no details.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) is considering cutting hundreds of jobs and will discuss potential steps with staff representatives over the coming days, five sources said on Thursday, the latest move by the French drugmaker's chief executive Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) to cut costs. 
Management will meet staff representatives on Friday and Monday next week to outline a restructuring plan, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. They declined to be identified as the plan is still confidential.
The reorganisation could involve several European countries and possibly others outside the region, as well as all the divisions of Sanofi except the vaccines and rare diseases unit Genzyme, the sources said.
Three sources said around 1,000 jobs in France were at risk. One of the sources said the cuts would take place over a three-year period, with no forced redundancies.
Sanofi said strategy matters would be discussed at two meetings convened for June 26-29. ""Information will be shared with staff representatives first and no redundancy plan will be presented then,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement.
The discussions come after Hudson announced in December plans to cut 2 billion euros ($2.24 billion) in costs by 2022. He joined the company in September from  Novartis  (S:NOVN).
""The COVID-19 (pandemic) had slowed the announcement, but (the measures) are part of the CEO roadmap,"" one of the sources said.
Hudson has pledged to commit resources in areas where he believes Sanofi can secure leading positions.
Since his arrival, the company ended research in diabetes and cardiovascular, an area where Sanofi had lost ground over the years, narrowed the number of its divisions and set out higher profit targets.
The group has also been bulking up, including in the lucrative field of cancer drugs. It announced a deal last year to buy U.S. biotechnology firm  Synthorx  (O:THOR) for about $2.5 billion. 
Vaccines are also a top priority and the company is currently working on two candidates to prevent COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus that has killed more than 483,000 globally, one in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and another with U.S. Translate Bio (O:TBIO).
Sanofi said on June 16 it would invest 610 million euros at two French sites to turn them into a hub dedicated to research, development and production of vaccines, with some 200 new jobs expected to be created on one of the locations.

""The fact that retail sales - not fleet - are what kept the market propped up speaks volumes to the resilience of the American consumer,"" Edmunds' executive director of insights Jessica Caldwell said in a statement. 
The shutdown of plants and auto dealers hit the U.S. auto sector hard in April and May, but assembly plants reopened starting May 18 and have since boosted production while sales have rebounded as states reopen economies.
TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) subsidiary ALG expects sales of new cars and trucks to drop 24%, with the month finishing with a annual sales rate of 13 million units, down from 17.2 million last year. Excluding fleet sales, retail deliveries will decline 15%, but rise 1.5% from May. 
With inventories lower, availability of some vehicles, especially pickup trucks made by General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), could suffer, analysts said. 
Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) build-to-order model means the electric carmaker will see a big decline in June sales, analysts said. 
Edmunds expects June sales to drop 29% from last year but only 3.6% from May. It expects an annual sales rate of 12.8 million vehicles.
As inventories dwindle and automakers pull back on incentives, the industry needs to prepare for uncertainties ahead, Caldwell said.
Cox Automotive sees June sales dropping 30% with an annual sales rate of 12.6 million units as supply constraints may limit market gains, especially among pickups. For the full year, Cox expects new-car sales of 12.9 million.

""The worst of the crisis is probably behind us,"" Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said on a conference call.

(Reuters) - The resilience of a months-long rebound in U.S. stocks is being put to the test as a long-feared resurgence in coronavirus infections weighs on hopes of a sharp economic recovery in the United States.
Investors have for weeks flagged a potential rise in coronavirus infections as a possible stumbling block to the rally in U.S. stocks. That threat increasingly appears to be materializing, with California, Texas and other U.S. states notching big jumps in coronavirus infections this week, even as other areas like New York appear to have curbed their infection rates. 
For now, many market participants believe that hard-hit U.S. states are unlikely to reinstate the economically devastating lockdown measures implemented earlier this year. Still, the increase in cases threatens to slow economic activity and undercut the case for a “V-shaped"" recovery that has helped extend the massive spring rally in stocks. The S&P 500 is up 36% from its late-March low while the Nasdaq made its most recent record high on Tuesday. 
""All this week, we've been hearing how it’s going to get worse. The facts seem to be supporting that narrative,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners, referring to the virus.
The S&P 500 fell 2.6% on Wednesday and oil prices tumbled more than 5% after the U.S. recorded the second-largest increase in coronavirus cases since the health crisis began. Stocks shuffled between gains and losses Thursday. 
The United States on Tuesday recorded the second-largest increase in coronavirus cases since the health crisis began. Arizona, California, Mississippi and Nevada had record rises in coronavirus infections on Tuesday. Texas set an all-time high on Monday. 
The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, once coronavirus hot spots, announced on Wednesday that visitors from states with high infection rates must self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.
""Even if it isn’t mandated by the government to stay home, people aren’t going to be comfortable going out. They’re not going to be out and about shopping,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
The threat of a slower recovery has put the spotlight on valuation concerns that have arisen as stocks marched higher. A record net 78% of fund managers believe the stock market is at its most overvalued since 1998, according to a June survey by BofA Global Research. Owning technology stocks was deemed the market’s “most crowded” trade for the second straight month, the survey showed. 
The S&P 500’s forward price/earnings ratio now stands at 24.5, according to Refinitiv, a level that was last seen about 20 years ago during the dot-com boom. 
“Markets were pricing in too much perfection for the past couple of weeks,” said Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management. “We were overbought both on a technical and a fundamental level.”
Many investors believe that expectations of continued support from the Federal Reserve and stimulus from U.S. lawmakers will limit the downside in markets. 
Congress has so far allocated nearly $3 trillion in financial relief, while the Fed has implemented numerous programs to pump trillions of dollars of credit into the economy.
""Virus-shock challenged fundamentals have quite possibly been more than offset by a blunt-force global policy response,"" analysts at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said in a recent report.
U.S. government bond yields near record lows have also boosted the allure of stocks.
Still, investors are weighing those factors against the damage the economy has already incurred, as well as other potential threats to the recent rally in equities. 
One of those could come from concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions. President Donald Trump and top U.S. officials recently said the trade deal remains intact, after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Monday the hard-won pact was “over.” 
Some investors also believe money managers rebalancing their portfolios to pare equity exposure into the end of the quarter may also weigh on stocks. A portfolio that had stock allocations at 60% and bond allocations at 40% earlier this year may now be weighed more heavily towards equities after the big run-up in markets.
Pension funds may sell as much as $76 billion in equities at the end of the quarter, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note. //
""Quarter-end rebalancing calls for equity selling,"" wrote Michael O'Rourke at JonesTrading on Wednesday.

970,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Texas Governor Halts New Phases of Reopening State’s Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Texas Governor Greg Abbott halted the phased reopening of the state’s economy, citing a surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations.
Under the executive order announced Thursday, businesses that were already permitted to open can continue to operate under existing occupancy limits. The next phases of reopening have been put on hold, according to a statement from the governor’s office. He also suspended elective surgeries to free hospital space.
“The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,” Abbott said in the statement. “This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.”
The governor’s announcement, which followed a similar pause in North Carolina, came as Houston’s Covid-19 outbreak accelerated at an exponential pace that will swamp the city’s medical infrastructure by the Independence Day holiday, according to a leading disease specialist.
Even as Houston-area intensive-care wards approach full capacity, the worst is yet to come because of “the huge amount of transmission going on in our community,” Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said in an interview Thursday.
Current trends in Harris County, which includes Houston, indicate the caseload will triple or quadruple by mid-July, Hotez said, citing modeling by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s PolicyLab. Such a scenario would be “apocalyptic,” he said. “We can’t go there.”
Houston sprawls over many miles of swampy southeast Texas, a landscape of freeways and shopping malls largely unhindered by zoning. It has a metropolitan area of about 7 million residents, who compose one of the most diverse communities in the nation. And like other major cities in the state, its mainly Democratic leaders have found themselves at odds with Abbott and Republicans who have diluted urban power in politics.
Abbott was quick to follow the lead of President Donald Trump, encouraging businesses to operate despite the pandemic and forbidding mayors and county leaders from taking stringent measures to contain it. But the disease’s spread is increasingly dictating events.
On Wednesday, the Texas Medical Center warned the region’s intensive-care capacity was quickly filling up and would soon force medical authorities to convert other facilities to ad hoc Covid-19 wards. Harris County officials said they are prepared to reopen a field hospital at a professional football stadium if so-called surge capacity shows signs of strain.
Classic Epidemic
The trajectory of new cases is “going vertical,” Hotez said. “That’s what epidemic diseases classically do.”
Abbott’s suspension of elective surgeries affects Harris, Dallas, Bexar and Travis counties, according to a statement from the governor’s office. Zimmer Biomet,  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK) and HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) were among the worst performers in the S&P 500 Health Care Index Thursday morning after the news broke.
“These four counties have experienced significant increases in people being hospitalized due to Covid-19 and today’s action is a precautionary step to help ensure that the hospitals in these counties continue to have ample supply of available beds to treat Covid-19 patients,” Abbott said in the statement.
The Texas Medical Center -- a cluster of hospitals, research facilities and medical schools south of downtown Houston -- can double its Covid-19 capabilities without overstretching staff or supply lines, Chief Executive Officer Bill McKeon said in an interview.
Youth Factor
”Obviously, when we see numbers that are growing exponentially, that’s always a concern to us,” McKeon said. “But remember, capacity is like a giant bathtub. Sooner or later, if water goes unchecked and the faucets are filling, then at some point any place, even the biggest medical city in the world, will overflow.”
The Medical Center is seeing more young patients admitted, which means they’re less likely to require intensive care, McKeon said. More concerning is that the trend probably indicates that young people aren’t practicing social distancing or masking up, whether because they’re socializing in crowded bars or have less ability to do so when they go to work, he said.
“If people do not change their behavior and really take this seriously across the entire community, then that will be a problem in the future,” McKeon said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's emergency spending to help the country bridge the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was needed to lay the groundwork for a recovery, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday in response to Fitch's rating downgrade.
Fitch cut Canada's rating to ""AA+"" from ""AAA"" on Wednesday, making it the first time since August 2004 that the ratings agency did not give Canada top marks.
""In this historic, unprecedented pandemic, we needed to help Canadians. We came into this situation with one of the best balance sheets in the G7, and we put that to work for people,"" Trudeau said in a news conference when asked about Fitch's move.
Canada had been one of the few countries with a AAA rating from all three of the main agencies, a point often made by Trudeau in the past when he was questioned about the sustainability of the emergency spending. 
Standard & Poor's and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) still give Canadian debt the highest rating.
Ottawa is rolling out more than C$150 billion in direct aid to support the economy, and Fitch said this would significantly drive up the deficit and debt this year. 
Trudeau said the emergency spending provides the foundation for the economy to ""come roaring back"" once the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
As of Wednesday, Canada had registered 102,242 cases of the coronavirus, with 65,091 patients recovered, and 8,484 deaths.
With the spread of the virus slowing, all 13 of the country's provinces and territories have started to gradually reopen their economies in recent weeks.

Airlines including Delta have added back some summer capacity after modest improvements in domestic travel demand in May and June, but analysts say a spike in cases in some states, which have prompted three Northeast states to order quarantines for some travelers and Disneyland to delay its reopening, could dampen the recovery. 
Bastian said Delta continues to see slow but steady increase in passenger volumes two weeks into the summer travel season, but warned that the airline expects overall demand this summer to be only 25% of last summer's revenue.
""While it's encouraging to see flights returning (...) we likely remain at least two years away from a return to normal,"" Bastian said.
To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus on airplanes, U.S. airlines have recently cracked down on passengers who do not follow new requirements to wear face coverings by threatening to remove their future flight privileges.

Bastian said the airline has already banned some passengers from future travel on Delta for refusing to wear masks on board.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 10:47AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus executive says jetmaker reaches new production 'sweet spot',"By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Airbus has reached a crucial jetliner production target and smoothed recent industrial problems as it embarks on a new phase in its response to the coronavirus crisis, the planemaker's chief operating officer said.
Airbus recently announced output cuts of 33%-42% to limit damage as the pandemic grounded airlines around the world. First, however, it had to overcome the difficulty of producing planes at all as lockdowns spread across Europe.
""We have recovered from that phase and we are now dialled in at the new rates,"" COO Michael Schoellhorn told Reuters. 
The monthly rates - 40 A320/A321, 6 A350 and 2 A330, down from 60, 9.5 and 3.5 respectively before the crisis - are a ""sweet spot that is not too disruptive to the whole supply chain...and puts us relatively close to where we feel the market will trend to,"" he said. 
The new rates have already kicked in at the start of each assembly line, where wings are joined, but unions said after a briefing that completed jets would only leave plants at that speed from September. Meanwhile, it remains uncertain when the delivery rate will catch up as airlines are reluctant to spend cash.
Until the pandemic hit, Airbus' problem was meeting demand for its hot-selling A321neo. But as that and other demand melted away in March, the company was forced to cut all output.
The result has been a production see-saw as Airbus first halted key plants, then started edging towards the new goals, which are higher than during the peak of the crisis but lower than the company and its suppliers originally invested for.
Suppliers are still lagging, however, with Airbus only needing parts for 25 jets a month as it soaks up surplus inventory from pre-crisis production levels, industry sources said. 
Airbus has not ruled out cutting output again depending on the pace of recovery, but Schoellhorn said 40 a month is ""still a place that we feel comfortable with"".
STABLE BASIS
The 55-year-old former military helicopter pilot and veteran of the Robert Bosch industrial group was brought in during a management shake-up last year to accelerate new production techniques as jetliner demand looked set to keep growing.
Instead, he found himself grappling with the industry's worst crisis as undelivered jets spilled onto the tarmac.
Still, Schoellhorn said the crisis had given Airbus a chance to fix problems it could not easily address beforehand.
""I drive this home every day: now is the time to put all the issues to bed,"" he said. ""We are making good progress.""
Chief among these is a high-capacity version of the A321, the 240-seat A321ACF, which had suffered delays of at least 6 months before things began improving late last year.
""There are no systematic industrial problems as we speak,"" Schoellhorn said of the plane. There are also ""very few disruptions"" among suppliers, he added.
Unions fear an imminent reorganisation involving thousands of phased job cuts and early retirements and are wary of a possible streamlining of the group's 11 European plants.
Schoellhorn declined comment on a potential restructuring, but said the time taken to improve operations during the enforced downtime would create a ""stable basis"" for the future.
That future is one in which parts and information flow more freely, expanding ideas already imported from the car industry. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has also invested in data-driven manufacturing methods.
""There will be elements of the production system that will be very much like they are today...but we will see a higher degree of automation building on what we have implemented in recent years,"" he said. ""It will be more of a real-time flow"".
For now, automation investment has slowed as Airbus saves cash on most projects except its next single-aisle, the A321XLR.
Airbus wants to sustain the recently lowered production rates without losing cash, meaning cutting fixed costs has become a pressing priority. 

""We are working on all angles,"" Schoellhorn said. ""It's a challenge but also an opportunity.""

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) said on Thursday it would lay off about 3,900 employees in corporate and management positions as U.S. businesses try to save cash in the face of dwindling demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The department store chain, which had about 123,000 employees at the end of January, said it expects to save about $365 million in fiscal 2020 and about $630 million every year as a result of the layoffs.
Macy's had in May warned of nearly $1 billion in operating losses in its first quarter and said it would turn into a ""smaller company"".
The job cuts come at a time when unemployment figures in the United States are already high. Rising coronavirus infections in many U.S. states including California, Texas and Florida are likely to hurt employment further as some people stay away from consumer-facing establishments. 
""Expect more layoffs akin to Macy's to be announced in the coming months,"" said Matt Fox, founder of Ithaca Wealth Management in New York.
""Retailers that were struggling before the pandemic hit will re-evaluate their operations and cut jobs out of necessity to stay afloat until the economy recovers."" 
Macy's said it has also reduced staffing at its stores, supply chains and customer support network and would adjust their levels as sales recover.
The company, which reopened its flagship Manhattan store on Monday, said it would bring back most of its remaining furloughed employees in the first week of July.
It expects the layoffs to result in pre-tax charges of about $180 million in fiscal 2020. 
Macy's shares were down about 2% in morning trading.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",Vaccine makers face biggest medical manufacturing challenge in history,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland
CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Developing a COVID-19 vaccine in record time will be tough. Producing enough to end the pandemic will be the biggest medical manufacturing feat in history.
That work is underway.
From deploying experts amid global travel restrictions to managing extreme storage conditions, and even inventing new kinds of vials and syringes for billions of doses, the path is strewn with formidable hurdles, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen vaccine developers and their backers.
Any hitch in an untested supply chain - which could stretch from Pune in India to England's Oxford and Baltimore in the United States - could torpedo or delay the complex process.
Col. Nelson Michael, director of the U.S. Army's Center for Infectious Disease Research who is working on the government's ""Warp Speed"" project to deliver a vaccine at scale by January, said companies usually have years to figure this stuff out. 
""Now, they have weeks.""
Much of the world's attention is focused on the scientific race to develop a vaccine. But behind the scenes, experts are facing a stark reality: we may simply not have enough capacity to make, package and distribute billions of doses all at once.
Companies and governments are racing to scale-up machinery to address a critical shortage in automated filling and finishing capacity - the final step in the manufacturing process of putting the vaccine into vials or syringes, sealing them and packaging them up for shipping.
""This is the biggest logistical challenge the world has ever faced,"" said Toby Peters, an engineering and technology expert at Britain's Birmingham university. ""We could be looking at vaccinating 60% of the population.""
Several developers, including frontrunner  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), are experimenting with new ways to mitigate the extreme cold storage demands of their vaccines, which at present need to be kept at minus 80 degrees Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit). 
SiO2 Materials Science is working on producing vials that won't shatter at super-cold temperatures.
Travel restrictions, meanwhile, are posing more prosaic problems; Johnson & Johnson, which plans to start clinical trials this summer, has struggled to send its vaccine experts to oversee the launch of production sites, for example. 
'NEVER IN HISTORY'
By setting up massive clinical trials involving 10,000 to 30,000 volunteers per vaccine, scientists hope to get an answer on whether a vaccine works as early as this October. But even if they succeed, manufacturing in bulk, getting regulators to sign off and packaging billions of doses is a monumental challenge.
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance, said in reality, the world is unlikely to go straight from having zero vaccines to having enough doses for everyone. 
""It's likely to be a tailored approach to start with,"" he said in an interview. ""We're looking to have something like one to two billion doses of vaccine in the first year, spread out over the world population."" 
J&J has partnered with the U.S. government on a $1 billion investment to speed development and production of its vaccine, even before it's proven to work. It has contracted Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS) and Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) to manufacture in bulk in the United States. Catalent will also do some fill-and-finish work.
""Never in history has so much vaccine been developed at the same time - so that capacity doesn't exist,"" said Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, who sees filling capacity as the main limiting factor.
Emergent's manufacturing plant in Bayview, Maryland, can accommodate four vaccines in parallel using different manufacturing platforms and equipment. 
Funded by the government in 2012, the plant includes single-use disposable bioreactor equipment featuring plastic bags rather than stainless steel fermentation equipment, which makes it easier to switch from one vaccine to another.
This month, the company received an additional $628 million to make those four suites available to support any candidate the government selects, CEO Bob Kramer told Reuters. 
BLOW-FILL-SEAL-REPEAT 
As well as working with J&J, New Jersey-based Catalent signed a deal with British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) last week to provide vial-filling and packaging services at its plant in Anagni, Italy. It aims to handle hundreds of millions of doses, starting as early as August 2020 and possibly running through until March 2022.
It has ordered high-speed vial-filling equipment to boost output at its Indiana plant, where it is also hiring an additional 300 workers.
Michael Riley, Catalent's North American president for biologics, told Reuters his biggest challenge was trying to compress work that normally takes years into months. 
Adding to the challenge is that glass vials are in short supply.
To save glass, companies plan to use larger vials of five to 20 doses - but this raises new problems, such as potential waste, if not all the doses are used before the vaccine spoils.
""The downside is that after a healthcare practitioner opens a vial, they need to then vaccinate 20 people in a short, 24-hour time,"" said Prashant Yadav, a global healthcare supply-chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington.
As part of the same drive, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense have awarded ApiJect Systems up to $138 million to upgrade its facilities to be able to make up to 100 million plastic pre-filled syringes by the end of this year, and as many as 600 million in 2021.
The company plans to use a technology called Blow-Fill-Seal, where syringes are blown out of plastic, filled with vaccine and sealed in seconds. This will need Food and Drug Administration approval, CEO Jay Walker told Reuters.
BREAKING COLD CHAIN
SiO2 Materials Science is, meanwhile, ramping up capacity of plastic vials with a glass lining, which are more stable at ultra-low temperatures.
""You can bring us down to minus 196 Celsius, which none of the vaccines need,"" Chief Business Officer Lawrence Ganti said. ""You can throw it against the wall and it doesn't break. Our founder has done that. He's thrown frozen vials at me.""
The company expects to boost production from the current 5-10 million vials a year to 120 million within three-and-a-half months, he told Reuters.
Once packaged, many vaccines need to be kept cold - and some leading contenders made from genetic material such as messenger RNA need to be kept very cold - presenting another challenge that may limit access.
""People who work with mRNA store it at minus 80 degrees centigrade, which is not something you're gonna find in most pharmacies or doctor's offices,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine.
Peters of Birmingham university has been gathering data from poorer regions of Africa and Asia, and said breaks in the temperature-controlled supply chain - ""cold chain"" - are already frequent.
In some places, it is common to lose 25% or more of vaccines because of broken cold chains, he told Reuters. 
""So if you're looking to manufacture four billion, and you reckon you're going to lose 25%, then you have to manufacture five billion,"" he said. ""It's all the elements to move it from the point of manufacture to the point of aggregation, right down to the health centres and then out to the community.""
QUARANTINE QUAGMIRE
Companies developing mRNA vaccines, including Moderna and Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO), which is partnering with Sanofi (PA:SASY), are working to make candidates stable at higher temperatures.
Ron Renaud, CEO of Translate Bio, said he was confident this would happen ""within a short amount of time"".
Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said: ""We are getting more confident that we could run our supply chain at -20C, which is an easier storage condition than deep freezing,"" she said.
Moderna plans to add a small period of time in which the vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius in doctors' offices or clinics.
""We will know more in the next 2-3 months,"" she said. 
The pandemic is also presenting obstacles of a less technical nature. 
Catalent, which has some 30 plants globally, has had to write special permission slips in eight languages explaining that their workers are considered essential. 
J&J is having trouble getting experienced personnel to far-flung labs to oversee the transfer of technology to contract manufacturers because they're subject to 14-day quarantines. 

""It is absolutely a factor,"" said Stoffels. ""If you have to send your people to the middle of India to get to filling capacity, that's not easy at the moment.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators Thursday unveiled a pair of rules that will make life easier for large banks with complex trading and investment portfolios.
One rule wraps up a long-running effort by Republicans to overhaul the so-called ""Volcker Rule,"" clearing the way for banks to make larger investments in riskier funds like venture capital funds.
The second relieves banks from having to set aside cash to safeguard derivatives trades between affiliates within the same firm. The move hands a win to big global banks that had lobbied for the relief, as industry estimates it could free up as much as $40 billion in previously reserved cash.
The rules were jointly unveiled by regulators on Thursday, with each agency expected to formally approve them.
The rule overhauling the ""covered funds"" portion of the Volcker Rule wraps up years of work overhauling that central post-financial crisis regulation, which places significant restrictions on a bank's riskier trading and investment activities. The new rule, largely similar to one proposed in January, opens the door to banks investing in venture capital funds, and eases restrictions around when banks are considered owners of funds.
The softer ""inter-affiliate"" swap rule frees banks from having to set aside funds to protect against derivatives trades made between affiliates of the same firm. The final rule did add to the September proposal, setting a limit on how much inter-affiliate exposure a bank could have without setting aside margin funds of 15% of the firm's capital.
The pair of moves serve as significant victories for the financial industry, which for years had complained about rules they said were onerous, confusing and overly cautious.
However, the moves adopted on Thursday may also be some of the last significant deregulatory projects under an industry-friendly administration, as President Donald Trump is up for re-election in November.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Thursday, extending the sharpest losses in two weeks that they made on Wednesday, as another modest drop in jobless claims failed to revive confidence in the outlook for the economy.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 41 points or 0.2% at 25,405 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5%. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that another 1.48 million Americans had filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week. While that was another decline, it was a smaller drop than expected. Continuing jobless claims, which come in with one-week time lag, dipped below 20 million for the first time since April, however. 
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) analyst John Vellis wrote in a research note Thursday that the pandemic is likely to leave lasting scars on the economy.
""The hardest-hit industries today — which include education, entertainment, travel, and food and accommodation — will not recover to pre-COVID levels of activity by the end of this year and instead will do so slowly during 2021,"" Vellis said. ""Before the economic downturn, those sectors collectively employed more than 40 million workers, or roughly 25% of the labor force. We estimate that in just those sectors alone, there will be six million fewer jobs in these sectors at the end of 2020 and still four million fewer in 2021.""
Among the biggest losers in early trade was Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, which fell 2.0% after the entertainment giant was forced to delay the reopening of its theme parks and resort hotels in California in response to the surge in new infections. At the other end of the scale, bank stocks responded positively to reports suggesting that the Federal Reserve is set to ease rules on their trading activities. The Fed is due to release the results of its annual stress tests later Thursday.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) stock all rose over 2%. 
Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock fell 2.4% after the department store owner said it will cut another 3,900 jobs nationwide in response to Covid-19 impacts, while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 1.7% after the oil producer said it would buy back up to $1.5 billion worth of senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, cutting a debt load that ballooned to $40 billion after its ill-timed acquisition of Anadarko last year. The prospect of deleveraging outweighed the company's bleaker warning that it expects to write $9 billion of assets down in the second quarter. "
982,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",IMF Flags Risks From Financial-Market Disconnect With Economies,"(Bloomberg) -- The International Monetary Fund warned that the two-month rebound in financial markets is vulnerable to a reversal because it’s fueled by central banks and disconnected from the economic outlook.
The S&P 500 has rallied more than 35% from its pandemic low in late March through last week, even as virus deaths mounted, the U.S. locked down and the unemployment rate soared. The IMF said that such rallies have occurred in past periods of significant economic pressure, only to quickly unwind. Credit spreads for investment-grade companies in advanced economies also are narrower than during past economic shocks, the fund said.
“This divergence raises the specter of another correction in risk asset prices should investors’ attitude change, posing a threat to the recovery,” Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, and Fabio Natalucci, the deputy director, said in a blog post accompanying the Global Financial Stability update on Thursday.
A sell-off could add financial stress on top of a recession that’s already projected to be the worst since the Great Depression.
The fund also warned that high debt levels may become unmanageable for some borrowers, with insolvencies and resulting losses testing bank resilience. Emerging- and frontier-market economies face refinancing risks, and authorities should closely monitor financial vulnerabilities while continuing to safeguard stability, the Washington-based lender said.
The IMF on Wednesday downgraded its outlook for the coronavirus-ravaged world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago. The fund said it now expects global gross domestic product to shrink 4.9% this year, compared with the 3% predicted in April.
Central banks in advanced economies have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus. While that along with the extensive use of tools such as quantitative easing has “restored confidence and boosted investor risk taking,” Adrian and Natalucci urged policy makers “to be attentive to possible unintended consequences, such as a continued buildup of financial vulnerabilities in an environment of easy financial conditions.”

The vaccine, among the first to be tested in humans in the United States, was found to produce protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers.
Under the deal, Catalent will provide manufacturing services for an initial 100 million doses starting in the third quarter at its facility in Bloomington, Indiana.
It will also provide other packaging and labeling, storage and distribution services at its facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to support Moderna's late-stage vaccine trial, which is expected to begin in July. (https://reut.rs/384fCLt)
Drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) have also signed agreements to boost manufacturing capacity for their experimental vaccines even before having adequate evidence of their efficacy.
There are no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 and experts have cautioned that a safe and effective vaccine may take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development. 
Vaccines by other drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), Sanofi (PA:SANY) and AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) are in various stages of development and about a dozen vaccines are currently being tested in humans.
Both Moderna and Catalent are also in talks for making hundreds of millions of additional doses.
Separately, Moderna has struck deals with the U.S. government for funds to ramp manufacturing capacity, while also entering into a 10-year collaboration with Swiss contract drugmaker Lonza Group AG (S:LONN) to produce large quantities of its vaccine.
Shares of Moderna were up 2.5% at $66.48 in premarket trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks spluttered to their lowest level in more than a week on Thursday, as a surge in U.S. coronavirus cases and an IMF warning of an almost 5% plunge in the global economy this year hit the bulls again.
Asia suffered its biggest drop in eight sessions overnight and though Europe's STOXX 600 recovered from an early 1% fall it remained unsteady, while Wall Street was expected to open 0.5% in the red. 
After a white-hot few months for markets that has seen world stocks rebound nearly 40%, nervousness about the impact of COVID-19 was rising again.
In the United States, Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina reported record increases in new cases on Wednesday and Australia posted its biggest daily rise in two months. 
The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ordered travellers from eight other states to quarantine on arrival, a worry for investors who had mostly been expecting an end to pandemic restrictions.
Disney has delayed the re-opening of theme parks and resorts in California, and Texas is facing a ""massive outbreak"" and considering new localised restrictions, its governor said.
""During the swift rebound since the March lows, equity markets may have gotten a little ahead of themselves,"" wealth manager DWS said in a quarterly Chief Investment Officer report.
With the added pressure of looming half year portfolio reviews, investors were huddling in traditionally safer government bonds and gold.
The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it now expects global output to shrink 4.9% this year rather than the 3% it predicted in April. 
""There is a little bit of reality bites coming,"" said Damian Rooney, senior institutional salesman at stockbroker Argonaut in Perth. ""I don't think there was a particular straw that broke the camel's back, but people are a little bit twitchy."" 
UBS' chief economist Paul Donovan said, however, that international organisations tend to lag behind and many economists were now revising forecasts up, not down.
""The IMF has been too pessimistic on growth in 27 of the past 30 years. It tends to be significantly too pessimistic when there are big structural changes.""
For now the subdued mood helped the dollar build on broad gains in the FX markets which had lifted it from near a two-week low. [FRX/] 
Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds sank to 10-day lows of 0.66% and -0.47% although they remained within their well-worn recent ranges.
LAYOFFS 
Weekly jobless claims data showed weak demand is forcing U.S. employers to lay off workers, even as businesses reopen. Claims totalled a seasonally adjusted 1.480 million for the week ended June 20 and although down from 1.540 million the prior week, it was higher than the 1.3 million a Reuters poll had expected. 
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, who argued against last week's increase to the bank's bond-buying programme, is due to speak about the future of society at 1700 GMT. The pound was up for a third day in four before that. [GBP/]
Signals on the trade front and political uncertainty have also added to jitters.
The United States has added items valued at $3.1 billion to a list of European goods eligible to be hit with import duties.
The Trump administration has meanwhile determined that China's Huawei and video surveillance company Hikvision are owned or controlled by the Chinese military, laying the groundwork for sanctions and new Sino-U.S. tension.
That stalled a rally in riskier currencies, and pushed the Australian dollar under 69 cents and left the kiwi stuck around 64 cents. [AUD/]

Gold hovered around $1,757 an ounce [GOL/], while Brent crude slipped back under $40 a barrel and U.S. crude futures fell by 60 cents a barrel or 1.6% to $37.40.

(Reuters) - The parent company of Chuck E. Cheese, the once popular children-themed restaurant chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday, saddled by a huge pile of debt and dismal sales because of lockdowns across the country.
CEC Entertainment (CEII.UL), which also owns Peter Piper Pizza, said it plans to use the bankruptcy proceedings to talk to stakeholders and landlords and to restructure its balance sheet, as the outbreak ravages the entertainment and leisure industries globally.
Already loss making, the outbreak shut the door on a rebound as sales plunged after restaurants were forced to close as lockdowns were put in place. Chuck E. Cheese was hit especially hard owing to its children's party and games venues. 
Irving, Texas-based CEC, which was taken private by Apollo Global Management (N:APO) in a leveraged buyout in 2014, joins a growing list of high-profile corporate collapses due to the ongoing health crisis.
Calling it the most challenging time in its history, the company listed assets and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to the bankruptcy filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. 
CEC, which terminated a merger with blank check company  Leo Holdings  (N:LHC_u) last year for an undisclosed reason, reported nearly $29 million in losses last year, compared to losses of $20.4 million in 2018.
Chuck E. Cheese's bid to boost sales through delivery apps under the name ""Pasqually's Pizza & Wings"" earlier this year only created more problems, as many customers thought they were ordering from a local business. 
As of Wednesday, 266 Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza restaurant and arcade venues were re-opened. The company expects to keep them open throughout Chapter 11 proceedings. 
As of March, CEC and its franchisees operated 612 Chuck E. Cheese and 122 Peter Piper Pizza venues, with locations in 47 U.S. states and 16 foreign countries.
PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) is serving as a financial adviser, while FTI Consulting (NYSE:FCN) is its restructuring adviser.

U.S. and international franchise partners, as well as corporate entities outside the United States are not part of its restructuring process, CEC added.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",'Embarrassing' potential ouster from MSCI index could bruise Turkish markets,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's potential ejection from MSCI's widely followed emerging markets index could suck almost a billion dollars out of its stock markets, dealing another blow to the country, whose position is already waning on global markets.
The world's largest index provider said late on Tuesday it was considering launching a consultation on whether Turkey should remain in its emerging market index or be reclassified to ""frontier"" or ""standalone"" status.
That consultation could happen if foreign investors' access to Turkish equity markets deteriorates further, MSCI said. 
The warning comes at a sensitive time for Turkey, whose corporate sector relies heavily on foreign investment flows.
Investors are still nervous after the lira plunged to a record low in May, and Turkey's economy, reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on domestic demand, tourism and exports, is expected to shrink 0.75% this year.
A consultation would only be the first step in the process and would not automatically lead to ejection from the index. But it is another warning sign and a clear reminder of Turkey's contentious relationship with foreign investors.
Some $900 million was at risk because of asset managers that track the MSCI main emerging market index would have to liquidate if Turkey was booted out, calculated Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital.
""Turkey's importance has been shrinking as investors have increasingly steered clear of an unpredictable economy led by a president who believes higher interest rates create inflation,"" Robertson wrote in a note to clients. ""A downgrade would be embarrassing for Turkey.""
Borsa Istanbul, the Capital Markets Board (SPK) and Turkey's central bank did not respond to a request for comment, while the treasury declined to comment.
President Tayyip Erdogan has frequently accused foreign speculators of destabilising the lira, and policymakers have tinkered numerous times with offshore lira markets, squeezing out liquidity and effectively preventing participants from shorting the currency 
MSCI said the introduction of short selling bans in October 2019 and stock lending bans in February 2020 had crimped access from abroad to Turkish shares.
Turkish authorities banned short selling of shares in seven large banks after U.S. prosecutors charged the state-owned Halkbank with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. 
The SPK said at the time that the move was made to ""ensure the functioning of capital markets in a reliable, transparent and stable environment and to protect the rights and benefits of investors” within the framework of SPK laws.
Turkey is not the only equity market in MSCI's cross hairs - a consultation on whether Argentina should lose its emerging market membership is already underway.
However, Argentina, a serial debt defaulter and prone to frequent political upheavals, is different from Turkey, which for over a decade was viewed as a promising emerging economy with a large population, robust banks and liquid financial markets.
Its most recent decline is reflected in Turkey's weighting in the MSCI emerging market index. Having a weighting in the MSCI EM index of nearly 2% at the end of 2014, it has now shrunk to 0.4%, according to data from MSCI. 
Foreign investors hold just over 50% of the total market capitalization, data from the Turkish investor relations society and Turkey's central securities depository show. Yet for much of the past decade, foreigners owned well over 60% of the $176 billion market.
But while they represent only 0.8% of the total Borsa Istanbul investor base, they account for around a quarter of its daily trading volume. 
Graphic: Turkey Equity Markets https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzwqaqpw/Turkey%20Equity%20Markets.JPG 
Foreign investors' waning participation in Turkish equities mirrors the debt trend, where non-residents now hold only around 6% of sovereign debt compared with 29% in 2013.
The possibility of joining MSCI's frontier markets index - a subset of smaller and riskier developing countries with less liquid or more restricted stock markets but also a much smaller following in the investment world - would be a blow for Turkey.
""Its ejection from the (MSCI EM) index would prompt the passive funds that follow that index to sell and give active investors in mainstream EM another reason to ignore Turkey,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Tellimer.
Turkey's outsized daily trading volumes compared with other frontier markets means such a relegation would also create a headache for MSCI and fund managers benchmarking to the frontier index.
Over the last six months, Turkey's average daily trading activity was close to $2 billion, which would dwarf all others, including Vietnam - next in line with a volume of $270 million, Malik calculated.
Kim Catechis, head of investment strategy at  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) affiliate Martin Currie, said he expected MSCI would not eject Turkey from its emerging markets index for at least a year.
Nonetheless, real concern over the country's unorthodox economic policy and predominantly debt-funded investment landscape had created real concern over the sustainability of the situation already pre-Covid-19.
""For investors, the cocktail looks increasingly unappetising,"" Catechis said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday after Wednesday’s sharp losses, with investors showing caution amid signs that cases of the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating, hampering efforts to reopen the country’s economy.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq Futures up 3 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract rose 107 points, or 0.4%. 
Wall Street closed sharply lower Wednesday, amid worries that rising Covid-19 infections could slow the reopening of businesses in many states, hitting the pace of the country’s economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7%, or 710 points, the S&P 500 slipped 2.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.2%, snapping an eight-day winning streak. This was the worst day for Wall Street in two weeks.
More than half of all U.S. states are reporting rises in new coronavirus cases, and the country as a whole recorded Wednesday a one-day total of nearly 35,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, the highest level since late April. 
This has prompted the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where the rate of infections has slowed after being particularly hard hit, to require visitors from states with increasing numbers of infections to self-isolate for 14 days.
With this in mind, attention will turn to the release of the weekly employment data. Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.9 million. weekly unemployment numbers. Recent progress has been good, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. 
Durable goods numbers for May and the first quarter GDP release are also due Thursday, but these are seen as more backward looking data points.
In corporate news, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) will be in the spotlight after delaying the re-opening of theme parks and resorts in California because of the increase in Covid-19 cases. The Wall Street Journal also reported that the entertainment giant is considering holding back the release of its “Mulan” movie.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would also be in focus after saying it would shut seven stories in the Houston area following a sharp rise in cases, after last week reclosing some locations in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
Meanwhile, sports apparel maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell, and analysts are expecting earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
Oil weakened Thursday, extending the previous session’s substantial losses as record high U.S. crude inventories revived fears of a supply glut amid concerns about a hit to fuel demand from a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $37.55 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $40.01.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,771.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1208, down 0.4%.

MUMBAI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) will drop the word ""fair"" from its ""Fair & Lovely"" brand of skin lightening products which are popular in South Asia but have long been criticised for promoting negative stereotypes against people with darker skin.
Companies face a mounting backlash on social media in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Products marketed for skin lightening have a huge market in South Asia due to a societal obsession with fairer skin tones, but those notions are being questioned more frequently as perceptions change.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) this month said it would stop selling skin-whitening creams which are popular in Asia and the Middle East. 
""We recognise that the use of the words 'fair', 'white' and 'light' suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don't think is right, and we want to address this,"" Sunny Jain, president of Unilever's beauty and personal care division, said in a statement.
Unilever's 'Fair & Lovely' brand dominates the market in South Asia. Similar products are also sold by L'Oréal (PA:OREP) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG). 
""We are making our skin care portfolio more inclusive ...a more diverse portrayal of beauty,"" Hindustan Unilever Chairman Sanjiv Mehta said in a separate statement. 
Unilever owns a 67% stake in Hindustan Unilever, its India unit. The companies also sell the popular Dove and Knorr range of products. 
In India, fairness products have long been endorsed by leading Bollywood celebrities, as well as other popular youth icons. 
Advertisements have regularly featured two faces showing skin tone transformation, as well as shade guides to show ""improvement"".
Hindustan Unilever said it had moved from that line of advertising in 2019, and ""will continue to evolve its advertising to feature women of different skin tones, representative of the variety of beauty across India.""
The brand name change is subject to regulatory approvals, the company said in a filing to the exchanges. It did not specify what the new name would be.
A source in the parent company told Reuters that alternatives like ""Dare & Lovely, ""Care & Lovely,"" or ""Fresh & Lovely"" were being considered, but products with the old brand name will not be recalled. 
""A recall is done when the product has a problem, please bear in mind the quality is not under the scanner, the name is,"" the source said. 
This month activists started petitions on Change.Org, drawing thousands of signatures, including one by Nina Davuluri, who in 2014 became the first Indian American to be crowned Miss America.
""I have goosebumps as I read this! Kudos to you @Unilever,"" Chandana Hiran, a Mumbai-based finance executive who started a Change.org petition called #allshadesarelovely, tweeted on Thursday.
Separately, a source at L'Oréal in India said the French cosmetics company was also having discussions in view of the backlash. 
""Words such as skin brightening, whitening, lightening could soon become a thing of the past on all labels and product sales pitches,"" the source said.

L'Oréal India declined to comment. L'Oréal in France did not respond to an e-mail seeking immediate comment.

MADRID (Reuters) - A Madrid court will start preliminary proceedings on Sept. 14 for a lawsuit brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel against Santander (MC:SAN) over the bank's withdrawal of an offer to make him CEO, a court spokesman said on Thursday.
Initially, the hearing was scheduled to take place on April 13 but ordinary judicial activity in Spain was suspended during the coronavirus lockdown.
Orcel, one of Europe's most famous bankers, is suing the Spanish bank for 112 million euros ($126 million), claiming breach of contract.
He was offered the CEO job at Santander in September 2018 but the bank changed its mind the following January, saying it could not meet his pay demands.
""The preliminary hearing is scheduled for September 14 at 11.00 am, when technicalities such as what procedural evidence or which potential witnesses can be accepted will be decided as part of the case,"" the court spokesman said.
The case has raised interest in the financial community as hirings and firings of CEOs are generally done behind close doors with potential conflicts resolved privately.
Santander declined to comment. Alvaro Remon, Orcel's lawyer, was not immediately available for comment.

The hearing is part of a lengthy legal process that could take several more months before full trial, the court spokesman added.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 06:34AM ET</span>",Lufthansa soars after top shareholder backs bailout,"By Ilona Wissenbach and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares jumped as much as 20% on Thursday after its top shareholder dropped his objections to a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) government bailout for the German airline brought to the brink of collapse by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""I will vote for the proposal,"" billionaire investor Heinz Hermann Thiele, who recently increased his stake in Lufthansa to 15.5%, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine daily on Wednesday.
His endorsement amounts to an 11th-hour reprieve for Germany's flagship airline after fears had swirled he might veto the proposed rescue, which will see the government take a 20% stake and board seats, diluting existing shareholdings.
Shareholders are due to vote on the plan later on Thursday at a meeting held online due to the pandemic. 
Thiele's backing will come as a relief to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who could ill afford another high-profile business collapse following the failure of payments firm Wirecard. 
Lufthansa, which traces its roots back almost a century, employs around 138,000 people and owns brands including Eurowings and Austrian Airlines. 
It has been brought to its knees by COVID-19 and what promises to be a protracted travel slump, and like many rivals across the world, sought state help to stay afloat. Even after Thursday's gains, its shares are down almost 40% this year.
Also on Thursday, European Union regulators approved Lufthansa's bailout deal, subject to a ban on dividends, share buybacks and some acquisitions until state support is repaid.
At 1015 GMT, Lufthansa's stock was up around 14% at 10.18 euros, leading Germany's mid-cap MDAX index (MDAXI).
JOBS AT RISK
Concerned a government stake would make it harder for Lufthansa to make tough decisions about restructuring and job cuts, Thiele had instead proposed an indirect government holding in the airline via Germany's KfW development bank. 
That sparked fears the bailout would fail and Lufthansa would have to seek protection from creditors within days.
Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said the German government did not plan to get involved in the operations of the airline.
""Everyone is aware that we are in a global competition. We need the tools to compete against American or Chinese airlines,"" Spohr told the Bild newspaper.
Thiele said talks with the government on Monday had not removed his doubts, but he could not have voted for insolvency. He said he would continue to seek to influence the company's development in the future, although declined to say how.
Thiele said it was in the interests of Lufthansa employees that management quickly negotiate restructuring with unions.
Up to 22,000 jobs could be at risk at the airline.
Spohr said he wanted to avoid job losses by cutting working time and salaries for all employees, suggesting hours and wages could be reduced by a fifth instead of axing a fifth of jobs.
Lufthansa struck a deal overnight with the UFO union representing German cabin crew that is set to reap more than 500 million euros in savings, including steps to stop pay rises, cut working hours, and a cap on pension contributions.
More talks are scheduled on Friday with services union Verdi.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>","Frustration, fear and family: lockdowns test investment bankers","By Sinead Cruise and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Lockdowns are sharpening the knives in the cut-throat world of M&A banking.
Stuck at home, armed only with a phone and a laptop, senior advisors are finding out just how strong their relationships with clients really are while frustrated juniors are left to crunch numbers in the shadows, deprived of the personal access to the rainmakers who could give their careers a boost.
With the dreaded ""doughnut"" – or zero bonus – almost a given this year, and some banks looking to cut jobs to weather the health crisis, the strains on bankers watching multi-billion dollar pre-pandemic deals go up in smoke is taking its toll.
""It's like a Darwinian selection,"" said a senior advisor at a Wall Street bank. ""If you're a senior banker and you don't win a single pitch you can only blame yourself. You've failed to cultivate your relationships and now it's clear to everyone.""
""If you don't know them well enough, you will never win a mandate over Zoom,"" said the banker, who declined to be named.
A lack of face-to-face contact is not just exposing the shortcomings of some senior financiers, it is also making it harder for junior associates to learn on the job and progress, headhunters, lawyers and bankers said.
""Junior bankers are challenged by old problems – long hours, excessive workload and lack of acknowledgement – but this lockdown has made them more acute,"" said Anna Marietta, co-founder and managing partner of headhunter Vici Advisory.
""Juniors – especially analysts and interns – can also learn through osmosis and they need physical interaction in the office. They need to see how their managers are handling client relationships and solving problems,"" she said.
RELATIONSHIP CHALLENGE
Global M&A volumes are down 41% so far this year, a far cry from the champagne-popping records of recent years when bankers at Goldman Sachs (N:GS), JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Citi (N:C) and Bank of America (N:BAC) - the top five dealmakers - were the toast of Wall Street.
Massive government support for companies, particularly in Europe, is keeping many firms afloat and delaying the kind of lucrative takeover deals that have put M&A advisors at the top of the investment banking world, bankers and lawyers said.
    But the pressure to drum up business means the workload - which often involves all-nighters and 100-hour weeks - is as heavy and stressful as ever, ramping up the risks for employers who turn a blind eye to potential burnout.
""Employers have always been responsible legally and financially for harm caused when they didn't ensure an employee's mental or physical safety at work,"" said Melanie Stancliffe, employment partner at Cripps Pemberton Greenish.
""Ensuring the physical safety of employees is the prime business reason to work from home and in this new normal, the focus needs to shift to protecting employees from other risks so they are well and can support - not sue - their employer."" 
For some bankers, the job stress is compounded by working from home in proximity to their families and juggling chores with conference calls, a shock to the system for people used to jetting around the world to schmooze clients.
""The lockdown for many throws into sharp relief the health of their home lives,"" Paul McLaren, consultant psychiatrist at The Priory's Wellbeing Centre in the City of London.
""For many high achieving City workers that is an area of their lives which they may have neglected, and participated in only from a distance. Rebalancing the power relationships at home with partners is a particular challenge at the moment.""
LOCKDOWN STRAINS
Still, investment bankers, with their bumpers salaries and bonuses from years past, can afford more palatial setups than most employees working from home during the health crisis.
    Some senior bankers in Britain have escaped to their remote country piles while others have hunkered down in spacious pads with attic studies in upmarket London neighbourhoods.
For some, the opportunity to spend more time with their family is a rare gift they relish. 
For others, the pandemic is exposing fractures in their personal lives. Well-known lawyers and psychiatrists contacted by Reuters have reported a surge in requests for help with relationships and mental health.
    ""Suddenly, a high-powered financial professional is stuck all day at home with someone that they usually barely see from week to week and with whom they've learned to co-exist at a distance,"" said Ayesha Vardag, known in City circles for winning multi-million dollar divorce settlements for her clients.
Vardag told Reuters that inquiries from financial sector employees and their spouses jumped 170% in the week to May 27 as British lockdown restrictions began to ease, with some choosing to call time on their marriages before bonus cuts and layoffs damaged prospective settlements.
    ""Many financial sector clients and their spouses are reactivating divorce enquiries they made before lockdown, left in abeyance because they wanted to work on their marriages,"" she said. ""Then they found they couldn't stand it any longer.""
'THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY'
For junior bankers, who typically range in age from the early 20s to early 30s, the lack of career progress under lockdowns is the main source of stress coupled with an ongoing hiring freeze at most banks. 
Shut out of video calls with clients due to digital security concerns, five analysts and associates said their opportunities to learn from - and impress - their bosses were limited. 
Instead of knocking on a partner's door to discuss ideas, some juniors said they had to lobby line managers to set up a call with their bank's top rainmakers.
    The top two M&A banks, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, said they were pulling out the stops to keep junior colleagues engaged. 
They pointed to a range of initiatives such as cocktail parties hosted by senior executives on Zoom, wellness programmes, online yoga and virtual choirs to relieve stress. 
Banking bosses, meanwhile, are counselling their troops to sit tight and wait, as the deal drought will eventually end.
""From the middle of March until the end of May, nobody felt it was the right time to buy a business. But things have started to change,"" said JPMorgan's co-head of global M&A Dirk Albersmeier.

""Europe is coming out of this crisis faster than the United States. In certain European markets bankers are already sitting in the same room with their clients which may accelerate the recovery. Getting to an agreement is often easier the old-fashioned way.""

997,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Carnival seeks first leveraged loan to shore up liquidity,"By Claire Ruckin
LONDON (LPC) - US cruise line operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) is looking to raise its first leveraged loan as it seeks alternative forms of liquidity to shore up its business, which has been sunk by the coronavirus pandemic.
The US$1.5bn dual-currency loan launched just before S&P lowered Carnival's credit rating to junk on Tuesday. Losing its investment-grade status was the latest blow to the beleaguered company that has been struggling with cancelled sailings since mid-March at an estimated cost of US$250m per month.
“Whatever the ratings metrics it is a cruise company, and there are the technicals of the ratings versus people’s perception of the credit,” a capital markets head said.
The five-year term loan B includes a minimum €500m tranche and is guided to pay 675bp-700bp, at 96 OID. The dollar TLB will have a 1% floor and the euro TLB a 0% floor. The loan is offered with call protection of NC1/102/par.
The cruise industry has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus and Carnival's revenues dropped to US$700m in the three months to May 31 from US$4.8bn a year earlier, contributing to a second-quarter net loss of US$4.4bn.
As such, Carnival will pay up for its debt.
“While lots of deals with near I-grade ratings are structured and priced as crossover credits, on this deal the clue is in the pricing. With a yield of up to 8% the pricing is more akin to a B3/CCC,” the capital markets head said.
STAY AFLOAT
Carnival secured a US$6.25bn debt-plus-equity recapitalisation in April that was designed to keep the cruise ship operator afloat for the next year.
It raised US$4bn from the sale of three-year debt, paying an 11.5% coupon at 99 OID and another US$2.25bn from equity-linked securities.
While still technically investment-grade at that time, Carnival's US$4bn secured debt offering was marketed as high-yield bonds and featured a covenant package to match.
This loan will similarly tap into leveraged loan market liquidity to help keep it functioning, even if normal business doesn’t resume for the foreseeable future.
“The punchline of the April offerings was that the company was raising enough liquidity to get through to the end of the fiscal year in November with no revenue. Now at the same time they have a number of debt that matures in 2021 and capital commitments for new build ships in 2021 so the premise around this whole exercise is that there is an insurance policy to protect against downside risk for whatever reason they may need it, such as a second wave of Covid,” a senior banker said.
While it was tempting to return to the bond market to raise the liquidity, there was a concern that investors would have capacity constraints from deploying more money to the sector.
Instead, bankers are targeting CLOs that are desperate for some highly rated paper, having been inundated with portfolios that have suffered downgrades to B3 and CCC.
“It struck as an opportunity to go to a more CLO base and have a part of the buyer universe that was not addressed in the bond to give the company additional flexibility,” the senior banker said.
RISKY BUSINESS
It is extremely rare to encounter a near investment-grade borrower tapping leveraged liquidity, especially with such rich pricing.
While commercial bank lenders are more focused on relationship lending in the investment-grade market, the buyers of leveraged debt are more economically driven.
“The right economic package had to be put forward to make this a valid investment opportunity for the CLOs and funds,” the senior banker said.
The risk-reward equation on this deal has had to take account of a possibility that a second wave of the virus could happen or the continuation of restrictions on cruise liners, which could impact Carnival’s cashflows and its ability to support its debt.
“I can't think of an offering with this pricing with this rating. It's a risky investment as it is not in business and losing money. Some people will say no straight away due to the sector. But if you take a view it is a going concern, and business will return, then a Double B paying 675bp-700bp at 96 is a no-brainer,” a second senior banker said.

JP Morgan is lead left and global coordinator with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Mizuho, Banca IMI (LON:IMI), HSBC, Santander (MC:SAN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), SMBC and Siebert are bookrunners.  Barclays  (LON:BARC), PNC, ANZ, DZ and Bank of China are co-managers.

998,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Lufthansa Takes the Bailout as the Price of Its Monopoly,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- To paraphrase George Orwell, if you want a picture of the future, imagine a national flag carrier stamping on a paying passenger – forever.
The shareholders of Lufthansa are waving through a 9 billion euro bailout plan Thursday that will see the German government take a 20% stake and two board seats at the company. The motion is expected to pass at an extraordinary shareholder meeting Thursday after the company’s largest private shareholder, Heinz Hermann Thiele, dropped his opposition to it on Wednesday, after meeting with government officials.
The deal says a lot about the direction that Europe is going in as a result of the pandemic. Instead of seeing it as an opportunity to sweep away postwar creations that are no longer fit for purpose, such as flag carriers, its leadership is trying desperately to defend the indefensible, terrified of change, more preoccupied with the loss of relative prestige within Europe rather than with the welfare of the customer.
The European Commission’s antitrust department, which only two years ago was still able to face down the monopolistic instincts of French and German industry in the shape of the proposed Siemens-Alstom rail merger, has rolled over. Having initially insisted that Lufthansa give up 72 landing slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports, it has now settled for only 24. Lufthansa will still have some two-thirds of landing slots at both, after having swallowed most of Air Berlin three years ago.
That means less competition and less competition means higher prices and, as far as the eye can see, fewer people flying. Perhaps this is the subconscious, or at least unspoken, intention of a government and a continent that has suddenly discovered that airlines have a carbon footprint. It isn’t a secret that Berlin and Paris would prefer people to use Deutsche Bahn and SNCF – two more state-owned money pits – rather than airplanes of any stripe.
But the Berlin government’s public statements suggest its real concern is about losing market share in intercontinental flying to hubs in France and the Netherlands, and about the spread of the looser - i.e, less generous -- employment terms of rivals such as Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air.
This government can’t hide its love for the high-wage, high-pension, high-protection labor model that Lufthansa can only defend if its market share is protected by regulation. The announcement of a deal on Thursday with cabin crew union UFO to shave labor costs by 500 million euros doesn’t end that model, although it will allow the government to claim that it extracted some concessions in return for its support.
Lufthansa share had risen 14.9% by 9 AM ET. By contrast, easyJet (LON:EZJ) shares in London were down 5.4% after it had to raise fresh capital from exclusively private shareholders to shore up its own liquidity position.
Over the last three years, Lufthansa shares have fallen 46%, and EasyJet’s have fallen 49%. For investors in European airlines, the destination appears to be the same, the question is merely whether you get there in business class or cattle class."
999,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","EU to propose single stock report to compete with London, document shows","By Francesco Guarascio and Huw Jones
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will propose a single report on stock market transactions as part of efforts to build a ""truly integrated"" capital market after Brexit, an EU document showed on Thursday.
The European Commission is working on the next phase in creating a capital markets union (CMU) to help companies raise more funds by issuing stocks and bonds as the economy recovers from COVID-19.
A ""consolidated tape"" that knits together upwards of 20 trading platforms across Europe is a longstanding ambition to replicate the efficiencies of the U.S. stock market.
It would give investors a snapshot of prices at which each stock is traded. Some stocks are traded on multiple platforms, making it harder to see if investors are getting the best deal.
""The Commission will propose the necessary legislative changes to support the establishment of an effective and comprehensive post-trade consolidated tape for equity and equity-like financial instruments by Q4 2021,"" the European Commission briefing document seen by Reuters said.
The need to bolster the capital market has been made more urgent by the departure of Britain, Europe's biggest financial centre, from the EU.
The ""vast majority of member states"" are still ""strongly opposed"" to centralising more supervisory powers in the bloc, the document said.
""We could emphasise the need to develop a single rule book that would seek the alignment of rules and limit national supervisory discretion in the post-Brexit and multi-entry EU,"" the document said.
The European Commission is due to set out its proposals to bolster CMU on September 23.
""It will also include a careful narrative on Brexit and the need for the EU to develop its own full-fledged, well-functioning and integrated market for capital,"" the document said.
""At the same time, the need for sovereignty would have to be carefully balanced against the imperative to promote an outward-looking EU Capital Market Union that would continue to be attractive to third-country investors.""
There is no consensus so far on how far to reform securitisation. Other ideas include extending the exemption for EU-regulated mutual funds from investor disclosure rules until they have been reworked.
The EU executive will assess by early 2022 the feasibility of a pan-EU label for financial advisors, it said.

Investing.com - European stock markets reversed early losses Thursday, with a rebound in consumer confidence in Germany helping to stem the drop in market confidence caused by increasing U.S. coronavirus cases and a global growth downgrade from the International Monetary Fund.
At 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.5%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.4%.
The GfK German consumer climate survey showed a more significant improvement in sentiment in Europe’s most important economy than expected, with the July number coming in at -9.6, compared with the expected -12, and a jump from -18.6 the previous month.
However, this initially failed to stem the drop in market confidence prompted by International Monetary Fund cutting its 2020 global output forecasts further on Wednesday, saying the coronavirus pandemic has caused more damage to the world economy than first thought.
Adding to the woe was a surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S., particularly in the states where restrictions were lifted early. This prompted the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to announce that visitors from states with high coronavirus infection rates must self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival, increasing fears of fresh lockdowns in the world’s largest economy.
Attention will turn later in the session on the release of the minutes from the last meeting of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy committee, the meeting where the central bank increased its pandemic emergency purchase programme by 600 billion euros.
In corporate news, German payments provider Wirecard (DE:WDIG) succumbed to the inevitable and filed for insolvency, three days after admitting to a $2.1 billion hole in its accounts. 
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock soared more than 14% after the company's biggest private shareholder Heinz Herrmann Thiele dropped his opposition to the government's proposed 9 billion euro bailout of the airline, which announced separately a deal with a labor union that should save it 500 million euros a year.
Staying in the sector, rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) slumped 5.4% after launching a 450 million pounds ($558 million) rights issue to shore up its cash reserves in the face of the Covid-19 crisis.
 Unite Group  (LON:UTG) also raised 300 million pounds ($373 million) via a share placing, with the student-accommodation builder’s stock falling 2.4%.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stock climbed 0.3% after agreeing to pay up to $10.9 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits with U.S. plaintiffs alleging one of the company’s products causes cancer, bringing a prolonged legal battle.
Oil weakened Thursday, extending the previous session’s hefty losses as record high U.S. crude inventories revived fears of a supply glut amid concerns about a hit to fuel demand from a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.
Wednesday's selloff came after U.S. government data showed crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels, driving inventories to a record high for a third straight week last week. 
At 4:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $37.74 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $40.07.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The world's largest container shipper, A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKB), will team up with industry majors to set up a research center in Denmark with the aim of reducing carbon emissions in the shipping industry. 
Denmark's Maersk, which aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050, said on Thursday the research center would combine knowledge from industry, academia and regulators towards ""decarbonizing"" the industry by developing carbon-neutral fuel and technologies. 
The shipping industry, which carries around 80% of global trade and accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, pledged last year to have ships and marine fuels with zero carbon emissions ready by 2030. 
The move would be funded by Maersk's majority owner, the A.P. Moller Foundation, which has donated 400 million Danish crowns ($60.36 million) towards building the Copenhagen-based research hub set to initially employ 100 people, Maersk said. 
Denmark, which has one of the world's most ambitious climate goals of cutting emissions by 70% by 2030, is home to renewable energy majors like wind farm developer Orsted (CO:ORSTED) and turbine maker Vestas (CO:VWS).
""With this donation, The A. P. Moller Foundation wishes to support the efforts to solve the climate issue in global shipping,"" chairman of the foundation's board, Ane Uggla, said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Thursday, consolidating after the sharp selloff in the previous session aided by a rebound in consumer confidence in Germany. However,  arket confidence has been hit by increasing U.S. coronavirus cases and a global growth downgrade from the International Monetary Fund.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were largely flat, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
The GfK German consumer climate survey showed a more significant improvement in sentiment in Europe’s most important economy than expected, with the July number coming in at -9.6, compared with the expected -12, and a hefty jump from -18.6 the previous month.
Attention will turn later in the session on the release of the minutes from the last meeting of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy committee, the meeting where the central bank increased its pandemic emergency purchase programme by 600 billion euros.
The major European indices had all dropped around 3% on Wednesday, while Wall Street saw its worst day in two weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 700 points.
The trigger for the selloff was the move from the International Monetary Fund to cut its 2020 global output forecasts further, saying the coronavirus pandemic has caused more damage to the world economy than first thought.
The IMF said it now expects 2020 global output to shrink by 4.9%, compared with a 3.0% contraction predicted in April.
However, the more important factor behind the selling was a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States, particularly in the states where restrictions were lifted early. This prompted the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to announce that visitors from states with high coronavirus infection rates must self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival, increasing fears of fresh lockdowns in the world’s largest economy.
In corporate news, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will be in the spotlight Thursday after the troubled airliner said it had agreed a deal with a workforce union that will save more than 500 million euros.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) will also be in focus after agreeing to pay up to $10.9 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits with U.S. plaintiffs alleging one of the company’s products causes cancer, ending a prolonged legal battle.

(Reuters) - Seeking to forestall further claims,  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) is taking a risky bet that an independent scientific review will ultimately show that its widely used weed killer Roundup does not cause cancer, legal experts said.
The company on Wednesday agreed to pay as much as $10.9 billion to settle about 75% of the 125,000 filed and unfiled claims by Roundup users who say the herbicide caused them to develop a form of blood cancer. 
But Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) had to find a separate solution to mitigate the risk of future claims without pulling the product off the shelves. The company decided to make a calculated gamble on the scientific evidence which so far has overwhelmingly supported its claim that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is safe for agricultural use.
Regulators worldwide, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency, have determined glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic.
But the World Health Organization's cancer research arm determined the herbicide to be a ""probable carcinogen"" in 2015 and since 2018, three consecutive U.S. juries, who listened to scientific evidence from both sides during trial, found that Roundup causes cancer.
""Bayer is taking a huge risk by doing this and it's a bet that time can show that the science underlying the plaintiffs' claims is bad,"" said David Noll, a law professor at Rutgers University.
While many details of the proposal have yet to be released by Bayer and approved by a federal judge, the plan calls for an independent panel of scientific experts, who will likely be chosen and agreed upon by both sides.
The company will pay $1.25 billion to support the panel's research, an amount that does not include any payouts to settle future lawsuits.
The scientific review process is expected to take at least four years, and findings by the panel would be binding on Bayer and anyone who has used Roundup before Wednesday but not developed cancer. 
If the panel finds glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic, those users could not sue. 
If the panel determines glyphosate causes cancer, however, Bayer could face a flood of new lawsuits, with potential damages determined at a later stage. Bayer on Wednesday said the lead plaintiffs' lawyers have agreed to its plans, but Reuters was not immediately able to reach those attorneys for comment. 
Lawyers for Roundup cancer claimants in the past have alleged that Bayer manipulated scientific studies and deceived the scientific community, claims Bayer denies.
Company executives on calls with reporters and analysts on Wednesday repeatedly said the science was in their favor.
""We are confident that the science panel will look at the scientific body of evidence and come to the conclusion that glyphosate is safe,"" said Bayer's global head of litigation, Bill Dodero. 
Scientific panels have been set up in previous mass torts but generally not as part of a settlement process, legal experts said. Bayer's proposal was ""creative but risky"" and will likely face procedural challenges in court, said Adam Zimmerman, a professor at Loyola Law School.
The experts said many details, including how people who have not yet gotten sick could give up their rights to a future lawsuit under the proposal, remained unclear.

An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on 'speculations or our future plans.'
In a separate stock exchange filing, Australia's  Brickworks  Ltd (AX:BKW) said it was in 'advanced discussions' with a customer for a warehouse development near Sydney through a 50-50 joint venture with industrial property giant  Goodman  Group (AX:GMG). 
Brickworks, which has an industrial property division, did not name the 'major client.' 
CEO Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Partridge told Reuters in an interview Brickworks' industrial property business has been doing well with rental receipts ""still coming in strongly."" 
""We have the Coles (AX:COL) warehouse which has been announced to build and we are in advanced discussion with another major client,"" he said.
When asked if he was referring to Amazon, Partridge said ""that's the speculation."" 
Amazon's reported expansion plans come on the back of surging online sales as consumers shift to e-tailing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Just two weeks ago, Amazon had announced the opening of its first Queensland fulfilment centre in Brisbane later this year. The company currently has three fulfilment centres in Australia, based in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said the reopening of theme parks and resort hotels in California will be delayed until Disneyland receives approval from state officials, as the state is hit by a huge spike in new coronavirus cases.
Disney had originally planned to reopen the Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park on July 17.
""California has now indicated that it will not issue theme park reopening guidelines until sometime after July 4,"" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday.
An alarming surge in coronavirus infection rates around the country have prompted calls for a delay in reopening of theme parks and other facilities where big crowds gather.
California witnessed its largest ever spike in confirmed new cases on Tuesday, with an additional 7,149 infections taking the state total to 190,222. 
Disney had received pushback from unions representing 17,000 workers at its Disneyland Resort in Southern California, who said they were not convinced the theme park would be safe enough to reopen by the company's target date.
It has also come under pressure to delay the July 11 reopening of its Orlando, Florida-based Walt Disney World.
Disney began closing its theme parks around the world in January in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. Disney in early May said measures to contain the pandemic had cuts its profits by $1.4 billion, most from its shuttered theme parks.
Disney started reopening its theme parks in May, starting with Shanghai Disneyland, and last week reopened Hong Kong Disneyland. In Florida, it has partially reopened its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping complex.

The company did not provide a new reopening date for its California parks and said it would provide one when it has a better sense of the guidelines, when they are released by the state.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>","California wants judge to classify Uber, Lyft drivers as employees","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - California plans to ask a state court judge to force Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) to classify their ride-hail drivers as employees rather than contractors, ratcheting up the tension over a new gig worker law.
Shares of both companies fell nearly 8%. A hearing for the matter was set for Aug. 6.
The fight is one of the biggest clashes over the future of the so-called ""gig economy"" of workers, typically for delivery and other app-based services. California is Uber's and Lyft's biggest U.S. market.
In January, California implemented a law making it tougher for companies to classify workers as contractors rather than employees. The contractor designation is essential to Uber and Lyft, who are exempted from paying drivers overtime, healthcare, unemployment and workers' compensation.
The court fight also comes as the coronavirus has shut down much of the ride-hailing companies' business and gig workers for the first time were able to receive taxpayer-sponsored unemployment benefits under a federal pandemic relief bill.
In a filing in the Superior Court of California in San Francisco on Wednesday, lawyers for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said their office on Thursday will file a request for a preliminary injunction, which would force the change in status if approved by a judge.
Uber in a statement said most drivers preferred the independence afforded by working as contractors, that it had made changes because of the law, and that it calculated over 158,000 drivers in California would lose work if the reclassification happened.
Lyft in a statement said California should rather let voters decide on the issue during a November ballot initiative sponsored by Uber, Lyft and delivery company DoorDash Inc.

""If the courts were to grant the Attorney General’s request, it would have a devastating effect on millions of Californians at the worst possible time,"" Lyft said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - GlobalFoundries could expand output at its flagship U.S. plant or break ground on a new one next to it, the chief executive of the semiconductor contract manufacturer told Reuters on Wednesday.
U.S.-based GlobalFoundries, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned fund Mubadala, could install new equipment to take advantage of 30% to 40% of floor space that is unused at its Malta, New York factory, which would boost output within 12 to 14 months. In a second phase, it may build an adjacent plant that could be producing chips by 2024, CEO Tom Caulfield said in interview.
Caulfield said the plans would hinge on customer demand - which has been difficult to predict during the coronavirus pandemic - and could be significantly sped up if U.S. lawmakers pass a $22.8 billion package to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.
On Tuesday, GlobalFoundries, which makes specialty chips for customers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO), said it had secured a purchase option agreement for about 66 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to its Malta plant. Expanding the existing plant would cost ""in the single-digit billions"" while building a new plant would cost ""high single-digits or higher,"" he said without elaborating.
Lawmakers in Washington are calling for more funds to fuel growth of U.S. chip foundries, as the Trump administration faces off with Beijing to dominate the high-tech industry.
GlobalFoundries has direct and indirect business with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the biggest target of U.S. technology restrictions, but Caulfield said Huawei is ""not a very appreciable part of our business"" and that GlobalFoundries complies with all U.S. regulations.
Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democratic Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill this month to provide more than $22.8 billion in aid for semiconductor manufacturers and more legislation is expected.
""There's only a certain pace at which we can go,"" Caulfield said. ""A partnership with the U.S. can accelerate that capability. ... What may take us five years, we can accelerate to two years.""
In overall revenue, GlobalFoundries is the world's third-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) but ranks second-largest when factoring out the part of Samsung's foundry business that makes chips for other elements of the Korean firm.
GlobalFoundries expects flat revenue this year of about $5.5 billion, below its initial forecast of $6 billion, after selling a custom-chip business to  Marvell Technology Group Ltd  (O:MRVL) for $600 million last year. GlobalFoundries viewed the business as competing with its own customers.
The manufacturer still plans an initial public offering that allows Mubadala to maintain a majority stake, but the listing may slip into 2023 from a previously projected 2022, Caulfield said, adding the timing depends more on financial milestones than a date.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. Senate Democrats are pressing America's top meatpackers to disclose by month's end how much pork, beef and chicken they shipped to China during the coronavirus outbreak while warning of possible meat shortages at home.
The request from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker increases scrutiny of companies like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), JBS USA and Smithfield Foods, after thousands of meatpacking workers were infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Such companies exported 112,327 tonnes of U.S. pork to China in April, more than any previous month and up 257% from a year earlier, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
The exports raise questions about why U.S. meat prices soared during the pandemic and President Donald Trump in April ordered slaughterhouses to stay open to protect the nation's food supply, Warren and Booker said in a letter to Tyson, JBS, Smithfield and Cargill Inc this week., 
Reuters reported on May 11 that Trump, a Republican, was facing criticism from some lawmakers, consumers and plant employees for putting workers at risk in part to help ensure China's meat supply.
""This pattern of behavior raises questions about whether you are living up to your commitments to the workers who produce your pork and beef; the communities in which you operate, and the nation's consumers that rely on your products to feed their families,"" Warren and Booker told the meat companies.
Tyson and JBS have said they reduced exports to focus on meeting U.S. demand. Smithfield retooled a plant to supply U.S. consumers, a year after workers said the company reconfigured the same facility to process hogs for China. Cargill said it does not export U.S. meat and poultry to China.

China's demand for meat imports increased after a fatal pig disease decimated its herd and sent Chinese pork prices to record highs.

Investing.com - KB Home on Wednesday reported fiscal second-quarter results that fell short of estimates on both the top and bottom lines as the Covid-19 pandemic hurt demand.   
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) slumped 7% in after-hours after ending the day 2% lower.
For the quarter ended March, the company reported earnings per share of $0.55, up from $0.51 a year ago, on revenue of $914 million, down from $1.02 billion. That was short of consensus estimates for earnings of $0.53 a share on revenue of $1.08 billion.
The miss on the top line comes as orders in the quarter suffered from coronavirus-led disruptions to activity as the homebuilder was forced to shutter operations  
Orders fell to 1,758 in the quarter from 4,064 in the year-ago quarter.
The homebuilder delivered 2,499, down from 2,768 a year earlier at an average selling price of $364,100, down from $367,700.
“The prolonged stay-at-home public health orders, resulting economic shutdown and our conservative approach to navigating the uncertain environment significantly impacted our orders during the quarter,"" KB Home said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks finally succumbed to investor worries about a second wave of coronavirus cases after managing to shrug off concerns earlier in the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 700 points on Wednesday, and tech giants could not maintain their record-setting pace.
Businesses across the U.S. are trying to reopen even though new hotspots continue to pop up. That has led to worries that the progress will be interrupted by a fresh round of Covid-19 shutdowns. Already, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been forced to reclose some of its retail stores, announcing the shuttering of seven stores in the Houston area beginning Thursday.
Restaurant groups, retailers, and travel and leisure stocks could feel more pain if new shutdowns are ordered. And the oil sector, which has staged a comeback from a sharp drop in demand in March and April, is feeling pressure because of the slow pace of recovery.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Earnings Reports Show Uneven Effect of Covid-19 Shutdowns
Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, is scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings Thursday before the opening bell. It's already a bleak outlook, with analysts tracked by Investing.com looking for a loss of $1.71 a share on revenue of $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, sports apparel maker  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) is set to report fourth quarter earnings after the closing bell, and analysts are expecting earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
2. Oil Sector in Spotlight After Mixed Data
Crude Oil WTI Futuresfell more nearly 6% on Wednesday after the government said crude stockpiles rose more than expected. At the same time, production also showed a surprising gain, indicating shale producers are back at work with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, trading around $38 a barrel.
Energy has been the worst performing sector of the S&P 500 this year despite staging a comeback since March and April, when demand for oil and oil products plummeted because of Covid-19 business shutdowns. Oil's sell-off on Wednesday also pressured shares of big oil companies such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) B PLC (NYSE:RDSb).
3. Investors Watch for the Trend in Jobless Claims
Also on Thursday, the government will report its weekly unemployment numbers. The progress has been good, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.9 million. Both would be down from the number of claims filed the prior week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.71%, or 708 points, the S&P 500 slipped 2.56%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.19%.
With more than half of all U.S. states reporting a rise in new coronavirus cases, with some breaking daily records, parts of the country are taking measures to contain the spread of the virus that threatens to undo some of the recent progress on reopening the economy.
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, where the rate of infections has slowed, will require visitors from states with increasing numbers of infections to self-isolate for 14 days, N.Y. Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday.
Other states have also suggested that restrictions could be reimposed to contain the outbreak.  
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was prepared to reinforce stringent coronavirus restrictions to contain the surge in infections in the state, which reported more than 5,000 new cases on Tuesday, the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began.
Florida, meanwhile, confirmed that cases jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a daily record, and now total 109,014.
 Disney  (NYSE:DIS) fell 3.8% after its theme park workers urged the company to delay the reopening following the uptick in coronavirus cases in Florida.
Energy led the decline in the broader market, paced by a slump in oil prices on fears the uptick in infections would slow the economy once more and hurt the usual a pick-up in demand seen during the summer months. The fall in oil prices was also exacerbated by a larger than unexpected build in U.S. weekly crude inventories, adding to concerns about the glut in supplies.
The reopening trade - bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – was shunned, with travel and tourism stocks down sharply.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 7.1%, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) slid 5.6%, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was down 11%, and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) slumped 11%,
Tech, which has weathered much of the virus-led wobbles in the market since March lows, fell out favor, with FAANG stocks in the red.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 3.4%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slipped 1.7%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 1.21% while Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slid 1.8% and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 2.1%.
Apple said it would temporarily reclose stores in Houston in the wake of rising Covid-19 infections. 
Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), meanwhile, sidestepped the selloff, rising 8.4%, following reports that it was exploring options to sell its $50 billion stake in VMware (NYSE:VMW).
Trade concerns also hurt investor sentiment in reports that the U.S. is considering new tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K."

FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), after more than a year of talks, agreed to pay as much as $10.9 billion to settle close to 100,000 U.S. lawsuits claiming that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup caused cancer, resolving litigation that has pummeled the company's share price. 
The German drugs and pesticides maker has come to terms with about 75% of the 125,000 filed and unfiled claims overall, it said in a statement on Wednesday of the deal to end legal disputes it inherited with its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
The settled cases over Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers account for about 95% of those currently set for trial, it added. 
""The Roundup settlement is the right action at the right time for Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) to bring a long period of uncertainty to an end,"" Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said. ""Unfortunately, we have to pay an awful lot of money for a product which is perfectly regulated.""
The company said it will make a payment of $8.8 billion to $9.6 billion to resolve the current Roundup litigation - including an allowance expected to cover unresolved claims - and $1.25 billion to support a separate class agreement to address potential future litigation.
Bayer did not admit liability or wrongdoing.
""Bayer is not getting complete relief, but trying to do as much as it can to calm uncertainty,"" said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School who has followed the litigation. 
The deal dwarfs previous out-of-court product liability settlements, such as Merck & Co's $5 billion deal to end litigation over its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx, and Bayer deals worth $2 billion to settle claims of harm caused by its Yasmin and Yaz birth control pills.
Ken Feinberg, who was appointed settlement mediator by a federal judge more than a year ago, said that while nearly 25,000 claims remained unsettled there will be no more trials as cases settle in coming months. 
""Bayer wisely decided to settle the litigation rather than roll the dice in American court,"" said Feinberg, who has mediated other high-profile disputes, including over the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP (NYSE:BP) Deepwater Horizon disaster and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s  diesel emissions scandal.
APPEALS TO CONTINUE
The three cases that have gone to trial will continue through the appeals process and are not covered by the settlement, Bayer said. 
A U.S. federal appeals court on Monday permanently blocked California from requiring a cancer warning on glyphosate-based Roundup. That ruling is separate from the wider litigation over whether Roundup causes a type of blood cancer.
The company, whose management in April regained shareholder support for its handling of the litigation, has denied claims that Roundup or its active ingredient glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the product is safe for human use.
Bayer said it expects to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and intends to keep its dividend policy.
The prospect of a surge in fresh lawsuits, fighting more than 20 trials a year and the accompanying unfavorable media coverage swayed Bayer to come to terms with claimants.
""We are well aware of the negative impact high profile trials already have had on our business and reputation,"" Baumann said.
Bayer shares are down 29% since it closed the Monsanto deal in June 2018. At one point last year as juries ruled against the company, Bayer's market value had fallen below what it paid for Monsanto.
As of April, the company had been sued by 52,500 U.S. plaintiffs who blame glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer, up from 48,600 in February. Law firms had lined up tens of thousands of additional claimants with cases yet to serve.
Bayer will continue to sell Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974. It will not add a cancer warning label to the product, a company spokesman said.
Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company's genetically modified seeds.
Potential future cases will be governed by a class agreement subject to court approval. The agreement includes the establishment of an independent scientific panel that will determine whether Roundup can cause cancer and, if so, at what minimum levels.
Bayer and the plaintiffs are bound by the panel's determination and no new lawsuits can be filed while the experts evaluate the science, a process expected to take about four years, Bayer said. 
Separately, Bayer agreed to resolve most cases in litigation over waste water contaminated with PCB, which Monsanto manufactured before 1977, for $820 million.

It also came to terms for up to $400 million to resolve lawsuits brought by land owners who say their crops were damaged by neighbors using Bayer's dicamba-based weedkiller. The product is alleged to evaporate easily and waft away from the target field.

Investing.com - Wall Street slumped on Wednesday, paced by a decline in energy, as investors fretted over the prospect of another lockdown after some parts of the U.S. imposed restrictions to combat a resurgence in coronavirus infections.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.67%, or 699 points, the S&P 500 slipped 2.63%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.30%.
With more than half of all US states reporting a rise in new coronavirus cases, with some breaking daily records, some parts of the U.S. are taking measures to contain the spread of the virus that threatens to undo some of the recent progress on reopening the economy.
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will require visitors from states with high rates of infections to self-isolate for 14 days, N.Y. Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday.
Other states have also suggested that restrictions could be reimposed to contain the outbreak.  
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was prepared to reimpose stringent coronavirus restrictions to contain the surge in infections in the state, which reported more than 5,000 new cases on Tuesday, the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began.
Florida, meanwhile, confirmed that cases in the state jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a record, and now total 109,014.
 Disney  (NYSE:DIS) fell 5% after its theme park workers urged the company to delay the reopening following a record uptick in coronavirus cases in Florida.
Energy, led the decline in the broader market, paced by a slump in oil prices on fears the uptick in infections would force some states to reimpose some restrictions, hurting the usual a pick-up in demand seen during the summer months. The fall in oil prices was also exacerbated by a larger than unexpected build in U.S. weekly crude inventories, adding to concerns about the glut in supplies.
The reopening trade - bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – was shunned, with travel and tourism stocks down sharply.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 5.8%, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) slid 5.7%, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was down 9.3%, and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) slumped 11%,
Tech, which has weathered much of the virus-led wobbles in the market since the March lows, fell out favor, with FAANG stocks in the red.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 3%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slipped 1.5%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 1% while Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slid 1.6% and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 2%.
Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), meanwhile, sidestepped the selloff, rising 7.6%, following reports that it was exploring options to sell its $50 billion stake in VMware (NYSE:VMW)."

Power quality study","(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler's (N:FCAU) Dodge and Kia Motors (KS:000270) topped an initial quality study of new vehicles sold in the United States based on owner responses, industry consultant J.D. Power said on Wednesday.
The study examined problems experienced by owners of new 2020 model-year vehicles during the first 90 days of ownership, and determined their initial quality based on the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles.
General Motors' (N:GM) Chevrolet and Fiat Chrysler's Ram tied for the third place.
The study found most domestic brands, including Fiat Chrysler's Dodge, Ram and Jeep as well as GM's Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, ranked above average.
GM's Chevrolet Sonic achieved the best score for individual model in the study.
""Collectively, this is the best-ever performance by the Detroit automakers — when compared with the import brands — in the history of the study,"" J.D. Power said.
The consultant added that most premium brands ranked below average, as they generally equip their vehicles with complex technology, which can cause problems for some owners. 
One-fourth of all problems cited by new vehicle owners related to infotainment, including complaints about built-in voice recognition and touchscreens.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) made its debut on the list with a score that suggested 250 problems per 100 vehicles. However, the electric car maker was not ranked as it did not meet the required criteria for a comparative study. 
""Unlike other manufacturers, Tesla doesn't grant us permission to survey its owners in 15 states where it is required,"" said Doug Betts, president of the automotive division at J.D. Power.

The study found that GM's plant in China, which makes the Buick Envision, was building vehicles with the fewest defects or malfunctions.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), accusing it of using a charity that helps cover Medicare patients' drug costs as a means to pay kickbacks for using its expensive macular degeneration drug Eylea.
The government filed a lawsuit against the company in federal court in Boston, the latest case to result from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers' financial support of patient assistance charities.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.
But the lawsuit said Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron following the launch of Eylea in 2011 began funneling tens of millions of dollars through a patient assistance foundation to ensure virtually no one on Medicare had to pay co-pays.
The lawsuit said the scheme helped Regeneron boost sales for the drug, which typically costs over $10,000 per year. From 2013 to 2014, when the scheme was operating, Medicare paid $1.9 billion for Eylea, the lawsuit said.
Regeneron in a statement said it would vigorously defend itself. ""We do not believe there is any merit to the complaint,"" the company said.
Its stock price midday Wednesday was $604.62, down 3.84%.
The lawsuit follows an investigation that has resulted in more than $865 million in settlements with drugmakers and charities, including the foundation the government says Regeneron used, Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund.
Good Days in October agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations it conspired with five other companies including Novartis AG to enable them to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their drugs. It did not admit wrongdoing.

The case is U.S. v. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11217.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Petrobras to receive offers for Bahia refinery on Thursday, sources say","By Tatiana Bautzer, Carolina Mandl, Gram Slattery and Sabrina Valle
SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA is set to receive binding offers for the country's second-largest refinery on Thursday, five people with knowledge of the matter said, as the state oil company aims to restart a plan to divest more than $10 billion in assets.
If the deal for the Landulpho Alves refinery, also known as RLAM, is concluded, it would mark a first in the producer's decade-long efforts to end its near-monopoly in refining in Brazil and open one of the top ten fuel markets in the world for private investors.
Potential bidders for the refinery in the northeastern state of Bahia include UAE investor Mubadala Investment Co PJSC [MUDEV.UL] and top Chinese state refiner Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), the people said. 
Indian conglomerate Essar Group, which has exploration operations in its home country and refining and fuel distribution assets in Britain, may also bid for RLAM, two sources said. Essar was initially interested in one of the smaller refineries expected to be sold later this year, according to the sources, that asked for anonymity to disclose private talks. 
Petrobras, Mubadala and Essar declined to comment by email. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Petrobras, as the producer is known, plans to sell half of its refining capacity, or eight plants, starting with RLAM, Brazil's first fuel unit ever. Although Petrobras' monopoly was ended by law two decades ago, the company has retained control of more than 98% of Brazil's fuel production.
The unit has processing capacity of 323,000 barrels per day, or about 14% of Brazil's total, and will be sold together with pipelines and terminals. The northeastern Brazilian plant, which dates from 1950, requires renovations, according to one of the sources.
As social isolation measures have been progressively eased in Brazil's largest cities, refineries are back to operating close to their regular capacities. 
Bidders had asked Petrobras for more time earlier this year, as financing became difficult and restrictions on visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected due-diligence work, Reuters reported.
Two other refineries in Brazil's southern region, REFAP in Rio Grande do Sul state and REPAR in Parana state, will have deadlines for binding offers in the third quarter, which could be as soon as July, two sources added.
Some potential buyers for all three refineries have completed due diligence, two sources said, as financing for acquisitions slowly returns after a dropoff as markets cratered in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The pandemic has squeezed the value of refineries, as drivers stayed home, reducing fuel consumption, and oil prices fell. Still, no potential bidders from an initial round of non-binding offers have so far dropped out, one of the sources said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - E-commerce players in India such as Amazon's (O:AMZN) local unit and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart will consider asking sellers on their platforms to list the country of origin on products, three sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The discussion was part of a meeting of online retailers held via video-conferencing, hosted by the federal commerce ministry's Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), two of the sources said.
The move comes amid India's efforts to single out Chinese-made products and cut down on their import following a clash between the two neighbours at a disputed Himalayan border site that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. []
The definition of ""country of origin"", however, remains vague with some products assembled in countries including India but with their components or raw material sourced from another nation, and companies have asked the government to clarify its stand, the sources said.
All three sources declined to be identified because the meeting was not public.
""This is optics. It won't really change anything,"" one of the sources aware of the discussion said. ""But in principle all the company representatives in attendance agreed that we could do it, but we need time. And we suggested that a better way would be for government to talk to sellers directly.""
Amazon and Flipkart have agreed to compel their seller to display country of origin for all products, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
Amazon, Flipkart and DPIIT did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Anti-China sentiments have simmered in India for years, with accusations of cheap imported products undercutting locally-manufactured good. But the tensions have heightened since the border clash.
The Confederation of All India Traders, a group representing roughly 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, has sought the support of tycoon businessmen, including India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, to boycott Chinese goods.
An Indian state-run e-commerce portal has already begun displaying country of origin besides products sold on it.

(Reuters) - Petitioners are pressing  Disney  to delay the July 11 reopening of its Orlando, Florida-based Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World, citing recent spikes in COVID-19 cases in the state.
By Wednesday, more than 7,000 people had signed the petition, which was created by Katie Belisle, a Disney World Attractions hostess, and addressed to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. 
“This virus is not gone, unfortunately it’s only become worse in this state,” the petition says. “Having our theme parks remain closed until cases are steadily decreasing would keep our guests, our employees and their families safe.”
Belisle could not immediately be reached for comment.
Walt Disney Co parks have been closed since January to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company had estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March.
""The safety and wellbeing of our cast members and guests are at the forefront of our planning, and we are in active dialogue with our unions on the extensive health and safety protocols, following guidance from public health experts, which we plan to implement as we move toward our proposed, phased reopening,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement.
The Florida petition follows similar pushback from unions representing workers at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which is planning to reopen on July 17. In a June 18 letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, the unions said it is still unsafe to open the park. Over 49,500 people have signed a Change.org petition urging Disney to reopen the park at a later date. 
Disney has already reopened its Shanghai Disneyland theme park and has partially reopened its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping complex. Disneyland Paris will begin a phased reopening on July 15.

When Disney World reopens, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell sharply on Wednesday as a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States fanned fears of a fresh lockdown, with worsening forecasts of the economic damage from the pandemic further denting sentiment.
The United States has recorded the second-largest rise in infections since the health crisis began, with states where restrictions meant to slow the spread of the disease were lifted early witnessing a flare up in cases.
The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced that visitors from states with high coronavirus infection rates must self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.
Shares of U.S. airlines, resorts and cruise operators slumped and the S&P 1500 airlines index fell 7.3%.  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL),  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) and Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN) shed between 9% to 12%.
""There is a sudden perception change among investors related to the extent of new round of virus cases,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
""The greatest focus is on COVID-19 (news) more than anything else until we get a more granular look at to what's going on.""
The pandemic was causing wider and deeper damage to economic activity than first thought, the International Monetary Fund said, prompting it to slash 2020 global output forecasts further to 4.9% from 3.0%.
Advanced economies have been particularly hard hit, with U.S. output now expected to shrink 8.0%, more than 2 percentage points worse than the April forecast.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index (VIX), rose to a one-week high at 35.86.

NHTSA is also probing 781,000 Chevrolet Equinoxes and GMC Terrain SUVs from 2010 to 2012 after receiving 52 complaints over a condition that could cause increased friction in the steering system. The friction may result in drivers feeling as if the steering wheel was sticking, the agency said, and added vehicles can still be turned but may require increased effort.
GM previously issued a service bulletin to address the issue and offered extended-warranty coverage to address it.
NHTSA said there was one report of an injury crash. The agency said it is reviewing vehicles that had the steering gear replaced under GM's special coverage but months later had additional steering concerns.
The issue is ""a slight feeling of friction in the steering system that can be an annoyance to customers,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said. ""We’ve reviewed this issue internally and have reviewed it with NHTSA previously. We do not consider it to be a safety issue.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The bright lights on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) old Times Square location in New York City have dimmed forever as the burger chain focuses on its newer flagship location up the street.
The old location on 42nd Street was hard to miss, with an old-school Broadway-style marquee emblazoned with row upon row of light bulbs. 
The closing had been planned before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the company said. The New York Post first reported the closure late Tuesday night.
The coronavirus outbreak has shuttered restaurants globally and prompted some big brands to rethink how they approach real estate in order to get food to people as quickly and with as little direct contact as possible.
Closing the 42nd Street location was ""a difficult decision,"" the company said in a statement. But McDonald's opened a new, three-story flagship restaurant nearby on 45th and Broadway last year. Both are company-owned locations.

""McDonald's reviews its restaurant portfolio on a regular basis to make the best decisions for our business moving forward,"" the company said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday finalized a directive requiring airlines to complete inspections of a key component of Boeing 737 MAX airplanes that, if faulty, could result in a loss of power to the engines.
The FAA, in response to a service bulletin issued by Boeing (N:BA) in December, proposed an airworthiness directive in February to mandate inspections. 
The directive addressed concerns that some 737 MAX exterior panels on top of the engine may not have electrical bonding necessary to ensure adequate shielding of underlying wiring from the electromagnetic effects of high-power radio frequency transmitters and other sources.
That, the FAA warned, ""could potentially lead to a dual-engine power loss event and/or display of hazardously misleading"" data. The agency added the that issue could result in a “forced off-airport landing.”
The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling plane, has been grounded since March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.
Boeing did not immediately comment.
The FAA said in February the directive would also address the potential safety risks of lightning strikes, but Boeing told the agency that was not accurate. The FAA agreed in its final directive to remove the reference to lightning, saying it had conducted further analysis since February.
Boeing said in December the issue affected airplanes built between February 2018 and June 2019 and as a result ""the protective foil inside the composite panels may have gaps.""
After the inspections, airlines will replace any excessively reworked panels, and modify an assembly to ensure adequate electrical bonding.

Reuters reported on June 10 Boeing is aiming to conduct a key flight certification test in late June. That test could take place as early as next week or could be set for early July, a person briefed on the matter said.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 12:01PM ET</span>","From Nordstrom to Saks, retailers reopen in NYC with challenges ahead","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Upscale retailers including  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), privately-owned Saks Fifth Avenue and jeweler  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF), reopened their large New York City flagship locations on Wednesday with reassuring signage and oversized jars of sanitizer to calm shoppers worried about cleanliness.
Curbing the spread of coronavirus is not the only challenge the retailers will face in coming weeks as the most populous and hardest-hit city in the United States reopens, experts said.
With record-low tourism, and many New Yorkers working from out-of-town locations, the retailers' pool of potential shoppers is much smaller now, even in the generally slower summer months.
Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners said that a lack of spending by tourists could bring a 9% to 12% average hit to upscale department stores' revenue compared with the year earlier. Foreign tourists are traditionally major spenders at department stores and luxury boutiques in New York City, as well as in Los Angeles and Miami.
Spokespeople for Nordstrom, Saks and Tiffany were not immediately available for comment.
Many non-essential retailers have pulled annual forecasts amid the virus outbreak, unsure of what the future may hold and how much people will want to spend on things like toys, apparel and accessories as well as home improvement. 
Over the last several months, they dangled deep discounts online, targeting quarantined shoppers, and have wrestled with mountains of unsold inventory.
NPD Group's chief industry analyst Marshal Cohen said he is paying attention to how many stores are open across a retailers’ fleet, how they are performing and, as their stores come back, how their online businesses are affected.
""It's no longer good enough to look at how sales are versus a year ago. We need to look now week by week,"" said Cohen, adding that he's also keeping tabs on restaurant traffic and unemployment figures.
Retailers' moves to ensure shopper safety include curbside pickup, virtual shopping and ""appointment only"" consultations.
Several retailers – including Saks, Nordstrom and Tiffany – decided to open their doors on Wednesday even though it became fair game on Monday to allow in-store retail in New York City.
""While we began preparing for reopening from the day we closed the flagship, we made the decision to open on Wednesday to ensure we had ample time to train our associates on our health and safety protocols and new services prior to opening,"" a Saks spokeswoman said.
On Monday, Macy's Inc (N:M) opened its 34th Street flagship store in Manhattan. Around 3 p.m. that day, there were only a handful of shoppers, way outnumbered by staff on the floor, according to a Reuters photographer.
Many New Yorkers have fled the city for the Hamptons and Montauk, both of which are on Long Island and farther along in the re-opening process.
Saks in May started offering same-day delivery to anywhere in the Hamptons. Customers can work with a style advisor to place orders via email or phone. Orders placed by 10 a.m. will arrive by that evening for a fee of $25, a company spokeswoman said.
Robert Burke, founder of luxury retail consultancy Robert Burke Associates, said what better a time for people to rethink retail in tourist hot-spots outside of Manhattan.
""They have got a full audience with residents and renters this summer more than ever,"" Burke said.

""It is even more difficult to get into the top restaurants and there is a pent-up desire of people to start the summer and just shop.""

1046,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Win Streak With Trump Regulators Dangles by Thread,"(Bloomberg) -- For Wall Street, this week might mark the end of the sweeping period of financial deregulation that has defined the Trump era.
Bank regulators will meet Thursday to wrap up a major revamp of the Volcker Rule and to scrap a constraint that’s forced lenders to set aside ten of billions of dollars to backstop derivatives trades. If President Donald Trump fails to win a second term, the changes will probably be among the last that watchdogs he’s appointed will get done before a new cast of agency heads takes over.
This push “could certainly represent the last wave of Dodd-Frank rollbacks under these regulators,” said Greg Gelzinis, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress. He notes that while some of the agency leaders could remain in their posts until their terms expire and the Senate confirms successors, a Joe Biden victory in November means they’d be working during a Democratic administration that has dramatically different priorities.
The Volcker Rule revisions that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency plan to take up this week will ease restrictions on lenders doing business with investment funds, including constraints on banks’ ties to venture capital funds. Last year, regulators already softened the better-known aspect of Volcker that restricts lenders from engaging in proprietary trading -- the practice of making market bets for themselves instead of on behalf of clients.
$40 Billion
Banking agencies are also poised to eliminate a separate requirement that banks hold margin when engaging in derivatives transactions with their own affiliates. Getting rid of the demand could free up an estimated $40 billion across the industry. But critics argue it could mean taxpayer-backed banks will amplify their risks to more dangerous levels.
Agency heads have six months left before the next administration begins. That’s not much time to propose an overhaul of regulations, seek public comment and finalize changes. That’s particularly true if Democrats retake the White House and the Senate because Congress can rescind rules within months of their approval through the Congressional Review Act.
Trump is trailing in polls across the board, nationally and in battleground states, according to the RealClearPolitics average. He had hoped to ride a strong economy to a second term, but the coronavirus and related shutdowns have left tens of millions out of work and the U.S. in recession. However, a New York Times poll released Wednesday showed the economy as the only bright spot for Trump. Half of those surveyed had a positive opinion of how the president is handling it.
Looking back, what bank regulators have accomplished in the past four years isn’t the doomsday scenario that consumer advocates feared after Trump pledged in January 2017 to “do a big number” on the Dodd-Frank Act. Core post-crisis rules remain intact that require banks to hold much more capital to protect against losses and to stockpile liquid assets to ensure they can endure runs. Those cushions have been credited -- by lenders and their overseers -- for keeping the Covid-19 economic turmoil from turning into an even more devastating crisis.
Leash Loosened
Still, the FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve and other agencies have succeeded bit by bit in loosening Wall Street’s leash under Trump. Rules they’ve relaxed include landmark post-crisis constraints, including the stress tests that assess whether banks can keep lending during economic calamities and living wills -- the detailed plans that are meant to map out a firm’s best route through bankruptcy. And deregulation is far from the only way Trump’s presidency has been good for banks, as the industry has been a big beneficiary of his tax cuts.
Regulators’ procedural missteps delayed work on rules relief that was at the top of Wall Street’s wish list, and agencies spent much of their time relaxing oversight for smaller banks. Rules that remain unfinished include an overhaul of big banks’ leverage limits, a long-awaited liquidity standard, a completion of market-risk controls and constraints on financial executives’ bonuses.
In many ways, the pace of rules-cutting has picked up during the coronavirus pandemic, as regulators moved to head off a severe recession by temporarily relaxing limits on banks’ leverage and other constraints. Wall Street critics worry that lobbyists will make a case for the changes to become permanent.
Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of banks’ most vocal opponents in Congress, sent a letter to regulators this week demanding that they reverse the decision on leverage, saying it’s “dangerous and puts the economy and hard-working families at risk.”

The coronavirus crisis, which had upended the financial markets, had slammed the brakes on market debuts for a while, but the appetite for new offerings is back up.
The company intends to offer 65.75 million shares in its IPO and has set a price range of $19-$21 per share, according to its regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1799208/000104746920003828/a2241948zs-1a.htm.
The higher end of the target range gives the company a valuation of $8.41 billion.
The company also plans to issue a private placement of shares worth $400 million to certain buyers. The shares will be sold at 98.5% of the IPO price and the full proceeds from the placement, contingent on IPO completion, will go to Dun & Bradstreet.
The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""DNB"". 
The offering comes less than two years after an investor group, led by former Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) dealmaker Chinh Chu, took Dun & Bradstreet private in a $6.9 billion deal.
The company provides businesses with data and analytics services and has more than 5,000 employees in North America, Europe and Asia, according to its website. 
For the three months ended March 31, revenue more than doubled to $395.3 million, from a year earlier. Operating loss narrowed to $8.3 million from $203 million.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Philippines to investigate Wirecard's phantom billions,"By Jörn Poltz and Karen Lema
MUNICH/MANILA (Reuters) - Wirecard's missing $2.1 billion is being investigated by the Philippines, which said that the German payments firm's former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek may be in the country.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said on Wednesday that he had told state investigators to coordinate with the Philippine central bank's anti-money laundering council in the inquiry.
Marsalek was fired on Monday after Wirecard said that the cash, purportedly held at two Philippine banks which have denied any links with the firm, probably did not exist.
""There are some indications that he may have returned recently and may still be here,"" Guevarra said in a text message to reporters, adding that immigration records showed the 40-year-old Austrian had been in the Philippines from March 3-5.
Marsalek's lawyer could not be reached for comment.
Wirecard's already battered shares fell a further 30% as a consortium of banks held crisis talks on how to recoup around $2 billion in loans to Wirecard, whose only listed bond crashed to 17 cents on the euro. 
Munich prosecutors may seek Marsalek's arrest, German business daily newspaper Handelsblatt reported. Germany has no extradition treaty with the Philippines. 
The prosecutor's office declined to comment, as did the court that would need to approve any arrest warrant. 
Former chief executive Markus Braun, who was arrested in Munich on Monday on suspicion of misrepresenting Wirecard's accounts and of market manipulation, was released on Tuesday after posting bail of 5 million euros ($5.6 million).
Although a warrant against Braun, who is also Austrian, has been lifted, he remains under investigation. Braun's lawyer Alfred Dierlamm declined to comment.
'CLARITY UNLIKELY'
During Braun's 18 years as CEO, Wirecard (DE:WDIG) grew into a $28 billion 'fintech' firm that won a spot in 2018 in Germany's DAX blue-chip index. It fell from grace last Thursday when auditor EY refused to sign its 2019 accounts.
Braun said Wirecard may have been a victim of fraud before he quit last Friday. The ensuing scandal has rocked Germany's financial establishment, shown regulators to have been asleep at the wheel, and sent Wirecard shares down by nearly 90% to value the business at $1.5 billion.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) cut its share-price target to 1 euro from 14 euros, saying customers may be starting to abandon Wirecard, while banks it owes 1.75 billion euros ($1.97 billion) to may be weighing the closure of credit lines.
""These developments may make the business unsustainable,"" its analysts wrote in a note. 
Payments giant Visa (N:V) said it was monitoring the situation, while Mastercard (N:MA) declined to comment. Wirecard runs real and virtual payment cards for both.
Southeast Asian ride-hailing and payments company Grab said it had put its partnership with Wirecard on hold.
The alliance, which is backed by Softbank (T:9984), was part of a broader pact in which the Japanese investor put money into Wirecard last year. A source close to Softbank said all of its group companies would probably sever ties with Wirecard.
CRISIS MANAGER
Wirecard's new CEO James Freis, a former financial investigator at the U.S. Treasury and compliance chief at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is holding crisis talks with a consortium of 15 banks led by Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
With Wirecard having failed to file audited financials, they could call in the loans at any time. 
Some creditors do not, for now, favour tipping Wirecard into insolvency. It could get a stay of execution until the end of the month, as creditors look to a July 1 deadline for extending the loan, sources familiar with the matter said.
But with the disclosure of the financial hole wiping out a decade of cash flows, it will be tough for Wirecard to survive even with a debt restructuring as underlying profitability could be weak, said Richard Sbaschnig, a forensic accountant at CFRA.Wirecard's potential break-up value is likely to be limited, Sbaschnig added, as earnings appear to have been negative in 2018 after stripping out the impact of the obscure third-party acquiring partners at the centre of the suspected fraud.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Vitamin chain GNC files for bankruptcy, may close 1,200 stores and sell itself","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -  GNC Holdings Inc  (N:GNC), the vitamin and herbal supplement retailer, has filed for bankruptcy, with plans to close at least 800 to 1,200 locations and possibly sell itself.
The 85-year-old company filed for Chapter 11 protection late Tuesday night in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware.
GNC had been trying to reduce its nearly $900 million debt load amid falling sales at its brick-and-mortar stores when the coronavirus pandemic forced thousands of locations to close temporarily, cutting off a major revenue source. About 2,100 of its 11,000 employees remain furloughed.
The Pittsburgh-based company, whose name is an acronym for General Nutrition Centers, plans a ""dual-path"" restructuring where it would either be sold as a going concern, or improve its balance sheet by shedding more than $300 million of debt.
GNC said it has agreed in principle with many lenders to sell itself to an affiliate of its largest shareholder, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co (SS:600664), for $760 million in a court-supervised auction, subject to higher bids.
It also said it has lined up $130 million in new financing, including support from Harbin and International Vitamin Corp, its largest vendor.
Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar said GNC and 16 affiliates sought court protection with a goal of ""operationally re-aligning their businesses,"" while minimizing the impact on customers, employees, landlords and vendors.
Business operations will continue, and fewer than 500 stores remain closed because of the pandemic. The company hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 in the fall.
GNC has about 7,300 locations, including 5,200 in the United States and 1,600 ""store-within-a-store"" locations in Rite Aid (N:RAD) stores. The rest are in about 50 other countries. Roughly 2,633 U.S. and Canadian stores are company-owned.
The company lost $200.1 million in the first quarter, in part because of the forced closures. It had shuttered 596 underperforming stores from January 2018 to March 2020.

The case is In re GNC Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 20-bk-11662.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tuesday it had opened an investigation into 63,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S cars after reports of media-control unit failures that led to the loss of the use of touchscreens.
The auto safety agency said the preliminary evaluation, covering 2012-2015 model year vehicles, comes after it received 11 complaints alleging premature failure of the media-control unit due to memory wear-out.
A complete unit failure results in the loss of audible and visual touchscreen features, such as infotainment, navigation, and web browsing, and loss of the rear-camera image display when in reverse gear, the agency said. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NHTSA said the failure does not affect vehicle-control systems.
Tesla used the same unit in 159,000 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles built by Tesla through early 2018. 
The memory control unit uses an  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device, NHTSA said. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flash devices have a finite lifespan based on the number of program or erase cycles, NHTSA said. 
Failures resulting from memory wear-out ""are likely to occur after periods of progressively degraded performance (e.g., longer power-up times, more frequent touchscreen resets, intermittent loss of cellular connectivity, loss of navigation),"" the agency said.
Some complaints said the failure could result in a loss of charging ability and that other safety alerts could be impacted. One driver said he could not clear fogged windows because he could not change climate controls. 
Another complaint said the failure disabled safety monitors associated with Tesla's driver-assistance system Autopilot.

The complaints said Tesla requires owners to pay to replace the unit once the warranty expires.

""Even in the (coronavirus) pandemic we are insisting on strong climate protection,"" Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said. ""Today we took a major step on the path to this goal."" The size of the package was agreed between Merkel's government and the utilities affected by the phase-out, which include RWE (DE:RWEG), Uniper (DE:UN01), EnBW (DE:EBKG), Vattenfall (VATN.UL), Steag and LEAG.
Winding down power generation from lignite, or brown coal, is expected to cost many more billions of euros, including 40 billion euros in investments in mining regions.
The lower house of parliament, where Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partner have a majority, has still to approve the package, which it will vote on in early July. 
It must then pass the upper house representing the states, and is also subject to approval by the EU Commission for compliance with state aid rules.
The coalition partners still need to agree on the final details of a separate compensation package for utilities with plants powered by imported hard coal.
These were meant to be harder hit but have successfully argued to extend a planned auction scheme and increase compensation payouts. They also want aid to switch mainly younger plants to gas use.
The government this month approved plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, plus measures to deliver on this target. In addition to the coal phase-out, these include carbon pricing for transport and buildings next year.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Council's £1 billion property bet shaken by WeWork rent waiver request,"By Gareth Gore
LONDON (IFR) - WeWork has asked to skip millions of pounds of rent payments owed to Spelthorne Borough Council, creating a major headache for the tiny local authority that has borrowed more than £1bn to bet on commercial property.
The request offers a glimpse into both the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdown on the council's finances and the struggles of WeWork as it wrestles with the same issues.
The beleaguered shared-workspace operator is one of Spelthorne council's biggest tenants, occupying three floors at 12 Hammersmith Grove, an office building in West London that the council bought two years ago from Aberdeen Standard Investments for £170m. It is one of the authority's biggest investments.
WeWork has asked the council to waive the next 18 months of rent in exchange for a five-year extension on its lease, according to documents seen by IFR. It is seeking to weather the hit to its business from the pandemic, which has led to a collapse in use of its shared office spaces.
The request would result in £4.5m of lost revenue for the council at a time when its own finances are already under strain due to the pandemic. It is facing additional costs of up to £2m linked to increased spending tackling homelessness, council tax support, burial costs and food distribution.
In a sign of the predicament facing Spelthorne, the council's property and development manager Nick Cummings has advised council leaders to accept the proposal. It is unclear whether the council has yet made a decision on the WeWork request. Spelthorne Borough Council declined to comment.
""The risk of not providing this tenant some short term assistance on returns for long term gain is potential default of the operations and vacant offices,"" Cummings wrote in one of the documents. ""In the current market the void period would be lengthy and the council would have significant void costs.""
SIGN OF STRESS
The request for a grace period on rent from WeWork is the most dramatic sign of stress in Spelthorne's commercial property empire since its first purchase in 2016. Since then, the council – one of the smallest in the UK – has bought several commercial properties, all financed through debt.
Last month, council leader Ian Harvey told IFR the council had collected 91% of rents owed to it for the March quarter and agreed to reschedule much of the rest. But since then Spelthorne ""has had to pro-actively engage with some of its tenants and discuss their cashflow issues"", according to a recent council report. 
Spelthorne is particularly exposed to sectors that have been hard hit by the pandemic. Three of its properties have principal tenants in the shared-workspace sector. Two of its office blocks are part of the complex around Heathrow Airport, which is now facing years of subdued demand.
BP (NYSE:BP), which is the council's biggest single tenant after agreeing a £385m sale-and-leaseback of its Sunbury campus with Spelthorne almost four years ago, has announced plans to cut 10,000 mainly office jobs. BP said it was still working out the process and it was unclear how Sunbury will be affected.
STREAM OF INCOME
Until now, the council's commercial property portfolio has provided a steady stream of income that has helped fund public services, boosting the council's regular sources of income from council tax and business rates and helping offset a fall in grants from central government.
The property portfolio generated £50m of rent last year, more than enough to pay the £35m it costs to service debts taken out to fund the purchases. It used £10m of the surplus to add to its general budget, on top of the £14m it gets from tax, rates and grants, and put the remainder into a rainy-day sinking fund.
""As part of our financial modelling for each property, we have put in significant provisions for a sinking fund to cover void periods,"" Harvey told IFR last month. ""That sinking fund is over and above the £10m a year that is going into support the normal services of the council.""
As the pandemic has strained Spelthorne's finances and led to a rise in rent arrears, the council has moved to tap the sinking fund. At an extraordinary meeting last month, the council approved £2.2m of the fund be used, substantially less than the £4.5m initially sought by leaders.
The strains on council finances have also opened up political fissures. Harvey was ousted as Conservative leader earlier this month amid concerns from other councillors over his property strategy and the party lost control of the council for the first time in history after some of its members formed a breakaway group.
He could also lose his role as leader of the council at a vote on Thursday.
HOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT
The sinking fund should provide the council with a cushion to get through the next couple of years. However, the impact of the pandemic on demand for office space remains to be seen. If rents fall and occupancy rates decline, the council may find it more difficult to service its £1bn of debt.
While some of its offices boast strong tenants on long leases, not all of its properties went into the crisis in the best position. The Charter Building, an office block in Uxbridge that Spelthorne bought for £136m two years ago, was just one-quarter rented out when the virus hit.
Still, the council documents seen by IFR show a hope that things could turn around. Cummings described WeWork as ""on a firm financial footing"".
""The tenant is a substantial serviced office operator which has been covered in the press in respect of a recent failed IPO,"" he wrote. ""The company is on a firm financial footing and is seeking (to) absorb difficulties brought about by the Covid crisis and position itself for long term business.""
""WeWork has confirmed that it expects its business to improve market share as a result of conventional office users increasing their utilisation of serviced office operations at the expense of conventional office space in Central London locations.""
But WeWork, which declined to comment, has burnt through billions of dollars, has never made a profit and is engaged in a legal battle with shareholders.
And not all of Spelthorne's councillors are convinced that waiving WeWork's rental payments is the right thing to do, with some voicing concern about extending assistance to a company that was already in trouble before the pandemic began, and which could take a brutal hit if current working from home habits persist.

""They are in the crapper and it's only going to get worse with Covid-19,"" said one person close to the situation, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. ""That's why it's crazy for SBC to have possibly given them a £4.5m pass.""

Symbiosis Pharmaceutical said on Wednesday it agreed to make and supply an unspecified number of units of the vaccine, AZD1222, for AstraZeneca to use in clinical trials. The companies did not provide any financial terms of the deal.
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot last month warned that the company was running out of time to effectively test the vaccine as the number of cases decline in Europe. 
Brazil last week became the first country outside of the UK to begin human testing of the vaccine AstraZeneca licensed from the University of Oxford. About 3,000 people in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have enrolled for trials.
Scotland's economic development agency, Scottish Enterprise, supported the establishment of Symbiosis Pharmaceutical in 2011 and provided it with capital. 
""It is fantastic to see the continued success of Symbiosis in Scotland, and I applaud the vital work they are undertaking,"" Scotland's Trade Minister Ivan McKee said in a statement.
AstraZeneca has doubled manufacturing and supply capacity for its potential coronavirus vaccine to over 2 billion doses with deals such as those involving Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) billionaire Bill Gates-backed firms and India's Serum Institute.
There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness caused by the new coronavirus, but about a dozen vaccines from more than 100 candidates globally are being tested in humans.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","BP's stranded Canadian, Angolan assets expose wider industry risks","By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - When  BP  (L:BP) slashed its long-term oil price outlook last week, prospects in Canada and Angola were rendered worthless, company sources and analysts said, exposing broader risks the industry faces as the world pivots to low-carbon energy. 
The $17.5 billion write-down, part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's drive to wean BP off fossil fuel, was the biggest the London-based company booked since the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. 
BP lowered its long-term oil price outlook from about $70 a barrel to $55, slashing the value of its $14.2 billion early-stage exploration portfolio by two thirds. It also wrote down $8 billion to $11 billion in the value of producing assets.
BP did not detail which assets were rendered uneconomical by the price adjustment, but company sources said they included three areas, including resources in Canadian oil sands and ultra-deepwater wells off Angola, which involve high costs.
An analysis by consultancy Rystad Energy also showed BP's exploration impairments would include mainly Canada and Angola.
A BP spokesman declined to comment.
BP holds interests in three oil sands lease areas through the Sunrise Oil Sands project with Husky Energy (TO:HSE), the Terre de Grace partnership with Value Creation and the Pike Oil Sands project with Canadian National Resources.
Canada's oil sands require complex and energy-intensive extraction processes that cause heavy carbon pollution.
""We recognise that oil sands projects raise environmental challenges and we are actively seeking ways to undertake these projects while minimising the environmental footprint,"" BP said on its website. 
BP's 2019 annual report said the Canadian oil sand exploration resource was valued at $2.5 billion, while Angola's so-called ""intangible assets"" were valued between $1 billion to $2 billion.
""BP's revision makes their oil price outlook more realistic,"" said Parul Chopra, vice president for upstream research at Rystad Energy.
""Oil sand projects in Canada have breakevens more than $45 per barrel and many ultra-deepwater projects in Angola, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have similar high breakeven prices.""
STRANDED ASSETS
BP's new forecast of $55 a barrel, an average for the benchmark Brent oil until 2050, is much lower than assumptions made by several rivals, some of whose forecasts are $70 or more, suggesting they face the risk of large impairments in future.
The lower forecast highlights the risk of stranded assets, or oil and gas resources that can not be tapped if the world wants to meet targets in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by the end of the century.
Looney's predecessor Bob Dudley had previously dismissed the idea that BP had stranded assets.
Long-term price forecasts vary across the industry. At the lower end of the scale, the International Energy Agency lists an average oil price of $59 a barrel in 2040, based on its sustainable development scenario calculated against 2018 prices.
Meanwhile, Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) booked 5.7 billion euros in upstream asset impairments, even when assuming oil would rise to $87 in 2035.
A Shell (LON:RDSa) spokeswoman said its financial outlook was based on an oil price of about $65 by 2025.
Equinor assumes a price of $80 in 2030. A spokesman for the Norwegian state-owned oil company said cutting the assumption to $50 would reduce Equinor's net present value (NPV) by 17%.
Italy's Eni lists $70 as its long-term oil price assumption, although Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said the firm still did not have stranded assets in a $50 scenario. 

""The clock must be ticking on the assumptions used at Eni and in particular Equinor,"" said Andrew Grant at think-tank Carbon Tracker, which estimates oil majors would have to cut output by 35% from 2019 to 2040 to meet Paris targets.

Investing.com --  U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Wednesday, as a rise in new coronavirus infections across most of the country revived the threat of restrictive measures to contain a disease that has never really gone away. 
California, Texas and Florida - three of the four most populous and economically important states in the country -- have all reported record numbers of infections this week.
The mood wasn't helped by a reminder from the International Monetary Fund that the problem still exists far beyond the U.S.: the Fund slashed its outlook for the world economy this year to show a 4.9% contraction, rather than the 3.0% it had forecast in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns across China, Europe and the U.S.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 288 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite - home to the 'growth' stocks that have been investors' preferred sanctuary during bouts of market negativity this year, was clearly outperforming with a loss of only 0.3%.
However, that Nasdaq rally is looking suspiciously narrow to some. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), highlighted via Twitter that the proportion of stocks in the Nasdaq trading above their 200-day moving averages is only 45%, compared to around 60% for the first half of the Trump presidency, and compared to around 80% during the earlier stages of the rally after 2009.  That implies that traders are betting increasingly on a narrow selection of heavyweight stocks such as the FAANG megacaps and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), all of which posted all-time highs on Tuesday. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all gave up between 0.5% and 1.0% in early trading, Apple being not unduly concerned by an Axios report that the Department of Justice is preparing to announce an antitrust investigation into possible abuse of the App Store (mirroring an EU investigation announced earlier this month). Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was the biggest loser among the megacaps, losing 2.6% after Unilever (NYSE:UL) unit Ben & Jerry's joined a growing list of advertizers to boycott the group's two big social networks over its hands-off approach to inflammatory political opinion.
Cyclical stocks - notably cruise lines - were harder hit, with Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) stock all falling over 9% on fears that a resurgence of the virus will push back even further the date when they can resume sailing. 
The biggest gainers in early trading included Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) stock and VMware (NYSE:VMW) stock. after The Wall Street Journal reported that founder Michael Dell is considering another reshuffle of his portfolio. The options under consideration include a partial sale of Dell's 81% stake in VMWare, as well as a complete buyout, the WSJ reported.
Elsewhere, Crude Oil futures fell 2.2% to $39.76 a barrel amid renewed Covid-19-driven fears for the demand outlook, while Gold Futures recovered earlier losses to trade down 0.1% at $1,780 a troy ounce.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Canada's financial capital, Toronto, set for muted reopening as big banks keep staff home","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto, Canada's financial capital, was set for a muted reopening on Wednesday following a three-month shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic, as several of its biggest employers said they would keep staff working from home over the summer.
Downtown Toronto streets, normally gridlocked on pre-pandemic weekdays, remained mostly free of traffic during what would have been the morning rush hour in the country's most populous city. 
Ontario, Canada's largest province by population, started gradually reopening its economy this month, but Toronto, which suffered more than 1,000 deaths, was left off the initial list.
But even with Toronto's reopening, Canada's three biggest lenders, Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY),  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD) and Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS), and second-biggest life insurer  Sun Life Financial  (TO:SLF) told Reuters they don't intend to bring staff back to offices until at least September. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM) said staff will continue to work remotely ""for an extended period of time.""
Brookfield Asset Management (TO:BAM) has reoriented desks and reduced meeting-room capacity, and plans to bring employees back gradually, a spokeswoman said. 
Even so, high-rise office buildings in Toronto stood ready for occupants' return. 
Brookfield, one of the biggest downtown landlords, has disinfected buildings, cleaned air distribution systems and water supply tanks and had them independently tested, the spokeswoman said. 
In office towers, signs instructed staff to keep their distance. Elevators sported stickers limiting riders to a few at a time.
The PATH, a 30-kilometer (18.6 miles) below-ground pedestrian walkway connecting about 75 buildings, and the world's largest underground shopping complex, also had messages urging users to stay safe.

Canadian provinces imposed the lockdowns in March to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed 8,454 people in Canada and infected 101,963, according to the latest government data.

The agreements would involve the development of new utility-scale solar installations in several counties, the lender said in a statement.
Wells Fargo did not disclose the size of its investment but said it would be able to meet the energy needs of about 1,200 properties in California and the mid-Atlantic states.
Many corporates have committed billions of dollars to fund green projects and pledged to reduce their carbon footprint, while some banks have said they would cut exposure to fossil fuel funding.
Wells Fargo has been meeting all its annual global electricity requirements with renewable energy since 2017 and is now working to set up longer-term contracts and increase power generation from on-site renewable sources.

The German government could still get a 20% stake, as originally envisaged. But under the new plan this would happen in two steps, without the need for shareholders' approval, the source said.
Germany's flagship airline has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and what promises to be a protracted travel slump, and has sought a state rescue to avoid insolvency.
Billionaire investor Heinz Hermann Thiele has objected to bailout terms, proposing an indirect government holding in Lufthansa via Germany's KfW development bank instead of a direct stake and board representation.
Thiele, who recently increased his stake in Lufthansa to 15.5%, is expected to have a virtual veto at Thursday's extraordinary general meeting - which is being held remotely due to the pandemic. 
Lufthansa expects holders of less than 50% of the stock to vote, in which case a two thirds majority would be needed for the bailout to pass. CEO Carsten Spohr said on Sunday shareholders representing only 38% of shares had registered for the EGM. 
Under ""Plan B"", Germany could initially get a roughly 10% stake in Lufthansa from a share issue without subscription rights at 2.56 euros per share, the source said.
The remaining stake would come from a regular capital increase in which all Lufthansa shareholders could participate, said the person, who is familiar with the plans.

The source cautioned the plans had not been approved by the government. Germany's finance and economy ministries declined to comment.

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",JPMorgan’s Michele Shuns Treasuries Turned ‘Zombies’ in QE Era,"(Bloomberg) -- Bob Michele bet on U.S. yields sinking to zero last year, and reaped the rewards of a historic rally. Now, he says the gains are looking exhausted.
The chief investment officer and head of global fixed income at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management has slashed the firm’s holdings of U.S. government bonds to the smallest since September 2018. He expects stagnant returns for the safest government bonds as global economies recover from coronavirus-induced recessions, and has pivoted into securities like corporate bonds and emerging markets debt pegged to growth.
Central bankers in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia are turning government debt into “zombie” bonds -- depriving them of the yield and volatility that makes them alluring to traders, Michele contends.
“We are going to be stuck with low yields for a long period of time,” Michele said in an interview. “Central banks are going to just control the level of yields in those markets and there are other things to us that look more attractive where we still get high quality and protection on the downside.”
The Federal Reserve and other central banks have pledged trillions in quantitative easing program to underpin economies hit by the pandemic. It’s possible that yields could fall further, Michele said. A spike in infections, election risk or even another rate cut would spark a flight to quality back to government bonds.
JPMorgan Fund That Sold Junk Debt Before Crash Is Diving Back In
The writing was on the wall for Michele in July 2019. While he didn’t warn a pandemic would bring global economies to a screeching halt, he did expect central banks to “cut rates as far as they can and expand balance sheets” to stave off a downturn.
Bob Michele Warns the 10-Year Treasury Yield Is ‘Headed to Zero’
Though the firm’s absolute holdings of Treasuries are the lowest in two years, duration, or exposure to rate risk though long-dated debt, is little changed.
“We are still holding roughly the same duration because we still expect yields to continue to come down,” Michele said. “Although we expect this recovery to continue and policy makers to ensure that it does, when you go back and look at the previous crises, there were fits and starts along the way.”
JPMorgan Asset now sees an 80% probability of above-trend global growth in the third quarter, compared with zero in the previous three months. The firm has also revised down a chance of a recession to 10% from 55%.
Growth Optimism
His optimistic view on the economy is one reason Michele favors securitized credit -- a choice he said surprised some of the company’s clients because it’s tied to consumer loans.
“Although the unemployment data looks horrific now, because of the policy response there’s enough cash coming to those collecting unemployment insurance that they are able to make payments on all the borrowing they have, and by and large they are doing it,” said Michele. “That’s been a pleasant surprise to us.”
Renewed trade tension between the U.S. and China poses the biggest threat to growth, overshadowing the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 and the U.S. election, he said.
“Elections come and go. They can be disruptive and create some political headwinds, but the market learns to reprice and adjust,” Michele said. “The world’s two biggest economies entering a feared cold war and the knock-on effects on the global economy is a long-term risk I am most concerned about.”

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",New-look U.S. bank 'stress tests' may leave analysts guessing,"By David Henry and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank analysts have cleared their diaries on Thursday ahead of a long evening poring over results of the Federal Reserve's bank health checks, which have been upended this year by the coronavirus pandemic.
Since 2009, toward the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. central bank has tested a snapshot of big bank balance sheets against an extreme hypothetical economic shock to assess their risk of losses, capital strength and capital requirements. 
This year, analysts, investors and bankers are flying blind after the economic crisis triggered by the outbreak of novel coronavirus coincided with a new regulatory tweak to rip up the Fed's ""stress test"" playbook.
""Inevitably, there will be some surprises in the results,"" said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, adding that the tests were ""a major event"" due to the changes. 
The uncertainty has been reflected in unusual volatility in options on bank securities in the last three months, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research published on June 15. 
The Fed will release results of the test, which was devised before the pandemic, on Thursday after markets close. The Fed is expected to provide guidance on how banks would fare if the current economic slump worsens. 
But it will hold back information on each bank's capital requirements, and lenders will not be able to announce their plans for capital distributions, such as dividends, until Monday evening.
This year, the Fed will not outrightly ""pass"" or ""fail"" banks, making the results even more ambiguous for analysts and investors trying to calculate where each bank stands. 
One item analysts say they will focus on is the impact of a new ""stress capital buffer"" the Fed introduced to better align lenders' capital requirements with their risk profiles. 
The big unknown is how much that new buffer raises each banks' overall capital requirement: the closer that requirement gets to the bank's actual capital level, the greater the chance it must cut distributions. Dividend limits are calculated as a percentage of the past four quarters of income, which has been declining due to pandemic-related loan losses.
The Fed will not release final buffer data for several weeks, but analysts believe they can figure it out Thursday night using a formula in the new buffer rule, and other data the Fed will provide on how badly the tests dented banks' overall cushion.
For now, analysts expect most banks to be okay because of the strong buffers that were built up over the past decade, but it remains unclear how badly losses on loans to struggling consumers and companies could alter that calculation in coming months. 

""Bank specific results will not be disclosed, so estimating capital plans will be challenged,"" Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Friday. ""Dividend cuts can still not be ruled out.""

1082,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Europe’s Slaughterhouses Are Back in the Pandemic Spotlight,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest flurry of coronavirus cases across European meat plants has confirmed their status as pandemic hotspots and is now starting to disrupt shipments to key customer China.
More than 1,550 employees of a German slaughterhouse have tested positive for the virus this month, and at least eight plants in the U.K. have also found infections among workers. That adds to hundreds of Covid-19 cases reported earlier this year and poses a fresh challenge for the region’s governments, which are reopening their economies after months of lockdowns.
The European Union is a heavyweight in global meat markets, ranking as the world’s top pork exporter and the largest purveyor to China. Europe’s role has gained greater prominence in recent years amid stronger demand from the Asian nation and increasing trade tensions between China and the U.S.
Here are five key points to watch:
1) How are meat plants around the world being affected?
Staff outbreaks have temporarily shuttered or slowed dozens of plants in the Americas, with more halted from Australia to the U.K. Slaughterhouse staff often work in close proximity in cold environments, potentially boosting the chance of transmission. The mass closures in the U.S. spurred some retailers to ration meat sales and burger chains reported temporary shortages. Farmers were also forced to cull thousands of livestock as there wasn’t space to sell them.
2) What’s different in Europe?
Europe’s meat plants tend to be smaller than their U.S. counterparts. There’s also spare processing capacity, allowing some flexibility to process animals or add shifts at alternate sites. But the risks facing workers are similar worldwide. Germany’s latest outbreak is massive and pushed the national infection rate well above government targets. Schools and child-care centers in the region were closed, and the army was summoned to help with testing.
The industry relies partly on contract workers from eastern Europe, who may also commute together and share housing. That’s helped companies circumvent stricter rules on working conditions, according to Germany’s labor minister, who said he’d like to speed up new rules aimed at cracking down on the practices.
3) Is there any impact on European consumers?
Unlike the U.S., Europe hasn’t seen widespread meat shortages, and farm-gate livestock prices retreated as shuttered restaurants and canceled festivals depressed consumption. The European Commission proposed a private-storage program in April to prop up beef and dairy markets. Retail sales for products like mince meat climbed as citizens stayed home, but fancier fare piled up in freezers.
4) Are companies changing practices?
In Germany, the government signaled that meatpackers must stop subcontracting workers and will face stiffer fines for violating labor laws from next year. A few companies have since pledged to begin hiring workers directly and improve housing standards. Producers in Europe are also introducing measures to ensure distancing during staff commutes, while improving protective gear for employees.
The British Poultry Council said it’s unfair to portray meat-processing sites as virus epicenters, adding that businesses are limited in what they control outside the workplace. The trade association said its members have staggered shifts and added perspex screens to safeguard the health of their workers, but added that the availability of personal protective equipment remains a concern.
5) How are trade flows being disrupted?
A German abattoir recently stopped exports to China, and a U.K. pork plant also voluntarily halted sales after a few workers contracted the virus. That comes as the Asian nation -- the world’s top consumer -- has grown wary that imports may be a cause of domestic outbreaks. All China’s testing of foreign meat has proven negative and officials agreed with global experts that food was an unlikely culprit. Still, the recent stoppages raise the prospect of further disruptions ahead.

1083,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Bank Dividends in Peril With Crisis Veterans Warning of Trouble,"(Bloomberg) -- A long-running clash over the ability of Wall Street banks to weather hard times and still pay shareholder dividends is gaining urgency as the number of Covid-19 cases ticks up and economic data remain gloomy.
Critics, including a number of government and Federal Reserve veterans of the 2008 financial crisis, say they’d rather see the banks marshal resources for a rocky road ahead than continue paying shareholders.
On Thursday, the central bank will announce results of its annual stress tests, which for the first time will include a “sensitivity analysis” to gauge how well banks can navigate an economy shattered by a global pandemic. While the Fed will release evaluations for individual institutions, the outcome of the sensitivity exam will have a single score for all the banks in the test.
The findings could feed a growing clamor for the biggest banks to suspend or cut dividend payments after they temporarily quit share buybacks for this quarter. Sheila Bair, who led the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. during the last crisis, said the Fed shouldn’t need stress tests to put a stop to dividends.
“It troubles me that the Fed seems to be struggling to make a judgment independent from what the big banks want,” Bair said in an interview. “We don’t know how bad it will get. It’s common sense and prudence to ask banks to retain capital.”
Net Incomes
During the months-long coronavirus lockdown, the biggest U.S. banks stuck to their intention to continue dividends. For the first three months of 2020, the four biggest U.S. commercial banks -- Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. -- all paid them, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo paying out more than their net incomes.
From the start of 2017 through March, the four banks cumulatively returned about $1.26 to shareholders for every $1 they reported in net income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup returned almost twice as much money to its stockholders as it earned, according to the data, which includes dividends on preferred shares. The banks declined to comment.
Fed watchers, including Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ben Elliott, say it’s unlikely the central bank will mandate a broad-based cut or suspension of dividend payments this week. The Fed declined to comment.
‘No-Brainer’
“The Fed has been great in all other respects,” Jeremy Stein, chairman of the Harvard University economics department and a Fed governor from 2012 to 2014, said in an interview, referring to the central bank’s bailout programs. “But here, on bank regulation, they’re behind.” Stopping dividends is “a no-brainer.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who as a Treasury Department official in 2008 helped design the Troubled Asset Relief Program, called on the banks to raise capital rather than spend it on payments to shareholders. In a Financial Times op-ed in April, Kashkari said that would be “the most patriotic thing.” And in an interview, Donald Kohn, who was the Fed’s vice chair under Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis, said it’s important to “make sure the banks have enough capital to survive a prolonged downturn in the economy.”
Read more: Banks’ Dividend Outlook Gets Murky With Fed’s Stress Test Twist
Recent data foretell months of hardship. This week, 31 states reported mounting cases of Covid-19, compared with 21 last month. More than 37 million Americans are struggling with hunger, a number that’s expected to climb to 54 million, including 18 million children, by the end of the year, according to advocacy group Feeding America.
About 20.5 million Americans filed continuing claims for jobless benefits in the first week of June, according to the Labor Department, and extended benefits -- the extra $600 a week the government is paying people who recently lost their jobs -- are set to expire July 31. Home-loan delinquencies increased to the highest since 2011, and weekly corporate bankruptcies soared to the most since 2009.
The strength of the recovery is going to depend on banks’ willingness to lend, and one lesson policy makers took from the 2008 financial crisis is that banks with high capital levels tend to extend more credit to households and businesses, said Thomas Hoenig, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City during the financial crisis and is now at George Mason University.
Making Rules
Fed bank presidents and former regulators have little actual pull beyond their bully pulpits. As the Fed’s vice chairman for supervision, Randal Quarles can help make rules.
In a presentation Friday, Quarles described the process that brought the financial industry to this point. After the 2008 meltdown, he said, Congress and the regulators established a system for making sure banks remained solvent -- and can even keep issuing dividends -- during another crisis.
The crisis has arrived, and the Fed board decided to let its stress-test process go forward instead of insisting that banks hold off on dividends for a while. That said, Quarles promised that the Fed’s special Covid-19 analysis will influence what the agency directs banks to do with their capital plans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has agreed with Quarles on this strategy.
In a reminder of how quickly losses can mount in a deteriorating economy, U.S. banks entered April with an almost spotless loan book. A growing economy and tougher lending standards had combined to produce years of falling delinquency rates. At the end of March, just 1.59% of the industry’s loans were at least 30 days late, according to FDIC data, a far cry from the record 7.39% in 2010, as the last crisis reverberated.
But banks can see dark clouds forming, so last quarter they added to the amount of money they set aside to cover delinquencies and defaults. It’s now about half the industry’s peak level of 10 years ago.
Investors have battered bank stocks this year and may not be sympathetic to suspending dividends, though James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that he thought markets have probably already priced in dividend reductions.
“Banks’ ability to raise the capital needed to provide credit to businesses and households will be permanently reduced if investors learned that bank dividends would always be cut in bad times, irrespective of each bank’s current capitalization and future prospects,” said Greg Baer, chief executive officer of the industry group Bank Policy Institute.
Stephen Schwarzman is among those who see less reason to worry about the economic future.  The Blackstone Group  (NYSE:BX) Inc. CEO said Monday he expects a so-called V-shaped recovery -- quick and dramatic -- due in part to the government’s stimulus programs.
After years of regulators directing them to build up capital, the biggest U.S. banks came into the coronavirus crisis on far sounder footing than they had in 2008, when a credit crunch froze lending around the world, and far better than their counterparts in Europe, where dividends have been suspended.
Huge Cost
“We’ve done the math and even under pretty negative scenarios, banks have enough capital to pay the dividends,” said Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo. “The Fed can always change its mind in two quarters. There’s a huge cost of not waiting. It will send a negative signal to the market that could potentially lead to a negative feedback loop.”
But Paul Tucker, a former Bank of England deputy governor who now chairs the think tank Systemic Risk Council, dismissed that argument. The Fed already is propping up markets, he said, and allowing the biggest banks to continue paying dividends is a mistake that could haunt the central bank if the economy doesn’t come roaring back.
“Is it a plausible proposition that talk in about five years’ time will be, ‘If only they had allowed banks to pay dividends, we would have gotten through these times so much better?’” Tucker said of the Fed. “I don’t think so.”

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",CVS to offer employers COVID-19 testing program as U.S. cases rise,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. employers grapple with trying to keep workers healthy and on the job amid fresh spikes in COVID-19 cases, CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) has begun selling companies a diagnostic testing program. 
In addition to onsite and pharmacy testing, CVS also will create plans for temperature and symptom checks, seasonal flu vaccines and other immunizations and offer add-on services like contact tracing technology for employees and other services. 
The unexpected surge in COVID-19 cases in states in the South and West has increased demand in recent weeks for testing workers on a regular basis, such as every two weeks or every month, said Troy Brennan, chief medical officer of the company, which operates pharmacies, a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service and the Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance plan. 
""The general perception is that there is not going to be a sustained lull over the course of the summer, and in fact it looks like it is building somewhat, and that is changing people's views,"" Brennan said.
States including Florida, Arizona, and Texas, as well as Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah have all reported an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks.
The United States has had more than 2.3 million cases and over 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, about a quarter of the world's total.
States hard hit early in the pandemic, such as New York and New Jersey, have experienced dramatic declines in cases. But many states that reopened before achieving safety metrics or are not requiring mask wearing are seeing record increases. Overall U.S. cases rose 25% last week with 10 states reporting a greater than 50% rise in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis.
Other companies such as Labcorp Holdings (N:LH) and Quest Diagnostics Inc (N:DGX) have also created testing services for corporations. Quest is working with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
CVS, however, is one of the nation's largest healthcare companies. Between its PBM services and insurance business, CVS serves some of the largest U.S. companies with hundreds of thousands of employees.
The new service, dubbed Return Ready, is open to all companies, not just current customers.
CVS declined to provide details about companies that have already signed up, but said they are in discussions with media companies, financials services, sports leagues and the public sector.
ANTIBODY TESTING NOT INCLUDED 
Return Ready is aimed at large employers or smaller ones who self-insure, meaning they pay for employee healthcare costs rather than insurers - and instead pay CVS to manage the tests and other services. 
CVS declined to provide pricing for the program. Diagnostic tests can cost more than $100 each.
While the U.S. government has required health insurers to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing, that coverage is largely restricted to ""medically necessary"" testing for those with symptoms and does not cover these back-to-work programs.
CVS is not offering tests that detect coronavirus antibodies to show prior infection.
Earlier this year, antibody tests were seen as key to getting the United States back to work, while in Europe some countries have considered related ""immunity passports."" But it is not yet known whether the presence of those antibodies confers some level of immunity against future infection or how long any immunity might last. 
Healthcare consulting firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) does not advise employers to use antibody tests because of the uncertainty about what they indicate, health management practice leader Jeff Levin-Scherz said in a recent interview. 
Even regular diagnostic testing offers no guarantees. If everyone is tested and the tests are completely accurate, workers can still become infected a day after they test negative, he said.

""You still couldn't assume that your workplace is a bubble and no COVID would come in,"" Levin-Scherz said.

LONDON (Reuters) - When the UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, rushing into the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 stocks index for a currency hedge and international exposure made sense for investors alarmed by a falling pound and dire economic forecasts.
Little did they know that the lightly regulated, UK-focused Alternative Investment Market (AIM) would prove to be a much better investment in the following four years, with a 34% gain.
London's AIM had a ""wild west"" tag: a home for young, innovative companies making their stock market debut. It offered both success stories and disappointing investments.
AIM, which was launched in 1995, was seen as the ultimate hunting ground for savvy, risk-taking stock pickers. Its constituents were prone to wilder moves than within its midcap peer, the FTSE 250 index, or the blue-chip FTSE 100.
But since the 2016 Brexit referendum and more recently with the coronavirus pandemic, it has consistently outperformed its bigger rivals.
GRAPHIC: FTSE AIM comfortably beats larger peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/yxmpjlkgapr/Pasted%20image%201592932700146.png 
The outperformance was largely down to a few stocks, such as online fashion retailer  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) and premium tonic water maker tonic maker Fevertree (L:FEVR). Both of them have risen multi-fold since the Brexit vote in 2016.
""There has been a number of stocks which have been terrifically successful,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould, comparing it to the FTSE 100. ""Over the four years, there has been a handful of stocks which have provided growth that you couldn't find anywhere else.""
The top five companies make up a fifth of the AIM index.

In further evidence of AIM's success, data compiled by investment platform Willis Owen shows that a number of funds focused on the index beat their peers.
Over the four years since the British people voted to leave the bloc, the TM Cavendish AIM TR fund, for instance, returned 91.9%, data compiled by Willis Owen showed.
""In fact, of the top 10 best-performing UK funds since the 2016 referendum, eight of them specifically invest in smaller firms"", many of them listed on AIM. 
""Many predicted that small UK companies would be the biggest victims of Brexit as their success is often linked to health of the overall economy"", said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen.
One reason for their success might lie in their ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. For instance, shares of Boohoo, which owns the Nasty Gal and prettylittlething brands, have risen 15-fold since June 2016.
""In our experience, smaller companies are often self-helpers and innovators; they don’t wait around for the rules to change"", Lowcock said.

1088,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Lower Amid Virus Flareups,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Wednesday, consolidating after recent strong gains while investors fret about the potential for a second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 19 points, or 0.6%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 33 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 197 points, or 0.8%. 
Wall Street has powered higher since the lows in March, helped by extraordinary levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, and by signs of recovery as the economy reopens.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has led the way, gaining for the last eight sessions to post a record high. It's on course for its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 1999, the height of the dot-com bubble.
The other senior indices are also posting gains. The DJIA is set for its best quarter since the first quarter of 1998 and the S&P 500 its best since the first quarter of 1975.
That's happening even though the U.S. has now confirmed more than 2.3 million Covid-19 cases and over 121,000 related deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, while several U.S. states are seeing record numbers of infections. Covid cases are growing by 5% or more in 26 of the 50 states.
The latest rise in new infections may prompt EU nations to close their borders to U.S. travelers as they seek to reopen their economies to tourism, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing unnamed European officials.
Adding to Wednesday’s worries, the United States is considering tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany, Bloomberg news reported, citing a notice published by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. This could prompt a tit-for-tat trade war, subduing economic growth.
Economic data releases are thin on the ground in the U.S. Wednesday, but signs of recovery continued in Europe as German business morale surged in June, posting the biggest rise since records started after reunification in 1990.
The International Monetary Fund will later update its forecasts for the global economy in an update of its World Economic Outlook.
In corporate news, tech giants will remain in focus, with the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) hitting fresh highs as home-bound consumers have turned to the internet and streaming services to keep busy during lockdowns.
Oil turned lower Wednesday, with investors worrying about a second consecutive week of increases in the crude oil supply.
The American Petroleum Institute estimated a large build of 1.749 million barrels for the week ended June 19 late Tuesday, much bigger than expected. Attention now turns to the government figures due at 8:30 AM ET, where a small build is expected.
By 2:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $39.59 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.7% to $41.92.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,792.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1305, flat on the day.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indigo Partners' JetSMART met Brazil officials in March to set up domestic flights,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Indigo Partners-backed JetSMART presented Brazil's air travel regulator, ANAC, on March 10 with a plan to enter the domestic market and disrupt the three established players there, ANAC told Reuters.
JetSMART already offers low-cost flights in Chile and Argentina and its private-equity backing has positioned it as the rare carrier able to make an investment during the coronavirus pandemic.
JetSMART told Reuters it is still eyeing an expansion in Brazil despite the collapse in passenger traffic triggered by the pandemic.
""Even though the pandemic has substantially reduced demand, we are still analyzing new operations in the region, although we are following the shape and speed of the market recovery in Brazil and other countries,"" JetSMART CEO Estuardo Ortiz said in a statement.
JetSMART and ANAC spoke in response to queries from Reuters, which had initially heard about the meeting from an industry source familiar with the situation.
The move would be an additional headache for Brazil's three established airlines: Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) and  Azul SA  (N:AZUL), which have been heavily affected by the coronavirus.
But JetSMART's entry would also be a coup for Brazil's government which has been trying to lure low-cost airlines into South America's largest air market, with little success so far.
Brazil's airlines are in weak shape.
LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection last month, while Gol's accountants are pushing to add a so-called going concern warning, a sign of doubt as to whether the airline will be alive a year from now. Azul has hired restructuring lawyers although it is so far renegotiating its debt without a bankruptcy filing.
LATAM and Azul announced a code-share agreement last week, allowing them to sell certain domestic tickets jointly.
At the meeting in March, JetSMART said it was interested in starting domestic operations ""soon,"" ANAC said, although it did not provide Reuters with a more detailed timeline.
""We believe (JetSMART) is still interested,"" ANAC told Reuters.
Indigo Partners, which also owns Frontier and Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), has been making bullish bets despite the crisis. It made an unsuccessful bid to buy Virgin Australia out of bankruptcy and maintains an order finalized with Airbus in late 2017 to buy more than 400 planes.

1091,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Premier Foods at 6-Year High as Turnaround Bears Fruit (and Cake),"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Feeling depressed about the second wave of Covid-19 coming down the road? Here, have a Bakewell tart from Mr Kipling. It looks like everyone else in Britain is, after all.
Premier Foods, the company behind a collection of brands that are household names in the U.K. but largely anonymous outside it, is looking forward to better times after swinging to a pretax profit of 54 million pounds ($67 million) from a loss of 43 million pounds a year earlier. 
The company said it expects revenue and profit for the year through March 2021 to come in above its expectations, after revenue in its fiscal first quarter rose some 20% thanks to stockpiling during the first phase of the pandemic.
The group, which had threatened to buckle under the weight of its pension liabilities until a restructuring last year, said it “continues to see elevated levels of demand for its Grocery brands during the COVID-19 pandemic” and is already thinking about what to do with the extra money.
It didn’t drop any clear hints about raising shareholder payouts, but did say it was working on a new international strategy “with the objective of delivering sustainable profitable growth.”
Premier Foods shares rose 6.6% to their highest in six years on the update. They’ve more than tripled from their March low and, at barely seven times fiscal 2020 earnings, look better value than most ‘value’ stocks given the comparative reliability of its cash flows, which now look more capable of sustaining the group’s debt. Net debt fell to 2.7 times EBITDA in the past 12 months, below the company’s internal target multiple of 3x. By contrast, the FTSE 250 index fell 1.9% and the STOXX 600 fell 1.8% on fears that the coronavirus is spiralling out of control again in much of the U.S.
Not everyone may be excited by the prospect of the company spending money on growing abroad, however. The improvement in Premier’s finances appears in large measure to be the result of concentrating on traditional strengths. International sales have dwindled to less than 5% of group revenues as of last year. The end of the post-Brexit transition period in December should logically strengthen its position in the U.K. at the expense of European rivals and, by the same logic, make expansion in Europe harder. Whether escaping the EU’s regulatory framework makes expansion outside that market any easier is still anybody’s guess.
In short, a solid, low-risk bet on U.K. consumption may become a higher-risk bet on pursuit of a bigger pie. Even so, management, which has delivered 11 straight quarters of growth in the U.K., can expect to be given the benefit of the doubt for now."
1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Italy approves guarantees for $7.1 billion loan to Fiat Chrysler: source,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy has approved a decree offering state guarantees for a 6.3-billion euro ($7.1 billion) loan to  Fiat  Chrysler's (FCA) (MI:FCHA) Italian unit, a source said, paving the way for the largest crisis loan to a European carmaker.
The source said Italy's audit court had signed off on the decree, in a final step of what had been a lengthy and contested process to get the loan approved. The court's approval follows an earlier endorsement by the economy ministry. 
""The audit court authorized the decree,"" said a source close to the matter, asking not to be named because of its sensitivity.
FCA's Italian division has tapped Rome's COVID-19 emergency financing schemes to secure a state-backed, three-year facility to help the group's operations in the country, as well as Italy's car sector in which about 10,000 businesses operate, weather the crisis triggered by the coronavirus emergency.
The loan will be disbursed by Italy's biggest retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), which has already authorised it pending the approval of guarantees the government will provide on 80% of the sum through export credit agency SACE.
The request for state support has sparked controversy because FCA is working to merge with French rival PSA (PA:PEUP) and the holding for the Italian-American carmaker is registered in the Netherlands. FCA's global brands include Fiat, Jeep, Dodge and Maserati.
It was not immediately clear what conditions, if any, Italy has set as part of the guarantees and whether they would affect FCA's planned 5.5 billion euro extraordinary dividend, which is a key element in the merger with PSA.

FCA, whose shares were down 0.5% by 0908 GMT, had no immediate comment.

Nearly three quarters of respondents said they’re worried about the November election, a greater percentage than those fretting about a second wave of the coronavirus or layoffs, or even a slower-than-expected economic recovery, RBC strategists led by Lori Calvasina wrote in a report June 24. The question, “what keeps you up at night?” saw the 2020 election as the most common answer.
While those questions didn’t specify the exact source of angst,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts recently flagged the potential for earnings-depressing tax hikes should Democrats do well in November. The RBC survey showed rising concerns about President Donald Trump going down to challenger Joe Biden.
“Our survey picked up an important shift in how U.S. equity investors are thinking about a Biden victory,” Calvasina said. “Biden bears surged in our June poll, rising for the second survey in a row. 60% now see Biden as a bearish or very bearish outcome for the stock market, up from 24% in our December 2019 poll.”
Some 65% in the survey saw Trump’s re-election as bullish or very bullish for stocks.
However, policy experts at the Scowcroft Group have said investor concerns about a potential Biden presidency are misplaced, and suggested that a second Trump term might not be entirely bullish for the market. Previous predictions of stock-market gloom from presidential elections often haven’t panned out well for strategists anyway.

NatWest Markets Plc global strategy desk chief James McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said in a note June 22 that concern among investors about a new wave of viral infections might soon shift to what the “worrying Covid-19 trends” might mean for the presidential election.
“This looks like a big risk for U.S. asset markets and the dollar as we head into summer,” he said.
The RBC survey was conducted June 15-22 and based on the input from 107 institutional investors, primarily U.S.-focused portfolio managers.
Some 56% of respondents said stock valuations were high or very high. As for the dollar, 47% expect it to weaken over the next six to 12 months, versus 17% who see it strengthening.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Gold shines as coronavirus surge unnerves investors,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices surged to their highest in nearly eight years on Wednesday, while global shares cooled as signs of an acceleration in coronavirus cases kept investors on edge.
Fuelling concerns about sustained weakness in the pace of the economic recovery was data showing several U.S. states seeing record infections and the death toll in Latin America passing 100,000, according to a Reuters tally.
The European Union is even prepared to bar U.S. travellers because of the surge of cases in the country, putting it in the same category as Brazil and Russia, the New York Times reported.
All that and softness in the dollar, along with endless cheap liquidity from central banks, helped spot gold gain 0.2% to $1,770.92 per ounce after touching $1,773, its highest level since October 2012 in early Asian trade. 
Global stocks were 0.3% lower and have been moving sideways in recent weeks after rising more than 40% from March lows on hopes the worst of the pandemic was over.
European shares were 1% lower.
There was some good news in markets, with emerging market stocks climbing to a 3-1/2 month high. They were up 0.5% on the day, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.5% to reach its highest since pandemic lockdowns first cratered markets in early March.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 reversed early losses to gain 0.1%.
""Global equity market futures are struggling to make gains today, likely for no other reason than with rising daily Covid-19 cases in the US remaining front-page news, the headlines are proving to be a weighty burden to bear this morning,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp. ""The trough in global growth is indeed behind us, but the recovery trajectory in H2 remains uncertain.""
Against a backdrop of concerns over a weaker U.S. dollar and that a jump in infections will lead to more stimulus measures, gold should remain on a reasonably constructive path, he said.
The euro, headed for its best month against the dollar since October, inched higher to $1.1303.
The dollar was just a touch negative against a basket of currencies, just above a one-week low hit Tuesday. 
""The dollar and risk sentiment are likely to remain broadly negatively correlated, barring the U.S. displaying clear and enduring leadership in the global economic recovery, something hard to square with the grim U.S. news on COVID,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
The New Zealand dollar eased after the country's central bank said it might have to do yet more to stimulate the economy, including cutting rates further, expanding bond purchases or even buying foreign assets.
Euro zone bond yields were broadly steady, with a focus on Austria which is expected to sell a new 100-year bond that will raise 2 billion euros, one of the longest-dated bond sales since the coronavirus crisis. 
Germany will also visit the primary market with the first reopening of a 15-year bond which is expected to raise 2.5 billion euros. 
Oil futures were mixed as worries about oversupply in the market, stoked by a rise in U.S. crude inventories, were offset by a drop in gasoline stocks.

Brent crude was up 0.3% at $42.75 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 1 cents to $40.34 a barrel, paring some earlier losses.

Many U.S. states have reported record daily increases in COVID-19 infections in recent weeks. A media report that European Union countries are prepared to bar entry to Americans also raised worries of further restrictions that could derail an economic recovery.

German real estate company Leg Immobilien (DE:LEGn) fell 3.2% after plans to launch a capital increase through stock and debt offering.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Wednesday, with investors fretting about the increasing number of coronavirus cases worldwide amid fears this will lead to the reintroduction of generalized lockdown measures.
At 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.6%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.7%.
Stocks in Europe have rallied hard since hitting a low in March, with gains driven by fiscal and central bank stimulus around the globe and a gradual easing of restrictions.  The U.K. announced a major relaxation of restrictions on its crucial service sector on Tuesday.
However, fears are mounting that the removal of these restrictions may have come too quickly and a second wave of the Covid-19 virus is on its way. 
German Health Minister Jens Spahn on Wednesday stressed that the coronavirus remains a risk after the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Tuesday put two municipalities back into lockdown following an outbreak at a meatpacking plant.
Still, there remains some optimism about the economic recovery, particularly after Tuesday’s upbeat business surveys, with France a stand-out as lockdown loosening there led to a modest return to growth.
“To some extent, this is obviously a technical rebound. The fact that PMIs are still in contractionary territory illustrates the two messages: a sense of relief that a sharp rebound is possible but at the same time caution against too much optimism,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The key economic indicator due for release Wednesday will be the influential German Ifo Business Climate survey for June, at 4:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), which is seen recovering. 
The French index for business confidence surged 18 points to 78, earlier Wednesday, the sharpest increase on record, statistics agency Insee said.

Atos (PA:ATOS) stock climbed 0.8% after the French information-technology company confirmed its goals for 2020, while maintaining its dividend.
Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock climbed 0.5% after the Finnish telecom equipment maker announced its new chief executive Pekka Lundmark will join the company on August 1, a month earlier than planned.
Oil edged higher Wednesday, consolidating after losses caused by a second consecutive week of increases in U.S. crude supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute estimated a build of 1.749 million barrels for the week ended June 19 on Tuesday, much bigger than the 300,000 barrel build expected. Attention now turns to the government figures due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), where a small build is expected.

1099,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>","Four Years After the Referendum, Brexit Still Haunts U.K. Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- U.K. equities have underperformed every year since the 2016 referendum, and have been a consensus underweight among money managers. Just as the long-shunned market was starting to recover from years of political instability and uncertainty over ties with the European Union, the coronavirus pandemic has left the country facing its worst recession in 300 years.
As the lockdown gradually eases, with English pubs, restaurants and cinemas set to reopen in July, clarity on negotiations with the EU before the end of the transition agreement in December may revive investor interest in a market that’s trading near historically cheap levels.
The FTSE 100 Index has lagged behind major indexes over the past four years, and in local currency terms is trading near levels it was at just before the vote four years ago. In dollar terms, its underperformance is even more striking, with a nearly 20% drop.
A tentative market recovery following Boris Johnson’s decisive electoral victory has been hampered by the lockdowns in the country that’s among the worst hit by Covid-19. A collapse in oil prices has also dragged on the megacap FTSE 100, given the almost 12% weight of energy stocks in the index.
Years of underperformance have pushed U.K. stocks’ discount to global equities to an extreme, one of the reasons the U.K. is the most preferred equity market in UBS Wealth Management’s asset allocation. The manager sees an improvement in earnings revisions on the back of higher oil prices, while noting the recent underperformance.
“The U.K. market should benefit from a rotation out of defensive growth stocks into value names, given its large exposure to value sectors such as basic materials, energy, and banks, which account for a combined 40% of the FTSE 100,” UBS WM strategist Claudia Panseri wrote in a note last week.
The exposure could be a double-edged sword. While the U.K. is traditionally seen as a high-dividend market, the pandemic’s impact has resulted in heavyweights including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc cutting payouts.
British equities were downgraded to underweight last week by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists, who said the market’s dividend base remained highly concentrated, with over a quarter of the payouts coming from the “at-risk” energy sector.
The U.K. remains the most unloved region for fund managers, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s June fund manager survey, which showed a net 29% as underweight. That said, allocation to U.K. equities increased by 4 percentage points this month, the survey showed, while staying well below the long-term average.
Positioning on the U.K. market could also largely depend on sterling moves, which are likely to be driven by the Brexit outcome. Rising risks of no deal could add pressure on the currency. And while the FTSE 100 has long moved in opposition to the pound, the two asset classes are currently experiencing their longest period of positive correlation since 2014.
The base case for  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists is that the EU and the U.K. will strike a “thin” free trade agreement by the end of the year.
The deadline for an extension request is at the end of June, and the government already stated it will not ask for another delay. That leaves until Nov. 26 to reach an agreement with the EU in a manner that will leave enough time to ratify a deal before the end of the transition period on Dec. 30.
While the EU is leading the fiscal stimulus effort, the U.K. has also been active and more could be on the cards, especially after investors expressed concerns over the Bank of England’s slowdown in asset purchases. Signs of economic recovery have also materialized after manufacturing and services data on Tuesday beat expectations, and the Citi Economic Surprise Index bounced.

1100,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>","Only Nasdaq at a Record Is Bad Sign for U.S. Stocks, BTIG Says","(Bloomberg) -- A combination of fresh highs for tech stocks and still-elevated volatility may signal trouble ahead for the S&P 500 Index, according to BTIG LLC.
The Nasdaq -100 reached a record on Tuesday, but its fellow American indexes S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 have failed to hit their own new marks, chief equity and derivatives strategist Julian Emanuel noted in a June 23 report. That signals the S&P 500 could fall to the lower end of its recent trading range in the near term, he said.
What’s more, a “sour patch” could develop if the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, moved above 45 -- or if the S&P 500 fell below its recent bottom, he said. A key level for Emanuel is 2,965, the intraday low hit June 15. That would be a drop of over 5% from current levels. The index is now up about 40% from late-March lows.
The VIX closed June 23 at a two-week low of 31.37, compared with its lifetime average around 19.4 -- signaling investors still see risks as elevated, Emanuel said.

Gains for U.S. stocks are more common during periods of low volatility or reversals after blowouts of the sort seen during March and April, Emanuel said. During the past three decades, VIX levels between 25 and 45 have been associated with large net declines for the S&P 500, he added.

1101,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Mixed; Virus Cases Mount,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Wednesday, with investors generally upbeat about the economic recovery but wary as cases of the coronavirus continue to mount.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
Stocks in Europe have rallied hard since hitting a low in March, with gains driven by hefty central bank stimulus around the globe and a gradual easing of restrictions despite a clearly negative outlook for many companies' earnings.
Hopes for an economic recovery were supported Tuesday by upbeat surveys of manufacturing and services, with France a stand-out as lockdown loosening there led to a modest return to growth.
“To some extent, this is obviously a technical rebound. The fact that PMIs are still in contractionary territory illustrates the two messages: a sense of relief that a sharp rebound is possible but at the same time caution against too much optimism,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
However, while the number of Covid-19 cases are much lower throughout most of Europe, several U.S. states are seeing record infections and the death toll in Latin America passed 100,000 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally.
The key economic indicator due for release Wednesday will be the influential German Ifo Business Climate survey for June, at 4 AM ET (0800 GMT). Optimism is seen recovering, as June’s flash PMI data pointed to further signs of a turnaround in the German economy.
In corporate news, Dufry (SIX:DUFN), the operator of duty-free shops, said Wednesday that it would cut staffing costs by 20% to 35% to reflect previously forecast potential sales declines of between 40% and 70% on the back of the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil edged lower Wednesday after hitting a three-month high on Tuesday, with investors digesting a second consecutive week of increases in  U.S. crude supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute estimated a build of 1.749 million barrels for the week ended June 19 on Tuesday, much bigger than the 300,000 barrel build expected. Attention now turns to the government figures due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $40.26 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $42.60.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,785.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1322, up 0.1%.

The pricing comes after SoftBank unveiled a series of transactions on Monday to divest more than $20 billion of stock in T-Mobile, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buybacks and debt reduction plan.
The sale price is a 4% discount to T-Mobile's Tuesday closing price. 
Together with SoftBank's already announced monetisation of stakes in e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) and wireless carrier Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Corp (T:9434), ""we now believe the selling is complete,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane wrote in a note to clients.
The injection of funds will relieve pressure on SoftBank after investments from Chief Executive Masayoshi Son and his $100 billion Vision Fund have soured and hammered the group's earnings.
SoftBank has spent 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) on a share buyback plan that will total up to 2.5 trillion yen. Son is due to address shareholders on Thursday in his first public appearance since May's earnings presentation.

Investing.com –  Virgin Australia  Holdings' (ASX:VAH) bondholders lodged a recapitalization proposal with the struggling airline’s administrator Deloitte on Wednesday morning.
The proposal comes two days after Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners submitted final and binding offers. It could involve a debt-to-equity swap among the bondholders, who are owed around AU$2 billion ($1.386 billion), as well as an AU$ 1 billion capital injection.
The airline had taken a hard hit even before the COVID-19 virus wiped out travel demand, entering voluntary administration in April with an AU$7 billion debt burden to its creditors.

The company said on Tuesday it will no longer display the Mississippi state flag in its stores while the state debates whether to make changes to its design after it drew opposition.
The Mississippi Baptist Convention, with over 500,000 members at more than 2,100 churches, called on state leaders to adopt a new flag, saying lawmakers have a moral obligation to remove the emblem from the state flag as it ""hurt and shamed"" many people.
""While the issue continues to be discussed, we've made the decision to remove the Mississippi state flag from display in its current form from our stores,"" a Walmart spokesman said.
In the ongoing global ant-racism demonstrations, protesters have demanded that authorities take down monuments, emblems and statues honoring pro-slavery Confederate figures and the architects of Europe's colonies.
The protests have spread since an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis on May 25.
Separately, social media users complained over links to products like an ""All Lives Matter"" shirt for sale on the Walmart Canada site.

1106,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>",Wirecard Clients Get Cold Feet After $2 Billion Goes Missing,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore ride hailing company Grab Holdings Inc. is among the businesses distancing themselves from Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY), making it harder for the German payments company to recover from a scandal that’s caused its shares to collapse and its chief executive officer to be arrested.
Grab said it hasn’t begun integration work on a partnership with the firm. French telecom carrier Orange SA (NYSE:ORAN) will soon put a new payments partner in place for its Orange Bank unit, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. While its issues with Wirecard are mostly technological, the debacle at the company is accelerating a change to a new provider, the person said.
The customer concern highlights the urgency for interim CEO James Freis to reassure Wirecard’s business partners. It has licenses with Mastercard, Visa and JCB International, through which its banking arm issues its credit cards. If Wirecard is unable to find its 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of missing cash, the card companies may have cause to revoke the licenses. A spokesman for Wirecard said the company will not be issuing statements about its situation.
“The big question is whether they retain the Visa and Mastercard licenses,” said Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud. “Without those they have no business.”
A Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). spokesperson said it is following the developments at Wirecard but did not want to comment on specific customer conversations or situations. A spokeswoman for  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). said the company continues to monitor developments and assess new information as it becomes available.
Monitoring Chaos
The company has more than 313,000 corporate customers, according to its website. It says it offers a range of services for digital payments in 26 countries around the world.
Other clients are monitoring the chaos at Wirecard after the payments company said the 1.9 billion euros it had reported as assets probably didn’t exist and it pulled recent financial results. The company is now in discussions with creditors and considering a full-scale restructuring.
The Dutch arm of airline Air France-KLM is assessing the situation, according to a spokesman. London-based digital bank Revolut Ltd. has decided to shift customers to alternative payment providers to avoid any service disruption. A spokesman for Orange, which has had a partnership with Wirecard since at least 2013, declined to comment.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore said Tuesday it has told Wirecard to make sure it keeps customer funds from its payments processing business in local banks. The city-state is home to Wirecard’s Asia-Pacific headquarters.
Markus Braun, who had been CEO for almost 20 years, was arrested on Tuesday and has been accused of inflating the volume of sales at Wirecard, according to the Munich prosecutor’s office. He had been the company’s biggest shareholder, and had to unwind his 7% holding he’d purchased through a 150 million-euro margin loan secured by the value of the stock.
Wirecard, once praised as an example of Germany’s ability to produce successful technology companies, is now a national embarrassment that’s jeopardizing the country’s image. Finance Minister Peter Altmaier said “we cannot allow individual companies to destroy the reputation of an entire industry and thus damage the country.”

There are now over 9.2 million cases globally as of June 24, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Tensions are also rising in Hong Kong, with the National People’s Congress Standing Committee scheduled to meet over the weekend. The committee could possibly enact national security laws in both Hong Kong and Macau before July.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street is likely to cut bonuses this year by 15-20% and make significant layoffs, according to a report published Tuesday by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. 
The estimates in the report by Alan Johnson, closely watched by financial professionals, are less severe than Johnson projected earlier this year. https://reut.rs/2WQHj5s 
But layoffs could be significant. Companies were forced to make quick decisions and cut red tape during the pandemic, and they have recognized fewer employees are needed to do certain jobs, Johnson said. 
""Technology has shown us that we don't need as many people, don't need as many management levels...and in many places there is going to be job insecurity,"" Johnson said. 
But cutting headcount adds expenses for severance pay, and companies will not want to be perceived as cheap with the economy in recession and millions out of work, Johnson said. 
For those still employed, incentive compensation will be under strict scrutiny as banks consider their own performance during the coronavirus crisis, and also the Black Lives Matter movement.
This scrutiny will extend to chief executives' compensation at public companies, Johnson wrote.
""With the impact of COVID-19 and recent focus on justice and equality, it will require a thoughtful analysis and balance of performance, competitive and societal priorities, and customer and employee expectations,"" Johnson wrote. ""This is not a year to be tone deaf."" 
The ratio between CEO and worker pay, which banks publish annually, will receive significant attention this year as advocates for greater equality bring mainstream focus to the figures, Johnson wrote. 

""Most of America is trying to stay above water,"" Johnson said. ""It's almost a political statement that you’re going to make with senior management pay (and it is) going to be dissected by the public.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd announced stricter health protocols on Tuesday after cases of the novel coronavirus at its Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world´s largest, reached 150, with 59 at its smaller Spence deposit.
BHP (AX:BHP) said 76 of those cases remained active and that the discovery of new cases suggested a ""stabilization and tendency toward decline.""
It added: ""This is a dynamic situation that can change rapidly, which is why we are making our best effort to implement all measures necessary to protect the health of our workers and contractors.""
A spike in cases in the city of Calama had led BHP to route all workers flying into the mines via nearby  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) airport instead, the company said, and workers were being encouraged to observe stricter social-distancing measures during trips.
BHP is one of a number of major miners operating in Chile to have upgraded safety measures in recent weeks as the world's No. 1 copper producer reaches the peak of coronavirus cases and deaths, and hospitals fill up.
Last week, state-owned copper miner Codelco [CODEL.UL], the world`s biggest, announced a strengthening of safety measures including a 14-day-on, 14-day-off shift schedule and the suspension of some construction projects after two workers died from COVID-19. Labor unions rejected the measures as insufficient.
Chile in May declared its copper industry among the least affected by the pandemic globally, with a drop of just 1% in output. But the recent changes have sparked speculation among analysts about a potential decline in output.
The government had announced lockdowns for the mines-heavy Antofagasta Region to begin on Tuesday.
Chilean Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica on Tuesday underlined the need to strike a balance between protecting mine workers from the coronavirus and keeping the country's economic engine running.
Prokurica said the ""indispensable"" mining sector had frozen the operations of about half its workforce through measures such as remote working, shift changes and suspension of projects, and tightened health protocols in response to the outbreak of the virus in Chile in March.
But the mining industry needs to keep operating, he said, if the government is to sustain emergency social support packages to address economic fallout from the pandemic.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) bondholders have put forward a recapitalisation proposal for the struggling airline, seeking to knock out rival offers from two U.S. private equity firms. 
The proposal was lodged with Virgin's administrator, a spokesman for the bondholders said on Wednesday, two days after Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners made final and binding offers for the airline.
""Our plan offers a sustainable capital structure underpinned by public ownership to provide certainty and support the strong operating plan for the airline,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The proposal involves a debt-to-equity swap among bondholders owed around A$2 billion ($1.39 billion) plus a fresh capital injection of around A$1 billion, one person with knowledge of the proposal told Reuters.
Virgin Australia would remain a listed entity as part of the plan, which would allow bondholders to recoup around 70 cents on the dollar of their investment, the person said.
The 70 cent return is a future estimate based on expectations of share trading, a second source told Reuters. 
The proposal would back the existing management team, honour full employee entitlements, customer travel credits and frequent flyer points, both sources said. They were not authorised to speak on the record.
Australia's second largest airline entered voluntary administration in April owing nearly A$7 billion to creditors, having struggled financially even before the coronavirus pandemic crushed travel demand.
Virgin Australia's administrator, Deloitte, declined to comment. Deloitte had said on Monday after receiving the Bain and Cyrus offers that it hoped to select a preferred bidder by June 30. 
Deloitte did not release financial details of those offers but said both planned to operate the airline as a smaller, single-branded domestic and short-haul international carrier with growth potential.
Virgin Australia competes against larger rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) in the domestic aviation market, which is an effective duopoly.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Shares in Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR) tumbled 13% on Tuesday after the key  Boeing Co  (N:BA) supplier warned it was seeking relief from its lenders due to Boeing's move to reduce parts shipments substantially this year.
As Spirit grapples with fallout over Boeing's 737 MAX production, its chief executive, Tom Gentile, and other company executives were in Seattle this week for discussions with Boeing on production rates and the possibility of further financial assistance from Boeing, a person familiar with the matter said.
A Boeing spokesperson declined to confirm or comment on specific talks between the companies, but said Boeing was ""working closely with all of our suppliers to ensure we all emerge from this situation strong, healthy and prepared for the future.""
Earlier this year, Spirit reached a deal with Boeing to make 216 shipsets, as complete sets of parts are known, in 2020, but that was cut down to 125 shipsets in May, as the coronavirus crisis spread and several airlines started deferring deliveries of planes. 
Spirit now expects to deliver only 72 shipsets to Boeing. That compares with 606 shipments in 2019, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) told clients Tuesday.
The company has already delivered 37 737 shipsets to Boeing and expects to produce and deliver the remaining 35 shipsets over the rest of the year. But Boeing told Spirit not to deliver any more fuselages through July, the person familiar with the matter said. 
Spirit's profits were already under pressure after Boeing halted production of its once best-selling 737 MAX from January through late May following a safety ban after two fatal crashes.
After the jet's grounding, Boeing kept production going for nine months and, earlier this year, paid Spirit $225 million to support 737 MAX production while deferring repayment of another $123 million advance.

The mobile-phone company, controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), laid out plans for the deal on Monday, but hadn’t yet set a price for the shares. Nearly 200 million shares are changing hands as part of the complex transaction.
SoftBank agreed to pay T-Mobile $300 million as part of the transaction and will cover all fees and expenses related to the deal. The company became co-owners with Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) of T-Mobile after the carrier merged with Sprint Corp. earlier this year.
At $103, the shares are selling at a discount to T-Mobile’s $107.16 closing price on Tuesday. They have gained 37% this year.
The deal, along with SoftBank plan to sell a 5% stake in its Japanese wireless subsidiary, is part of a broader $42 billion push to unload assets. The company aims to use the funds to finance stock buybacks and pay down debt. Masayoshi Son, the company’s founder, is dealing with steep losses in his Vision Fund after writing down the value of investments in the sharing economy from WeWork to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
SoftBank will now turn its attention to other assets in its portfolio and may pursue an outright sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Son has said $11.5 billion raised from issuing contracts to sell stock in Asia’s largest corporation was a first step toward unwinding more of its holdings.
SoftBank “needs to further enhance its cash reserves,” the Japanese company said in a statement on Tuesday, citing concerns for “a second and third wave of spread of Covid-19.” The Japanese investment giant may invest the proceeds in high-quality securities until they are used for buybacks or debt reductions.
A stock offering due to trade on Wednesday was overseen by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government financing for projects to return critical supply chains to the United States as part of coronavirus response efforts could reach tens of billions of dollars and clients may include a projected $12 billion Taiwanese semiconductor plant, the head of the agency managing the funds told Reuters.
The U.S. International Development Finance Corp is talking to companies about reshoring the manufacturing of personal protective equipment, generic drugs and pharmaceutical ingredients, DFC Chief Executive Adam Boehler said in an interview on Monday.
Boehler said letters of understanding for some initial projects could be signed within the next month. The Trump administration has been pushing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-supply-chains/u-s-mulls-paying-companies-tax-breaks-to-pull-supply-chains-from-china-idUSKBN22U0FH for U.S. companies and importers to move manufacturing out of China.
The agency, which opened its doors in January to boost U.S. overseas development financing efforts to counter China's massive Belt and Road infrastructure drive, was drafted into domestic service in May, after President Donald Trump signed an executive order https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/eo-delegating-authority-dpa-ceo-u-s-international-development-finance-corporation-respond-covid-19-outbreak under the Defense Production Act.
DFC and the Defense Department agreed https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2227560/dod-partners-with-dfc-to-protect-industrial-base-from-economic-effect-of-pandem on Monday to jointly administer $100 million in supply-chain reshoring funds from the $2.3 billion coronavirus legislation passed in March.
Company proposals to reshore are already pouring in, Boehler said.
""The areas that have come on hot right away are on the PPE side and within the pharmaceutical value chains,"" Boehler said, adding there was interest in returning some generic drug production - almost all of which is imported - to the United States.
The $100 million can be leveraged into ""tens of billions of dollars"" in loans by using it as a pool of capital similar to the U.S. Treasury's backing of Federal Reserve loan facilities, Boehler said. At that scale, the agency could participate in the financing of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's (TW:2330) planned factory in Arizona.
The project is a centerpiece of the push to wrestle global technology supply chains back from China. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a major supplier to Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and other major U.S. tech firms.
""We provide loan and investment financing, so could we be relevant there? Absolutely. We're talking tens of billions of dollars in potential here, so that's a possibility, I wouldn't exclude that,"" Boehler said.
A financing package for TSMC would likely include private capital from the state of Arizona. It is too soon to say whether the agency would be able to participate.
'FOOT ON THE GAS'
DFC was created under 2018 legislation that combined the former Overseas Private Investment Corp (OPIC) and part of the U.S. Agency for International Development, more than doubling OPIC's overall lending and investment capacity to $60 billion. Its planned October 2019 launch was delayed until January by a budget fight in Congress that threatened a government shutdown.
Boehler said DFC's development mission would not be affected by Trump's executive order and would keep its ""foot on the gas"" to accelerate projects in poor countries.
The 337-employee DFC - small for a federal agency - is adding about 15 people to focus solely on the domestic reshoring projects, he said, and the funding for overseas development will be kept separate.
The agency approved https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-approves-1-billion-investments-global-development $1 billion worth of investments and loans at its June board meeting, including a $200 million loan to Guatemala's Banco Industrial to expand lending to small and medium-size enterprises. Boehler said the bank's board in September would consider a larger slate of projects.

The acquisition would come as Europcar struggles to cope with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has weighed on travel around the world and sapped demand for car rentals. It would represent a reversal for Volkswagen, which sold Europcar to investment firm Eurazeo SE (PA:EURA) in 2006. 
Volkswagen has reached out to Europcar to express its interest in an acquisition and carry out due diligence, one of the sources said. The talks are preliminary and a deal is far from certain given the financial toll of the coronavirus outbreak on Europcar, the sources added.
Europcar, which has market capitalization of 390 million euros ($441 million) and net debt as of the end of March of more than 1 billion euros, has also attracted interest from private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO), the sources added.
Volkswagen, Apollo and Eurazeo, which currently owns close to 30% of Europcar, declined to comment.
When Volkswagen divested Europcar in 2006, it said it could be a mobility services provider without owning a short-term vehicle hire company. A new deal for Europcar would allow Volkswagen to buy it back at a significant discount to the 3.32 billion euros it sold it for 14 years ago.
Europcar is hoping to avoid the fate of U.S. peer  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ), which filed for bankruptcy protection in May.

Last month, Europcar said it secured a 307 million euro financing package to manage through the coronavirus crisis, which included a 220 million euro loan guaranteed at 90% by the French state.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Companies that spend on social causes risk hedge fund challenge: study,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - U.S. companies that spend more on social and environmental causes, such as sustainability or charitable donation programs, are more likely to attract hedge funds that challenge their strategy and board, according to a new academic study.
The study's findings underscore the pressure on companies to balance the interests of Wall Street and Main Street as management fields calls to protect companies' share price while doing more to tackle social inequality. This tension has intensified in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. protests over racism and policing after the death of a Black man, George Floyd, in police custody.
U.S. companies have about a 3% chance on average of being targeted by an activist hedge fund, but the probability nearly doubles for those who are top spenders on corporate and social responsibility (CSR) programs, according to the study, which analyzed 506 instances of shareholder activism between 2000 and 2016.
""CSR spending can be an indicator (to hedge funds) that there might be some wasteful spending at companies and that maybe top management isn't focused on the short-term returns,"" one of the study's authors, Pennsylvania State University professor Mark DesJardine, said in an interview.
The research, conducted by DesJardine along with Emilio Marti of Rotterdam School of Management and Rodolphe Durand of HEC-Paris, will be published in the Academy of Management Journal later this year.
While hedge funds are rarely explicit in their demands to companies about doing away with CSR spending, their focus on cost-cutting often results in the scaling back of these programs, according to the study. As a result, the targeted companies become reluctant to invest in CSR, even after the hedge funds have cashed out on their stock.
""We see CSR flatline for up to five years"" after an activist exerts pressure to boost short-term profitability, DesJardine said.
For example, Motorola Solutions Inc (N:MSI), which was spun out of telecommunications firm Motorola in 2011 under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, cut CSR spending by 50% over the following three years, according to data provider KLD Global Socrates.
Icahn and Motorola Solutions did not respond to requests for comment.
CSR investing has become important for many younger investors and has been backed by pension funds who have also fueled investments in hedge funds over the years.
One of the world's most prominent activist shareholders, Jeffrey Ubben, said on Tuesday he was stepping down from the hedge fund he founded in 2000, ValueAct Capital, because he believes his focus on social and environmental investments can no longer ""peacefully co-exist"" with traditional shareholder activism. He is launching a new firm focused on CSR investments.
DesJardine said that the economic uncertainty fueled by the pandemic will pit the need of many companies to protect profits by cutting costs against calls by their customers, vendors and others to demonstrate a strong social conscience.
""This will increase the tension companies face when deciding how to balance social spending and short-term profitability pressures,"" DesJardine said.

TOULOUSE/PARIS (Reuters) - French unions and a regional body slammed a decision by Airbus (PA:AIR) to cancel plans to bring some engine work in-house on Tuesday, saying it would cost 350 French jobs.
Airbus was due to take over production of some A320neo nacelles or engine housings from Raytheon Technologies Corp (N:RTX) this month, gaining access to future maintenance profits.
The plan dates back to 2017 when Airbus looked at ""in-sourcing"" two types of nacelle offered by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and what is now Raytheon Technologies, depending on the type of engine. It later decided to import only Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s work.
But a public-private consultative body in the Occitanie region, where Airbus is based, disclosed that the plans had now been dropped altogether and said Airbus would instead prolong Raytheon's nacelles contract beyond end-June.
Coming days after France unveiled support for aerospace, the ""politically and economically untenable"" move means jobs will go to Mexico or China, Jean-Louis Chauzy, head of the CERER consultative body, said.
""The loss of capabilities will accelerate offshoring,"" he said, adding it would sour broader Airbus restructuring talks.
Force Ouvriere union said the move contradicted efforts to preserve high-tech employment.
Airbus said it had been forced to cancel the in-sourcing project due to the coronavirus crisis, which ""leaves Airbus with no choice than to revisit all current and future product development activities to protect our cash.""
Industry sources said the earlier decision by Airbus to import the work had partly been intended to spur suppliers to make concessions in a longstanding tussle over aftermarket profits.
But some had questioned whether it could develop the nacelles quickly and cheaply enough.

The cancellation may impact Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) which plans to buy the Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Belfast plant where thrust reversers for Airbus-designed nacelles would have been made. Spirit said planned acquistions were moving forward but not yet complete.

1118,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 05:03PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for June 24,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Tech stocks continued to climb to new records Tuesday, shrugging off fears about a second wave of Covid-19 infections that are weighing on other sectors exposed to the success of businesses reopening.
Investors appear to be betting that tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will come out of the pandemic ahead. The stocks hit fresh highs as home-bound consumers turned to the internet and streaming services to keep busy during lockdowns.
The reopening plans around the country were threatened by mounting new coronavirus cases. Government data on crude oil inventories – which investors use to judge whether business demand for fuel is rising or falling – is due out Wednesday.
Investors will also be watching to see if tech can continue its rally, along with financials. While stocks rose on Tuesday, the indexes had given back some of their gains by the closing bell.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. More Information on Oil Inventory Gives Reading of Demand
The Energy Information Administration's crude inventory numbers for the week ending June 19 are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) on Wednesday. The closely watched number is used by investors to judge whether demand is rising or falling. On Tuesday, the industry's own weekly report showed a higher than expected increase in crude oil in storage, a potentially bearish sign.
2. Can tech giants continue their record-breaking climb?
FAANG giants hit new highs on Tuesday, pulling the NASDAQ Composite to its own record as tech investors seem to be unworried about possible interruptions to the economic recovery from Covid-19 shutdowns.
Investors will be looking to see if this group can keep up the momentum. Apple is surging after a bunch of announcements out of its Worldwide Developers Conference, including new operating systems for its iPhones and the announcement it would be using its own processing chips in new Mac computers.
Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon also hit new highs.
3. Financial Stocks Could Be a Proxy For Economic Revival
Bank stocks are also surging on the prospect of more stimulus money on the way from Washington. That benefits big lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) because it puts money in the hands of businesses and consumers to spend more.
On Tuesday, Trump administration officials were busy shaking off mixed signals on China-U.S. trade and focused on getting out the word on stimulus. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to cheer investors by saying a fourth round of stimulus, about $1 trillion, would be introduced in the next few weeks and aimed at getting people back to work.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>","J&J loses bid to overturn baby powder verdict, but damages cut to $2.12 billion","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A Missouri appeals court on Tuesday rejected Johnson & Johnson's bid to throw out a jury verdict in favor of women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its baby powder and other talc products, but reduced damages by more than half, to $2.12 billion.
The Missouri Court of Appeals lowered the original $4.69 billion verdict from July 2018 after dismissing claims by some of the 22 women and their families who had sued.
But it said the plaintiffs had proven that J&J and an affiliate concealed for decades that the talc products contained asbestos, ""worked tirelessly"" to ensure that testing protocols would not detect asbestos in all talc samples and published articles downplaying the safety hazards of talc.
""Plaintiffs proved with convincing clarity that defendants engaged in outrageous conduct because of an evil motive or reckless indifference,"" the court said. ""There was significant reprehensibility in defendants' conduct.""
J&J said it will appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.
""We continue to believe this was a fundamentally flawed trial, grounded in a faulty presentation of the facts,"" spokeswoman Kim Montagnino said. ""We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important. We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.""
Tuesday's decision followed J&J's May 19 announcement that it would stop selling its Baby Powder talc in the United States and Canada.
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company faces more than 19,000 lawsuits claiming that its talc products cause cancer because of contamination from asbestos, a known carcinogen.
J&J's payout in Tuesday's decision includes $500 million of compensatory damages and $1.62 billion of punitive damages, down from a respective $550 million and $4.14 billion in the original verdict from a Missouri circuit court.
Mark Lanier, the lead lawyer for plaintiffs, called the decision ""a clarion call for J&J to try and find a good way to resolve the cases for the people who have been hurt.""
J&J has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder's safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. 
Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/)
J&J has been the target of a federal criminal probe on how forthright it has been about the safety of its talc products, as well as an investigation by 41 U.S. states of its baby powder sales.
The company has also faced an investigation by a congressional subcommittee on the health risks of asbestos in consumer products containing talc.
J&J on Tuesday declined further comment on these matters.
Johnson & Johnson's shares were down 39 cents at $142.83 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Mnuchin says U.S.-China decoupling will occur if firms cannot compete fairly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that a decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies will result if U.S. companies are not allowed to compete on a fair and level basis in China's economy.
Speaking at a virtual event sponsored by Bloomberg and Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), Mnuchin said he also had ""every expectation"" that China would live up to the terms of the Phase 1 trade agreement calling for a massive increase in Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, energy and services.
""If we can compete with China on a fair and level playing field, it is a great opportunity for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers, as China has a large, growing middle class,"" he said. ""But if we can't participate and compete on a fair basis, then you are going to see a de-coupling going forward.""
Switching to the coronavirus epidemic in the United States, Mnuchin said he hoped to have the next aid package passed by both chambers of Congress in July, and that while negotiations had begun, there was no need to rush because there were still hundreds of billions of dollars undistributed from the last bill, passed in March.
The next coronavirus bill would be more targeted to businesses that need help the most and toward returning many people to work as quickly as possible.
While infrastructure projects will be part of those discussions, Mnuchin said the next bill would likely focus on other priorities.
""The issue with infrastructure is that normally, these are not shovel-ready (projects),"" Mnuchin said. ""Even if we pass something, this isn't going to impact getting people back to work in September and October.""
President Donald Trump is racing to try to revive the economy from coronavirus shutdowns before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.

Mnuchin added that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows would participate in the negotiations between the Trump administration and congressional leaders.

Investing.com -- A contrarian bet on the stock market is down sharply after word of plans to delist it.
VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NASDAQ:TVIX) tumbled more than 12% after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it would delist those notes, among other VelocityShares. TVIX closed down 8% at $132.10.The exchange traded note had risen to as much as $950 in March amid growing alarm about coronavirus. Credit Suisse said the move to delist it was to “better align its product suite with its broader strategic growth plans.”Consultant Six Figure Investing said that most people buy it as a “contrarian investment, expecting it to go up when the equities market goes down."" The S&P 500 hit a 2020 recent low in March at 2,237.40 and is now at 3,145.36.
ETNs qualify as a liability for the issuing company, according to ETF.com. In 2016, Credit Suisse delisted two ETNs, amid speculation it was trying to clean up its balance sheet. The products can also produce big losses for investors if markets go the wrong way. In 2018, an investor sued Credit Suisse alleging misstatements regarding another ETN that led to losses, CNBC reported. That ETN, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note, which is no longer listed, sank by more than 90 percent within hours following a market selloff. The delisting of the ETNs will become effective on July 12.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The damage done to the U.S. economy by the coronavirus pandemic will create opportunities for investors in distressed credit, PIMCO Chief Executive Emmanuel Roman said at the Bloomberg Invest Global conference on Tuesday. 
Roman is not expecting U.S. gross domestic product to return to 2019 levels until the end of 2021. The next 18 months are therefore a time when investors can secure positions in businesses and credit at low prices, he said. 
""Distress is a long cycle, and the need to deploy capital to restructuring situations is actually an opportunity to deliver outsized returns,"" said Roman. ""It is something that we are focusing on.""
S&P Global Ratings Research estimates that the global default rate for speculative-grade companies will rise to 12.5% by March 2021, from 3.5% as of March 2020. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that PIMCO was seeking to raise up to $3 billion for a distressed debt fund, its largest ever. The Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO) has $1.78 trillion in assets under management. 
The path to recovery for some U.S. companies has been and will continue to be aided by the Federal Reserve's stimulus operations, said Roman, noting that the bank's pledged support is ultimately more important than what it actually purchases. Issuance of new investment-grade corporate bonds has broken records this year and in May hit $1 trillion, a threshold not breached in 2019 until November. 
Roman said the firm had no plans to acquire rival fund managers, and said that mergers would be scarce while meetings were still largely virtual.

""I think when people talk on Zoom, it is not easy to do mergers. Until we get back to face-to-face meetings, I don't think you'll see very many mergers. I think at some point you need to break bread and look each other in the eyes and say 'this is something I want to do.'""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investor Jeffrey Ubben, who grew ValueAct Capital into one of the world's most powerful activist hedge funds, is retiring from the firm and will start anew with an investment company that will focus on society and the environment.
Ubben has founded Inclusive Capital Partners along with Lynn Forester de Rothschild and will take along some ValueAct colleagues, including Eva Zlotnicka, head of stewardship at the firm, three people familiar with the move said.
The move completes Ubben's roughly three-year long transition out of the day-to-day business at ValueAct and will give him a new platform for socially responsible investments at a time investors are calling for corporations to behave better.
""The final step in the journey is for the former CEO to leave the company, to fully empower his/her successor. We are taking that step today,"" ValueAct's chief executive officer Mason Morfit wrote to his investors in a letter seen by Reuters.
The ValueAct team which has worked on investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Nintendo will stay together, Morfit wrote, adding ""this team is going to win. Big."" 
He said the firm's fundamental values remain unchanged with a focus on ""finding win-wins for our companies and our investors, always learning,"" and ""having fun.""
Ubben, who spent the last years becoming one of Wall Street's biggest evangelists for investments with strong environmental, social and governance components, said his new firm will ""partner with management and the boards of companies whose core businesses seek to achieve the reversal of corporate harm."" 
""We will aim to make capitalism part of the solution, rather than the source of some of the world's biggest problems,"" Ubben wrote in the firm's mission statement, seen by Reuters.
The Financial Times first reported Ubben's move.
Ubben founded ValueAct, which now manages over $14 billion, in 2000 and spent decades growing it into a powerhouse known for preferring to stay out of the limelight and working more collaboratively with companies in pushing for change.

He has not led an investment in ValueAct's main fund since 2018 and has handed responsibility to Morfit, his hand-picked successor, by first making him chief investment officer in 2017 and then making him chief executive officer in 2019.

Shapiro declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. The deal covers chips and software for the vehicle system.
The new partnership followed Daimler's move last week to pause a development alliance with rival German luxury carmaker BMW in the area of automated driving.
Shapiro said the high-end Nvidia Drive AGX Orin Platform - an autonomous vehicle processor - would be standard in every Mercedes-Benz vehicle. With that in place, consumers will be able to update the car's software the way smartphones are updated today.
Asked how the Mercedes-Benz partnership will affect Nvidia’s decade-long collaboration with  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG), Shapiro said neither arrangement was exclusive. With Mercedes-Benz there is “a huge dedication, huge energy, huge investment from both companies to bring this to market,” he said.

Mercedes-Benz sold 2.39 million cars worldwide in 2019. The two companies have been working together on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence car technology for over five years.

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",Pimco’s Roman Sees U.S. Inflation Remaining Low for Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Inflation in the U.S. is likely to come back slowly, keeping the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates for an extended period, according to the chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.
Over the next couple of years, prices are likely to increase to the 2.3% to 2.4% level, Emmanuel “Manny” Roman said Tuesday at the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event. The central bank has learned its lesson from past interest rate increases and will be determined to avoid another “temper tantrum,” he said.
“The days of inflation we remember are gone,” Roman said. “We don’t think the Fed is going to raise rates for a very long time.”
Led by the Fed, central banks have been cutting interest rates and buying securities to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, an intervention that helped stabilize global markets. Even as U.S. unemployment soared to its highest level in decades, stock markets have recovered most of their post-pandemic losses and corporate debt investors have poured money into junk bonds.
U.S. equities rose to a two-week high Tuesday amid a report that President Donald Trump supports sending another round of checks to Americans and data that showed manufacturing nearing expansion.
Pimco, with about $1.8 trillion in mostly fixed-income assets under management, is raising at least $6 billion for distressed credit and other corporate debt opportunities to take advantage of dislocations driven by the coronavirus pandemic. It’s also looking to return as an originator of collateralized loan obligations for the first time since 2006, eyeing prospects for charging higher interest rates and stricter underwriting standards than pre-pandemic issues.
Rivals such as Howard Marks’s Oaktree Capital Group also have launched new long-term funds to seize underpriced assets that feature multi-year lockups to allow the investments to regain value.
Under Roman, Pimco has continued to focus on actively managed funds even as money pours into low-fee index-tracking products. U.S. active managers saw assets in their funds dip in May from a year earlier as the spread of the coronavirus sent equity markets swinging wildly.
Roman, 56, became CEO of Pimco, a unit of Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE, in 2016 after heading Man Group Plc and spending 18 years at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:07PM ET</span>","Wall Street higher on signs of recovery, Nasdaq hits record high","By Devik Jain and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes rose on Tuesday as improving economic data and the prospect of more stimulus bolstered hopes of a swift recovery, while a jump in technology shares powered the Nasdaq to another record high.
White House advisor Larry Kudlow said tax rebates and direct mail checks are on the table in the next coronavirus relief bill.
The Nasdaq hit a fifth record high this month with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) providing the biggest boost after at least three brokerages raised their price targets, a day after the iPhone maker said it would use its own chips for Mac computers.
The pace of contraction in U.S. manufacturing and services sectors slowed in June as businesses reopened after the health crisis resulted in a lockdown in mid-March.
Another set of data showed new home sales jumped 16.6% in May, blowing past estimates of a 2.9% rise.
""The market seems to be in a liquidity-driven FOMO (fear of missing out) mode where Fed has your back and U.S. government will probably come back to the table in the next two to three weeks to continue to do more stimulus,"" said Nate Fischer, chief investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners in Cleveland, Ohio.
""It would be healthy for the market to probably chop sideways here in the next couple weeks and then in earning season see if companies really feel as bullish as the markets.""
Global equity markets were also boosted by President Donald Trump's assurance that the Phase 1 trade agreement with China was ""fully intact"" after adviser Peter Navarro sparked confusion by saying the deal was over.
While U.S.-China tensions have been a cause for concern, monetary and fiscal support worth trillions of dollars has in part powered the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX), with the index just about 7% below its Feb. 19 record high.
Nine of the 11 major sub-indexes were higher with technology (SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) posting the steepest gains. The defensive real estate <.SPLRCR> and utilities (SPLRCU) slipped.
At 12:40 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 229.28 points, or 0.88%, at 26,254.24, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 29.26 points, or 0.94%, at 3,147.12. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 137.03 points, or 1.36%, at 10,193.50.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE) rose 2.3% as brokerages raised their price targets ahead of quarterly results on Thursday.
 Boeing Co 's (N:BA) top supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (N:SPR) slipped 14.9% after it said it was seeking relief from lenders as its finances were stretched by the COVID-19 pandemic and a 737 MAX production halt.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and six new lows.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>","Federal judge orders heads of GM, FCA to try to resolve GM racketeering lawsuit","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - A federal judge in Detroit on Tuesday ordered the chief executives of automakers General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) to meet by July 1 to try to resolve GM's racketeering lawsuit.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Borman called on GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA CEO Mike Manley to meet in person to try to resolve a case that could drag on for years. 
""What a waste of time and resources now and for the years to come in this mega-litigation if these automotive leaders and their large teams of lawyers are required to focus significant time-consuming efforts to pursue this nuclear-option lawsuit if it goes forward,"" Borman said at the end of a hearing during which FCA asked the judge to dismiss GM's lawsuit.
Borman said instead, the companies need to focus on building cars and keeping people employed at a time when the coronavirus has hurt the U.S. economy and the country is also dealing with issues of racial injustice after the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered worldwide protests. 
GM filed the racketeering lawsuit against FCA last November, alleging its rival bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM is seeking ""substantial damages"" that one analyst said could total at least $6 billion.
Barra and Manley should meet, taking into account social distancing to keep them safe, to ""explore and indeed reach a sensible resolution,"" Borman said in the hearing, which was broadcast online.
It is common for judges to order parties to try to resolve disputes out of court. But it is unusual that the chief executives of two big companies be instructed to meet face-to-face, not just to settle their differences but also to serve a greater good.
A GM spokesman said the No. 1 U.S. automaker has a strong case and ""we look forward to constructive dialogue with FCA consistent with the court’s order.”
FCA had no immediate comment.
Borman said he wanted to hear from Barra and Manley personally at noon on July 1 to provide him with results from their discussion. 

FCA shares were up 6.1% at $10.24 in New York and GM shares were down 0.5% at $26.25 on Tuesday afternoon.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 12:17PM ET</span>",Sanofi eyes approval of COVID-19 vaccine by first half of 2021,"By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA said on Tuesday it expects to get approval for the potential COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc by the first half of next year, faster than previously anticipated.
Sanofi, which is hosting a virtual research and development event, and GSK had said in April the vaccine, if successful, would be available in the second half of 2021.
""We are being guided by our dialogue with regulatory authorities,"" Sanofi research chief John Reed told reporters, when asked about the accelerated time frame.
There are currently no vaccines to prevent the coronavirus that has infected more than 9 million people and killed over 469,000 globally, and only a couple of medicines that have demonstrated benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in clinical trials.
Many drugmakers are racing to come up with a safe and effective vaccine that can be produced at large scale.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, the University of Oxford in collaboration with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc, and an alliance of BioNTech and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) grabbed headlines by moving to human trials as early as March.
Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said the firsts in the race now were not assured of securing victory.
""There are companies moving faster, but let us be brutally clear, speed has three downsides,"" he said of competition.
""They are using existing work, in many cases done for SARS; it is likely not to be as efficacious; and there is no guarantee on supply in large volumes,"" Hudson said.
The probability of success for Sanofi is ""higher than anybody else,"" the CEO said.
The comments echoed those of GSK, whose chief medical officer for vaccines told Reuters on Friday the company was aiming at quality before speed.
Sanofi, whose Pasteur vaccines division has a long established reputation, notably in flu, is currently working on two vaccine projects. 
One uses an adjuvant made by GSK to potentially boost its efficacy. It has received financial support from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
The other, being developed with U.S. company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) Inc, relies on a different technology known as mRNA, similar to the Moderna approach.
Clinical trials of the vaccine developed with GSK, described as a recombinant vaccine because of the use of GSK's boosting adjuvant, are to start in September. Trials of the mRNA vaccine candidate should begin around the end of the year, the company said.
Sanofi said it had capacity to produce up to 1 billion doses a year of its recombinant vaccine, and that it would be able to supply up to 360 million doses of its mRNA vaccine annually. 
In April, Sanofi said it had manufacturing capacity for 600 million doses for its recombinant vaccine, with the ambition to double production by mid-2021.

The company also said it would expand its collaboration with Translate Bio on developing vaccines, in a deal which will give the U.S. group $425 million in upfront payments.

The Canadian pot producer said it has cut its selling, general and administrative (SG&A) workforce by 25% and will lay off 30% of its production staff over the next two quarters.
A slow roll out of retail stores, the prevalence of illicit markets and burgeoning supply from producers racing to assert dominance have led to steep price declines and unsold pot stacking up.
Aurora said it expects SG&A expenses to be around C$42 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with C$75.1 million, excluding severance costs, recorded in the third quarter.
It also expects production asset impairment charges of up to C$60 million in the fourth quarter.

Stephane Manigold, who owns four restaurants in Paris, including one with two  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stars, took Axa to court for not paying out on a business-interruption policy, after France imposed a two-month lockdown to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A Paris court in May ordered the insurer to cough up two-months worth of revenue losses - or 45,000 euros ($50,985) for one of Manigold's restaurants, Le Flaubert.
The businessman said he had now reached a broader compensation agreement that covered all his restaurants. 
Axa confirmed a settlement had been reached, but did not disclose the terms of the deal. 
It is not the only insurer facing such issues.
French financial watchdog ACPR said in a report on Tuesday that, based on a survey of insurers, just under 3% of their policies would trigger clear-cut business-interruption payouts linked to the pandemic. Another 4% were ambiguous, it said. 
Manigold's case gave impetus to similar claims from restaurant managers and businesses hurt by the shutdowns in France and elsewhere, including nightclubs, which have yet to re-open in many European countries. 
Axa has since said there were about 1,700 restaurant contracts in France with ambiguous clauses which it was now looking into, although that is only a fraction of its 20,000 insurance policies in the sector, most of which do not carry explicit business-interruption conditions. 
The insurer is in talks with some 600 other restaurants over compensation, a spokeswoman said. 
""What was missing at first was any form of dialogue with Axa,"" Manigold told Reuters, adding he was pleased others might now benefit from similar payouts.

Many meat exporting nations, such as Brazil and the United States, have seen thousands of cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, among workers in meat plants.
Brazil's Agra Agroindustrial De Alimentos S.A. had voluntarily halted beef exports to China after a virus infection among its workforce, China's General Administration of Customs said on its website. 
In a separate statement on its Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media account, the department added that Britain's Tulip had voluntarily suspended all pork exports from its Tipton plant in the West Midlands because of a virus outbreak.
A joint statement from Tulip and Public Health England confirmed there had been ""some cases of COVID-19 in staff members"" at the Tipton plant which continues to operate.
Tulip, a division of Pilgrim's Pride Corp (O:PPC), is Britain's largest pork processor.
China has stepped up inspections of meat imports after a new cluster of virus infections in Beijing was linked to the capital's huge Xinfadi wholesale food market. 
Beijing has started testing meat, seafood and fresh produce, with some major Chinese ports opening all meat and seafood containers for virus tests.
Last week, Chinese customs asked food exporters for signed declarations that their produce was free of virus contamination. 
On Sunday, China said it had suspended poultry imports from a U.S.-based meat plant of Tyson Inc (N:TSN) after earlier halting pork products from German processor Toennies.
China's meat imports in the first five months of 2020 soared 73.4% on the year to 3.85 million tonnes.
The world's top pork consumer imported a monthly record volume of 400,000 tonnes in April as domestic output plunged after an outbreak of African swine fever hit its pig herd in late 2018.

1141,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",BlackRock Joins Growing Club of European Market Fans on Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). is the latest addition to the rapidly expanding group of market participants turning bullish on European assets.
“We are warming up to European assets as the region steps up its policy response and demonstrates relative success in tamping virus growth,” said BlackRock Investment Institute strategists Elga Bartsch, Mike Pyle and Scott Thiel.
BlackRock’s analysts gave their stamp of approval to the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program and to the region’s 750 billion-euro ($847 billion) recovery fund plan, as well as to the French and German fiscal stimulus. They also said that strict lockdown measures helped to effectively limit Covid-19’s spread in Europe and now that restrictions are being lifted, mobility has rebounded swiftly, signaling a quick recovery in economic activity.
The strategists maintain their overweight in European peripheral government bonds and are considering an upgrade to European equities, which they currently rate as underweight.
“Europe’s policy response to the virus shock was slow to get going –- but an impressive array of fiscal and monetary measures is getting into place to bridge the economy through the shock,” they said.
The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing about $6.5 trillion, is the latest in a string of strategists and investors including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) to have become more optimistic in the past weeks on European markets.
Goldman strategists led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann on Friday lifted the region’s stocks to overweight from neutral on a three-month basis, citing a pick-up in global growth, U.S. political headwinds and EU political tailwinds.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has outperformed the S&P 500 since mid-May, partially thanks to investor rotation into cyclical and cheaper value shares on optimism about a strong pick-up in economic growth. Market players are using their dry powder to buy the region’s stocks, boosting the allocation to European equities by 24 percentage points to a net 7% overweight, the largest increase in net weighting for any region this month, BofA’s investor survey showed.
To be sure, Goldman strategists are less convinced that Europe can outperform the U.S. on a longer-term basis, while noting that differences between the regions will diminish as European growth sectors rise in significance and as the area’s policy makers and politicians show their commitment to support its economy.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Bayer nears glyphosate settlement after lengthy talks: sources,"By Tina Bellon and Patricia Weiss
(Reuters) - Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn) is set to reach a settlement this week with U.S. plaintiffs that claim its glyphosate-based weedkillers cause cancer, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
After more than a year of talks, however, some details and the overall amount of the settlement have yet to be finalised, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity.
German business daily Handelsblatt earlier on Tuesday reported a deal was imminent, with Bayer pledging $8-$10 billion to settle the claims, including a $2 billion buffer for future cases.
The drugs and pesticides group, which said in May that talks were progressing, is keen to draw a line under the legal dispute over Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers, which it inherited via its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Its shares rose 6% to 72.78 euros at 1400 GMT. Still, they were more than 20% below their value August 2018, when Bayer lost the first of three court cases with damages in the tens of millions being awarded to plaintiffs.
Bayer, which has repeatedly said the product is safe to use and has approval from market regulators, is appealing all three jury verdicts. 
In April, Bayer's management regained shareholder support for its handling of the litigation process.
A Bayer spokesman declined to comment. Perry Weitz of Weitz & Luxenberg, one of the leading plaintiffs' firms involved in the Roundup litigation, also would not comment.
Court-appointed mediator Ken Feinberg, who started work little over a year ago, also declined comment.
The company's supervisory board was due to discuss and vote on the settlement in the coming days, Handelsblatt cited company and negotiating partner sources as saying.

As of April, the company had been sued by 52,500 U.S. plaintiffs who blame Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer, up from 48,600 in February.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Wirecard ex-boss Braun arrested as creditors hunt lost billions,"By Jörn Poltz, Patricia Uhlig and Arno Schuetze
MUNICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wirecard's (DE:WDIG) former boss has been arrested on suspicion of falsifying its accounts, after the German payments firm disclosed a $2.1 billion financial hole and questioned whether trustees had actually held money on its behalf.
Markus Braun turned himself in on Monday night after Munich prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest. A judge ruled on Tuesday that the 50-year-old Austrian could be released as soon as he posts 5 million euros ($5.7 million) in bail.
In his 18 years in charge, Braun transformed an offshoot of the dot.com boom, known for handling payments for online gambling and adult entertainment sites, into a $20 billion-plus 'fintech' that won a place in Germany's blue-chip DAX index.
The former consultant traded in a suit for a black roll-neck and portrayed himself as a tech visionary, telling New York investors last autumn that Wirecard would increase revenues by six times by 2025 as digital payments boom.
Wirecard's meteoric rise was, however, accompanied by repeated allegations from whistleblowers, journalists and speculators that its revenue and profits had been pumped up through fake transactions with obscure partners.
Braun, who will have to report to police once a week, said last week in a video statement that Wirecard may have been the victim of fraud, without giving details.
He now stands accused of misrepresenting Wirecard's accounts and of market manipulation by falsifying income from transactions with so-called third-party acquirers, the Munich prosecutor's office said earlier.
Two people familiar with the matter said state prosecutors were also considering issuing an arrest warrant for Jan Marsalek, a board member fired on Monday. Lawyers for Braun and Marsalek were not available for comment.
Wirecard's implosion was described on Monday as a ""total disaster"" by Germany's financial regulator, who has come under fire for pursuing its critics and not the company.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters on Tuesday that lawmakers should decide quickly how to tighten regulation following the Wirecard scandal, which had exposed lapses by both auditors and regulators.
URGENT BANK TALKS
An external audit by KPMG in April could not verify cash balances, questioned Wirecard's acquisition accounting and was unable to trace millions in reported cash advances to merchants.
Braun, who said at the time that the allegations were not confirmed ""in every point"", quit on Friday after in-house auditor EY refused to sign off on Wirecard's 2019 accounts.
Wirecard's shares have since shed more than 80% and its only listed bond is trading at 26 cents on the euro, indicating that investors expect to lose most of their money.  
New CEO James Freis, a former financial investigator at the U.S. Treasury and compliance chief at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has opened urgent talks with some 15 banks that have lent 1.75 billion euros to Wirecard.
With Wirecard having failed to file audited financials, the banking consortium led by Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) could call in the loans at any time.
Sources close to the talks said it was doubtful that Wirecard can continue as a going concern, while risks of litigation ruled out asset sales for now.
The main question is whether to allow the firm to keep operating for a couple of weeks, to allow more time to recover money, one source familiar with the talks said.
More than 5,000 staff are due to be paid at the end of June, and bankers would decide before then whether to pull the plug and trigger insolvency, the source added.
Wirecard is being advised by investment bank Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and the creditors by law firm Allen & Overy. Both declined comment.

1150,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Higher After China Wobble,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday after President Donald Trump moved to dispel concerns about a new trade war between the U.S. and China.
Trump had publicly contradicted his trade advisor Peter Navarro late on Monday after Navarro told Fox News that the phase-one trade deal signed in January, under which the U.S. had suspended many of the import tariffs it had imposed over the previous 18 months, was ""over."" Trump said via Twitter the deal was ""fully intact.""
Data from the USDA and others suggest that China has fallen far short of its commitments under the deal to buy U.S. farm goods, as its own economic growth - and demand for commodities - has fallen far short of what it had expected before the coronavirus pandemic. As such, market participants interpreted Trump's intervention as less a statement of fact than an admission that there was no stomach for raising tariffs again - a measure that would hit U.S. consumers' spending power at a time when over 20 million are unemployed. 
By 9:45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 275 points, or 1.1% at 26,300, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.9%.
There was also better news from the economy: New home sales rose faster than expected in May to 676,000. Meanwhile, IHS Markit's purchasing manager index for June also rebounded more than expected to 49.6 from 39.8 in May.  Services in particular rebounded smartly as businesses started to re-emerge from lockdown. As with similar PMIs released earlier in Europe Tuesday, the figures still showed the economy contracting this month - albeit at a slower rate than in May. 
Among individual stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock marched to a new all-time high after the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference passed off without any major surprises. The company confirmed that it will start using its own chips in the next generation of laptops and Macs.  Bank stocks were also in favor, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) stock,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all rising over 2%. 
Elsewhere,  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 5.6% after the company priced its share offering at $13.50 a share, a discount of nearly 10% to Monday's closing price. The issue's pricing was hurt by the company's decision to increase its size to $2 billion from an originally envisaged $1.5 billion.
In other markets,Gold Futures hit an eight-year high as investors continued to price in currency debasement through a likely long period of ultra-low interest rates and asset purchases. By 10:15, gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were at $1,783.36, up 1.0% on the day.  U.S. Crude Oil futures, meanwhile, hit their highest level since early March on signs that OPEC's crackdown on quota-busting had had some effect. WTI was up 0.7% at $41.00 a barrel.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's flag carrier TAP is confident the European Commission will approve a restructuring plan that would allow the airline to avoid repaying a government-backed loan, its chief executive said on Tuesday. 
In April, TAP asked for help as the company, which usually operates around 2,500 flights per week, was forced to suspend almost all of them as demand for travel collapsed in the coronavirus pandemic. 
Earlier this month, the European Commission approved Portugal's plan for a 1.2 billion euro ($1.4 billion) rescue loan for TAP.
Rescue aid can be granted for a maximum of six months and authorities have committed that TAP will reimburse the loan or submit a restructuring plan in that time.
""We believe it is possible to send a restructuring plan to the European Commission that is accepted because we believe TAP has a viable business model,"" CEO Antonoaldo Neves told a parliamentary committee. 
""TAP has new planes, it has an extraordinary team,"" Neves added. ""Now it will be a long and hard recovery.""
TAP tried to resume some of its international operations last month as lockdown measures were slowly being lifted but, with little demand, the company took a step back.
""It is very difficult to predict the demand we will have in coming months,"" Neves said. ""We have done a process in which we place flights and withdraw flights, testing market demand."" 
TAP was partly privatised in 2015. Brazilian-U.S. airline entrepreneur David Neeleman holds a 45% stake, and the state 50%, with TAP employees holding the remaining 5%.
TAP ended last year with its best ever cash position despite a net annual loss of 106 million euros, but it has incurred heavy losses in recent months.
""The country must unite to save TAP from the pandemic,"" Neves said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed a potential $2 billion deal with U.S. biotech company Translate Bio (O:TBIO) to make vaccines, expanding their collaboration in development of an inoculation against COVID-19.
The deal strengthens Sanofi's credentials in a market engaged in a frantic race to find a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus disease that has killed more than 472,000 worldwide.
The companies said they would expand their partnership to develop a wide range of mRNA vaccines. The mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, an area of Translate Bio expertise, instructs human cells to make specific proteins that produce an immune response to a disease.
The deal will give Sanofi about 7.2% of Translate Bio and exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and sell infectious disease vaccines using the U.S. company's technology.
Sanofi expects its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate to enter clinical trials by the end of the year and, if successful, gain regulatory approval in the second half of 2021. 
The group is also working on another COVID-19 vaccine with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), targeting approval in the first half of next year.
Translate Bio, meanwhile, will receive an upfront payment of $425 million, comprising $300 million in cash and a common stock investment of $125 million through a private placement at $25.59 per share - a 57.6% premium to Monday's closing price of $16.24.
The U.S. biotech specialist will also be eligible for further potential milestone and other payments of up to $1.9 billion, the companies said.
The deal makes Sanofi its fourth-largest shareholder, Refinitiv data shows.
Sanofi last month sold most of its 20.6% stake in U.S. partner Regeneron (O:REGN) for more than $11 billion and said it would use the money for innovation and general growth, with financial sources telling Reuters they expected the group to engage in a series of smaller deals rather than a large acquisition.

Earlier Tuesday, the composite eurozone PMI hit a four-month high of 47.5, up from 31.9 in May and a record low below 14 in April, at the depths of the pandemic-driven lockdowns. That's still below the 50 reading that separates growth from contraction, however.
Additionally, new home sales for May are scheduled at 10 AM ET, and are expected to be 640,000, up 3.5% pn the month, compared with a gain of 0.6% the previous month.

The Italian spirits group said in February that it planned to move its registered office to Amsterdam and introduce an enhanced loyalty share scheme, in a move aimed at increasing merger and acquisition opportunities. But when the plan looked as though it might be derailed by a fall in Campari's share price due to the coronavirus crisis, leading shareholder Lagfin bought more than 30 million of its shares, which limited Campari's outlay for investors liquidating their shares to 5.2 million euros, it said on Tuesday.
This was below the 7 million to 8 million euros which the Campari board had deemed ""tolerable"", it added. As all conditions required for the domicile shift had been fulfilled, Campari said it had scrapped an extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for Friday to vote on the plan.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK) has picked investment bank Houlihan Lokey (N:HLI) as an adviser, according to sources close to the matter, following an accounting scandal that has seen the Chinese coffee chain's shares plummet and creditors pursue assets held by the firm's family.
Houlihan Lokey's remit will be to provide financial and strategic advice, one source said.
A Cayman Islands court last week granted lenders, led by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), a court order to wind up Primus Investments Fund and Mayer Investments Fund, entities holding shares in Luckin Coffee and ultimately controlled by the family of the coffee firm's Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu.
The lenders are seeking to recover about $324 million of outstanding debt, according to a Cayman Islands court filing.
Luckin's fortunes have crashed since an internal probe showed much of its 2019 sales was fabricated and overestimated by 2.2 billion yuan ($311.31 million).
Houlihan Lokey has experience with advising other companies in financial distress. It was last week appointed by troubled German tech firm Wirecard (DE:WDIG) to assess its options and is advising the founder of United Arab Emirates-based hospital operator NMC Health .
Luckin Coffee and Houlihan Lokey were not immediately available for comment.
Nasdaq-listed Luckin Coffee's shares fell 11% on Monday after IFR reported shareholders will vote to oust Lu and other directors at an extraordinary general meeting on July 5. The stock, which was halted from April 7 to May 19, has lost around 85% of its value since the probe was revealed.

1169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>","Ford Ranger, Tesla Models Ride High in ‘American-Made’ Car Index","(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s new Ranger truck topped a ranking of vehicles that contribute most to the U.S. economy, while three Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. models placed in the top nine.
The two companies’ brands were absent from Cars.com’s top 10 last year but stood out in the 2020 version of automotive site’s “American-Made Index.” Ford’s pickup and Tesla’s Model S, X and 3 all made their debut in the annual study.
“Tesla’s participation is one of the major developments this year,” said Kelsey Mays, senior editor of Cars.com. The electric-car maker fared well because it uses a lot of U.S.-sourced drivetrain components, and its U.S. vehicle assembly employs many workers, she said.
Honda Motor Co. matched Tesla with three vehicles in the top 10, but that was down from five last year. Honda’s Odyssey minivan, Ridgeline pickup and Passport SUV all are made in Lincoln, Alabama. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Jeep Cherokee took the No. 2 slot, dropping one place. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s Chevrolet Corvette was another repeat top-10 finisher, joined by the Chevy Colorado mid-size truck at No. 10.
The ranking is based on five criteria Cars.com has said aren’t equally weighed, including assembly location, parts sourcing as determined by the American Automobile Labeling Act, factory employment relative to sales and sourcing of engines and transmissions. Of the roughly 350 new vehicles on the market in the U.S., 91 qualified for inclusion in the index.
More than two-thirds of American consumers who responded to a May survey said they considered U.S. economic impact when shopping for a vehicle, according to Cars.com, essentially unchanged from last year. But 37% of respondents said the coronavirus outbreak will make them more likely to purchase a U.S.-made model, with just 4% replying they will be less likely to do so.
Domestic parts content also will become increasingly important under a new trade agreement the U.S. struck last year with Canada and Mexico to replace Nafta. Under President Donald Trump’s renegotiated deal, automakers must raise North American content to avoid tariffs. They also must abide by tighter minimum-wage standards for workers.

Automakers including Tesla, Ford, Honda and Fiat Chrysler will have an easier time meeting the new standards under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement than manufacturers that don’t build as many of their cars where they sell them, Mays said.
The new USMCA rules are set to go into effect July 1, but the U.S. is giving automakers five years to meet key requirements.

The bulk of staff at banks have been working from home since Britain introduced a lockdown in March to fight the pandemic.
It has highlighted potential savings in expensive London office space over the longer term, as working from home is expected to become more prevalent after the lockdown has shown that it can function effectively on a large scale.

LONDON (Reuters) - Grocery sales in Britain surged 18.9% in the four weeks to June 14, driven by the popularity of online and convenience stores during the coronavirus lockdown, industry data showed on Tuesday.
Online sales rose 91% year-on-year over the four weeks, market researcher Kantar said, reflecting a change in behaviour with nearly one in five British households now buying over the internet.
Convenience stores, be they independent retailers or the smaller formats of major supermarket groups such as  Tesco  (OTC:TSCDY) Express (L:TSCO) or  Sainsbury 's Local (L:SBRY), accounted for 14.7% of all sales in the four week period, Kantar said.
Rival market researcher Nielsen also highlighted the strong performance of convenience stores.
“We’re still shopping less frequently but shoppers are gradually changing their behaviour,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.
He noted that households made 77 million fewer trips to the supermarket in the latest four weeks compared with last year - 19 million more than in May, reflecting the slight easing of government restrictions.
Kantar said online grocer Ocado (L:OCDO), the Co-operative Group <42TE.L>, which has a network of local stores, and frozen food specialist Iceland, were the standout performers over the 12 weeks to June 14 with year-on-year sales growth of 42.2%, 34.5% and 31.4% respectively.
Of Britain's four major grocers, Kantar said market leader Tesco was the strongest performer with growth of 12.1%, followed by No. 4 Morrisons (L:MRW) on 10.5% and No. 2 Sainsbury's on 10.2%. Walmart-owned (N:WMT) Asda was again the laggard with growth of 6.3%.
As was the case in May, German-owned discounter Aldi lost market share. It fell to 7.5% from 7.9% this time last year. However, rival discounter Lidl saw its share edge up to 5.8%.
Kantar said UK grocery inflation was 4.0% for the 12-week period, with prices rising fastest in markets such as bacon, sausages and cooked meats while falling in poultry, bread and eggs.

1172,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 05:17AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Rallying on Two Head-Fakes,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets rallied on Tuesday morning on two separate factors, neither of which was particularly convincing.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.2% at 366.96, having earlier hit a two-week high. The German DAX index was up 1.9%, while the Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB were both up 1.5%.
The move was mostly due to a much sharper-than-expected rebound in IHS Markit's purchasing managers indexes for June, with France's index conspicuously popping back above the 50 level that traditionally separates growth from contraction.
The composite eurozone PMI hit a four-month high of 47.5, up from 31.9 in May and a record low below 14 in April, at the depths of the pandemic-driven lockdowns. The manufacturing index rebounded to 48.2 from 35.6, while the services index rose to 47.3 from 30.5. 
However, the trouble with the PMIs is that they are diffusion indexes. That is, they aggregate multiple indicators by asking whether they are trending upward or downward, but they ignore the extent of the movement. As such, they are generally better at indicating turning points in trends than absolute levels of activity. 
""Today’s PMIs for June are almost entirely worthless,"" said Panmure Gordon chief economist Simon French, via Twitter. ""Not a criticism of the data providers - simply that in such unprecedented circumstances any calibration across to output levels is impossible. The data is good for headlines and pretty charts - little else.""
IHS Markit did its best to put the numbers in context. The bottom line is that the eurozone economy is still contracting. IHS noted that jobs were cut and output and prices fell, even if at a much slower pace than before. After virtually every country in Europe lifted its lockdown measures at least partially in May, this relative improvement can't come as any surprise.  
""While the recovery may start in the third quarter, momentum could soon fade meaning it will likely take up to three years before the euro zone regains its pre-pandemic level of GDP,” IHS Markit's chief economist Chris Williamson said.
But in one regard at least, the indexes do provide a valuable test of sentiment. IHS noted that optimists outnumbered pessimists for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak began, with an unignorably large majority of respondents expecting output to increase in future. 
The trajectory for the economy may not be great, but it is at least comprehensible. 
That's more than can be said for the second factor behind Tuesday's upward move, namely, relief that the U.S. administration still wants to maintain the fiction of the 'phase 1' trade deal with China. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro told Fox News late on Monday that the deal was 'over', as China has not approached the level of purchases of U.S. products that it committed to before the pandemic. President Donald Trump himself had to take to Twitter to correct his advisor, saying the deal was still intact. Most analysts saw the intervention as purely tactical.
""The trade deal is most at risk in September and October,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management in a morning podcast. ""If U.S. President Trump imposed trade taxes then, the damage to U.S. companies and consumers would be felt after the election."""

investors expressed relief that the U.S.-China trade deal was still in place ahead of the latest business sentiment data.
At 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 1.4%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.8%.
The moves were driven largely by an upside surprise in purchasing manager indices for France and Germany for June, which showed both of Europe's two largest economies rebounding more quickly than expected.  The eurozone composite PMI rose to 47.5 from 31.9 in May, well above expectations for a reading of 42.4. The biggest improvement was notched by services, which had been slower to reopen from lockdown measures than the manufacturing sector.
Earlier, global stock markets had breathed a sigh of relief after U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the U.S.-China trade deal was ""fully intact"", contradicting his trade adviser Peter Navarro, who had told Fox News overnight that the trade deal with China was ""over"". 
Navarro’s comments had revived memories of the trade war between the two countries, which roiled financial markets and dented global growth before being partially settled with the first phase of an agreement in January.

Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, amid relief over the lessening of U.S.-China tension regarding the trade deal. China is one of the world’s biggest oil importers, and a trade war with the U.S. would likely stunt its demand.

It said Wirecard's primary business activities in Singapore are to process payments for merchants and help companies issue pre-paid cards. Wirecard is operating under an exemption until the new law comes into force.

Wirecard’s primary business activites in Singapore are to process payments for merchants and help companies issue pre-paid cards, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Tuesday in an emailed reply to questions.
“MAS has required Wirecard to ensure that they keep customer funds arising from these activities in banks in Singapore,” a MAS spokesperson said in the email.
Shares in the German firm have collapsed in recent days amid an accounting scandal and worries about Wirecard’s credit facilities.
The company on Monday acknowledged that 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) previously reported as assets probably doesn’t exist. Bank of China Ltd., China’s fourth-largest lender, may write off most of the 80 million euros ($90 million) it is owed and not extend the credit line, according to people familiar with the matter.
Wirecard entities in Singapore are not currently regulated by the MAS, though the central bank has received a license application from Wirecard under the new Payments Services Act, the regulator said.
The act provides for a grace period for entities conducting regulated activities to apply for a license, the MAS said. It may issue requirements to such entities during the grace period, it added.
Singapore is home to Wirecard’s Asia-Pacific headquarters and the company has been expanding aggressively in the region, which accounted for almost 45% of the group’s reported revenue in 2018, second only to Europe.
The company’s regional operations cover Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, according to its website.

1180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>","‘Nasdaq 1999’ Feel May Boost Even Humdrum Stocks, Cambiar Says","(Bloomberg) -- Investors shouldn’t count out the potential for more plain-vanilla stocks to rally, according to Cambiar Investors LLC.
In a normal year, the advice would probably be to sell 10% to 20% of one’s portfolio after such a big rally and just hold some cash, according to Chief Investment Officer Brian Barish. But the “nearly Argentinian levels” of growth in money supply, likely vaccines or treatments for Covid-19 and high levels of short interest means it is a bad idea to take too much out of the market.
“There is a ‘Nasdaq 1999’ feeling to certain stocks which are evidently worth billions but have never made money or even a physical product,” Barish said by email. “The presence of these doesn’t mean that old-school industrial companies should be sold. There are a lot of dollars out there willing to chase crazy stuff, and eventually these will find their way to more vanilla stocks.”
The S&P 500 is up 39% from its March 23 bottom, as the Federal Reserve and governments globally added stimulus to help counter the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. But there’s a wide dispersion in performance -- the Energy sector has soared 65% and Info Tech 48%, while Consumer Staples has gained 21%.
The rebound has fueled questions about whether valuations are too high. Still, Barish isn’t alone in seeing potential for selective gains -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s John Normand also recommended cross-asset investors get more choosy in the second half of 2020.
Barish said his stock-picking strategy, even in an atypical year, revolves around the basics: earnings, cash flow, pricing power and long term market position. “For a lot of these more speculative names, nobody has a clue of any of that.”

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Asian stocks climb after volatile trade on U.S.-China trade confusion,"By Swati Pandey and Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian equity markets bounced on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S.-China trade pact was ""fully intact"", clarifying earlier confusing statements from the White House over the fate of the deal.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan rose 0.72% to 517.1 points after earlier going as low as 509.9. Chinese shares regained lost ground too, with the blue-chip index last up 0.38%.
Jitters emerged early in the Asian day after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the trade deal with China was ""over"", linking the breakdown in part to Washington's anger over Beijing not sounding the alarm earlier about the coronavirus outbreak.
The statement prompted a selloff across equities markets but sentiment quickly recovered when Navarro, an outspoken critic of China, said his remarks had been taken out of context.
Trump also soothed nerves when he tweeted: ""China trade deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the agreement.""
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose about 1% in early afternoon trade, South Korea's KOSPI index added 0.54% and Japan's Nikkei jumped 0.8%.
Asian stocks have rallied hard since hitting a low in March amid worries about the jolt to the global economy from the coronavirus-driven shutdown.
Ord Minnett investment advisor John Milroy said equity market sentiment was positive despite ongoing bursts of volatility across regional markets.
""It's worth nothing our clients here have been net buyers since the depths of market despair,"" Milroy told Reuters from Sydney.
""I should think any pullback would be a catalyst for that pattern to resume, the conversations that I am having with clients is all about what to buy not what to sell.""
Safe-haven gold, which initially rose on Navarro's remarks, sold off on the clarification, while risk sensitive currencies staged a recovery.
""The saving grace for markets is liquidity, which is in abundance and will offer a backstop as the bulls and bears stage a tussle and cause market volatility,"" said Vasu Menon, Singapore-based senior investment strategist at OCBC Bank Wealth Management.
Menon expects U.S.-China tensions to escalate in the run-up to the U.S. elections.
""So expect markets to be very bumpy in second half of this year because of the double whammy from COVID-19 and U.S.-China tensions.""
China on Tuesday reported 22 new coronavirus cases, of which 13 were located in the capital, and the city's government has started to restrict people from moving to help contain the outbreak. 
New infections have spiked in Latin America, Brazil in particular, while New York City, the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak, eased restrictions after 100 days of lockdown.
In the Asian afternoon trading session, the safe-haven yen slipped against the dollar to 107.13, while the euro was a shade higher at $1.1266.
The risk sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.1% at $0.6910. Its kiwi counterpart was marginally weaker at $0.6472.
In commodities, U.S. crude fell 0.22%, or 13 cents, to $40.64 a barrel, while Brent was down 13 cents at $43.07.
As investors piled on equities, spot gold was relatively flat at $1,754.52 an ounce after trading down by up to 0.2%.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open just higher Tuesday, continuing the recent positive tone despite some volatile trading in Asia over a U.S.-China trade misunderstanding.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
Stock markets in Asia breathed a sigh of relief after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the U.S.-China trade deal was ""fully intact"", contradicting the impression his trade adviser Peter Navarro had made when he said the trade deal with China was ""over"". 
Navarro’s comments had revived memories of the trade war between the two countries, which roiled financial markets and dented global growth before being partially settled with the first phase of an agreement in January.
Stocks in Europe have rallied hard since hitting a low in March, when economies were shut down to fight the coronavirus. The gains have been driven by hefty central bank stimulus around the globe and gradual easing of restrictions, although worries about a second wave have kept investors jittery.
Economic indicators will center around the closely-watched June PMI data for the European region Tuesday. The PMI data for May, while better than April, showed that the manufacturing and service sectors were still deep in contraction territory. Some improvement is expected as the region’s services sectors catch up a little with manufacturing in the reopening process.
In corporate news,  Intu Properties  (LON:INTUP) is likely to be in focus after the owner of shopping malls in the U.K. and Spain had appointed KPMG to contingency plan for administration in the event it doesn’t receive needed financial backing.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, amid worries that an escalation of U.S.-China tension threatens a delay in the global economic recovery. China is one of the world’s biggest oil importers, and a trade war with the U.S. would likely stunt its economic growth.
Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its own data on crude oil and product inventories. Those numbers come in advance of government figures that are usually released on Wednesday.
At 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $40.46 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $42.86.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,763.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1263, up 0.1%.

Investing.com – Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) has sold a part of its stake in carrier T-Mobile for $21 billion after suffering record losses in its Vision Fund, it said on Tuesday.
Alongside plans announced in May to divest a 5% stake in its Japanese wireless subsidiary Softbank Corp, the T-Mobile sale is part of the Japanese company's $42 billion push to divest assets in order to pay down debt as well as finance stock buybacks.
SoftBank “needs to further enhance its cash reserves,” according to a statement on Tuesday,  which also cited concerns for “a second and third wave of spread of COVID-19.” The statement added that the company may invest the proceeds in high-quality securities until they are used for buybacks or debt reductions.
The company acquired the T-Mobile stake earlier in the year, after T-Mobile's $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp was approved by U.S. regulators. Meanwhile, T-Mobile separately announced on Tuesday that it would hold a public offering of 133.5 million common shares.

Conflicted remuneration relates to any benefit, whether monetary or non-monetary, given to an Australian financial services licensee who provides financial product advice to individuals.
More than A$22 million ($15.22 million) in conflicted remuneration was paid by Colonial First State Investments Ltd (CFSIL) to CBA for the distribution of its Essential Super plan between July 2013 and June 2019, said the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
ASIC said it is seeking civil penalties against both CBA and CFSIL, adding that each contravention attracts a maximum civil penalty of up to A$1 million for both CBA and CFSIL.
""This investigation is related to a Royal Commission referral to ASIC arising from the superannuation round of the hearings,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Daniel Crennan QC said in a statement.
The Royal Commission inquiry https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-banks-inquiry/australia-vows-to-clean-up-financial-sector-after-landmark-misconduct-inquiry-idUSKCN1PT099#:~:text=Australia%20vows%20to%20clean%20up%20financial%20sector%20after%20landmark%20misconduct%20inquiry,-Jonathan%20Barrett%2C%20Swati&text=Regulators%20will%20be%20subjected%20to,the%20so-called%20Royal%20Commission uncovered widespread misconduct in the financial services industry, including charging customers for service not rendered and the deception of regulators.
CBA on Monday acknowledged the proceedings brought by ASIC and said CFSIL and CBA are reviewing ASIC's claim.
CBA, the country's biggest lender, in May sold 55% of CFSIL to private equity giant KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) for A$1.7 billion. The transaction is expected to completed in the first half of 2021.
In March, ASIC filed a civil lawsuit against CFSIL for deceptive product communication between March 2014 and August 2016, hindering customers of the FirstChoice Fund from transitioning to the cheaper MySuper fund.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Tuesday morning, with some recovering their earlier losses after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that the U.S.’s trade deal with China is “over”. 
Investors breathed a huge sigh of relief after both Navarro and U.S. President Donald Trump clarified that phase one of the U.S.-China deal, agreed upon earlier in the year, was still intact.
But some investors are keeping a wary eye on the simmering tensions.
“Geopolitics are coming to the fore now once again...we are seeing the switch flipped back to risk off,” Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte., told Bloomberg.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.11% by 11:21 PM ET (4:21 AM GMT), and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.12%. Both indexes clawed back their earlier losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 0.86%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.11% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.54%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.21%.
Before Navarro’s comments, stocks had been set to gain in Asia as markets opened after Wall Street came off a stellar session on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite enjoyed its longest rally so far this year with a seventh straight advance.
Positive outlooks from some influential investors had also boosted investor sentiment. Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman told Bloomberg that the U.S. economy will likely benefit from a V-type recovery over the next few months, although he warned that it would take “quite a while” to return to 2019 levels."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - More than 1,600 workers at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc are petitioning its Google unit to stop selling email and other services to police departments, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The workers in a petition seen by Reuters expressed disappointment with Google not joining the ""millions who want to defang and defund"" police departments. Civil rights activists across the United States for years have called for scaling back traditional policing, and the efforts have gained momentum through protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody last month.
""We should not be in the business of profiting from racist policing,"" the Google petition said. It cited sales of the company's G Suite package, which includes tools for email, document editing and file storage, to the police department in Clarkstown, New York.
A Google spokesperson told Reuters in response, ""We have longstanding terms of use for generally available computing platforms like Gmail, G Suite and Google Cloud Platform, and these products will remain available for governments and local authorities, including police departments, to use.""
Clarkstown police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Google has faced internal criticism in the past over sales and partnerships involving the U.S. military, as well as foreign governments seen by human rights activists as authoritarian. 
While the company has pulled back from some deals like facial recognition, it has responded to concerns by saying it remains committed to helping governments with cybersecurity and other issues.

""We're committed to work that makes a meaningful difference to combat systemic racism, and our employees have made over 500 product suggestions in recent weeks, which we are reviewing,"" the spokesperson added.

Volkswagen last Tuesday began sending workers in reduced numbers back to its factory in the city of Puebla, where the German automaker and its luxury brand unit Audi (DE:NSUG) have major plants. 
Many other major carmakers, especially from the United States and Japan, had resumed operations in other parts of Mexico a couple of weeks earlier.
The state of Puebla, however, has been one of the parts of Mexico worst hit by the coronavirus and had delayed reopening factories. 
Volkswagen, which has tested staff extensively for COVID-19 infections and coronavirus antibodies, said staff who tested positive had contracted coronavirus during the period after the plants had shut in late March and before resuming work.
About 45% of the company's 11,364 workers and collaborators had been tested and nearly 2% had contracted the virus, the company said in a statement, equivalent to about 100 workers.
Mexico has become one of the world's main coronavirus hotspots, with the Latin American nation on Monday reporting 4,577 new infections and 759 additional deaths.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been criticised for permitting factories to reopen too soon, with few signs that the number of deaths or infections was easing up.
Volkswagen added that the plant in ""coming days will remain focused on training and preparation for the start of manufacturing.""

The transaction, along with a plan to sell a 5% stake in its Japanese wireless subsidiary, is part of a broader $42 billion push by SoftBank to unload assets to finance stock buybacks and pay down debt. Masayoshi Son, the company’s founder, is dealing with steep losses in his Vision Fund after writing down the value of investments in the sharing economy from WeWork to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
SoftBank’s shares gained as much as 3% in Tokyo. The Japanese investment giant will now turn its attention to other assets in its portfolio and may pursue an outright sale of part of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Son has said $11.5 billion raised from issuing contracts to sell stock in Asia’s largest corporation was a first step toward unwinding more of its holdings.
SoftBank “needs to further enhance its cash reserves,” the Japanese company said in a statement on Tuesday, citing concerns for “a second and third wave of spread of Covid-19.” The company may invest the proceeds in high-quality securities until they are used for buybacks or debt reductions, it added.

As part of a complex series of transactions unveiled Tuesday, T-Mobile will hold a public offering of 133.5 million shares of its common stock, the carrier said in a statement. It also will grant the underwriters 10 million shares. Additionally, T-Mobile intends to sell as many as 30 million common shares to a Delaware statutory trust.
Five million shares will be sold to an entity controlled by Marcelo Claure, a SoftBank executive and T-Mobile board member, with funding coming from SoftBank. And T-Mobile will have the right to buy almost 20 million shares. Altogether, as many as 198.3 million shares owned by SoftBank will be transferred.
SoftBank secured the stake in T-Mobile US just this year, after U.S. regulators approved the American wireless carrier’s $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp. T-Mobile’s market value is about $132 billion.

T-Mobile stock closed at $106.60 Monday in New York, putting the value of the 198 million shares at about $21 billion. They had been up 36% this year through Monday’s close.
Both companies had said earlier they are discussing a possible deal. Even before the transaction, Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) was the controlling shareholder of T-Mobile due to how voting rights were structured following the Sprint deal.
The stock offering, due to trade June 24, will be overseen by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc.

1190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",Tyson’s Virus Transparency Made It Vulnerable to China Ban,"(Bloomberg) --  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN). is the only major U.S. meat company still regularly releasing results as it conducts coronavirus testing for employees. It’s also the only American meat producer to see China slap a ban on some of its shipments.
On Sunday, China said customs would seize any shipments from a Tyson poultry plant in Arkansas after the company reported two days earlier that 13% of the facility’s workforce tested positive for Covid-19. The move has raised a lot of questions for the meat industry, including whether this will be a one-off action or the signal of a shifting stance from Beijing.
If China starts to routinely implement this type of halt for plants with positive Covid-19 cases, it also raises the question of whether companies will continue to publicly announce testing results.
China’s export suspension could discourage meat companies from being transparent about test results, said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council in Atlanta.
China Blocks Tyson Poultry, Stoking Fear Over Global Exports
Tyson said Sunday it was looking into the reports on China’s action, and a spokesman on Monday said the company didn’t have more to add, while citing the company has been among the most transparent among major American food producers.
Unions and labor groups have repeatedly called for increased testing as a key part of what’s needed to keep employees safe at meat plants, where thousands of workers have fallen sick with coronavirus. The groups have also said that transparency is needed on case counts.
A German pork exporter has also voluntarily suspended meat shipments to China after a virus outbreak, the Asian country’s customs authority said last week.
If China’s export ban spooks companies from releasing testing data, it could be a further step back for ensuring worker safety after dozens of employees at meat plants died from the virus over the past several months.
The halt on Tyson shipments stands out because it’s hardly the only meat company with virus cases -- it’s just the only one continuously releasing data on testing.
“Tyson should not have been cited for putting worker safety first or for its transparency in acknowledging that it has taken actions to quarantine workers at their Arkansas facility,” Sumner said in an email.

Shares in Wichita-based Spirit, which builds the fuselage, thrust reversers, engine pylons and wing components for the 737 MAX, fell about 4% in after-hours trading. 
Boeing has asked the aero parts maker to substantially reduce 737 production this year, and Spirit warned that further suspensions or cuts may have a ""material adverse"" effect on its financial condition.
The company said it now expects to deliver only 72 shipsets - or complete sets of parts - to Boeing, compared with 125 planned earlier.
""Given the substantial production plan reduction, Spirit could breach the financial covenants under its credit agreement in the fourth quarter of 2020 without an amendment or waiver,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.
A Boeing spokesman said the U.S. planemaker was working closely with Spirit to adjust delivery schedules and production rate profiles as appropriate. 
Spirit's profits were already under pressure after Boeing halted production of its once best-selling 737 MAX in January. The jet was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people five months apart. 
Earlier this year, Spirit reached a deal with Boeing to make 216 shipsets in 2020, but that was cut down to 125 shipsets in May, as the coronavirus crisis hammered international air travel and several airlines started deferring deliveries of planes.
As a result, Spirit has been forced to cut thousands of jobs and reduce its quarterly dividend by 90% to just 1 cent per share.

The company had already delivered 35 737 shipsets to Boeing as of June 19, and expects to produce and deliver the remaining 37 shipsets over the rest of the year.

Key metrics including manufacturing profits, capital expenditures and retail sales volumes remained at historically low levels and barely improved from those in the first quarter, CBB International said in a quarterly report based on a survey of more than 3,300 firms.
The retail sector fared the worst, with revenues and profits extending sharp falls. A steep decline in credit costs seemingly didn’t encourage struggling retailers to borrow, signaling continued weakness in the sector. In contrast, the manufacturing sector expanded over the first quarter and services sector performed the best.
Sluggish global demand remained a key drag on growth, with regions more internationally exposed performing worse, while interior regions received a boost from a marked rebound in domestic orders, according to the report.
“The eventual return to growth does not mean a return to anything approaching the old levels of growth,” the firm said in its quarterly report on China’s economy. “Until and unless global demand recovers more forcefully, the incremental quarterly improvement just seen will make for a contraction for full-year 2020.”
That pessimistic view contrasts with the outlook of most economists and the government, who all expect the economy to return to growth this quarter and to expand this year.
China’s Slow Reboot Points to Hard Road Back for Global Economy
The latest official data showed China’s economy continued to inch out of the coronavirus slump in May, driven by a recovery in industry amid sluggish consumer demand. China’s economy contracted 6.8% in the first quarter.
The report was based on 3,304 interviews conducted in China mid-May to mid-June. Official gross domestic product data for the second quarter is due for release on July 16.

The company will refocus on government contracts and technology businesses, Chief Executive Stuart Bradie wrote to employees on Monday. It will ""no longer engage in lump sum, blue collar construction services,"" saying the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the decision to leave fixed-contract energy projects.
KBR held contracts for engineering and construction services for several LNG projects, including at Freeport LNG in Texas, Pieridae Energy Ltd's proposed Goldboro LNG facility in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Glenfarne Group's Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana. 
Freeport LNG has delayed its project to 2021 and planned to seek new bids for construction, spokeswoman Heather Browne said. Pieridae and Glenfarne did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.
KBR declined to discuss potential impairments on its current LNG projects, but pointed to an investor webcast last Tuesday that said it expected the energy business to be ""marginally profitable"" this year. It will disclose more details with second-quarter results next month, an executive said in the webcast. 
About 85% of the company's forecast earnings for 2020 are expected to derive from government business, up from about 11% in 2015, Bradie told investors during the call.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Monday urged a judge to keep a former Green Beret and his son locked up as Japan prepares to formally seek their extradition on charges that they helped former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) boss Carlos Ghosn flee the East Asian country.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Hassink argued during a virtual hearing that Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, have a ""clear and present reason to flee"" after being accused of helping Ghosn, who faces financial misconduct charges in Japan.
""They're actually some of the best defendants that I’m sure this court has seen positioned to actually succeed in that flight,"" Hassink said.
He argued the men, who have been held without bail since being arrested in Massachusetts last month, helped smuggle Ghosn out of Japan in a box on Dec. 29, 2019. Ghosn then allegedly fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn, Nissan's former chief executive, was charged with engaging in financial wrongdoing by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.
The Taylors' lawyers countered that had they wished to avoid prosecution they could have remained in Lebanon, where they were when Japan in January said it would seek their arrest, rather than return to Massachusetts.
""If he's an expert of escape, he would not have returned to the United States,"" Robert Sheketoff, a lawyer for Michael Taylor, argued.
He and other defense lawyers argued the case against their clients was flawed and that Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and private security specialist, is at heightened risk of complications from COVID-19, which could spread in the jail.
The hearing itself was held through a Zoom videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell said he hoped to rule ""as quickly as I can.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Monday with the biggest gains in technology stocks as investors focused on the potential for more government stimulus measures even as they worried about an increase in coronavirus cases in the United States and other countries. 
Nasdaq registered its fourth record closing high this month with the biggest boosts from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The World Health Organization reported a record rise in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, driving demand for perceived safe havens including gold and longer-term U.S. Treasuries. [US/][GOL/]
While New York City on Monday celebrated the lifting of many coronavirus restrictions, a dozen states in the U.S. South and Southwest reported record increases in new cases with 10% to 20% of people testing positive in some.
However White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that there was no second wave of the pandemic and that it is unlikely there will be widespread shutdowns across the country.
Investors were also clinging to hopes for more government stimulus after U.S. House of Representatives Democrats on Thursday unveiled a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill in the same week that reports emerged of preparations by the Trump administration for an infrastructure stimulus plan.
""The good news from last week is dominating the bad news from today, which is the increase in COVID cases,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones, who cautioned that government infrastructure spending plans have failed to become reality several times in the recent past.
Richardson said rising virus case numbers spurred a rotation out of sectors hit hardest by coronavirus' economic impacts into more resilient sectors such as technology. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he supported the idea of giving Americans a second round of financial aid because of the virus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.5 points, or 0.59%, to 26,024.96, the S&P 500 gained 20.12 points, or 0.65%, to 3,117.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 110.35 points, or 1.11%, to 10,056.48.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors, technology was leading the pack. However the next biggest gainer was the defensive utilities sector.
The market took a step back on Friday after Apple Inc's move to temporarily shut some U.S. stores again underscored concerns of a delay in the recovery.
But Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed on Monday and trading at record highs as the company announced new products at its annual conference for software developers. 
Travel-related stocks were some of the weakest as those companies have been hit hard in the past by lockdowns. 
The S&P 1500 airlines index dropped 1.3%, while shares of cruise operators Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises dropped 6%.
U.S.-based meat processor Tyson Inc slipped 2.8% as China's customs authority suspended imports of poultry products from a plant owned by the company that had been hit by the coronavirus.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc fell almost 7% as it planned to secure $3.5 billion in new financing by selling shares and convertible senior notes to boost liquidity.
Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc soared just under 16% as it signed up with NASA to develop a program to promote private missions to the International Space Station.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and nine new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges 10.66 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.29 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

A federal judge in Sacramento on Monday granted Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s request to block the state from requiring the company or any businesses from providing a ""clear and reasonable warning before exposing any individual to glyphosate,"" the report said https://bloom.bg/2YUijv0.
Bayer did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Bayer, which acquired Roundup manufacturer  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in a $63 billion deal in 2018, to date has faced three juries over claims that Roundup causes cancer.

The company has denied the allegations made by more than 42,700 plaintiffs in the United States, saying decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use.

Investing.com - Tesla is not expected to start production of its Cybertruck until late-2021, but early signs of strong demand for the company's electric pickup are already beginning to emerge, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended the day down 0.66%, and was largely flat in after-market hours.
""We estimate that pre-order levels are staggering coming out of the gates since announced last year and currently stand north of 650,000 based on our estimate with momentum,"" Ives said. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), the leader in the pick-up truck market, sells roughly 1 million F-150 pickups per year.
The initial Cybertruck will be sold in three models: a single motor version with battery range of 250+ miles (base model), a dual motor version with a battery version of 300+ miles starting at $49,900 and a trifecta-motor version with a range of 500+ miles which starts at $69,900, Ives added.
In a sign of sufficient demand for its Cybertrack, Tesla would need to meet the 175,000-to-200,000 unit threshold in its first full year of deliveries, which will likely be 2022, the firm added.
Given the strong level of initial demand, however, investor focus will shift to which location Tesla will choose for its Cybertruck production, Ives added. Austin, Texas, is likely the front runner, though Tulsa, Oklahoma, is also in the running."

Citing a doubling in the positive-test rate to almost 9%, as well as surges in new cases and hospitalizations, Abbott on Monday urged residents of the second-most populous U.S. state to voluntarily wear masks and take other precautions.
Abbott’s remarks underscore a political quandary in Republican-led states that were among the vanguard in reopening across the U.S. While Covid-19 cases are rising, and events like President Donald Trump’s weekend rally in Oklahoma sow additional concern about more infections, the GOP governors’ all-in embrace of ending lockdowns makes it difficult to start reapplying restrictions to public life.
The outbreak is accelerating at “an unacceptable rate and it must be corralled,” Abbott said during a media briefing. “If those spikes continue, additional measures are going to be necessary.”
Abbott said he’s stopping short of decreeing unspecified “stronger measures” because hospitals still have ample bed capacity for Covid-19 patients. But if positivity rates and hospitalizations should double in the next few weeks, the situation would be “urgent” enough for him to reconsider.
“Closing down Texas again will always be the last option,” Abbott said.​
​Texas’s positive-test rate climbed to to 8.94% on June 19, the highest since April 21, according to state health department data. Hospitalizations have more than doubled this month to 3,409 as of Sunday, the most-recent data available.
Although Abbott focused on voluntary measures he urged individuals to take -- such as avoiding crowds when possible -- he said state regulators have begun shutting taverns that weren’t enforcing social distancing. County leaders in several of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas recently began mandating that businesses require customers to mask up.

Investing.com -- Big tech stocks led the market higher to start the week as investors weighed the positive aspects of business reopenings across the U.S. with continued evidence that new coronavirus cases are rising in many states.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a widely followed stock owned by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb), helped lead the gains along with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Meanwhile, retailers got a boost as malls and stores reopened, while airline stocks fell.
Data on manufacturing and new home sales are due out on Tuesday, along with industry data on crude oil and related inventories. Investors will be looking for signs the Covid-19 recovery is revitalizing business.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Watching for Signs of Health in Manufacturing and Services Sectors
Manufacturing PMI for June is scheduled to be reported Tuesday at 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT). Analysts followed by Investing.com are looking for a reading of 48, up from 39.8 the prior month. Services PMI expected to be 46.5, up from 37.5.
PMI, which stands for Purchasing Managers' Index, measures the activity level of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector. It is seen as a leading indicator of overall economic performance. Services PMI sectors cover transport and communication, financial, business and personal services, computing, hotels and restaurants.
2. Watching for Signs of Health in Real Estate
New home sales are scheduled to be reported at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). They are expected to be up 3.5% for the month of May, or 640,000 compared to a gain of 0.6% the previous month.
Existing home sales, which were released on Monday, came in around 3.9 million, below expectations and down from more than 4 million the prior month.
3. Crude oil Inventories Provide a Glimpse of Demand
American Petroleum Institute will release its own data on crude oil and product inventories on Tuesday at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT). Those numbers come in advance of government figures that are usually released on Wednesday morning.

Investing.com – The Dow started the week on the front foot on Monday, powered by tech as investors continued to favor growth stocks in the wake of the rising Covid-19 infections.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.59%, or 151 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.11% to close at another record high.
As coronavirus infections worldwide mount, investors continued to bet that large-cap tech stocks are better placed to weather any potential disruptions to the economic reopening, and eventual recovery.
FAANG led the move higher in tech, powered by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as Wall Street continued to back the tech giant. Cowen lifted its price target on Apple to $400 from $335, after raising its forecast for iPhone shipments ahead of the company's launch of a 5G iPhone later this fall.
At its worldwide developer conference, which kicked off earlier today, Apple officially announced it will move away from using Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac to ARM chips -- a move which likely paves the way for the company to take ""more control around its chips and architecture and crown jewels hardware ecosystem moving forward,"" Wedbush in a note.
The World Health Organization announced more than 183,000 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, with parts of the U.S. recording a daily record for new infections since the start of the pandemic.
Florida reported 2,926 new cases on Monday morning, taking its toll of new infections above 100,000 after governments nationwide eased public health restrictions. Other hotspots including Texas and Arizona have also put many on high alert.
""To state the obvious, Covid-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas,"" said Texas Governor Gregg Abbott, following an average of more than 3,500 new cases a day reported in the state.
The climb in tech, however, helped the broader market offset weakness in travel and tourism stocks. Airlines and cruise companies, in particular, were shunned as the rise of infections, which threatens the pace of economic reopening, raised doubt over a rebound in travel demand.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 0.79%, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) was down 0.75%, while  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) slumped 6.75% after it announced plans to raise $3.5 billion in new financing.
TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) clawed back losses to end flat despite warning that revenue in June will be just a fifth of revenue reported in the same period a year earlier.
Energy, meanwhile, also pushed the broader market higher, buoyed by higher oil prices as global oil producers tighten supply.
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE:SPCE) surged 16% after it reached a deal with NASA to train astronauts for trips to the International Space Station.
On the economic front, existing home sales for May fell short of economists forecast, but analysts downplayed the data.  
""The declines were broad-based, but we wouldn't make too much of this data point, which is very backward looking,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""(A)ll forward-looking indicators paint a very constructive picture for housing in the months ahead."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submitted an amended rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday in a bid to enable companies that debut on the stock market through a direct listing to raise capital.
The move has the potential to transform the market for initial public offerings (IPOs), which are arranged by investment banks acting as underwriters rather than allowing companies to sell shares directly to investors.
The SEC declined an earlier request by NYSE in December to allow companies going public through direct listings to sell stock. It did not disclose the reasons for its decision at the time. 
""We want to provide (companies) what is arguably a more efficient pricing mechanism for their IPO,"" NYSE Vice Chairman and Chief Commercial Officer John Tuttle said in an interview. 
""While the current IPO works for many companies, we want to create an additional option that could arguably allow for more efficient pricing,"" Tuttle added. 
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In its latest submission, NYSE laid out in detail a mechanism for the first trade under a capital-raising direct listing, including how a floor price for the shares would be set.
NYSE also dropped a proposal for the SEC to waive a requirement that companies have at least 400 shareholders of so-called round lots at the time of the listing. 
""With the IPO market surging as it is right now, the time is ripe to further advance this option,"" Tuttle said. 
Some 56 companies have gone public in the United States so far this year, raising $18.4 billion, compared to 160 companies raising $46.3 billion in all of 2019, according to Renaissance Capital. The IPO market was largely subdued for two months earlier this year due to the coronavirus outbreak but activity has rebounded in recent weeks. 
Several venture capital investors, including Benchmark's Bill Gurley, have criticized the traditional IPO structure, arguing it allows banks to sell stock at a discount to their clients, who can then reap large gains when the stock begins trading. 

The SEC already allows direct listings for companies that do not raise capital in the process. In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) was the first major company to go public through a direct listing.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday pushed back against pressure from airlines to reopen the nation's borders, saying moving too quickly could spark a second wave of the coronavirus.
""I understand there are a lot of tourism firms and airlines who would like us to be able to once again to welcome tourists,"" Trudeau told a daily briefing.
""But these people all need to understand that if we take steps too quickly, if we are not sure of what we're doing at each stage, we risk hitting a second wave ... and having to close our economy again.""
Last week, a group of 27 leading executives added to calls for looser air travel restrictions in a open letter published in the Globe and Mail newspaper.
A senior official with Air Canada - the country's largest airline - urged the government on Monday to quickly reopen borders and dilute quarantine requirements, citing what other nations were doing.
""Otherwise our sector and the Canadian economy will suffer far longer than it needs to,"" Ferio Pugliese, senior vice president of government relations, told the House of Commons health committee.
Air Canada said in mid-May it had decided to reduce its workforce by up to 60%.
Canada and the United States last week extended a ban on non-essential travel to late July. Washington and Ottawa introduced month-long restrictions in March and renewed them in April and May.
""I understand how difficult this is and how frustrating this is for some people but ... we are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders,"" Trudeau said.
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters later on Monday that ""airlines are going to take longer to come back than some other parts of the economy"".

But that’s what’s happening.
As American companies retreat from buying their own shares to preserve cash during the coronavirus pandemic, retail investors are being lured by a flood of economic stimulus. Net corporate-demand will plunge 80% to $100 billion this year as firms step up equity selling, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). That’s about one third of the amount of purchases expected from either U.S. household or international investors.
“Broker data show a surge in retail equity trading activity,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note to clients. “Foreign investors and households will supplant corporations as the largest 2020 source of U.S. equity demand.”
That’s a turnaround from the previous four years, when companies spent more than $2 trillion buying back their stocks, dwarfing every other category of investors, according to Federal Reserve data compiled by Goldman. While the analysis of equity holdings by household investors also includes hedge funds, the firm put a spotlight on the role that retail traders have played in the S&P 500’s nearly 40% surge from its March bottom.
The fear-of-missing-out has been fueling buying by day traders, such as those on the commission-free brokerage Robinhood, who pounce on companies with little or no profit and send their stock price surging. With mom-and-pop investors opening record numbers of new trading accounts, Wall Street pros are trying to figure out to what degree retail appetite has become a self-fulfilling prophecy in many parts of the market and what risks it poses to the rally.
While Kostin says the participation of individual investors would be a big driver of equity demand this year, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson suggests the focus on their contribution is overdone.

Despite a surge in retail account openings, their actual dollar flows are probably small, Wilson said in a note to clients, adding that Morgan Stanley’s wealthy clients still hold new-record cash levels and show “little in the way of outsized risk appetite or speculative behavior.”
“The data supporting the ‘retail driving the rally’ is incomplete, circumstantial and tends to leave out some important considerations,” Wilson wrote. “There is surely some impact but this is more at the stock than the market level.”
To Goldman’s Kostin, his team’s prediction on robust retail inflows isn’t without caveat.
“The pace of viral spread and path of economic normalization will be key determinants of household equity flows,” Kostin said. “In addition, political uncertainty, particularly regarding personal tax rates, represents a risk to our forecast.”

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>","Apple launches phone-based car keys, new features at developer conference","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Monday announced a system to let iPhone owners unlock and start cars with their devices at its annual conference for software developers.
The new system, which also lets users share digital car keys with friends and family members via the company's iMessage system, will work with BMW (DE:BMWG) 5 Series vehicles that will ship next month, Apple said in a virtual keynote filmed at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. 
The system will work with phones running the current iOS 13 operating system so that owners can start using it when BMW vehicles arrive. Apple said more cars that work with the system will come to market next year.
Apple also updated its mapping application with information about electric vehicle charging stations, working with BMW and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) to show stations compatible with the user's vehicle.
The automotive announcements came at an annual conference where Apple was expected to signal a departure from  Intel Corp 's (O:INTC) almost 15-year run supplying Mac computer processors.
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference comes as paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the Cupertino, California, company's revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple's mobile devices.
Those fees, and Apple's strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company.
But developers still gravitate toward Apple's platform because it is lucrative, with a user base that is willing to spend money on paid apps. The annual developer conference, being held online this year for the first time because of the novel coronavirus, is where Apple often announces access to new hardware capabilities, such as special tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
Apple this year could announce a move to part ways with Intel, which has supplied processors for Mac computers since 2006. Apple could announce a move to use its own house-designed processors as soon as Monday, two people familiar with matter told Reuters. The company, which already uses its own processor designs in iPhones in iPads, could announce one laptop model and one desktop model that will use the new chips, one of the people told Reuters.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's future plans or products.

If Apple announces the move Monday, it will build on a tool it introduced last year called Catalyst, which aims to make it easier for developers to move their apps from Apple's mobile operating systems to Mac computers.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Dior revives fashion shows - but with no front row,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury label Christian Dior said on Monday it would press ahead with a calendar of fashion shows for this year starting in July with an Italian catwalk display - but without the celebrated front-row audience of A-listers.
The coronavirus crisis has accelerated a rethink among high-end brands of how collections are presented, with some opting out of costly events and restricting the number of clothing ranges they produce.
Dior, one of the LVMH conglomerate's biggest labels, said it was maintaining its calendar of industry fashion weeks that brings buyers and bloggers to Paris, and would produce other collections in between. 
It will premiere a mid-season ""cruise"" range in the Italian city of Lecce on July 22 with a streamed live show, Chief Executive Pietro Beccari said, after a presentation planned for May was postponed. 
""We would like to send a message of support, of hope, of optimism and of rebirth,"" Beccari said. ""I'm thinking about big suppliers but also the small ones, many tiny family businesses of artisans in France and in Italy ... many of them didn't know and still do not know how to survive.""
High-end brands often rely on firms to manufacture luxurious cloth or products that require special treatment, such as items covered in feathers or tinted by hand. 
Dior planned to go ahead with a womenswear fashion show usually held in Paris in September, Beccari said, adding that by then it might even bring in a front-row audience. 
""Fashion week is important not only for the fashion family, it's also important for the city where the shows are,"" Dior's designer Maria Grazia Chiuri said. 

Fashion events are usually big business for cities like Paris, with hotels normally rammed during that period.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Carnival extends operations pause as cruise industry troubles persist,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Cruise Line said on Monday it has extended its pause in operations for North American voyages until Sept. 30, as it determines how to safely resume service amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The cruise line, owned by Carnival Corp (N:CCL), had previously said it would resume some voyages on Aug. 1.
Industry trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said on Friday its ocean-going cruise line members, which include Carnival,  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL), and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH), would voluntarily extend their pause in operations from U.S. ports until Sept. 15.
The cruise industry has taken a major hit from the novel coronavirus pandemic, with some of the earliest large clusters of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, occurring aboard cruise ships in which thousands of passengers and crew were packed in tight quarters. 
On March 14 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a no-sail order for all cruise ships, which it subsequently extended to July 24.
To survive for months without revenue, the companies have issued debt and pursued additional funding. In May, Norwegian completed a $2.4 billion fundraising through debt and equity offerings. Norwegian Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio told Reuters at that time that the $3.5 billion in cash that the company had on hand would be enough to bankroll it for ""at least 18 months"" without new revenue.
In April, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), disclosed an 8.2% stake in Carnival Corp.
The major cruise operators are not eligible to receive funding from the CARES Act, which was passed by Congress in March to address the economic fallout from the pandemic, because they are incorporated outside of the United States. 

Amid worldwide travel restrictions, operators have struggled to repatriate foreign workers living aboard idled ships.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 12:51PM ET</span>",EU warns of competition concerns over LSE's $27 billion bid for Refinitiv,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators on Monday warned about the possible anti-competitive effects of the London Stock Exchange's $27 billion bid for data and analytics company Refinitiv as they launched a four-month investigation into the deal.
LSE announced the proposed acquisition last year which will broaden its trading business and make it a major distributor and creator of market data, a profitable and fast growing sector. It will also make it a rival to Bloomberg.
The European Commission said it was concerned about the combined company's large market share in the trading of European government bonds because both LSE's MTS trading venue and Refinitiv's Tradeweb are already market leaders. It said a new trading rival would not gain enough clients to challenge the two trading venues.
It said another key concern was the merged entity's market power in trading and clearing in over-the-counter interest rate derivatives used by investors and companies to hedge interest rate risks, a business where customers rarely switch to a rival.
LSE said in a statement that it continued to engage constructively with the European Commission and that it remained committed to closing the transaction in 2020.
Refinitiv declined to comment.
The Commission also cited worries about rivals in consolidated real-time datafeeds and desktop services being shut out from accessing LSE's input data and competitors in index licensing facing the same problem.
""It is key for a well functioning financial market to ensure that market participants continue to have access to financial market infrastructure and financial data products on competitive terms,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The European Commission will decide by Oct. 27 whether to clear the deal.
The probe was launched after the LSE declined to offer concessions during the EU's preliminary review.

Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which owns Reuters News.

FRANKFURT/MANILA (Reuters) - Wirecard said on Monday that 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) it had booked in its accounts likely never existed, a black hole that threatens to engulf the payments company and tarnish the reputation of Germany's financial watchdog.
The one-time investor darling is holding emergency talks with its banks, which are owed roughly 1.75 billion euros, to avert a looming cash crunch triggered by the missing money.
The episode marks a dramatic turn in the fortunes of a homegrown tech firm that attracted some of the world's biggest investors before a whistleblower alleged that it owed its success in part to a web of sham transactions.
Wirecard said last week that auditor EY had refused to sign off its 2019 accounts as it was unable to confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros in cash balances in trust accounts, about a quarter of its balance sheet. 
On Monday, the company was frank. 
""The Management Board of Wirecard assesses ... that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of 1.9 billion EUR do not exist,"" it said.
State prosecutors in Munich investigating the case are now considering issuing arrest warrants for its former CEO, Markus Braun, and Jan Marsalek, a board member fired on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Braun and Marsalek could not be immediately reached for comment, and their lawyers declined to comment. 
The furore has also damaged Germany's image. 
Felix Hufeld, head of Germany's financial watchdog Bafin, described the crisis, which has seen around 11 billion euros wiped off Wirecard's market value in recent days, as a ""total disaster"", conceding his agency and others had made mistakes.
""It is a scandal that something like this could happen,"" Hufeld said.
REGULATOR UNDER FIRE
Bafin's own record has come under fire as Wirecard's share price has imploded, hitting retail investors and some large money managers. 
The regulator had focused on probing so-called short-sellers and journalists behind reports which questioned Wirecard's accounts, prompting criticism over its inaction against the company.
German lawmaker Fabio De Masi said that Bafin had failed in its duty over Wirecard, whose credit rating was ultimately withdrawn by agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
Wirecard, which started out handling payments for adult entertainment and gambling websites and now processes payments for companies including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), has appointed investment bank Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) to help assess its options.
More than a dozen banks, including ABN Amro and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), are forming a creditor committee and have hired law firm Allen & Overy, two people close to the talks said. 
Houlihan Lokey, A&O and the banks declined to comment. 
Wirecard also said it is looking at the sale or closure of parts of its business, but its creditor banks are not interested in a fire sale, especially as litigation risks may put off buyers, one person close to talks told Reuters.
The company, which has long been held up as a rare German technology success, also withdrew its financial statements for 2019 and said it was examining cost cuts.
HUNT FOR MISSING CASH
EY had regularly approved Wirecard's accounts in recent years, and its refusal to sign off for 2019 confirmed failings found in an external investigation by KPMG in April, which in turn followed investigative reports by the Financial Times.
Wirecard's latest announcement follows the exit on Friday of former chief executive Braun, who was replaced by James Freis, an ex-compliance officer at Germany's stock exchange.
The company has been under scrutiny since the whistleblower alleged the web of sham transactions. This culminated in a search for the missing cash, which last week hit a dead end in the Philippines.
The Philippine central bank said none of the money appeared to have entered the country, after Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and BDO Unibank said documents purporting to show Wirecard had deposited funds with them were false. 
BPI Chief Executive Cezar Consing said a certificate purporting to be for a Wirecard deposit was ""spurious"".
Wirecard, which operates both as an issuer of real and 'virtual' payment cards, had marketed itself as a universal payments platform positioned to profit from the growth in digital payments. Its future is now uncertain.

(Reuters) - Oilfield service provider ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) on Monday said a lengthy audit committee review revealed multiple financial and internal control weaknesses, but none severe enough to restate prior results. 
The company, which is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said in a regulatory filing that the board's investigation also found a failure to elevate whistleblower complaints and inaccurate business expense reporting.
Former Chief Executive Officer Dale Redman pledged company shares for personal loans, violating its insider trading policy. Redman stepped down in March, shortly after Reuters sought comment on the share pledges.
""Our senior management did not establish and promote a control environment with an appropriate tone of compliance and control consciousness throughout the entire company,"" the company said in a filing, adding the audit committee found ""a general lack of focus on promoting a culture of compliance within the company.""
ProPetro, which has delayed financial reports during the audit, expects to become current with financial filings by July 15.
Shares were flat on Monday at $5.40. 
""We hope the current PUMP (ProPetro) team will learn from these mistakes,"" analysts for Tudor Pickering Hold & Co wrote in a note on Monday, adding that relationships with companies like  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) could help future operations.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>","Valentino sues to close Fifth Avenue boutique in Manhattan, blames pandemic","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Italian fashion company Valentino SpA has sued the landlord of its American flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, seeking to void its lease because the coronavirus pandemic has made keeping the store open impossible.
In a complaint filed on Sunday, Valentino said the store, located two blocks south of Trump Tower, can no longer operate ""consistent with the luxury, prestigious, high-quality reputation"" of its neighborhood, as the lease contemplated.
Valentino told its landlord Savitt Partners it planned by year end to quit its lease, which began in 2013 and expires in 2029, but said the landlord wrote on Friday that it would not accept a surrender.
Savitt's lawyer Robert Cyruli declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying: ""My client does not elect to litigate through the media."" Valentino and its lawyer also declined to comment.
The lawsuit in a New York state court in Manhattan is one of several between retailers such as Gap, H&M, Victoria's Secret and the National Basketball Association and their Manhattan landlords after the pandemic forced store closures.
Valentino's store is at the midpoint of a half-mile (0.8 km) stretch of Fifth Avenue from Rockefeller Center to the corner of Central Park containing many luxury retailers, with high rents.
Much of that stretch became dormant in mid-March, when New York officials closed ""nonessential"" businesses to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Some restrictions were lifted on Monday, and some in-store shopping is now allowed.
But Valentino said shoppers have grown fearful of ""in person, 'non-essential' luxury retail boutiques,"" and that ""even in a post-pandemic New York City (should such a day arrive)"" the Fifth Avenue location was irreparably damaged.
Keeping the store open is ""impractical, unfeasible and no longer workable,"" it said.
On June 8, Victoria's Secret, part of L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB), filed a similar case to void the $938,000-a-month lease for its flagship store in Manhattan's Herald Square.

1221,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Investors Are Spending Fresh Billions Hedging the Market Mania,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether it’s a bearish portent of a sell-off to come or prudent hedging after a fierce stock rebound, traders are bolstering their defenses against an end to this vertiginous rally.
Gold and longer-maturity bonds are getting outsized inflows. Protective equity options are outdrawing speculative contracts, while volatility markets are positioning for fresh disruptions.
It comes as signs of froth are emerging. The S&P 500 Index is on the cusp of its best quarter in more than 80 years even as fears of a second coronavirus wave grow. Speculative mania reigns among retail investors, while the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. are turning bullish on U.S. stocks.
But for all the fears that Wall Street is running headlong into risk in one of the fastest rebounds ever, hedging demand shows the frenzy is being met with some vigilance.
Yellow Metal
Net bullish bets on gold in futures and options have risen for the first time in four weeks, recovering from a one-year low, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund holding bullion, took in the most in about a year at $1.3 billion on Friday, in large part a sign of enduring faith in the defensive asset.
One reason: bulls keep finding their faith rewarded, with the price of bullion edging toward the highest since 2012.
Duration Demand
Almost $10 billion flowed into fixed-income ETFs last week, favoring funds targeting government and investment grade debt over those buying riskier junk bonds. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF, ticker TLT, which buys only longer-dated government notes, had its best week in seven with $600 million of inflows. Money market-like ETFs added assets for the first time since early May.
After two-and-a-half years of bearish bets against Treasuries, hedge fund positions are now nearly completely neutral, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
“A new lockdown is not in the price for equities, but a slowdown is creeping in the price of bonds” said Ben Emons, head of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “The near-term risk for markets optimism about the reopening could be a more pronounced summer slowdown than what is expected.”
Fear Gauge
The traditionally inverse correlation between stocks and the Cboe Volatility Index, the fear gauge on Wall Street, has been turned on its head recently, with the VIX rising even on days when market has rallied.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists note that “the VIX should be much lower - the gap between VIX and S&P 500 returns is one of the largest on record.”
While part of that may be down to investors chasing bullish call contracts, it may also be a sign that options markets are “less optimistic on growth so far and that equities have run up a bit too fast,” they wrote in a recent note.
Stock Hedging
Meanwhile, JPMorgan strategists argue that there’s been plenty of stock hedging among institutional investors, despite all the focus on speculative call buying by moms and pops. A measure of the price of protective puts versus bullish calls known as skew has been steadily rising for the S&P 500 and Euro Stoxx 50 indexes, they wrote in a note on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) said on Monday that it will delist several exchange-traded notes, including one linked to Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" that soared during the peak of the sell-off in U.S. stocks.
The Swiss bank is discontinuing nine of its exchange-traded notes (ETNs), including three linked to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). It is also delisting six gold, silver and natural gas ETNs. Most of the ETNs are listed on Nasdaq. The two natural gas ETNs are listed on NYSE Arca.
The bank said it was delisting the ETNs ""with a view to better align its product suite with its broader strategic growth plans.""
The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN (O:TVIX), the largest of the products, held $1.5 billion in total net assets as of Friday, according to Refinitiv. In mid-March, as the S&P 500 (SPX) plummeted 34% from its peak, TVIX's total net assets temporarily swelled to more than $6 billion, and the ETN traded as high as $1,000 a share.
TVIX, along with the other ETNs, will be delisted as of July 12. Credit Suisse will suspend further issuance of TVIX on July 3. Previously issued notes will remain outstanding and may trade over the counter.
On Monday, TVIX shares were trading 2.4% higher at $159.55.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned around in early trade Monday to trade modestly higher, after falling at the open on a lack of reassurance over fiscal stimulus from White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow.
Kudlow told CNBC that ""nothing has been decided yet"" about the size of the next coronavirus relief package. Analysts have warned that the economy faces a severe blow if support payments that are scheduled to end in July aren't extended in one form or other. Kudlow's comments took the gloss off a day marked by optimism at the further reopening of New York City's economy. 
Also weighing on sentiment was the awareness of rising numbers of new coronavirus infections in some of the country's largest states, including California, Texas and Florida, as well as announcement of a dilutive capital raising exercise by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which said it wanted to raise up to $1.5 billion in stock and convertible notes.  The stock fell 4.6%.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 69 points or 0.3% at 25,938 points, while the S&P 500 was also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock outperformed, rising 1.5% ahead of the start of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference later in the day. The iPhone maker is widely expected to announce a move to make its own chips for the next generation of Mac computers, in what would represent a break from its current supplier Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel stock was down 0.4%. Apple's conference also comes less than a week after the European Union opened two new antitrust investigations against the company for possible abuse of its App Store. 
Apple's decision to temporarily close some stores in coronavirus hotspots in the U.S. had been a major factor in the market's turnaround late on Friday. However, the mood had largely bucked up again by Monday, as New York reopened much of its retail sector, including cafes, restaurants and hair salons. There were also upbeat statements on reopening from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), which said it will reopen its Disneyland Paris theme park on July 15th, and from Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), which said it expected to have 95% of its stores open by the weekend.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Lufthansa shares down on bailout standoff with shareholder,"By Ilona Wissenbach and Holger Hansen
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares fell on Monday as the German government held last-ditch talks with the airline group's biggest shareholder, who is threatening to block a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) bailout unless its terms are adjusted.
The stock was down 5.2% at 1101 GMT, as billionaire investor Heinz Hermann Thiele met senior government officials at the finance ministry, according to three people familiar with the matter. Lufthansa declined to comment.
The German airline has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and what promises to be a protracted travel slump, forcing it to seek a state rescue to avoid insolvency.
Thiele, who holds 15.5% of the group, objects to bailout terms that would see Germany acquire a 20% stake and board seats, diluting existing shareholders, and has instead proposed an indirect holding via the country's KfW development bank.
Monday's stock decline followed a weekend message in which Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told employees less than 38% of shares had been registered to vote at a key shareholder meeting on Thursday, handing Thiele an effective veto on the bailout, which needs a two-thirds majority to pass.
Lufthansa shares also exited Germany's benchmark DAX index on Monday, a relegation announced early this month. 
The group warned last week a no vote would force it to seek creditor protection to avoid insolvency. That could eventually lead to break-up pressures on the group, whose other carriers include Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss.
As well as adding significant risk, ""a protective umbrella procedure for Lufthansa would be a great embarrassment for Germany as an export nation,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Ruxandra Haradau-Doeser said.
The government has nonetheless refused so far to consider any changes to the complex bailout deal negotiated with Lufthansa management and the European Commission.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who attended the talks with Thiele along with Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, said beforehand he expected the talks to produce a consensus behind the proposed deal.
""I think discussing about the proposal, which is what we do - just making clear what it is about - could organise the consensus,"" Scholz told a financial conference by videolink ahead of the talks with Thiele.
""Lufthansa has been a very successful company before the crisis, so it's our duty to make feasible that they (survive) the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",German hydrogen economy to spark traded market for imports: consultants,"By Vera Eckert
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's push to increase the use of hydrogen as a clean fuel to meet climate targets will require imports and a traded market to supplement home-produced supplies, a consultancy close to protagonists in the emerging industry said.
""There will have to be a mix of domestic and foreign hydrogen volumes, depending on where the cheaper source is,"" said Andreas Schwenzer, principal consultant at Horvath & Partners, which advises the gas network Open Grid Europe.
""The energy market is already discussing how a euro-denominated wholesale market can emerge,"" he said in an interview.
Germany this month agreed a national hydrogen strategy, which in July will be embedded in a wider European Union plan for a fossil-free future for the bloc's industries.
Germany, one of Europe's biggest gas markets, consumes 55 terawatt hours annually of CO2-intensive hydrogen from natural gas.
But it lacks land and offshore resources to produce sufficient carbon-free hydrogen from renewable energy to meet the EU goal to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.
Horvath sees opportunities for Spain and Portugal to use solar-powered electrolysis to extract carbon-free hydrogen from water and ship this northwards, on vessels or through pipelines, Schwenzer said.
Morocco could also become a supplier, along with the Middle East, which needs to become less reliant on fossil fuel and may consider hydrogen the least disruptive option because it can use gas infrastructure. 
Developers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals in Germany aim to become hydrogen-ready.
In addition, Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which owns and operates existing and planned gas pipelines into Germany, says it can potentially transport hydrogen.
Some banks say there is too much hype around hydrogen as its commercialisation is years away and the technology is unproven.
The cost of green hydrogen is expected to fall and Schwenzer said EU targets to cut production costs to 2 euros ($2.24) per kilogram by 2030/35 from currently 6 euros appeared realistic.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, extending recent gains on enthusiasm over the economic re-opening, despite a rising number of coronavirus infections.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 22 points, or 0.7%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 75 points, or 0.8%. The Dow Futures contract rose 186 points, or 0.7%. 
These indices last week recorded their fourth winning week out of the last five, helped by the hefty amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus and nascent signs of economic recovery.
Economic data points have continued to show improvement, with the initial jobless claims data dropping again last week, although the pace of decline stalled, while retail sales showed a sharp jump. 
The economy has continued to reopen, with New York City, one of the hardest hit regions in the U.S., moving to phase 2, allowing New Yorkers, among other things, to go to hairdressers and enjoy outdoor dining.
That said, the World Health Organization reported a record jump in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, with the biggest increase seen in North and South America.
There have also been spikes in coronavirus infection rates in several U.S. states, notably in the south of the country. Nearly 120,000 Americans have died to date, over one quarter of the global total of 469,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Economic data releases are limited Monday, with May’s existing home sales the main number. Later in the week durable goods orders are expected to rebound but remain below pre-virus levels.
Thursday’s closely watched report on initial jobless claims will be the main event, as it provides the timeliest data on the economy’s health.
In corporate news, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group announced that it is planning to secure $3.5 billion in new financing to enhance its liquidity position.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also be in the spotlight as it hosts its Worldwide Developers Conference. It announced on Friday that it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as the coronavirus cases rose, and was also hit with two antitrust probes by the EU last week.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Monday, helped by the news that the number of operating oil and natural gas rigs operating in Canada and the U.S. fell to a record low last week, but weighed by concerns that a record rise in global coronavirus cases could curb a recovery in fuel demand.
U.S. crude prices fell 0.4% to $39.68 a barrel, while Brent Futures dropped 0.3% to $42.08.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,758.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1212. up 0.3%.

Turkey’s benchmark equities gauge has erased its 2020 drop in a rally driven mostly by a wave of buying from local investors drawn to the market as they search for returns.
The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index gained as much as 1.5% on Monday and has climbed 37% from its March 23 low to be little changed for the year. Gains in discount grocery chain BIM BIM Birlesik Magazalar AS (IS:BIMAS) and GSM operator Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (NYSE:TKC) have been the biggest contributors to the advance, rising 38% and 28%, respectively, in that period.
Turkish stocks have outpaced developing-nation peers, with the MSCI emerging-market index still down 10% for 2020. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has slipped 12%.
Locals Replace Foreigners in Turkey’s Record Stock Market Rally
Global equity markets were crushed as concerns over the impact on economies from measures taken to fight the coronavirus pandemic prompted a worldwide sell-off. As risk aversion among investors increased, the lira sank to a record-low against the dollar in May, triggering measures from Turkish policymakers to support the currency and the economy.
“This is a rally almost purely driven by the locals, which explains why Turkish stocks’ declines were relatively limited on some days of the global rout this year and outperformed many peers both in the developed and emerging markets,” said Burak Isyar, head of equity research at ICBC Turkey Yatirim in Istanbul. “A lot of local investors opened accounts during their home-stay time at the height of the virus outbreak.”
Fleeing the lower interest rates that have accompanied the government’s steps to protect the currency, locals have flocked to equities, leading to the longest winning streak since Bloomberg started tracking the Istanbul stocks benchmark in 1988.
Turkey’s main equity benchmark is showing signs of overheating already. The benchmark’s 14-day relative strength index soared to 83 points on Monday, the highest level since February 2017, and has remained above the level of 70 that signals a security may be overbought for almost four weeks.
“Could it continue like this? You never know, said Isyar. “It may extend gains for a while more before changing course. When it’s overheated like this, one negative global headline may suddenly trigger profit-taking.”
The benchmark index was 1.3% higher as of 11:35 a.m. in Istanbul, led by gains in banks. Shares of state-run Turkiye Halk Bankasi (IS:HALKB) were up 6.2% following the resignation of Geoffrey S. Berman, the chief federal prosecutor in New York who was also leading a U.S. case against the lender.

The Japanese automaker said it planned to make 71,000 fewer vehicles globally in July than its original goal of about 700,000. While production has yet to return to normal, the July reduction is smaller than the 20% output cut for June.
""We expect the recovery trend to continue in August,"" a spokesman said.
Global automakers are trying to get their plants back up and running after many were closed earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus.
For the April-July period, Toyota anticipates a global production drop of 30% from its initial plans, made before the virus outbreak and a plunge in demand for vehicles. 
The automaker produced nearly 3.7 million vehicles during the same period last year.
At home, Toyota plans to make 39,000 fewer vehicles in July, or 10% less than initially planned. 
It will stop making its Coaster minibus model for six days, while lines producing the Land Cruiser and Prado SUV models, and the Porte subcompact, will stop for two days. These adjustments will affect six production lines at three of the automaker's plants. 
Second shifts at some of these plants will remain cancelled, potentially until September. In total, Toyota operates 28 production lines at 15 vehicle factories in Japan.

Toyota will also cancel some Saturday shifts next month on four lines that produce models including its popular RAV4 SUV crossover model and the Prius gasoline hybrid, many of which are exported overseas.

TSMC's clients include Huawei's chip division HiSilicon. However, the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei over security concerns and trade disputes with China has left the world's biggest contract chipmaker exposed to diplomatic developments between two countries where it also has production bases.
Last month, the company unveiled plans for a $12-billion plant in the United States just hours before the U.S. Commerce Department outlined a proposal to amend chip export rules - a move that would restrict TSMC's sales to Huawei.
The amendment would require licences for sales of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology to Huawei, the world's biggest supplier of telecoms equipment and its second-largest smartphone maker.
Kung Ming-hsin, the new head of Taiwan's economic planning agency, the National Development Council, said the United States was taking aim at a specific company, not Taiwan's economic relations with China, the island's largest trading partner. 
""The United States has not asked Taiwan to cut off all ties with China. It's aimed at Huawei,"" Kung told reporters in Taipei.
The main reason the United States has targeted Huawei is because it was not transparent and had too close a relationship with the Chinese government, he added, charges the company has denied.
""As for TSMC, although their orders no longer have Huawei, they've quickly been filled up, as other people really need them,"" Kung said, without elaborating.
TSMC declined to comment, saying it did not comment on its customers.

The chairman of TSMC, a supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL), said this month the firm could quickly fill any order gap should U.S. curbs prevent sales to Huawei.

1239,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",StockBeat: What's Left of Wirecard?,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Is there any value in Wirecard AG (DE:WDIG)?
By mid-morning trading on Monday in Frankfurt, the market's answer was increasingly firm-looking ""no"". The fallen star of the German fintech universe was under fresh pressure after admitting that the 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in cash that it said last week it couldn’t find probably never existed, pulling its last financial accounts and warning that it may have to do the same for previous years. 
The Munich-based payments group added that it was looking at ways of immediately reducing costs, which can only mean large-scale layoffs and the abandonment of all but essential operations.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the stock was at 17.25 euros, down 33% from Friday’s close, down over 80% from before last week’s revelations, and down over 90% from its peak in 2018, when the company took the place of the decaying giant Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in the benchmark DAX index. Adding insult to Commerzbank's injury is the fact that it is one of the group's biggest lenders.
The company’s 2024 bonds were also trading at levels that implied a high risk of imminent bankruptcy, quoted at between 24 and 28.5 cents on the euro.
Among all this bleakness was one crumb of comfort: the company’s lenders are still talking to it and have not – yet – decided to call in their loans, triggering a cash crunch that could push the company into insolvency. But one can assume that this is as much due to a desperate attempt to avoid the embarrassment of booking the loans as non-performing rather than any expectations of recovering actual value. 
According to Bloomberg, the company has drawn over 90% of a 1.75 billion euro revolving credit facility. The outstanding 2024 bond issue adds another 500 million euros to the pile. Its other liabilities appear negligible, by comparison.
On the asset side of the balance sheet, its last reported statements showed 3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, of which 1.9 billion is almost certainly non-existent. It also showed 1.2 billion euros in receivables but, given that the scandal here revolves around allegations of false invoicing, the receivables number has to be sharply discounted too.
Wirecard is a payments business, so most of its remaining assets – some 1.5 billion euros, according to the balance sheet – are intangible. Around half of that number is goodwill, a notoriously slippery accounting term.
It would be surprising if a company that couldn’t even count its cash properly had understated its intangibles but, in fairness, there probably is some value in Wirecard’s intellectual property and its partnerships if (a big if) current partners such as Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), are prepared to continue working with it. And one has to doubt that the world will notice if it the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android app stores have one less mobile wallet to offer.
Whether it is enough to carry the kind of debt that Wirecard has is obviously another matter."

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery in world stocks faltered on Monday as the threat of rising coronavirus infections in parts of Europe and the United States curbed risk appetite, boosting demand for safe-haven gold.
European stocks fell 0.3% at the open after Germany's coronavirus reproduction rate rose over the weekend to 2.88 on Sunday from 1.06 on Friday, health authorities said.
The rise, mainly driven by outbreaks in meat processing plants, brings with it the possibility of renewed restrictions on activity, a move that could end any economic rebound.
""I regard the German R statistic as a bit of a red herring or more of a statistical quirk,"" said Chris Bailey, Raymond James European strategist.
""Coronavirus at-the-margin remains an overhang but the opening up of Europe still looks on much more solid foundations than the US/Americas."" 
U.S. stock futures were up 0.8%, continuing to shrug off a spike in infections. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.2% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat.

In further evidence that United States was far from returning to normal, Apple (O:AAPL) said on Friday that it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases rose in some states.
Those concerns sent gold 0.5% higher to $1,752 per ounce, near its May peak of $1,764.8, which was its strongest since October 2012.
Record stimulus measures to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic will leave advanced economies with much higher debt than the accumulated during the 2008/09 financial crisis, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) estimated in a report.
""Government debt/GDP ratios will rise by around 19 percentage points, nearly twice as much as in 2009 during the GFC ... the rise in debt burdens will be more immediate and pervasive, reflecting the acuteness and breadth of the shock posed by the coronavirus."" Moody's said.
The pandemic is accelerating globally with the World Health Organization reporting a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday.
""The second wave is becoming a theme for markets,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""Whether there will be a lockdown may vary depending on region. It will be a tough decision for politicians. But they probably have no other choice if they are running out of hospital beds,"" he said.
Torn between record stimulus and growing fears of second- wave infections, stocks have been moving sideways in recent weeks. They had risen more than 40% from March lows on hopes the worst of the pandemic was over.
Global stock market valuations are now at their highest since 2002 compared with projected earnings in the coming 12 months.

Investors are also wary of developments in Hong Kong after details of a new security law for the territory showed Beijing will have overarching powers on its enforcement.
China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, will meet on June 28, and the Global Times reported it was likely to enact the Hong Kong security law by July 1.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) fell 0.7%, underperforming regional markets.
Major currencies were mostly steady. The euro traded at $1.1205 (EUR=), near its lowest in nearly three weeks.
The yen traded at 106.92 per dollar , not far from a one-month high of 106.58 to the dollar earlier this month.
Oil prices strengthened on tighter supplies from major producers, but concerns that the rising coronavirus cases could curb demand checked gains.

Brent crude rose 0.8% to $42.48 a barrel. U.S. crude was up 0.4% to $39.89 a barrel.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Environmental shareholder activism comes to Japan as Mizuho faces climate resolution,"TOKYO (Reuters) - More investors are publicly backing a resolution to curb coal project lending that shareholders of Mizuho Financial Group are expected to consider this week, the first time such a step is to figure at the annual meeting of a Japanese listed company.
As a new front of stakeholder activism opens up in Japan,advisory groups such as the Institutional Shareholder Services group and Glass Lewis, which advise funds worth more than $35 trillion, back the proposal in recommendations seen by Reuters.
If Thursday's resolution is passed, it could push Japanese banks, one of the last remaining major holdouts on financing coal, to live up to recent commitments to end lending for the dirtiest fossil fuel as climate concerns grow.
""This is a pivotal moment for companies to show their dedication to the future financial and climate-related sustainability of their business models,"" said Dewi Dylander of Danish pension fund PKA.
PKA has about $50 billion under management and will vote in favour of the Mizuho resolution, Dylander, the fund's head of environment, social and governance issues, told Reuters.
Swedish pension fund manager AP7, with $64 billion in assets under management, also supports the resolution, spokesman Mikael Hök told Reuters. It joins three investors who reiterated their support.
Anders Schelde, the chief investor officer at MP Pension, said he hoped investors such as Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) would back the move.
Blackrock, which holds about 5% of Mizuho, a stake worth about $1.3 billion), declined to comment.
Ostensibly aimed at getting Mizuho to align its business to goals of the Paris Agreement to counter global warming, the resolution seeks to push the bank to halt backing for coal projects around Asia, a priority for Japan's government and big business. 
Similar shareholder resolutions have succeeded in getting banks to stop financing coal and other fossil fuels and funding is slowly drying up for coal, at least, as the dirtiest and most polluting of such fuels. 
But Japanese banks have been among the biggest financiers to coal over the last five years, Refinitiv SDC Platinum says.
Graphic: Coal finance, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yxmvjlgwbvr/coal-financing-through-2019.PNG 
In April, Mizuho said it would stop financing new coal power projects, bowing to pressure from investors and NGOs such as Kikonet, a shareholder which is sponsoring the resolution.
Critics have highlighted the many loopholes that mean Mizuho will keep lending to projects in its pipeline and its distant 2050 target to cease lending.

But ""in the real world the loopholes are not that big,"" said Kimiko Hirata, international director at Kikonet, citing competition from renewables and growing opposition to power derived from coal.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: After BP takes a hit, investors widen climate change campaign","By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing £1.8 trillion ($2.2 trillion) in assets are widening a campaign pressing oil majors to better reflect climate risks in their accounting, and will soon target other businesses with heavy fossil fuel exposure, the group said on Monday.
The investors believe their campaign is working, noting the ""hugely important"" news of  BP  (L:BP) joining other oil majors in lowering the value of its assets amid a global transition to cleaner energy, said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at asset manager Sarasin & Partners. 
""The question all company directors and their shareholders now need urgently answered is, 'Where else might company positions be overstated?'"" the group of more than 20 leading funds said in a joint statement seen by Reuters.
BP declined to comment on the campaign.
The investor group can't be certain whether its efforts played into BP's decision to reduce the value of its assets by up to $17.5 billion, announced on June 15.
But they have already begun lobbying building materials company CRH (I:CRH) and plan to write to Anglo-Australian miner  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) (AX:RIO), which supplies the steel industry. Along with cement, steel is a major source of greenhouse gases. 
""We will be rolling out similar engagements with other fossil fuel-dependent companies,"" Landell-Mills, who is coordinating the campaign, told Reuters in an interview.
The investors were also planning to include European and U.S. banks financing fossil fuel projects, Landell-Mills added. 
Rio Tinto and CRH declined to comment. 
Early last year, the investors began lobbying the Big Four accounting firms - EY, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG - to do more to ensure climate-related risks are adequately reflected in company financial statements they audit. The campaign is one of a number of efforts by investors to push companies on environmental policies, amid concerns many businesses are both contributing to the planet's warming while also failing to take full stock of the risks they face. 
Major fund managers including BlackRock (N:BLK) have issued increasingly strident public statements about climate change, while other investors have threatened to pull money out of Brazil unless Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation is curbed.
The campaign led by Sarasin & Partners emphasizes the legal duty companies have to ensure their financial statements fully reflect how government moves to ratchet up climate action and the falling costs of renewable energy are likely to affect future profitability. 
""It's a very serious thing from their perspective,"" said Landell-Mills. ""This is a matter of ensuring there is no misrepresentation going on."" Accounting for potential future losses can weaken a company's balance sheet, making it harder to finance new investment in carbon-intensive activities such as oil exploration, the investors argue. The coalition includes Sarasin & Partners, M&G Investments, Jupiter Asset Management,  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners and pension funds such as the Brunel Pension Partnership and Denmark's PKA.
""POTENTIALLY OVERSTATING""
Although it was difficult to independently assess the impact of the campaign, Landell-Mills pointed to a series of moves that align with the investors' demands in letters https://sarasinandpartners.com/stewardship-post/paris-aligned-accounting-is-vital-to-deliver-climate-promises sent to BP, Anglo-Dutch major Shell (L:RDSa) and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) in November. In the letters, seen by Reuters, the investors questioned whether the companies' oil price assumptions, which form the bedrock of their accounts, were aligned with the 2015 Paris climate accord, which implies sharp cuts in fossil fuel use.
Before BP's writedown, the group's letter to the British oil major said: ""We have concerns that, at present, BP's accounts may be overlooking material climate considerations, and consequently potentially overstating both performance and capital."" The same language was used with Shell and Total. Total did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Shell said it had ""comprehensively responded"" to similar demands by the investor group, and included climate risks in its accounts. ""Since that time, Shell has also published an ambition to be a net zero energy company by 2050, or sooner,"" Shell said in an email to Reuters on Sunday.
Last week, BP cut its benchmark Brent oil price forecasts to an average of $55 a barrel until 2050, from $70, saying it expects a collapse in oil demand during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate a low-carbon transition. BP also said it would have to review some plans for early stage oil and gas exploration projects.
Meanwhile, Shell also lowered its long-term Brent crude expectations to $60 a barrel, from the 2018 price of $70, in its 2019 annual report published in March. Total also reduced its price assumptions at about the same time. 
While majors often adjust price assumptions, the investors noted that Shell's auditor's report contained substantially more references to climate risks than the previous year.
""It's tip of the iceberg,"" Landell-Mills said. ""And investors will have to understand that they (oil majors) are not going to be able to pay dividends like they did before.""

1250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",New Wirecard CEO Has Few Days to Calm Nervous Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Wirecard AG's (DE:WDIG) interim chief executive officer was supposed to be getting ready to run a new department called “Integrity, Legal and Compliance.” Now he faces a crucial week to convince investors that the payment company’s collapse isn’t terminal.
James Freis took charge on Friday following the shock announcement that Markus Braun had resigned. Braun’s position became untenable following revelations that about 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) -- or two-thirds of the company’s 2019 revenue -- had gone missing. The two Asian banks that were supposed to be holding the money denied any business relationship with Wirecard, plunging the company into further chaos.
The company subsequently withdrew its fiscal 2019 and first-quarter 2020 financial results after saying those funds on its balance sheet probably don’t exist.
Freis’ to-do list is extensive, but he has some relevant experience. He began his career as an attorney at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After a spell as director of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, where he was responsible for the regulation of financial institutions, he spent 6 years at Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG, most recently as chief compliance officer.
Freis wasn’t meant to start at Wirecard until July, but his first priority will be to work closely with the company’s lenders, who are demanding more clarity in return for the extension of almost $2 billion in financing after Wirecard breached terms on the loan. At least 15 commercial lenders, including Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) and ABN Amro, are in negotiations about the next steps.
Wirecard said it’s in “constructive talks” with its lenders, and has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. to come up with a financing strategy. However, a prolonged extension of Wirecard’s repayment obligation could be seen as delaying insolvency, which is illegal under German law.
In Braun’s parting note on Friday he said the “confidence of the capital market in the company I have been managing for 18 years has been deeply shaken.” He added that responsibility for all business transactions lies with the CEO.
Now Freis will need to reassure investors in order to halt a share price that went into free fall. Long-term investors have cut their stakes in Wirecard, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s asset manager DWS said it will file a lawsuit against both Wirecard and Braun, a company spokesman said on Friday.
The price of credit swaps on Wirecard indicate 82% odds of default by Christmas and 96% likelihood over five years, according to ICE Data Services on Friday, while Moody’s Investors Service cut Wirecard’s credit ratings six levels, putting it one step from the lowest tier of junk.
Wirecard is also facing multiple investigations by local prosecutors and BaFin, the German financial regulator. One of Freis’ tasks will be to clarify with regulators what happened to the missing cash and what the implications will be to Wirecard’s balance sheet.
The problem has been compounded after Philippine central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno told reporters on Sunday that none of the missing money entered the Philippine financial system, after two of its major lenders denied holding funds for the German payments processor.
Wirecard has also been forced to reassure customers that it is business as normal at its banking arm. Wirecard started offering a digital wallet called boon Planet in 2019. The app, similar to Paypal, was advertised in January this year with an attractive yield for account balances. While it is unclear how much money customers deposited at the app, the company sent out a message on Saturday reassuring its clients that their deposits are protected by a German state guarantee fund.
German politicians are now taking aim at Wirecard, once seen as proof that Germany could build a fintech giant to take on U.S. rivals.
“BaFin started its investigations early on, but sadly that couldn’t prevent the striking losses for investors,” said Florian Toncar, a German lawmaker from the opposition Free Democrats. “It would be very good to see BaFin use the tools at its disposal to quickly provide investors with clarity.”
Freis posted his job update on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) shortly after the announcement. One contact responded that it sounds like “one heck of a turn around project” but that Wirecard has found the right guy to restore credibility. In a reply, Freis quipped that the “one upside...is that I never have to worry about finding a beer when I need one at the end of the day.”

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>","China eases green rules for petrol-electric hybrids, giving makers space to manoeuvre","BEIJING (Reuters) - China re-classified petrol-electric hybrid vehicles on Monday so they get more favourable treatment than all-petrol or diesel counterparts under new clean car rules, making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choice.
China has some of the world's strictest rules regarding the production of fossil-fuel vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities.
Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers including Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of new energy vehicles (NEVs), such as all-electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Plug-in hybrid technology differs from that of petrol-electric hybrid vehicles.
Automakers in China are obliged to manufacture NEVs to win ""points"" to make up for a portion of the negative points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles.
However, the system has been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve petrol cars' efficiency.
The policy published on Monday by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology allows automakers to gradually make more petrol-electric hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles from 2021 through 2023.
Such hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as ""low fuel consumption passenger vehicles"". Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making petrol-electric hybrids will be less than for petrol-only vehicles.
That could see more of those traditionally powered vehicles replaced with petrol-electric hybrids, experts and industry officials said, because when automakers produce those hybrids, they would not have as many negative points to make up for.
Experts have said the beneficiaries of such change would include global petrol-electric hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), as well as Chinese makers Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (SS:601238) and supplier Hunan Corun New Energy Co Ltd (SS:600478).

China hopes NEVs will account for around a quarter of all vehicles sold in the country by 2025.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Monday morning, with investors digesting Sunday’s record number of COVID-19 cases as well as details of China’s national security laws for Hong Kong that were released over the weekend.
The World Health Organization reported a record 183,020 COVID-19 cases on Sunday, with over 8.9 million cases globally and over 460,000 deaths as of June 22 according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.46% by 10:20 PM ET (3:20 AM GMT) over fears that national security laws could be enacted in the city sooner than expected. China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee said it would meet again for three days starting June 28, as it wrapped up its bimonthly meeting over the weekend. The rare move could see the laws enacted in Hong Kong and Macau as early as June 30.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.43% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.51%. China announced earlier in the day that it would not change its benchmark lending rate, keeping both the 1-year loan prime rate and the 5-year loan prime rate steady at 3.85% and 4.65% respectively.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.18%, reversing its earlier gains. Australia saw a return of tightening restrictions in the second-biggest state of Victoria, to curb a surge of cases in the state.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.02% and South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.11%.
“Shares remain technically overbought and vulnerable to a further correction or period of consolidation, but we continue to see it as a pause in a rising trend,” Shane Oliver, global investment strategist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd, told Bloomberg.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 10:25PM ET</span>",Brands tout Black heritage as some shoppers question authenticity,"By Melissa Fares and Siddharth Cavale
NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - L'Oreal SA, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and other multinationals that acquired personal-care brands founded by Black people are moving to reassure their core customers, some of whom have pledged in the wake of racial-justice protests to direct their spending toward only Black-owned companies.
L'Oreal's multicultural beauty brand Carol's Daughter, which was founded by a Black woman in her Brooklyn kitchen in 1993 and named for her mother, said June 10 that it wanted to ""clear some things up"" when it posted a message to its Instagram page.
""Carol's Daughter is Black-founded, and Black-led, and joined the L'Oreal family of brands in 2014,"" it said. Founder Lisa Price ""is still actively involved in all aspects of the business; leading the brand's product development and creative vision,"" the statement said. 
Price is senior vice president and creative director at Carol's Daughter, which is part of the Multi-Cultural Beauty Division at L'Oreal USA, and is also part of the Executive Committee at L'Oreal USA. 
Multinational companies in recent years have snapped up products aimed at Black consumers and marketed those brands as authentically Black, with homemade formulas, personalized offers and feel-good marketing. But in the wake of the protests following the May 25 death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, many consumers are pledging to purchase more goods from Black-owned businesses as a way to bring greater racial equity. SheaMoisture, a personal care company founded in Harlem by Liberian immigrants in 1991, became part of Unilever in 2017 after the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever purchased Sundial Brands, a New York-based beauty firm. Black consumers threatened to boycott its products in June citing its corporate ownership. 
On June 9, Cara Sabin, CEO of Sundial Brands, which operates as a standalone unit within Unilever, posted a message on Instagram to assuage them. ""I am a Black CEO, in White corporate America, leading a brand that exists to serve our Black consumer,"" Sabin wrote. 
Black spending power in the United States is expected to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2021, from about $1.3 trillion last year, according to a report by Nielsen, a data analytics firm that tracks consumer purchases. The Black community makes up 13.4% of the U.S. population, and outspends in relation to other groups on products such as hair care and beauty, and women's fragrances. In 2017, for example, Black shoppers represented 85% of the $63 million total U.S. industry spend on multicultural hair care products.
The group also represented 22.4% and 21% of the total U.S industry spending on women's fragrances and feminine hygiene products that year, respectively, the report showed. 
Sales of hair care products targeted at multi-ethnicities were up 50% year-over-year in the month to May 17, according to Strategic Solutions International, a unit of Nielsen. Black-owned hair care companies represented 14% of the category, but drove 20% of that growth at retail stores. 
But some consumers say they’re paying closer attention to the ownership of a variety of goods and services aimed at Blacks, including bookstores, restaurants and pharmacies. On fundraising site GoFundMe, there are nearly 2,000 pages set up in support of Black-owned businesses, the majority of which were all created in recent weeks. 
“We’ve been dealing with these issues with Black people for how long, right? But there’s just something about this moment,” said Vivian Duker, a Baltimore-based corporate attorney. Earlier this month, she teamed up with a friend to launch a Change.org campaign called “#VERIFYBLACK” that has garnered more than 7,000 signatures. The petition seeks to get social media platforms to identify Black-owned businesses more clearly.
Brands such as Carol's Daughter and SheaMoisture would not qualify as Black-owned businesses, she told Reuters.
Unilever and L'Oreal did not respond to requests for comment.
Procter & Gamble in 2018 acquired Walker & Co, the parent company of Bevel, a men’s grooming line, and Form Beauty, a women's haircare line - both primarily for people of color. Walker & Co Vice President of Marketing Tia Cummings told Reuters that being part of P&G helped widen the availability of its products, making it easier for men and women to find and purchase them. 
Dana Williams-Johnson, Instructor in the Howard University School of Business Marketing Department said companies ""making money off of Black consumers should have leadership that reflects the consumers that purchase the brands."" 
""How diverse are these company's boards? How many Black people are at the top with a seat at the boardroom table? How much do all these brands truly value the Black dollar? Those will be the questions that need answers next,"" she added.  
According to Black Enterprise magazine, 187 of the S&P 500 companies did not have a single Black member on their boards in 2019. 
Haircare company Cantu Beauty faced such questions on Instagram this month, with some shoppers noting it was sold to PDC Brands in 2015 and declaring they would boycott the brand in favor of Black-owned businesses. 
So the company hosted an Instagram livestream chat ""with the people behind the brand"" on June 12. ""I want to pull back that curtain and let you guys see exactly what is going on behind the scenes,"" Cantu Beauty's Global Vice President Dametria Mustin said during the livestream.
PDC Brands did not respond to requests for comment.Synthea Hairston, 24, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania called Cantu her ""number 1"" brand for many years. But she refuses to shop the brand again. 
""Now my conscious is eating at me... I will literally be keeping a list with me at all times to make sure what I’m picking up is Black-owned.""

Joint inspections and checking financial paperwork would be key parts of cooperation, Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in an interview with Caixin.
""More importantly, we should establish a high degree of mutual trust between regulators through adequate communication and coordination, and on the basis of that, jointly set up a law enforcement mechanism against cross-border securities misdeeds,"" he was quoted as saying.
Yi's comments come amid bilateral tensions over trade, the coronavirus and Hong Kong but which also include cross-border listings and investments.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is moving to make it harder for some Chinese companies to list in the U.S., after Nasdaq-listed  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) admitted to fabricating sales. U.S. regulators have also warned investors against putting money into Chinese companies due to disclosure issues.
According to Yi, the CSRC has also told the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) it is willing to discuss ways to conduct joint inspections of cross-border listed firms and has submitted concrete proposals several times, but U.S. counterparts have not actively responded.
""I think that under the current political atmosphere, PCAOB could be under some pressure... We welcome the PCAOB to sit down with us to talk at any time,"" Yi was quoted as saying.
In response to U.S. complaints that the PCAOB is still unable to inspect financial paperwork in China, Yi told Caixin that China has never barred the provision of documents to foreign regulators, but under Chinese law, such information should be exchanged confidentially through regulators.
The CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali issued an order Saturday confirming PG&E’s Chapter 11 plan that will cover billions of dollars in damage claims stemming from catastrophic wildfires linked to the company’s equipment. The judge said in an earlier written decision that he planned to approve the turnaround proposal because the alternative would leave tens of thousands of fire survivors with “no other options on the horizon.”
PG&E needed the judge to sign off on its plan before the end of this month to qualify for a state wildfire insurance fund. That will help it cover damage claims from any future blazes sparked by its power lines.

“PG&E is committed to emerging from Chapter 11 as a fundamentally improved and transformed utility that meets the highest safety, governance, and operational standards,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said Saturday in a statement.
The company said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in July.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019 after its equipment was implicated in wildfires that killed more than 100 people and burned tens of thousands of homes across Northern California. It was the largest utility reorganization in U.S. history. The company is emerging from Chapter 11 saddled with nearly $40 billion in debt after it agreed to settle claims from people, insurers and local government agencies for $25.5 billion.
PG&E retired expensive high-coupon debt and replaced it with lower cost debt as a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, yielding savings for customers, according to a statement.
With the judge’s confirmation in hand, PG&E can begin marketing $5.25 billion in shares as part of a plan to raise $9 billion through new equity to help pay for the fire-related costs. It is also raising more than $13 billion in the debt markets.
Some wildfire victims denounced PG&E’s turnaround proposal, saying hedge funds and other investors stood to make billions from bets on the distressed utility while individual victims will have to take half of their $13.5 billion settlement in shares in the reorganized company.
PG&E said it will implement all wildfire settlements it reached during its bankruptcy after it emerges, including the immediate funding of the victim trust.

1257,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Australia Fears Second Wave as State Tightens Virus Controls,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s second-most populous state has tightened coronavirus controls as a spike in cases triggers fears the nation could be hit by a second wave of infections.
Victoria extended a state of emergency by four weeks to July 20, halved the number of visitors allowed in homes to 5 and delayed a planned increase in the size of gatherings in cafes, restaurants and pubs.
The weekend announcement, and a jump in cases in countries including the U.S., Israel and South Korea, heightened market concerns about the difficulty of reviving economic growth while controlling the spread of Covid-19. The Australian dollar declined against most of its Group-of-10 peers on Monday, falling as much as 0.4%.
Australia has managed to limit the total number of coronavirus cases to 7,460 by closing international and state borders, quarantining returning residents, social distancing measures and a widespread testing and tracing regime. But concerns are growing about community transmission in Victoria, responsible for 116 new cases in the past week -- 83% of the national total. Of those, 87 were largely associated with community transmission.
Health authorities are warning people to avoid traveling to six areas in the state capital, Melbourne. A professional Australian Football League match scheduled to be played in the city on Sunday was postponed after a player contracted the virus.
The spike in cases may cause states and territories such as Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania to keep their borders closed beyond July, despite pressure from Prime Minister Scott Morrison to allow inter-state travel to boost tourism and buoy the shattered economy.
Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy on Monday said he was concerned by the “fairly rapid rise” of infections over a few days in Victoria, which appeared to be caused by family gatherings. In some instances, people who had tested positive or come into contact with an infected person had failed to self-quarantine.
“Complacency is dangerous,” Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
There was no sign the Black Lives Matter rally in Melbourne earlier this month had caused a spike, he said. Officials don’t believe the three protesters who have tested positive were infected at the rally, or transmitted it there. However, the mass protests may have encouraged other people to flout social distancing rules and gather in larger numbers, he said.
If lockdown measures are re-imposed more widely, it could further damage the economy and erode business confidence and consumer sentiment, said Nathan Cloutman, a senior industry analyst at IBISWorld. “Businesses are now less likely to re-stock supplies and re-hire employees when social distancing is removed, out of fear that restrictions will be re-imposed before they can generate revenue to cover those costs.”

The company plans to raise $1.5 billion by selling shares and convertible senior notes due 2025, the airline said in a statement.
Additionally, the airline said it will offer $1.5 billion in senior secured notes and that it intends to enter into a new $500 million term loan facility due 2024.
The company expects to use the net proceeds from the stock and convertible notes offerings for general corporate purposes and to enhance its liquidity position, the airline added.
The stock and convertible notes offerings, first reported by Bloomberg News, include a 30-day option for the underwriters to purchase up to $112.5 million of additional common shares and up to $112.5 million of additional convertible notes respectively, the company said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co. LLC,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), BofA Securities and JP Morgan will be acting as representatives for the underwriters.

1259,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Asian Buyers Turn to U.S. Oil Amid Uncertain Flows From OPEC,"(Bloomberg) -- As the OPEC+ alliance sticks to its guns in trying to curb oil output to shore up prices, Asian buyers are increasingly looking to the U.S. for a cheaper source of supply.
Refiners in the top crude-importing region have been forced to accept big reductions in their regular contracted volumes from producers including Saudi Arabia and Iraq in the past couple of months. They’ve also been taken aback by sharp swings in official selling prices.
The lower volumes and pricing uncertainty is encouraging Asian processors to take a closer look at American crudes, particularly as freight rates across the Pacific have fallen over the last couple of months. Staff at four Asian processors who buy and sell crude said they were considering purchasing U.S. oil, declining to be named because the information is confidential.
Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have long-standing reputations as reliable suppliers to Asia, but the price war followed quickly by massive output cuts have unsettled buyers in the region. While these traditional suppliers are unlikely to be overtaken by the U.S. anytime soon, the instability has created an opening for American producers.
“It’s difficult for refiners to cope with such volatility,” said John Driscoll, chief strategist at JTD Energy Services Pte in Singapore. “On the other hand, U.S. oil is looking more attractive with lower prices and freight rates.”
See also: Saudi Oil Hike Shocks Asian Buyers Without Better Options
The volume of U.S. oil flowing to Asia is already rising. About 49 million barrels are scheduled to arrive next month, compared with 27 million barrels each in May and June, figures from Vortexa Ltd. show. Deeper discounts for American crude relative to other benchmark crudes such as Brent are spurring interest from China, said Serena Huang, a senior analyst at the market analytics firm.
China’s Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. bought at least 2 million barrels of the West Texas Intermediate Midland grade for August-September arrival, while South Korean processors including GS Caltex Corp. and SK Innovation Co. purchased U.S. varieties including WTI Midland and Eagle Ford for September.
WTI Midland, a favored grade for some North Asian refiners, is comparable to Abu Dhabi’s Murban and Das Blend and Saudi Arabia’s Arab Extra Light and Arab Light, as well as Russian Sokol. The American varieties are cheaper than similar Middle Eastern types of the crude, the refinery officials said.
The spot premium to purchase WTI Midland against its benchmark has risen by about $2 a barrel from a month earlier, while that for Murban has increased by $4 a barrel because of an increase in its official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the cost of hiring a Very Large Crude Carrier, which can hold 2 million barrels, for a journey from the U.S. Gulf Coast to China was around $7.5 million in mid-June, compared with $15 million in late April.

1260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",China Investor Buys Record-Cheap Bank Stocks Nobody Else Wants,"(Bloomberg) -- To most investors, buying shares of Chinese banks seems like a losing strategy this year.
Under pressure from the government to sacrifice profits, stung by ultra-low interest rates and parrying the threat of souring loans, China’s biggest listed lenders have seen their shares sink 13% in 2020. They trade at a measly 0.7 times the projected value of their assets, near the lowest multiple since before the global financial crisis.
But for one Shanghai-based fund manager, the value case for Chinese bank shares is now so compelling that the stocks comprise one of the biggest parts of his portfolio. Zhou Liang, founder and fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co., says prices already reflect a worst-case scenario for deteriorating profits and non-performing loans.
“The market has priced in too much pessimism,” said Zhou, whose firm oversees about 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion). His flagship fund has outperformed the CSI 300 Index by more than 150 percentage points in the past five years, according to financial data provider East Money Information Co. “We believe many people misunderstand the banking sector.”
Zhou says concerns over asset quality, non-performing loans, profit sustainability and the impact of the pandemic have been overdone. “The four major banks and large joint-stock banks have no problems in terms of asset quality, as there are few toxic assets,” said Zhou via phone from his office in Shanghai. “The return on equity is relatively high, while operating costs of Chinese banks are low compared with those in the U.S. due to cheaper labor and rental.”
Zhou’s flagship fund has made an accumulated return of more than 340% since inception in 2013. Since 2016 he has been all-in on mainland-listed blue chip stocks including banks, property developers, baijiu makers, insurers and some leading manufacturers.
China is leaning on its massive banks like never before to help bolster an economy facing its worst slump in four decades. The government is asking them to keep profit growth below 10% while pushing the financial industry to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan in profit this year by offering lower lending rates, cutting fees, deferring loan repayments and granting more unsecured loans to small businesses. Zhou says that such policy headwinds are well priced in.
“In the past few years, the policy environment of banks and real estate has not been very friendly, but this does not prevent you from finding out how to profit,” said Zhou.
China’s financial stocks are trading at their cheapest level versus the MSCI China Index in more than a decade. So far this year they are the second-worst performer on the country’s benchmark CSI 300 Index. Zhou’s flagship fund has lost 5.7% in net asset value in 2020.
But he is sticking to his conviction that a three-to-five year time frame will yield results. “The potential returns from banking stocks are far greater than the potential risks,” said Zhou.

Lufthansa has been hard hit by what is expected to be a protracted travel slump because of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing it to seek a bailout.
Billionaire shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele will meet the economics minister on Monday to discuss his objections to the state-backed bailout, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
As an alternative to the government taking a direct stake in Lufthansa, Thiele has proposed an indirect participation through state-owned German development bank KfW [KFW.UL].
In a letter to employees, Spohr said the airline was in intense talks with the government and large shareholders which had ""the clear goal of finding a satisfactory solution for our company and all participants before Thursday,"" when an extraordinary shareholder meeting will be held.
Expressing his desire to avoid a grounding or insolvency, he said: ""I am sure this is an objective which unites all parties.""
Lufthansa warned last week that a failure to secure shareholder approval for the bailout could force it to apply for protection from creditors under German insolvency law.
The bailout requires the support of more than two thirds of shareholders. Thiele, who has 15.5% of Lufthansa's shares, objects to the German state taking a 20% stake and seats on its supervisory board.
Spohr said shareholders representing 38% of the company's capital had registered for the shareholder vote, handing Thiele an effective veto if he does not endorse the proposed deal.
Lufthansa will pay June salaries on Monday, Spohr said in the letter.
Lufthansa and Germany's finance ministry declined to comment on the meeting. Thiele could not be reached for comment.

MANILA (Reuters) - None of the $2.1 billion missing from scandal-hit German payments firm Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) appears to have entered the Philippine financial system, the central bank said on Sunday.
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said in a statement the Southeast Asian country's biggest lenders, BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands, suffered no losses, despite having been named in connection with the missing funds.
The chief executive of Wirecard, Markus Braun, who built the company into one of the hottest financial technology investments in Europe and a rare tech champion for Germany, quit on Friday as the company faces a cash crunch after saying it may have been the victim of fraud.
The search for the missing cash hit a dead end in the Philippines, but the two Philippine banks have said documents purporting to show Wirecard had deposited funds with them were false.
""The initial report is that no money entered the Philippines and that there is no loss to both banks,"" Diokno said, though he added that the central bank was investigating.
""The international financial scandal used the names of two of the country’s biggest banks — BDO and BPI — in an attempt to cover the perpetrators' track,"" he said.
BDO and BPI have stated that Wirecard was not their client and that they had no business relationship with the German firm, Diokno said.
BPI, however, told Reuters on Saturday that it had suspended an assistant manager whose signature appeared on one of the fraudulent documents.
BDO told the central bank that it appeared one of its marketing officers had fabricated a bank certificate.

Diokno reiterated the Philippine banking system was in a strong position going into the coronavirus pandemic and well-capitalised.

(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG) said its Chapter 11 reorganization plan has been confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, bringing the power provider one step closer to emerging from bankruptcy and participate in a state-backed wildfire fund.
The court's approval follows the confirmation of the plan by power regulator California Public Utilities Commission in May.
""Today's ruling in the Chapter 11 proceeding concludes the process of approving PG&E's Plan of Reorganization,"" the San Francisco-based utility Chief Executive Officer and President Bill Johnson said in a statement on Saturday.
The company said that it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in July and that it is on track to participate in a state-backed wildfire fund, which reduces liability for investor-owned utilities but requires them to spend billions of dollars upgrading equipment.
The utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities exceeding $30 billion from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. 
Earlier this week, the company pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in Northern California touched off by the utility company's power lines.
The guilty plea, part of an agreement with prosecutors in Butte County, is intended to end all criminal proceedings against PG&E from the Camp Fire, which broke out on Nov. 8, 2018, and destroyed much of the town of Paradise.
The Camp Fire killed at least 84 people and destroyed some 18,000 buildings. It is considered the most destructive wildfire in California history.

The company said earlier in June that it plans to raise $5.75 billion from public offerings as it tries to emerge from bankruptcy.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Most of Canada's biggest banks are ending their extra payments to employees who continued working in public during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, as the country's daily infection tallies decline.
The banks' moves follow grocery chains  Metro Inc  (TO:MRU), Loblaw Companies (TO:L) and Sobeys Inc in ending the additional work incentives, which were put in place when many other Canadian workers began working from home to limit their risk.
The rollback of extra temporary pay for grocery store employees prompted a Canadian parliamentary committee on Thursday to summon major retailers to explain their decisions. The chair of that committee, Liberal legislator Sherry Romanado, could not be reached on Saturday.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM) (  CIBC  ) will end its pay incentive, C$50 per day for workers required to work on site, on June 27, spokesman Tom Wallis said.
""As the economy and many businesses begin to re-open, we are also shifting to the next phase of how we operate,"" he said.
CIBC will continue to offer employees up to 10 additional paid days off to deal with COVID-19-related matters, Wallis said.
The number of total COVID-19 infections in Canada surpassed 100,000 this week. Daily cases tallies have declined in many provinces, even as they reopen parts of their economies.
 Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD)'s incentive program, which pays workers at bank locations C$500 and an extra day off for each of April and May, is due to expire at the end of June, said spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo.
Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) will also end its special compensation program on June 30, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Lewis.
 National Bank of Canada  (TO:NA) ended its additional pay program earlier this month, spokeswoman Marie-Pierre Jodoin said.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: London index reshuffle to give healthcare stocks a bigger profile,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare sector looks set for a bulked up profile in growth indexes when FTSE Russell reconstitutes its stock indexes late next Friday, an annual event that historically creates one of the biggest trading volume days of the year. 
The Russell rebalance becomes final on the fourth Friday every June, after markets close. Stocks are added or deleted from Russell's family of indexes, including the Russell 1000 large cap and Russell 2000 small cap, prompting fund managers to adjust portfolios to reflect new weightings and components.
Russell bases the placesment in the indexes on a number of factors, including market capitalization, voting rights requirements and country of domicile. 
Telegraphing the reconstitution can create additional buying and selling stocks. Some investors may use the additional liquidity to take advantage of any resulting price dislocations, or to adjust the holdings in their portfolios, especially in smaller companies that have much lower liquidity. 
The resulting surge in trading volume crests right before the market close. FTSE Russell says more than $15 trillion is currently benchmarked to its indexes globally and about $9 trillion to its U.S. indexes.
""I’m already at the spot where I will be happy when Russell is behind us because it is an emotionally elevated day, everybody has to really be on their toes, there is a lot of messages and a lot of traffic coming down,"" said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. 
The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, because of the scale of the revamp, reinforces the rules for trades on the close and contingency plans in the event of unusual market conditions. During the June 2019 reconstitution, Nasdaq said 1.279 billion shares representing $42.59 billion were executed in its ""closing cross"" in 1.14 seconds across Nasdaq listed stocks.
This year's reconstitution is also influenced by market volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While other index providers delayed rebalancing that was scheduled for earlier in the year, FTSE Russell has moved forward with the reconstitution as originally scheduled. 
""Our policy team did consult the market on whether any temporary measures were needed to accommodate the market volatility and the overwhelming feedback was that it wasn’t required and we should proceed according to the published rules,"" said Catherine Yoshimoto, director, product management at FTSE Russell.
The influence of the novel coronavirus will also create more movement between the indexes than in recent years. Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) estimates turnover across the Russell 3000 to be $57 billion compared with the $35 billion last year. 
In addition, the coronavirus has aided the strong performance of healthcare stocks and other names that have benefited from the ""stay at home"" environment, some of which are likely to be added directly, or promoted to, the large cap Russell 1000. 
Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets anticipates nearly half of the stocks being promoted to the Russell 1000 from the Russell 2000 will be healthcare names. 
Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), which offers virtual healthcare services, has risen more than 130% this year and is widely expected to be promoted to the Russell large cap index. Home fitness provider Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) is seen as being added directly to the Russell 1000. Of the six initial public offerings being added to the Russell 2000, all belong to the healthcare space. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) anticipates the healthcare weight in the Russell 2000 to decrease by 1.7% as a result of these promotions, while forecasting the healthcare weight in the Russell 2000 growth index at 33%, with 17% due to biotech names. 
The firm sees the weighting for healthcare increasing by 5.9% in the Russell Midcap growth index and 1% in the Russell 1000 growth index.
""Obviously healthcare is the cure to this pandemic, so anything and everything in healthcare has generally worked pretty well,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.

""There are so many companies that are trying stuff. Who knows who is going to win or lose out of this?""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (T:6502) plans to gradually unwind its 40% stake in Kioxia Holdings after the world's second-largest flash memory chip firm lists its shares in an IPO later this year, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.
The Japanese industrial conglomerate is considering distributing about half or more of after-tax proceeds from the sale back to shareholders, the sources told Reuters, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.
Toshiba said in a filing with the Tokyo stock exchange on Saturday that it was considering various possibilities for shareholder returns, such as the handling of assets and reviewing its portfolio.
The company said nothing has been decided over its stake in Kioxia, the former flash memory chips unit it sold to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion in 2018. 
Toshiba bought its Kioxia stake as part of that deal.
The initial public offering of Kioxia could be Japan's biggest listing this year, sources have said.
Japanese media reports have estimated market valuation to reach $32 billion in an IPO as early as October, although the coronavirus outbreak has created uncertainty over the timing and valuation of the IPO.
Many overseas fund investors are urging Toshiba to sell the stake on the grounds that flash memory chips, used in smartphones and data storage servers, are a highly volatile business that could sway Toshiba's earnings, the source said.
Toshiba has been facing pressure from activist funds agitating for changes since the company sold 600 billion yen ($5.6 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of the U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. Nearly 70% of its shareholders are non-Japanese.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","Several U.S. states see coronavirus infection spikes, Wall Street unnerved","By Steve Gorman and Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - Troubling spikes in coronavirus infection rates were reported on Friday in several U.S. states, mainly in the South and West, a day before President Donald Trump was due to preside over an Oklahoma campaign rally that will be America's largest indoor gathering in months.
Wall Street jitters over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases as states moved to reopen long-stifled commerce and ease social-distancing measures helped drive down major U.S. stock indexes, reversing earlier gains.
Experts say expanded diagnostic testing accounts for some, but not all, of the growth in cases - numbering at least 2.23 million nationwide on Friday - and that the mounting volume of infections was elevating hospitalizations in some places.
""Clearly the cases are rising rapidly. It's not just a matter of testing more,"" said Dr. Murtaza Akhter, an emergency room physician at Arizona hospitals, noting the lag time between a positive test and severe illness or death. ""The real concern is what is coming up for us in the next week or two."" 
He said the latest wave of cases has put Arizona's major hospitals at or near capacity, and placed the Southwestern state on track to surpass New York at its peak on a per-capita basis.
More than 119,000 Americans have perished from COVID-19 to date, according to Reuters' running tally.
Particularly alarming has been the upward trends several states are reporting in the percentage of positive tests among individuals who are screened, a metric experts refer to as the positivity rate.
The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning, and widely watched data from Johns Hopkins University shows 16 states with average rates over the past week exceeding that level and climbing.
Four were averaging double-digit rates - Arizona at 17%, Alabama at 12%, Washington state at 11% and South Carolina at 10%. The dozen others were led by Utah, Texas, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia, all averaging rates of 7.5% or higher.
Some of the latest daily figures were also disconcerting. 
Arizona, where doctors and public health administrators have called for making face coverings mandatory in public, reported a record 3,246 new infections over the previous 24 hours, nearly twice those tallied on Wednesday. Its latest single-day positivity rate, from Thursday, stood at 18.6%.
In Phoenix, where the president is due to visit a church next Tuesday for a ""Students for Trump"" event, the city council voted at the mayor's urging on Friday to mandate face coverings in most public places. That move came two days after Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order allowing cities and counties to require face coverings.
Florida, one of the last states to impose stay-at-home restrictions and one of the first to begin lifting them, reported 3,822 new cases, a daily record. Its latest positivity figure was 10%, according to the state's health department.
SUNBELT HOT SPOTS
""The situation in Florida and Arizona is really concerning,"" William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University, adding that the spike in cases was not just due to more testing but indicative of an ""underlying outbreak of unknown size.""
Even if the growth in confirmed cases partly reflects transmission among younger people less likely to be hospitalized, those people could infect the elderly and other vulnerable individuals with underlying health conditions. 
""The more community transmission there is, the larger the risk that it infects somebody who is vulnerable. There are quite a lot of old people in Florida and in Arizona,"" Hanage said. 
Another focus of concern was in Oklahoma, where the Trump campaign will hold a rally on Saturday at a 19,000-seat indoor arena in Tulsa, his first such event since lockdowns were imposed across much of the country in March.
Public health experts have warned that assembling thousands of shouting, chanting people inside the BOK Center and an adjacent convention hall poses the risk of creating a ""super-spreader"" event for the highly contagious coronavirus.
Rally organizers plan to hand out masks and hand sanitizer to attendees before they enter the venue, but they will not be required to maintain social distancing or wear face coverings. They also must sign a waiver promising not to sue Trump or the campaign if they contract the virus.
Trump supporters began lining up outside the arena well in advance. One of them, Randall Thom, 60, from Lakefield, Minnesota, said on Friday the United States needed to reopen.

""We can't be afraid of this China virus or whatever you guys want to call it. I'm not afraid of it at all,"" he said. ""And I am so honored that President Trump wants to do a trade for us as citizens, you know, to give us our rights to be normal again.""

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>",Brands tout Black heritage as some shoppers question authenticity,"By Melissa Fares and Siddharth Cavale
NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - L'Oreal SA, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and other multinationals that acquired personal-care brands founded by Black people are moving to reassure their core customers, some of whom have pledged in the wake of racial-justice protests to direct their spending toward only Black-owned companies.
L'Oreal's multicultural beauty brand Carol's Daughter, which was founded by a Black woman in her Brooklyn kitchen in 1993 and named for her mother, said June 10 that it wanted to ""clear some things up"" when it posted a message to its Instagram page.
""Carol's Daughter is Black-founded, and Black-led, and joined the L'Oreal family of brands in 2014,"" it said. Founder Lisa Price ""is still actively involved in all aspects of the business; leading the brand's product development and creative vision,"" the statement said. 
Price is senior vice president and creative director at Carol's Daughter, which is part of the Multi-Cultural Beauty Division at L'Oreal USA, and is also part of the Executive Committee at L'Oreal USA. 
Multinational companies in recent years have snapped up products aimed at Black consumers and marketed those brands as authentically Black, with homemade formulas, personalized offers and feel-good marketing. But in the wake of the protests following the May 25 death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, many consumers are pledging to purchase more goods from Black-owned businesses as a way to bring greater racial equity. SheaMoisture, a personal care company founded in Harlem by Liberian immigrants in 1991, became part of Unilever in 2017 after the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever purchased Sundial Brands, a New York-based beauty firm. Black consumers threatened to boycott its products in June citing its corporate ownership. 
On June 9, Cara Sabin, CEO of Sundial Brands, which operates as a standalone unit within Unilever, posted a message on Instagram to assuage them. ""I am a Black CEO, in White corporate America, leading a brand that exists to serve our Black consumer,"" Sabin wrote. 
Black spending power in the United States is expected to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2021, from about $1.3 trillion last year, according to a report by Nielsen, a data analytics firm that tracks consumer purchases. The Black community makes up 13.4% of the U.S. population, and outspends in relation to other groups on products such as hair care and beauty, and women's fragrances. In 2017, for example, Black shoppers represented 85% of the $63 million total U.S. industry spend on multicultural hair care products.
The group also represented 22.4% and 21% of the total U.S industry spending on women's fragrances and feminine hygiene products that year, respectively, the report showed. 
Sales of hair care products targeted at multi-ethnicities were up 50% year-over-year in the month to May 17, according to Strategic Solutions International, a unit of Nielsen. Black-owned hair care companies represented 14% of the category, but drove 20% of that growth at retail stores. 
But some consumers say they’re paying closer attention to the ownership of a variety of goods and services aimed at Blacks, including bookstores, restaurants and pharmacies. On fundraising site GoFundMe, there are nearly 2,000 pages set up in support of Black-owned businesses, the majority of which were all created in recent weeks. 
“We’ve been dealing with these issues with Black people for how long, right? But there’s just something about this moment,” said Vivian Duker, a Baltimore-based corporate attorney. Earlier this month, she teamed up with a friend to launch a Change.org campaign called “#VERIFYBLACK” that has garnered more than 7,000 signatures. The petition seeks to get social media platforms to identify Black-owned businesses more clearly.
Brands such as Carol's Daughter and SheaMoisture would not qualify as Black-owned businesses, she told Reuters.
Unilever and L'Oreal did not respond to requests for comment.
Procter & Gamble in 2018 acquired Walker & Co, the parent company of Bevel, a men’s grooming line, and Form Beauty, a women's haircare line - both primarily for people of color. Walker & Co Vice President of Marketing Tia Cummings told Reuters that being part of P&G helped widen the availability of its products, making it easier for men and women to find and purchase them. 
Dana Williams-Johnson, Instructor in the Howard University School of Business Marketing Department said companies ""making money off of Black consumers should have leadership that reflects the consumers that purchase the brands."" 
(This story refiles to remove Price's first name in paragraph four) 
""How diverse are these company's boards? How many Black people are at the top with a seat at the boardroom table? How much do all these brands truly value the Black dollar? Those will be the questions that need answers next,"" she added.  
According to Black Enterprise magazine, 187 of the S&P 500 companies did not have a single Black member on their boards in 2019. 
Haircare company Cantu Beauty faced such questions on Instagram this month, with some shoppers noting it was sold to PDC Brands in 2015 and declaring they would boycott the brand in favor of Black-owned businesses. 
So the company hosted an Instagram livestream chat ""with the people behind the brand"" on June 12. ""I want to pull back that curtain and let you guys see exactly what is going on behind the scenes,"" Cantu Beauty's Global Vice President Dametria Mustin said during the livestream.
PDC Brands did not respond to requests for comment.Synthea Hairston, 24, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania called Cantu her ""number 1"" brand for many years. But she refuses to shop the brand again. 

""Now my conscious is eating at me... I will literally be keeping a list with me at all times to make sure what I’m picking up is Black-owned.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Unions representing 17,000 workers at Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disneyland Resort in California have told the state's governor they are not convinced the theme park will be safe enough to reopen by the company's July target date.
In a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, the unions said they had been in discussions with Disney since mid-March when Disneyland was closed to help curb the coronavirus pandemic. The resort in Anaheim, in southern California, houses the Disneyland theme park and the California Adventure Park, both of which the company aims to reopen July 17.
""Unfortunately, despite intensive talks with the company, we are not yet convinced it is safe to reopen the parks,"" the letter from the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions said.
A Disney spokeperson said Friday the company had put the safety of workers and guests ""at the forefront of our planning.""
""We look forward to continued dialogue with our unions on the extensive health and safety protocols, following guidance from public health experts,"" the spokesperson said.
The California Department of Public Health said theme parks would be able to welcome guests when the state reaches Stage 3 of its phased reopening plan. It is currently in Stage 2.
The agency said it would release guidelines on how to minimize coronavirus spread at theme parks, but said there was no timetable yet for when the guidance would be issued.Disney plans to reopen Florida's Walt Disney World on July 11 with extensive measures ranging from requiring masks and temperature checks to suspending activities such as parades that create crowds. 
The Disneyland unions said the company had accommodated some concerns. But there were ""numerous questions Disney has not answered, including any serious discussion of 'testing' - which has been the cornerstone of plans for other areas of the entertainment industry reopening,"" the unions said.
""Therefore, at this point we do not know if the resort can be operated safely,"" the letter said.

(Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR) said on Friday it is extending furlough programs for 5,300 of its employees in Spain and the United Kingdom in its latest effort to cope with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
""This will be effective from 20th May till 30th September and affects all Airbus Operations SL employees in Spain (with some exceptions), which means around 3,100 employees"", an Airbus spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement 
""Airbus Helicopters and Airbus DS employees in Spain are not impacted"", the spokesman said.
In the United Kingdom, the period of furlough for about 2,200 Airbus workers will start on July 20 and end on Aug. 9, the statement said.
""In France, all employees of the commercial aircraft division are in some way affected"", the spokesman said. He added about 29,500 employees in France were working on average about 30% shorter weeks.
Sources told Reuters in May that Europe's largest aerospace group was exploring restructuring plans involving the possibility of ""deep"" job cuts as it braced for a prolonged coronavirus crisis after furloughing thousands of workers.
The company had told senior staff it must be ""resized"" in plans to be set out around end-June. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a global airline crisis, with carriers and suppliers pleading for help.

The implementation of the rights plan will prevent investors from acquiring 20% or more of the company's outstanding common shares without complying with certain provisions of the plan, Cineplex said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= Cineworld scrapped the deal last week citing what it termed Cineplex's breaches in the merger agreement between the cinema operators. The rights plan has not been adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of Cineplex, it added. 
Cineplex said the rights plan is subject to ratification by the company's shareholders and will have an initial term of three years.

Mulqueen's retirement is the latest management switch-up to touch space station operations, as NASA's space station program manager Kirk Shireman retires Friday to take a job in the private sector. 
The move comes as the space station, a football field-sized research post 250 miles above the ground, undergoes a shift to commercial operations and as NASA increasingly welcomes companies to stimulate private space tourism.
John Mulholland, who managed Boeing's Starliner program during a high-profile test mission failure last year, will take the helm of Boeing's space station operations as the company renegotiates its decades-old contract with NASA. 
Boeing is the prime contractor for the U.S. wing of the international space station on a contract worth roughly $20 billion since its conception in the late 1990's. The company has built and managed much of the station for NASA. 
Boeing's senior vice president of space and launch, Jim Chilton, told employees in an email Friday that Mulholland's new role will ""reflect the continuing evolution of the International Space Station,"" whose 20-year anniversary of housing humans in low-Earth orbit comes later this year. 

NASA's Kathy Lueders, who oversaw the program that funded Starliner's development, was elevated to the space agency's human spaceflight chief last week after predecessor Doug Loverro resigned.

Investing.com - The Dow claimed a weekly win despite rounding off the week on a sour note as investors assessed whether Apple's decision to close some its U.S. stores in the midst of rising infections was a sign that parts of the U.S. could be forced to roll back the easing of some restrictions to curtail growing outbreaks.    
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.80%, or 208 points, after racking up as many as 371 points intraday. The S&P 500 fell  0.62%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.03%.

The move from Apple, however, appeared to exacerbate some investor concerns that an ongoing rise in coronavirus cases could hamper the pace of economic reopening.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Friday they will resume pre-pandemic manufacturing schedules at their U.S. plants from June 22. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). has said it aims to be back to normal output levels by month’s end.
Ford’s move comes two weeks earlier than planned, a sign that its supply base and workforce ramp up has gone more smoothly than anticipated. Once Fiat Chrysler restores a second shift at its Jeep Cherokee assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, on Monday it will be back to its previous production, a spokeswoman said.
Since reopening after a two-month long shutdown in mid-May, U.S. automakers have been careful to pace their restart. They have faced fragile supply lines ruptured by quarantines in Mexico and a labor force still reluctant to go back to work and risk exposure to the coronavirus. At the same time, sales are recovering faster than analysts’ expected, with pickups and SUVs fueling demand.
Earlier this week, Fiat Chrysler canceled summer shutdowns at two truck plants in Michigan, its Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio and its muscle-car factory in Canada. But it will temporarily close three other factories -- including the Jeep plant in Illinois and its minivan factory in Ontario -- for one or two weeks in July or August.
GM plans to resume normal production levels by the end of June.
“We’re still targeting to be at normal capacity by the end of June or sooner, if possible, but obviously it’s a very fluid situation,” Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said last week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The massive stock market rally in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic has been built largely on optimism and has overlooked potential negatives that could end up catching investors off guard, Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, said in a client note.
Much of the rally seems to be based on injections of liquidity by the U.S. Federal Reserve and stimulus payments by the Treasury, which investors assume will bring about a financial recovery without major negative consequences, the veteran distressed debt investor said in the note https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos dated Thursday.

""In other words, the fundamental outlook may be positive on balance, but with listed security prices where they are, the odds aren't in investors' favor,"" he said.
High-profile hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stan Druckenmiller said recently they were becoming more bullish on stocks. Jones' speech, reported by Bloomberg, was at the Economic Club of New York, and Druckenmiller spoke to CNBC.

LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Switzerland's Attorney General's Office (OAG) has opened a criminal probe into commodity miner and trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) over allegations it failed to have measures in place to prevent corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The Swiss-based, London-listed multinational, which is subject to various international inquiries, said it would cooperate with the probe, but declined to comment further.
In a statement on Friday, the OAG said it opened the criminal proceedings against Glencore this month, but it was not possible to predict the timeframe or course of the case.
Prosecutors began investigations against ""unknown perpetrators"" after receiving a complaint in 2017 on suspicion of bribery of foreign public officials, the OAG said.
Glencore also faces corruption and bribery investigations by several other entities including the U.S. Department of Justice and Britain's Serious Fraud Office.
It has said it was cooperating with all proceedings.
Canada's regulatory authorities fined a Glencore-controlled subsidiary in 2018 after allegations of inadequate financial disclosures in the DRC.
QUESTIONS OVER FORMER ISRAELI PARTNER
The numerous probes and exposure to coal have seen Glencore's shares underperform peers.
Glencore mines copper and cobalt from Congo, where its links to former partner and Israeli billionaire businessman Dan Gertler have been the subject of scrutiny.
Gertler was sanctioned by the United States in 2017 over allegations he used his friendship with former DRC President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals. 
He denied all allegations of impropriety at the time.
Congo Mines Minister Willy Kitobo Samsoni and a spokesman for the presidency were not immediately available to comment.
Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt, used in batteries for electric vehicles, and Africa's biggest miner of copper.
The top brass at Glencore is expected to step down this year after years of leadership under South African CEO Ivan Glasenberg.

Glencore's founder Marc Rich was indicted in 1983 for exploiting the U.S. embargo against Iran, tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. He fled to Switzerland, where he remained a fugitive pursued by the Justice Department until he was pardoned by then President Bill Clinton in 2001.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","Wall Street dips on news of Apple Store closures, prospects of new shutdowns","By Stephen Culp (NYSE:CULP)
(Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Friday, reversing earlier gains as spiking cases of COVID-19 and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s announcement of fresh store closures heightened concerns that a new round of lockdowns would be imposed and delay an economic recovery.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were in the red after two days of range-bound, sideways movement.
""It went from a fairly positive day to a weak day fairly dramatically and quickly,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Which doesn't surprise me for a summer Friday during a pandemic and extreme economic weakness and political uncertainty heading into the weekend.""
Apple Inc announced it is temporarily shutting some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina.
New cases of COVID-19 set records across at least six U.S. states, and mandated mask use is becoming more common as economies continue reopening. China, where the pandemic originated but had been contained, also reported an uptick in new cases of the disease.
""Throughout the week there have been increasing news items regarding a spike of COVID cases in the U.S. and around the world, and that's led to fears of the economy not recovering as quickly as people hoped,"" Tuz added.
""And Apple closing stores is a good example of that.""
Still, for the week, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are all on track to post solid percentage gains.
The S&P 500 and the Dow are now about 9% and 13% shy of their respective all-time highs reached in February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq hovers around 1% below its last closing high reached on June 10, after breaching that level earlier in the session.
Trading volume is typically light on summer Fridays as investors head into the weekend.
But Friday marks ""quadruple witching,"" in which futures and options expiries occur, and that typically translates into elevated volume and liquidity. The S&P is synchronizing its delayed rebalancing to take advantage of that liquidity, which could drive volumes even higher.
In a video conference, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned the economic recovery from the pandemic is set to be challenging and there will be no quick fix.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.56 points, or 1.02%, to 25,813.54, the S&P 500 lost 26.47 points, or 0.85%, to 3,088.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 53.46 points, or 0.54%, to 9,889.59.
Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, 10 were trading in the red, with healthcare as the sole gainer.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, the world's largest movie theater operator, dipped 2.0% after its announcement that it would reopen theaters at about 450 locations in the United States next month was tempered by renewed shutdown fears.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 117 new highs and 2 new lows.

With the advent of autonomous driving, carmakers have been forced to link up radar, camera and ultrasonic sensors and connect them to braking and steering components, something which requires thousands of lines of software code.
""There is a race to create automotive operating systems. We are seeing that many non-automotive players are building up competence in this area,"" Senger told Reuters. 
By 2025, VW wants to increase its own share of software development on its cars to 60%, from 10% at present, and to design the electronics and vehicle architecture as well.
Volkswagen board member Thomas Ulbrich said in March that U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla (O:TSLA) has a 10-year start on rivals when it comes to building electric cars and software.
""In future there will likely be fewer automotive operating systems than carmakers,"" Senger explained.
Volkswagen will define the core operating system but may seek an open source approach to enhance elements of it.
""The operating system is not something that we will control on our own. We will define its core and then quickly include open-source components, to create standards. This will create opportunities for partnerships,"" Senger said. 
Adopting an open-source approach to development with external partners is a new approach, Senger said. ""This is almost unimaginable for traditional carmakers. But this is the key breakthrough opportunity.""
In January, Volkswagen launched Car.Software, an independent unit responsible for developing lines of code, with around 3,000 digital experts and a budget of more than 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion). By 2025 it wants to have more than 10,000 software experts.
Senger said it has received many inquires from other carmakers about whether they can participate in the project.
""We are in the process of looking at the opportunities,"" Senger said, adding that Volkswagen wants to create a new system, rather than integrate legacy software from rivals.

""This will filter out many who are not willing to do this,"" Senger said about potential partners.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Apple to shut some U.S. stores again due to rising COVID-19 cases,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Friday it is temporarily shutting some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina in the United States, as novel coronavirus cases continue to rise in the country.
Shares of the company, which said the closure would affect 11 stores in these states, were down 0.5%.
Apple had planned to reopen about 100 U.S. stores, mostly with curbside pickup but some with walk-in service, in late May as lockdown restrictions began to ease.
However, cases in the United States have been steadily rising, with over 2.2 million people infected and at least 118,396 people dead.
In a letter to Apple customers in May, Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's retail chief, had said the company would look at data on a local basis and that re-closings were a possibility based on that data.

""These are not decisions we rush into — and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,"" O'Brien had said.

1299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Roaring U.S. Auto Sales Spur JPMorgan to Raise Price Targets,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. auto market is bouncing back nearly as fast as it fell, making the hope of a V-shaped recovery real.
New vehicle sales and used vehicle prices are recovering in May and June almost as fast as they declined in March and April, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). “We didn’t call it, nor did we expect it, but numerous data points all suggest the U.S. auto industry is in the midst of a once fabled but clearly no longer mythical ‘V-shaped recovery,’” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a report.
That rebound prompted JPMorgan to raise its 2020 U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate (SAAR) -- a closely watched sales measure -- by one million, to 14.5 million. The figure, materially above implied estimates from IHS Automotive of 13.2 million, also pushed JPMorgan to raise earnings per share estimates for automakers and suppliers, and led to higher price targets for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE).

“The comeback in sales and prices has been faster than most anyone presumed,” Brinkman said. “And because the shutdown of production lasted as long as it did amidst the more resilient than expected demand, inventories are now lean (even sparse), supporting an even sharper rebound in production, which comes as a relief to the entire supply chain.”

Brinkman prefers General Motors to Ford because of its greater geographic exposure to North America and China, as a percentage of total sales. In addition, General Motors offers a “superior margin and [free cash flow] profile.” The analyst raised the price target on GM to $33 from $29, and repeated an overweight rating on the shares. At the same time, Brinkman raised his price-target on the neutral-rated Ford, citing a chance that the shares may look more attractive in the second half as liquidity concerns fade.
Tesla’s price target was also raised, to $275 from $240, though Brinkman continues to rate the stock underweight due to rich valuations. Ferrari’s price target was raised to $145 from $133 following a better-than-expected recovery in sales after a Covid-19-induced slump. JPMorgan maintained its neutral rating on Ferrari, also citing valuations.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>","Gucci hikes handbag prices to curb coronavirus hit, says analyst","MILAN (Reuters) - Gucci has raised the price of handbags by up to 9%, joining rivals Louis Vuitton and Chanel in a bet their brands will still lure the wealthy, a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) report said on Friday, as top luxury brands try to shake off the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The luxury fashion industry, which plays a large role in the economies of Italy and France, has been hard-hit by lockdowns that forced the closure of stores across the globe and could face years of uncertainty as many people's incomes are likely to fall. 
Jefferies luxury goods analyst Flavio Cereda compared prices in various countries of two Gucci handbags - the $2,290 Dionysus and the $2,980 Zumi - in May and June and found price increases for both in Italy, Britain and China of between 5% and 9%. 
A spokeswoman for Gucci's owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) declined to comment.
Analyst Cereda said in a report the price change would narrow the gap between handbag prices in Europe, which are lower than in major luxury markets such as China, where shoppers have queued at stores as they emerged from lockdown. 
Still, the price in euros of the Dionysus in China was 28% higher than in Italy after the increase. The gap stood at 23% for the Zumi, Cereda's data found.
""We are unsurprised that Gucci, another brand with strong brand heat, is following suit with opportunistic price increases in an attempt to mitigate revenue contraction,"" said Cereda, who in May cut his rating on Kering to ""hold"" from ""buy"". 
Chanel said in May it was increasing prices on its handbags and some small leather goods worldwide to reflect higher raw materials costs because of the supply chain disruption following the coronavirus crisis.

A Reuters review of online prices for handbags by LVMH's (PA:LVMH) star label Louis Vuitton also found increases in Europe and the United States.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Fed to set bank capital levels via pre-pandemic stress test model: Quarles,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to rely on a stress test built before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic to set big bank capital requirements but will make use of pandemic-specific analysis to inform whether banks can pay out funds to investors, a top official said Friday.
Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles said in a speech that the Fed is testing banks against three possible economic trajectories of varying severity to see how they perform, citing ""unprecedented uncertainty"" about the pandemic's long-term economic impact. Those results will help the Fed decide whether banks can pay out extra funds to investors via dividends or share repurchases.
Quarles's remarks Friday mark the first details the Fed has provided on its ramped-up stress tests, which the central bank said it was augmenting in April with pandemic-related ""sensitivity analyses.""
The extra portions of the test will see how banks perform against three ""plausible"" economic outcomes: a rapid ""V-shaped"" recovery, a slower ""U-shaped"" recovery, and a tumultuous ""W-shaped"" recovery. The latter two are expected to be more severe than the original Fed stress test, according to Quarles.
However, the Fed is not going to use those results to dictate how much banks must hold as a capital cushion. Rather, Quarles said the original test scenario will continue to provide the basis for each bank's capital levels. Instead, the Fed will consider the extra analysis in evaluating bank plans to distribute excess capital, including through dividends and share repurchases.
""The sensitivity analysis will help the (Fed) Board assess whether additional measures are advisable for certain banks or certain future developments,"" said Quarles, according to prepared remarks.
Quarles said banks will be able to draw up capital plans after receiving their test results, and the Fed will announce each firm's final capital requirements later this year before they take effect in the fourth quarter.
While banks grumbled about the late change to this year's test, Quarles acknowledged that the Fed's original scenario published in February had been overtaken by the actual economic downturn in several ways, forcing adjustments.
""We simply would not have been doing our jobs if we had just run the test using a scenario framed before the economy began to deteriorate in March,"" he said, according to prepared remarks.

The Fed is due to publish the 2020 test results on June 25. Quarles said the Fed will provide firm-specific data on its original test as in prior years, but only provide aggregate data on how banks performed in the additional pandemic analysis.

The former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive is due to take up the job on July 1, in the middle of an upheaval for the firm as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic and reverses years of production expansion to focus on its most profitable models. 
Addressing shareholders at an annual meeting, De Meo said he shared a ""sense of urgency"" with teams at Renault to deliver on its restructuring.
""I've always liked to go where there are challenges,"" De Meo said, adding he was very conscious that Renault faced problems. 
""I know that with everyone's help, we can make Renault one of the best turnaround surprises in your investment portfolio.""
The coronavirus crisis has forced carmakers around the world to temporarily halt manufacturing, while dealerships also closed, compounded existing problems at Renault, which is also trying to relaunch an alliance with Japan's Nissan (T:7201). 
De Meo is expected to announce a new strategic plan by the end of the year or early next year, which would include a vision for the models Renault wants to focus on. 
The Italian-born executive had to delay his arrival at Renault due to a non-compete clause in his former contract. He will work alongside the current interim CEO Clotilde Delbos and Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard. 
De Meo recently asked staff to prepare him with memos on the group's brands and their performance, people at Renault said, adding he had taken interest and been complementary about its Alpine sports car ranges for example. 

Several factories in France are under review, including the one that makes Alpine vehicles in Dieppe.

Citing the example of Trieste airport in northern Italy, Alitalia said it was being charged to resume services from that facility at more than double the rate applied to its competitors. 
The airline, which is in the process of being re-nationalised after years of difficult private management and failed restructuring attempts, said it had sent evidence of what it described as ""economic discrimination"" to the relevant authorities, adding this was a trend seen at the majority of Italy's airports. 
""Alitalia's efforts to become more efficient require an end to the competitive asymmetry existing with foreign companies that receive equal service,"" the company said in a statement.
Alitalia added that being able to resume its flight connections depended on how quickly demand recovers from the impact of the coronavirus and on ""obtaining from airports economic conditions for the restart of flights in line with those offered to other airlines"".

Trieste airport could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Glencore-Merafe Chrome Venture (J:MRFJ) runs seven chrome mines and five ferrochrome plants in South Africa, and employs a total of 11,448, including contractors, the  Merafe  website says.
""The (consultation) process is as a result of the worsening operating environment across the South African ferrochrome industry, including unsustainable electricity pricing,"" a company release on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) said.
The process of laying off employees refers to the section 189 of the Labour Relations Act in the South African constitution, which requires companies to consult with employees and unions before it implements job cuts.
""Despite significant investments in an attempt to make the operations more competitive, the parties have continued to come under substantial operational and financial pressures,"" the statement said.
Glencore declined to comment on the number of employees that would be affected. Merafe referred queries to Glencore's Johannesburg office, which did not answer phone calls.
The statement said smelter operations in Lydenburg, Wonderkop, Boshoek and Lion would be affected as well as the Eastern and Western Chrome Mines. 
South Africa, the world's top chrome ore producer, implemented a strict lockdown in late March to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The lockdown forced many mines to halt production and the Glencore-Merafe Chrome Venture was among those to declare force majeure, releasing it from contractual obligations.
Swiss-based Glencore owns 79.5% of the Glencore-Merafe Chrome Venture, which has a total capacity of 2.3 million tonnes of ferrochrome per annum.
President Cyril Ramaphosa eased the lockdown restrictions in April, allowing mines to operate at full capacity but by then miners, as well as banks, retailers and manufacturers were announcing job reduction plans.

The National Treasury's worst case projections estimate the country could lose as many 7 million jobs due to COVID-19.

As part of the change of domicile plan, shareholders who oppose it have the right to exercise withdrawal rights.
Controlling investor Lagfin, which supports the change in domicile, said in a statement late on Wednesday that it was willing to buy up to 38 million more shares from shareholders who oppose the move, at a price of 8 euros each for a total of 304 million euros ($341 million). 
The transaction was due to end Friday at 1600 GMT and Campari shares were up 2% at 7.80 euros by 1443 GMT. 
Lagfin's pledge to buy additional shares is expected to reduce the cost for the group to liquidate withdrawn shares and increase the chances that the redomiciliation is approved at next week's shareholders' meeting, Berstein analysts said in a comment.
The Aperol maker announced in February that it planned to move its registered office to the Netherlands and introduce an enhanced loyalty share scheme, in a move aimed at increasing M&A opportunities.
Shareholders approved the plan at a meeting in March, subject to several conditions. They are due to vote again on the move on June 26.
Lagfin already committed in February to spend 76.5 million euros to buy withdrawn shares at the withdrawal price of 8.376 euros each and support the group, which said it would reject the redomiciliation if the cost to liquidate withdrawn shares was too high.
Campari plans to set up a registered office in the Netherlands but keep its headquarters in Milan and its listing on the Milan bourse.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with a bang Friday, and stocks continued to trade higher mid-morning to stay on course for their fourth weekly gain in five, amid ever-more frequent anecdotal signs of companies returning to more normal levels of business in the wake of the pandemic.
By 11:15 AM ET (1615 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 186 points, at 26,366 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.
Stocks were helped by the optimism in the crude oil market, which rose on firming hopes that the global crude market will return to balance soon as demand around the northern hemisphere picks up.
Energy companies Occidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) and Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) jumped 4.8% and  2.2%, as U.S. crude futures hit their highest level in nearly two weeks.
Positive news from the corporate sphere helped the market shrug off lingering signs of trouble with the Covid-19 virus. California, Florida and North Carolina all urged mandatory mask use on Thursday as at least six states set daily records for new coronavirus cases. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock rose 1.7% after the carmaker said it will return to full production on Monday, two weeks ahead of schedule.
Among individual stocks, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) surged 6.2% to a new all-time high on the back of a steady flow of content acquisitions that analysts believe will strengthen its paying subscriber base. Rosenblatt Securities reportedly raised its price target for the streaming company to $275, compared to last night's close of $225.28. 
Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN), another stock beloved of the new army of retail traders, also rose 5.4% after the casino operator said it has now reopened 30 of 41 properties across the country. Airline JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU), by contrast, only edged up 0.4% after saying it will start ticket sales on 30 new routes.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, meanwhile, ground higher, ignoring the furor over its treatment of political ads, which has included calls by various pressure groups for a boycott of the social media giant. 
Elsewhere, Gold Futures were also strong at the end of a week that has seen some big stimulus announcements from the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Bank of England. Big emerging markets including Indonesia and, on Friday, Russia, have also cut interest rates sharply this week.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's top administrative court upheld a 50 million-euro fine ($56 million) imposed last year on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google for breaching European Union online privacy rules, it said on Friday. 
Although representing a tiny fraction of Google's financial resources, the penalty sent ripples through Silicon Valley and is still the biggest fine imposed for such a breach.
A spokeswoman for Google said in a written statement on Friday Google would review possible changes.
""People expect to understand and control how their data is used, and we've invested in industry-leading tools that help them do both,"" the statement said.
""This case was not about whether consent is needed for personalised advertising, but about how exactly it should be obtained. In light of this decision, we will now review what changes we need to make.""
The French regulator CNIL in January last year found the world's biggest search engine lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informs users about its handling of personal data and failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.
Its decision relied on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the biggest shake-up of data privacy laws in more than two decades, which came into force in 2018.
It allows users to better control their personal data and gives regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations.
France's supreme administrative court, the Council of State, on Friday confirmed the CNIL's reading of the case. 

""(The court) also notes that the information available is sometimes incomplete, in particular regarding the data retention period and the purposes of the various processing operations carried out by Google,"" it said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) will retain control of T-Mobile (O:TMUS) should Japan's Softbank (T:9984) liquidate its stake, CEO Tim Hoettges said on Friday as he vowed to claim top spot in the U.S. market.
Speaking at the German group's annual general meeting, Hoettges said that Softbank wants to reduce its 23% stake in U.S. operator T-Mobile to bolster its finances because of the demanding economic environment.
Deutsche Telekom has the right of first refusal under a four-year shareholder pact that took effect when T-Mobile's $23 billion takeover of rival Sprint closed in April, he added. 
The German company owns 43% of T-Mobile but the shareholder pact with Softbank assures it of strategic control and allows it to consolidate results of its largest subsidiary at group level.
""We will become No.1 in the United States,"" Hoettges said earlier in his set-piece address to the AGM, which was held online for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Talks with Softbank continue, Hoettges said. 
Capital markets publication IFR reported on Friday that Softbank could liquidate about two thirds of its stake, with T-Mobile likely to repurchase part of that while Deutsche Telekom could buy enough shares to lift its stake above 50%.
The U.S. merger has cemented T-Mobile's position as the country's No.3 wireless provider behind AT&T (N:T) and Verizon (N:VZ).
Hoettges also confirmed Deutsche Telekom's guidance for this year, emphasising the group's resilience in the face of the pandemic. He added that its outlook would be updated during the second quarter to account for the U.S. deal.
""We want to continue growing,"" he said. ""In terms of revenue. In terms of earnings from operations. And in terms of free cash flow.""
Deutsche Telekom has forecast core profit this year of 25.5 billion euros ($28.6 billion) and proposed a 2019 dividend of 0.60 euros.

Its Frankfurt-listed shares were up 1.4% at 1327 GMT.

FRANKFURT/MANILA (Reuters) - Wirecard's chief executive quit on Friday as the German payments firm's search for $2.1 billion of missing cash hit a dead end in the Philippines and it scrambled to secure a financial lifeline from its banks.
Markus Braun, who built Wirecard into one of the hottest financial technology investments in Europe before questions over accounting saw it crash in value, leaves the firm facing a looming cash crunch and mired in allegations of fraud.
Braun resigned just hours after releasing a video blaming Wirecard's problems on fraud, saying he accepted ""responsibility for all business transactions lies with the CEO.""
Wirecard, which has seen nearly 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) wiped off its market value in just two days, had been a welcome technology success story in Germany, a country better known for its prowess in heavy industry.
But it has been under scrutiny since a whistleblower alleged that it owed its success in part to a web of sham transactions, a scandal that some fear will now damage Germany's reputation.
Wirecard said in a statement that James Freis, a former compliance officer at Germany's stock exchange, had been appointed as the firm's interim CEO.
It is holding emergency talks with banks to secure a financial lifeline, three people with knowledge of the matter said, after its auditor, EY, would not sign off on its accounts.
On Thursday, Wirecard warned that loans of roughly 2 billion euros ($2.24 billion) could be terminated if its annual report is not published on Friday and it has until evening to strike a deal with the banks, the sources told Reuters.
Wirecard's share price dropped by as much as 50% on Friday in a continuation of Thursday's rout, with the stock hitting 20 euros, a far cry from the 200 euros it was priced at when it joined Germany's prestigious blue-chip Dax index in late 2018.
""Wirecard is a company that has caused serious damage to the credibility and trust of the Dax with international investors. This will have significant consequences for the image of the German capital market,"" Carola Rinker, a German economist specialising in accountancy fraud, said.
Wirecard's shares tanked again on Friday after two Philippine banks, BPI and BDO, said it was not a client of theirs and alleged that documents had been falsified.
'SPURIOUS' DOCUMENT
Braun, who has aggressively defended Wirecard against allegations of accounting fraud, had earlier said that the firm could itself have been the victim, without giving details.
""Attempts by Wirecard to appear as the victim in the missing 1.9 billion euros have been undone within hours of Wirecard management’s video yesterday evening,"" said Neil Campling at Mirabaud, the only analyst to have a price target of zero.
EY had regularly approved Wirecard's accounts in recent years, and its refusal to sign off for 2019 confirms failings found in an external probe by KPMG in April.
While Wirecard did not give any details of where the missing money is alleged to have gone, statements by the two Philippine banks denying any involvement spooked investors in the firm.
""The document claiming the existence of a Wirecard account with BDO is a falsified document and carries forged signatures of bank officers,"" BDO said, adding that it had reported the matter to the Philippines' central bank.
BPI also said Wirecard was not a client, adding:
""Their external auditor presented to us a document that claimed that they are a client. We have determined that the document is spurious. We continue to investigate this matter,"" BPI said in a statement.
The Wirecard scandal, which was extensively investigated by the Financial Times newspaper and has been the subject of several reports by so-called short sellers, has also damaged the standing of German financial regulator Bafin.

""Bafin looked on for far too long,” Fabio De Masi, a German lawmaker said, adding that the agency must be improved.

ATHENS/LONDON (Reuters) - Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) has hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS to sell two portfolios of soured loans worth about 7 billion euros as it scrambles to clean up its balance sheet and tackle a new debt crisis triggered by the novel coronavirus, sources told Reuters.
Piraeus, Greece's largest lender by assets which is 26%-owned by the country's HFSF bank rescue fund, aims to conclude the securitisation of the two loan portfolios between the end of 2020 and the start of 2021, three sources familiar with the matter said.
JPMorgan has won the mandate for Piraeus' biggest debt auction, dubbed Project Vega, which consists of 5 billion euros ($5.62 billion) of non-performing loans (NPLs), while UBS is handling the 2 billion euro Project Phoenix sale, the sources said.
Advisory firm Alantra is working on both projects alongside the other banks, they said.
JPMorgan, UBS and Alantra declined to comment while Piraeus was not immediately available.
Piraeus may only pocket between 250 and 300 million euros from the sales given the rich discounts demanded by investors to ease balance sheet clean-ups of troubled Southern European lenders, one of the sources said.
Both transactions will take advantage of Greece's Hercules bad debt reduction scheme which provides state guarantees for the senior tranches of the securitisations.
The sale comes as Greek lenders, including Alpha Bank, resume efforts to divest NPLs after the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Negotiations to find a new owner for Piraeus' smaller Iris portfolio, consisting of 600 million euros of private debt such as credit card and leasing loans, are in the final stages, the first source said.
The bank, led by Christos Megalou, has also bundled about 300 million euros of secured corporate debt in a portfolio known as Trinity which is up for sale, the same source said.
Project Phoenix consists only of residential mortgages while Project Vega has 1 billion euros of residential mortgages and 4 billion euros of commercial loans.

One of the sources said Project Vega - comprising 53,000 loans with 43,000 real estate properties as underlying collateral - will be securitised through three different special purpose vehicles to provide flexibility.

The move, requested by State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, is part of the former businessman's strategy to make the country's telecoms giant more profitable and reduce its dependence on mobile services. 
However, it leaves Bukalapak without anyone from its founding team, after co-founder and chief executive Achmad Zaky stepped down in January.
Bukalapak, valued at more than $2.5 billion during its last fundraising round in October, is backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd , China's Ant Financial , and Korea's  Shinhan Financial Group  Co (NYSE:SHG) Ltd (KS:055550). [L3N26P106] 
The company says it has served 92 million users in Indonesia's fast-growing e-commerce market, which has attracted foreign investors due to surging smartphone use and rising middle class income. But it is trailing Softbank-backed Indonesian company Tokopedia and Tencent-backed regional rival SEA (N:SE).

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) said on Friday it is buying a chain of laundromats in Brazil to be renamed Omo, after the world's No. 2 laundry detergent, in what the consumer goods giant said could be a precursor to other similar deals elsewhere.
The acquisition of unlisted Acerte Group and its chain of 123 franchised laundromats and ""express"" tailors for an undisclosed sum is part of Unilever's effort to boost its exposure to health and hygiene related areas, the Anglo-Dutch company said. 
""The idea is to have the largest franchise in the sector in the country within five years,"" Eduardo Campanella, Unilever's vice president of marketing in Brazil, said in an interview, adding that the company could quadruple the existing number of outlets.
The creation of the chain echoes on a smaller scale Procter & Gamble Co's (N:PG) expanding presence in the U.S. drycleaning and wash-and-fold space, where it operates in more than 800 locations named for Tide, the one detergent brand that outsells Omo on a global basis.
Campanella said Unilever has seen the recent growth in public concern about hygiene as an opportune moment to boost its exposure to personal care and beauty lines of business at a moment when margins in its food business are under pressure. 

Unilever, maker of food brands such as Hellmann's and Knorr, in April ditched its annual sales targets as consumer consumption habits changed. Campanella said the laundry franchise business could be expanded to some of the other 162 countries where Unilever has a presence.

The group is targeting markets in the United States, Chile and Spain, the head of Global Power Generation Antonio Cammisecra told Reuters. In the United States a focus will be on Texas, where the group has wind and solar assets.
""We have huge renewable energy pipelines in these countries where there’s also a promising market for hydrogen too,” he said. 
Enel, which owns Spanish utility Endesa will be installing electrolysers – which use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen - at its solar and wind farms to produce hydrogen to be used for energy storage or sold on to industrial clients to help decarbonize their processes.
Cammisecra said the group wanted to build large-scale plants that would typically have a quarter the capacity of the renewable plant it is built next to. 
""We'll start with 2-3 projects in the first year to see if the business case is sound,” he said.
Enel is talking to companies interested in signing long-term contracts to offtake the hydrogen to fuel their businesses, such as chemicals, steel, cement and refining companies.
Though today expensive for widespread use, Brussels believes hydrogen could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU’s Green Deal. 
Earlier this month Germany earmarked 9 billion euros to expand its hydrogen capacity in a bid to meet emission targets. 
""If we realistically want to boost the contribution of renewables to Europe's ambitions to cut CO2 emissions by 50-55% by 2030, we'll need to find a role for hydrogen,” Cammisecra said.
Enel, the world’s biggest private renewables player, is looking to raise its green capacity to around 60 gigawatts by 2022 from 46 GW now. 

It is planning to phase out Italy’s coal-fired generating capacity by 2025 in line with the country’s law. ""Despite all the complications created by COVID, we’re most definitely on track to be out of coal in Italy by 2025,"" Cammisecra said.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Time is money: the armchair traders of lockdown,"By Colm Fulton
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - At 7am on Friday morning, Dean d'Arco, 31, a phone shop manager from Belfast, Northern Ireland, logged on for his last day as a round-the-clock armchair stock market trader.
During almost three months on coronavirus furlough, he was one of a swelling number of stuck-at-home punters using their free time to ride a climbing stock market which rebounded after a giant slump in March. 
As lockdown lifts, d'Arco is now returning to work, but he doesn't plan on giving up his new-found interest in financial markets entirely. 
""It's given me a routine, a reason to get out of bed in the morning,"" d'Arco said of his time on furlough, adding that his new hobby was also a welcome social activity. 
Along with his friend Damian McVeigh, 31, the pair put in 70-plus hours a week on trading apps, staking a substantial part of their savings in the process, despite neither having prior experience in financial markets.
""I only play with savings I can afford to lose and I've made a good return and have no regrets,"" McVeigh, who is a quantity-surveyor by trade, said.
Around the world, online retail brokers are booming this year, with global app eToro increasing new account openings by 400%, compared to the same period last year.
EToro customers invested $300 billion in Q1, part of a global surge in activity on retail trading platforms which played a role in the recent stock market rally. 
""We began to see record levels of activity when the coronavirus pandemic started,"" said Johanna Kull, an economist for Swedish trading app Avanza. 
""Stock market gains have mostly been led by government and central bank stimulus, but increased retail trading activity has pushed up prices and caused volatility in specific small cap stocks,"" she said. 
McVeigh said he has invested around 5000 pounds ($6,300) and made a 20% profit by trading around 80 companies and commodities such as oil. 
A WhatsApp messenger group chat set up to plan a now-cancelled holiday became an active stock market discussion forum when McVeigh started talking about the plight of his ex-employer, a listed company he had staff shares in. 
""FEELS LIKE BETTING""
Fuelled by the stimulus packages, trading indexes have rallied hard since lows in March, with the Nasdaq last week briefly beating the 10,000 mark for the first time.
Two weeks ago, a flurry of activity was seen in bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt stocks with Hertz (N:HTZ), Chesapeake (N:CHK), Whiting (N:WLL) and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) rising 300% to 500% before pulling back a bit, leaving seasoned traders scratching their heads.
""It feels like betting when it comes to struggling companies,"" said McVeigh, who bought shares in Valaris, a company which he doesn't expect to survive but still made him a profit. 
The pair say that in general, though, buying stocks feels different to gambling because it is not a win-or-lose proposition like betting on the outcome of a football match. 
More recently, anxiety about a second wave of coronavirus infections has hit markets, with the S&P 500 last week suffering its worst weekly decline since March 20.
""I didn't get too badly caught by the big dip. I took most of my capital out when some stocks rose beyond their pre-pandemic level, as that just felt unnatural to me,"" said McVeigh, adding he wished he'd taken out all his funds.
Both men said it will be impossible to trade as intensely when they return to work, so they plan to change their trading strategy to focus on long-term stocks.
""The way things are now, if you take your eyes off it for a moment you can lose serious cash,"" McVeigh said, adding: ""But I won't stop, I enjoy it too much.""
D'Arco said he plans to buy into innovative tech companies, ones he calls ""future game changers"".
McVeigh, the more pragmatic of pair, said: ""I expect there to be a crash soon. I plan on picking up undervalued stocks when that happens and hold them for long-term gain.""

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>","China to revamp benchmark equity index, STAR as pursues growth","By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will revamp its benchmark equity index by introducing more high-tech strength and removing loss-making companies, as it turns to its capital markets to bolster its economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
While the crisis has aggravated tensions between Beijing and Washington, China has increased its focus on capital markets to foster growth as it seeks technological self-sufficiency. 
China will include depository receipts issued by red-chip companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and stocks in the technology and innovation STAR Market in the Shanghai composite index (SSEC), the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE (LON:SSE)) said in a statement on Friday.
Red-chip stocks are those incorporated outside mainland China but listed on Chinese bourses.
Stocks with a risk warning alert, usually issued to loss-making companies, will be removed from the Shanghai index next month, the statement said. 
The SSE also said it would publish on July 23 an index tracking the STAR Board, launched last July. 
The Shanghai Composite has not been revamped since its introduction in July 1991, leading to an excess weighting of traditional industries, including banks and energy, analysts and fund managers say.
The planned changes follow other reforms.
A week ago, China finalised rules for companies seeking to list on Shenzhen's ChiNext board that streamline the process and allow the market to fully determine IPO pricing. 
China's top securities regulator said on Thursday the country would continue to ""comprehensively deepen"" capital market reform and that the priority was to restore market confidence. 
In a sign of market participants' approval, the ChiNext (CNT) hit a more than four-year high on Friday. 

Yu Xiuwen, an analyst with Huachuang Securities, said Sino-U.S. tensions added impetus for change and Beijing was attaching more importance to its capital markets as a financing channel as it seeks to support its home-grown tech sector.

Hoettges, answering a question at Deutsche Telekom's annual general meeting, said Softbank was seeking to sell down its stake due to ""heightened liquidity needs arising from the demanding economic environment"".
He noted that, under a four-year shareholder agreement that entered effect when T-Mobile completed its acquisition of Sprint, Deutsche Telekom had the pre-emptive purchase right to ensure it retains control of its U.S. subsidiary.
Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of T-Mobile but is able to vote shares owned by Softbank. That brings its voting stake to 67%, assuring strategic control and allowing it to consolidate the financial results of the U.S. unit.

No agreement has yet been reached and Deutsche Telekom will inform the market when one has been reached, Hoettges said.

1325,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Supply-Demand Mismatch Risks Shortages and Higher Prices,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- New data suggest that the economy has been growing for the past two months, although the distribution of that growth has been uneven. Consumption has been recovering more quickly than production, a divergence that will need to be resolved during the next few months. Some catch-up growth in manufacturing and housing should help offset any speed bumps in consumption that might come about from a second wave of the coronavirus or withdrawal of fiscal support by Congress.
The best encapsulation of this trend might be the advance retail sales and industrial production data released on Tuesday. Retail sales in May significantly outpaced expectations, rising 17.7% from the prior month and down just 6.1% from a year ago. The drivers of the improvement were sales of motor vehicles, furniture and clothing as states began reopening their economies, with consumers perhaps having some pent-up demand after sheltering-in-place for weeks.
The same can’t be said for industrial production, which only grew 1.4% from the month before, and is still down 15.3% from a year earlier. Because of the nature of this economic dislocation, a shutdown of large parts of the economy in the midst of a public-health crisis, businesses are cautious about forecasting demand as they deal with challenges ranging from stressed supply chains to new safety regulations.
But consumption can only exceed production for so long before we see spot shortages or higher prices for some goods. We've seen this most dramatically in the housing industry. The housing market was already struggling with lack of supply before the crisis hit, and while both demand and construction plummeted as lock-down orders went into place, demand has bounced back faster than production.
The homebuilder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) gave a good explanation for why this environment is so difficult in its quarterly earnings conference call this week. The company noted that after a strong start to the year, sales plunged in March and April, with April orders declining 29% from a year earlier. The company's building activity slowed as a result, both in response to weaker demand and in an effort to preserve cash. Since then, Lennar has experienced the same rebound as the rest of the industry, and orders in the first two weeks of June rose 20% from a year earlier.
What this means is that even if demand remains strong -- not a certainty given the risk of a rise in infections -- Lennar will have a shortage of houses for sale in the second half of the year because of decisions made in March and April. This does provide an opportunity for other homebuilders, but it might mean an even more severe inventory shortage for would-be homebuyers. That would, of course, put more upward pressure on home prices while construction activity plays catchup.
Some of the same forces are at work in the auto industry. The rental-car industry has been hard-hit by the decline in travel, leading Hertz to file for bankruptcy. And yet used-car dealers aren't seeing rental-car companies selling their inventory to raise cash. The reason? Because of a lack of production by the automakers, they're worried that they won't be able to replenish inventories if and when demand for rental cars returns. Used-car prices have recovered, at least in part, because of this lack of inventory.
These demand-supply dynamics are among the reasons yesterday's Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook manufacturing survey showed that the six-month outlook for economic activity rose to its highest level since the early 1990s. Throughout the economy, production needs to catch up to meet even a subdued level of demand and rebuild inventories that have been drawn down during the past few months.
Despite signs of an economic rebound, many things still could derail this recovery. Virus hot spots in states such as Arizona, Texas and Florida could undo some of the economic progress made since April. Failure by Congress to extend fiscal relief programs put in place to respond to the crisis could have a similar effect. But with consumers showing more willingness to spend than seemed likely even a month or two ago, production needs to step up to meet that demand. Assuming it does, that added output should help boost economic growth in the months ahead. More worrisome would be if it doesn’t, and we get a mini-bout of stagflation marked by constrained production and higher prices.

At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 26 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 82 points, or 0.8%. The Dow Futures contract rose 235 points, or 0.9%.

The Democratic Party unveiled a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan in the House of Representatives Thursday, calling for a huge increase in funding to repair roads and bridges while expanding broadband access in rural areas.
This is larger than the $1 trillion package the Trump administration is reported to be readying, but suggests that the gap between the two sides is not .- so to speak - unbridgeable.
Thursday’s  employment data suggested that the economy could need more help, as implied by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his testimony to the Senate earlier this week, as a further 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.
The market's gains in recent days have occurred against the backdrop of a rise in infections in a number of populous states, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas. California, which is also experiencing a rise in new cases, ordered its citizens on Thursday to wear face masks in public to limit the spread of the disease.

The presidential election will be a risk factor for markets after a shift in polls that has seen President Donald Trump lose ground to Democrat Joe Biden. A Biden victory could threaten policies championed by Trump and generally favoured by Wall Street.
Outflows from healthcare stocks could also in part be due to profit-taking after the sector's strong outperformance year-to-date as defensive stocks were largely insulated from the coronavirus-led shocks.
Equity funds in general fell out of favour with $6.4 billion being pulled out as an increase in pockets of rising coronavirus infection numbers in the U.S. curbed risk appetite. Bonds meanwhile saw inflows of $15.4 billion.
Money market funds, which saw a record $1.2 trillion inflows year-to-date, continued to see redemptions with $16.4 billion going out as investors favoured bonds over cash, BofA's data crunching for the week to June 17 showed.
""Cash heading into bonds not stocks,"" BofA said, pointing to $3.5 billion flowing out of European stocks and a combined $3.3 billion leaving financials and U.S. value stocks, firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their share price.
Stock markets have been wobbly recently after having reduced COVID-19 related losses to less than 10% aided by a combined 134 interest rate cuts by central banks around the world and stimulus measures worth well over $18 trillion.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Running on 'hopium': Explaining the market rally in Wall Street's terms,"By April Joyner and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Risk assets such as stocks and high-yield corporate bonds have climbed over the past two-and-a-half months despite a dire global economic outlook in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The rally has left some market observers scratching their heads but has also given rise to a bundle of jargon - some old, some new - attempting to explain recent trends. Here's a guide to what's driving financial markets now, in Wall Street's own words.
DON'T FIGHT THE FED
One key factor in Wall Street's climb, strategists say, is the unprecedented monetary support from the Federal Reserve, including purchases of corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds. The Fed's balance sheet has expanded by some $3 trillion since March. Those actions have revived the slogan ""Don't fight the Fed,"" as the liquidity supplied by the U.S. central bank has fueled an upward trend.
""Every time the stock market starts to sell off, the Federal Reserve responds with some accommodative policy,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
FOMO
As markets keep climbing, more people are being prodded to jump in. Retail investors unexpectedly increased their stock exposure throughout the selloff and rally, and some institutional investors are now following suit,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists wrote earlier this month. Some market watchers chalk that up to the ""fear of missing out,"" or FOMO, as concerns over the coronavirus pandemic begin to recede.
""We have some good news coming in now, so investors are scrambling to grab equities again,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital.
FOMU
After hitting a four-year low in March, prices of the riskiest U.S. corporate bonds have been driven higher alongside stocks by FOMU, or fear of massive underperformance, said William Zox, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. As the rally in risk assets took off, conservatively positioned investors may have found themselves falling behind peers. FOMU pushed them to raise their risk exposure, driving the rally further, Zox said.
TINA
The market rebound despite cratering expectations for corporate earnings has sent stock valuations soaring. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the MSCI World index is at its highest level since June 2002, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
But investors haven't been put off by the notion of overvalued stocks. According to one popular line of thought, that's because ""there is no alternative,"" or TINA. Bond yields have shrunk as central banks worldwide have slashed interest rates.
HOPIUM
Optimism that the U.S. economy will quickly rebound after a forced shuttering of businesses has also lifted stocks. Several sentiment indicators, including the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey, reflect an increasingly rosy view. That's led to what Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), calls ""hopium.""
""I think there is a heck of a lot of hope and the assumption, to some degree, that the recovery will be pretty sharp,"" she said.
FOGO
Shares of several companies that cater to homebound consumers have been resilient this year. Videoconferencing company Zoom Communications Inc's (O:ZM) stock rose in March even as markets tumbled, while shares of home fitness company  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON) posted less than a 1% loss that month.
According to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, stocks in stay-at-home categories such as internet retail and grocery delivery will likely continue to outperform given American's broad ""fear of going out,"" or FOGO.
BEACH
Travel, leisure and energy companies, whose income has been decimated by the economic shutdown and restrictions on travel, have had some of the sharpest recoveries in stock and bond prices over the past few months. Shares of cruise line operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL), for instance, have rallied 136% from their April trough, after the company secured $6.25 billion in rescue financing from the market.
Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson, used the acronym BEACH, for booking agencies, energy, airlines and autos, cruise lines and hospitality - though he's not joining the buying frenzy.
RORO
The foreign exchange market has followed the rise and fall of U.S. stocks in textbook risk-on, risk-off - or RORO - fashion, according to analysts at HSBC. Before the Fed's unprecedented intervention in financial markets in March, risk-on currencies, like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, significantly depreciated against the U.S. dollar. The Aussie  fell 21.6% from the start of the year to its trough on March 19.

But as the stock market has rallied, safe havens like the Japanese yen  and Swiss franc  have weakened significantly more versus the dollar than risk-on currencies.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: European investors threaten Brazil divestment over deforestation,"By Jake Spring
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Seven major European investment firms told Reuters they will divest from beef producers, grains traders and even government bonds in Brazil if they do not see progress in resolving the surging destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
The rising threats from investors with more than $2 trillion in assets under management, including Finland-based Nordea and the UK's Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), show how the private sector is taking global action to protect the world's largest rainforest. 
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has shrugged off diplomatic pressure on the matter.
Deforestation of Brazil's Amazon surged to an 11-year high in 2019, Bolsonaro's first year in office, and has risen a further 34% in the first five months of 2020, according to preliminary data from government space research agency INPE. The right-wing populist has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region.
""The trends we've seen in Brazil are very concerning,"" said Daniela da Costa-Bulthuis, Brazil portfolio manager for Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco. ""You have a dismantling of the regulatory mechanisms of environmental control since last year."" 
Bolsonaro's press office declined to comment on the investors' concerns. He defended Brazil's environmental record against criticism from world leaders last year as destructive fires in the Amazon drew global outcry. So far, corporate pressure has proven more effective in turning Brasilia's attention to the environment. 
A bill originally proposed by Bolsonaro to grant property deeds for irregularly settled public land, a measure seen encouraging deforestation, failed to reach a vote in May and is now delayed indefinitely after more than 40 mostly European companies threatened to boycott Brazilian exports.
UNDER SCRUTINY
In September, 230 institutional investors signed a letter calling for urgent action to combat the fires surging in the Amazon rainforest, capturing global attention. 
However, the seven asset management firms that spoke to Reuters - Storebrand, AP7, KLP, DNB Asset Management, Robeco, Nordea Asset Management and LGIM - went further in laying out the threat of divestment if there is not progress. The firms hold over $5 billion in investments linked to Brazil, including global grains traders with major operations in the country.
Norway's largest pension fund KLP said it was engaging with trading firms Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) (N:ADM), Cargill and  Bunge  (N:BG) and judging if their environmental policies are adequate.
""If our conclusion is negative, divestment can be the likely result, potentially as soon as this year and we'd expect such a move to trigger other larger investors to follow our lead,"" said Jeanett Bergan, KLP's head of responsible investment, via email.
In response to questions on divestment, Bunge and Cargill described a range of efforts to root out deforestation from their supply chains, citing their adherence to the ""Amazon Soy Moratorium.""
In that voluntary agreement, major trading firms including Cargill, Bunge and ADM pledged not to buy soy from parts of the Amazon deforested since 2008. 
ADM did not respond to request for comment.
Norwegian insurance and pension provider Storebrand and Sweden's largest national pension fund AP7 also said they could divest from ADM and Bunge if the companies do not take adequate measures to combat deforestation. 
Norway's DNB Asset Management AS said index funds it manages, which include holdings in Bunge, could exclude companies that fail to meet its sustainability standards.
Other investment firms mentioned concerns related to Brazilian meatpackers, which have drawn scrutiny in the past for sourcing beef from deforested areas of the Amazon.
LGIM is pushing Brazilian companies, including the world's largest meatpacker, JBS (SA:JBSS3), and smaller rivals Marfrig (SA:MRFG3) and Minerva (SA:BEEF3) for ""robust climate targets and land-use policies, with inaction potentially leading to voting sanctions and targeted divestments,"" said Yasmine Svan, senior sustainability analyst at LGIM, in an emailed statement.
JBS, Minerva and Marfrig said in separate statements they are committed to eliminating Amazon deforestation from their supply chains and detailed their efforts.
AFTER ""QUARANTINE""
The asset management arm of Nordea (HE:NDAFI), one of the Nordic countries' biggest banks, halted purchases of Brazilian sovereign debt last year after forest fires flared, putting its roughly 100 million euros ($112 million) of Brazilian government bonds in ""quarantine.""
Thede Ruest, head of emerging-market debt at Nordea Asset Management, said the firm could go further.
""The next level of escalation from quarantining actually means selling our Brazil government bonds, which could trigger other funds following suit,"" Ruest said. ""We are disappointed by the lack of progress by the current administration, with deforestation rates continuing to soar ahead of another major fire season.""
Da Costa-Bulthuis of Robeco, which manages at least 3 billion euros in Brazilian equities and up to 5 billion euros when including debt and other assets, declined to comment on specific holdings. 
But she said the firm could reduce its exposure to Brazil if its environmental record deteriorates further.
Da Costa-Bulthuis, along with LGIM's Svan and Nordea's Ruest, expressed alarm about a recent video of a Brazilian cabinet meeting, made public due to a federal investigation.
In the recording, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles suggested to Bolsonaro and other ministers that the government should accelerate environmental deregulation while the public is distracted by the current coronavirus pandemic.
""He's working against the environment. What he said was unacceptable,"" da Costa-Bulthuis said. ""If they (the government) will be sensible or not, I think one way to start would be to change the environment minister because this guy does not have credibility.""
Salles and his press office did not respond to requests for comment on the statement. At the time, the minister said he was only calling for cutting unhelpful bureaucracy that hinders investment.
Bolsonaro dispatched the military last month to combat destruction of the Amazon, although deforestation rose again in May compared to a year earlier for the 13th straight month.
Da Costa-Bulthuis said that the deployment was ""the minimum"" the government could do and not an adequate replacement for strengthening agencies specialized in environmental enforcement.

""We don't think they're doing enough.""

1333,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Macro Weakness Leaves FTSE Running on Optimism Alone,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s not only U.S. investors who can ignore bad news.
Europe’s stock markets are finishing the week on a hopeful note, underpinned by the injection of another 540 billion euros through the European Central Bank’s ‘TLTRO’ operation on Thursday, and supported also by a rebound in U.K. retail sales that was at the top end of expectations.
The U.K. data were, however, only superficially positive. While overall sales rose 2%, rather than the 5.7% consensus estimate, they were still down over 13% on the year, and it can hardly be imagined that they will recover last year’s levels if the current pace of job-shedding continues. Over 1.5 million Brits have filed for jobless benefits in the last two months, despite what initially appeared to be a substantial and comprehensive job protection scheme.
Add to that the lack of meaningful progress in avoiding a cliff-edge effect when the post-Brexit transition period for trade with the EU ends in December and the government’s continuing struggle to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under control, and it is all too easy to see how the U.K. economy can turn down sharply again in the second half of the year.
At the same time, the Bank of England is slowing the rate of its bond purchases, even though it increased the overall envelope of its asset purchase program by 100 billion pounds – the bottom end of the range of expectations ahead of Thursday’s Monetary Policy Council meeting.
That doesn’t look too clever at a time when the public debt is exploding, rising above 100% of GDP for the first time in 47 years in May thanks to the surge in government borrowing to cope with the pandemic. The best case that can be made for the Bank’s caution is that it is holding back some ammunition in case of another downturn later this year.
Britain’s twin deficits, as former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney repeatedly said, leave it dependent on “the kindness of strangers” and their willingness to finance those deficits. That’s especially true if the Bank is going to ease off the gas.  
No surprise, then, that such gains in U.K. stocks on Friday are due largely to the pound sliding to a three-month low against the euro and its lowest in nearly three weeks against the dollar.
In fairness, domestic-themed stocks are also showing pockets of strength, with fast-food chain Greggs up 1.7% after laying out its reopening plans earlier in the week and retailers  Next  (LON:NXT) and  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) also reacting positively to the retail sales numbers. Most homebuilders are also in the green after two well-received capital increases in the course of the week,  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) leading the way with a 3.9% bounce.
Even so, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 remain the worst performers in Europe this year (after Spain) for a reason. Until the macro backdrop improves, and specifically, until the U.K. government proves it can manage either the pandemic or the Brexit process better than its continental brethren, there seems little reason to expect that to change."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog on Friday proposed enabling some consumers to extend a payment freeze on their credit cards by a further three months as part of measures to support borrowers in difficulties because of the coronavirus crisis.
The extension to the payment holiday, which was introduced in April, would also enable some consumers to ask for a reduced interest rate on any overdraft borrowing above 500 pounds.
Those who have yet to ask for a payment freeze on credit cards or for an interest-free overdraft of up to 500 pounds ($620) could seek one until Oct. 31, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a statement.
""The proposals ... would provide an expected minimum level of financial support for consumers who remain in, or enter, temporary financial difficulty due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim CEO.
""Where consumers can afford to make payments, it is in their best long-term interest to do so; but for those who need help, it will be there.""
Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at fund supermarket  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said the new proposals would make it harder for some borrowers to obtain a further payment freeze because of the restriction on those deemed able to resume payments. 
""This feels like a blow to borrowers, but it’s actually a very sensible move, designed to protect people from a nightmare further down the road. Putting off repayments will build up the interest you’ll eventually have to pay.""
Guidance for other forms of borrowing, such as auto finance, pawnbroking and payday loans, will be updated soon, the FCA said.
The watchdog is seeking comments on the guidance until 1600 GMT on June 22 before issuing its final guidance.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>","South Korea's wealthy, passed over by pandemic pain, splurge on Porsches and BMWs","By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hwang Min-yong, a 37-year-old South Korean businessman, recently received his black Porsche Cayenne coupe with red leather seats after a seven-month wait and took it out for a spin on a scenic road overlooking a river near Seoul. 
""Porsche has been my dream car ... I don't really feel the effects of COVID-19, as my company is less affected,"" said Hwang, who owns a small tech firm. 
South Korea's swift handling of the COVID-19 crisis has provided a backdrop for a sharp increase in demand for premium and luxury cars, dealers and officials said, as wealthy people, insulated from many of the pandemic's worst effects, want to show off on the road. 
""This year will be one of our strongest years,"" Porsche Korea CEO Holger Gerrmann told Reuters on Tuesday, as the brand saw sales rise by 46% to 3,433 vehicles as of January-May this year from a year earlier. That compared with 4,285 vehicles in all of 2018, and 4,204 in 2019.
In many ways, experts say, the rising sales of imported cars illustrate the widening wealth gap during the pandemic in South Korea, which already has one of the highest inequality levels among advanced countries. 
Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, the monthly average income of the wealthiest 20% of households rose by 6% from January to March, while the poorest 20% of households saw income unchanged. 
""The strong sales are testament to the rising consumption power of the top class despite the pandemic,"" said Yang Jun-ho, an economics professor at Incheon National University.
He said rich people benefited from rising stock and property prices, while vulnerable workers at mom-and-pop stores lost their jobs. South Korea's unemployment rate surged to its highest level in more than 10 years in May, government data showed.
But those who can afford it see luxury cars as an alternative to buying property, dealers said.
""In the early 2000s, the price of a BMW 320 was the cost of a Gangnam apartment,"" said Ro Chang-whan, a longtime dealer and exporter of used cars. ""House prices have gone up enormously since and buying a car is a more realistic choice.""
Sales of imported cars priced over 100 million won ($82,511) jumped 70% to 15,667 vehicles from January to May this year, compared with a year earlier. Sales of small cars made in Korea fell by 10% from January to April, according to the latest data.
""Porsche and BMW are so popular that there are not enough of them,"" said Kim Ryu-bin, a dealer of imported cars. 
Graphic: Luxury car sales a bright spot in South Korea, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgvobqrnpd/index.html
STRONG DEMAND
BMW (DE:BMWG) sales rose 46% to 21,361 vehicles from January to May this year from a year earlier, while Lamborghini sales quadrupled to 115 vehicles during the same period, Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association data showed. 
South Korea has surpassed the United States as the top country for sales of the BMW 5 series from January to April this year, according to BMW's South Korean unit. 
""As the virus eases quicker than expected, consumers are going ahead with purchases,"" said Kim Hyo-hyun, a BMW dealer in the affluent Gangnam district of Seoul. 
Sales of  Hyundai Motor 's (KS:005380) premium sedan Genesis G80, priced at roughly $50,000, surpassed that of the $30,000 Sonata last month and hit a record high.
While demand is strong, supply constraints due to COVID-19 manufacturing shutdowns in Europe and the United States are expected to slow sales, dealers say. Kim said his store expects to see sales fall by one fifth next month.

Mainland China reported 32 new coronavirus cases by the end of June 18, 25 of them in the capital city, Beijing. Infections also rose in the United States this week.
""The rise in infection rates over the past two weeks has increased the levels of uncertainty as to the effect this might have on any recovery and whether it will be V-shaped, as markets appear to be currently pricing, or whether it will be a much longer U-shaped type of rebound,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, edged up overnight and was up around 0.1% at 0700 GMT.
European stocks rose, with the Stoxx 600 up around half a percent at 365.34 (STOXX).
Oil prices rose around 1%, adding to gains in the previous session, after OPEC producers and their allies promised to meet commitments on cutting supply and two major oil traders said demand was recovering well.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rose 2.1% to $39.64 a barrel and Brent futures (LCOc1) were up 1.8% at $42.27 a barrel, the highest in more than a week.
The dollar slipped overnight but recovered in early London trading and was still heading for its best week in a month. Against a basket of currencies (=USD) it was at 97.415, down less than 0.1% on the day.
European Union leaders meet via teleconferencing on Friday to discuss proposals for a 750 billion-euro EU-wide coronavirus recovery fund.
The meeting is expected to be only a first step towards a consensus on a joint economic rescue fund that has so far been a tug-of-war between fiscally conservative northern countries and high-debt southerners.
""There’s little hope for an agreement on the recovery fund any time soon,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss.
""The issue will have to be thrashed out at a later summit, possibly next month, although one hasn’t been scheduled yet. Remember that agreement has to be unanimous on these issues, so even tiny Austria can in effect veto the German-French proposal.""
The euro inched up from two-week lows at $1.1208. It rallied when the fund was announced last month but has slipped this week as uncertainties mount over whether the plan can be delivered.

Demand for safe German government debt declined, with the benchmark 10-year Bund yield up around 1 basis point, at -0.393% (DE10YT=RR).

1339,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 04:24AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Higher; Investors Looking for Recovery Package,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, with investors looking for more stimulus to help the region’s nascent recovery amid concerns about a fresh spike of Covid-19 infections.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.5%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.4%.
EU leaders are set to discuss later Friday, via video conference, the European Commission's plan to borrow 750 billion euros against the EU budget, in order to fund a recovery fund for the region.
Deep divisions remain over the plan with hard-hit countries such as Spain and Italy pushing for funds, while the so-called “frugal four”, including Denmark and Austria, are opposed to the fact much of that money would be earmarked as grants.
“We still think the frugal four will eventually bend in compromise, but with some compromises with budget rebates etc,” said Danske Bank, in a research note.
U.K. retail sales jumped 12% in May, after slumping 18% the previous month, in a welcome sign that the British consumer may be returning. At the same time, German producer prices remained in negative territory in May, providing food for thought for the European Central Bank given its inflation mandate.
While hopes for more stimulus to boost the global economy and thus a reasonably quick rebound remain strong, worries about a second wave of the Covid-19 virus have prompted some investors to temper their optimism this week.
On Thursday around 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in northern Germany tested positive for the virus. At the same time, cases have been rising in a number of the more populous U.S. states, while Beijing has struggled to cope with an outbreak which started at a popular food market over the weekend.
In corporate news, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock climbed 2% amid hopes for some movement over its stalled government bailout.
Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA) stock rose 0.7% after promoting its chief risk officer Stephen van Rijswijk to be its new chief executive. He'll succeed Ralph Hamers, who has moved to become CEO at UBS Group.
BMW (DE:BMWG)stock rose 0.4% after agreeing to a compensation package with employee representatives to allow job reductions.
Wirecard (DE:WDIG) stock tumbled another 40%, extending Thursday’s declines when the German payments processor said its auditor could not locate a hefty sum of cash on its balance sheet.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, helped by Iraq and Kazakhstan, two of the countries who have struggled to meet their target cuts, agreeing to compensate for their overproduction in May.
This would take extra barrels out of the global supply, if followed through, and allay concerns of oversupply in the market.
At 4:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% higher at $39.95 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.5% to $42.55.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX), which like other global markets has struggled in the face of new bouts of coronavirus infections in the China and a number of other economies, rose 0.5% at 0705 GMT, with Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) leading gains.
The European Council will have its first meeting to discuss a commission's proposal to raise 750 billion euros worth of debt to top up spending from joint coffers to be worth 1.1 trillion euros in 2021-27.
COVID-19 cases continued to rise as around 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in northern Germany tested positive for the virus on Thursday, while cases rose in several U.S. states and Beijing.

Among stocks, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) rose 3.5% after its biggest shareholder, German billionaire Heinz Hermann Thiele, reached out to Berlin politicians for talks, newspaper Handelsblatt reported, the latest step in a standoff over the airline's 9 billion euro ($10.1 billion) bailout.

1342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>","Wirecard’s $2.1 Billion Hole Deepens, Asian Bank Claims Forgery","(Bloomberg) -- BDO Unibank Inc., the Philippines’ largest bank by assets, said it is one of the Asian banks involved in an investigation into about 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of missing cash at Germany’s Wirecard AG (DE:WDIG).
“It was a rogue employee who falsified documents and forged the signatures of our officers,” BDO Unibank Chief Executive Officer Nestor Tan said in a mobile phone message. “Wirecard is not even a depositor -- we have no relationship with them”.
The German payments company suffered one of the worst stock slumps in the history of Germany’s benchmark index after warning that as much as 2 billion euros in loans could be called due if its audited annual report, delayed for the fourth time, was not published by June 19.
Wirecard spokespeople did not immediately return calls and emails for comment
The company’s auditor Ernst & Young couldn’t confirm the location of the missing cash that was supposed to be held in Asian banks and reported that “spurious balance confirmations” had been provided, Wirecard said in a statement on Thursday.
BDO has reported the Wirecard issue to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Philippines central bank, Tan said.
Wirecard Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun said the trustee involved is in “constant contact” with EY and the company has promised to clear up the issue quickly with two Asian banks.
The company temporarily suspended its outgoing chief operating officer Jan Marsalek, it said in a statement late Thursday. Marsalek -- who has been suspended on a revocable basis until June 30 -- had tried to get in touch with the two Asian banks and trustees over the past two days to recover the missing money, but wasn’t successful, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday. It’s unclear if the funds can be recovered, the person added.

Reuters reported the cuts exclusively earlier on Friday, citing people with direct knowledge of the issue.
In a statement on its website, Nissan sad it will cancel all night shifts at one of its production sites in Kyushu, southern Japan, from June 29 to July 31. Night shifts at its other Kyushu site will be stopped from July 20 to July 31, it added. 
In addition, Nissan will stop output at its plant in Oppama, Kanagawa prefecture, on two days in July, while its factory in Tochigi prefecture will be closed over eight days next month, the statement said.
The automaker's plants are normally closed on weekends. 
The people with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters that night shifts at the Oppama plant would also be cancelled from late June.
A spokeswoman said there were no night shifts scheduled at the plant at the moment.
Nissan's latest production cuts come as global automakers are reeling from plunging sales amid plant closures in many countries earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus. Nissan has been slashing output at home and abroad since February, beginning in China.
The Japanese automaker is taking a particularly big hit as sales and profitability have been deteriorating before the virus outbreak. Last month it unveiled an aggressive restructuring plan after posting its first annual loss in 11 years.
The latest output cut would be another big hit for its Kyushu plant. Much of the plant's production is exported.
The plant makes the Rogue, Nissan's top-selling SUV crossover model, whose sales have slowed ahead of plans to launch a remodelled version this year.

1344,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>","Rich Clients Should Leave Stock Bubbles to Day Traders, UBS Says","(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest wealth manager has a message for any clients tempted to follow day traders into some of the equity market’s more exotic stocks in search of a fast buck: don’t even go there.
With little-known companies from Fangdd Network Group Inc. to Nikola Corp. having seen their stock prices surge manyfold -- sometimes in a matter of just days or hours -- during the recent market rally, UBS Global Wealth Management’s Charles Day says rich clients should stick to safer names.
“The stocks that I hadn’t heard of three months ago all of a sudden are the most active -- that’s not where investors go, that’s where traders might go or hobbyists might go,” said Day, a managing director and private wealth adviser at the Swiss firm, which oversees $2.3 trillion in assets. “If you’re a wealthy investor, you have to avoid thinking that you’re missing out on huge returns in these stocks.”
With the S&P 500 up more than 30% since hitting March lows, the fear-of-missing-out is fueling buying by day traders, such as those on the commission-free brokerage Robinhood, who pounce on companies with little or no profit and send their stock price surging. With mom and pop investors opening record numbers of new trading accounts, Wall Street pros are trying to figure out to what degree retail appetite has become a self-fulfilling prophecy in many parts of the market and what risks it poses to the rally.
In the face of rising concerns about the pace of economic recovery and the risk of a second wave of infections, Day recommends that clients focus on blue-chip growth stocks in retail and technology with steady cash flows as well as seeking opportunities in cheaper value shares. He advises holding some cash and government bonds to protect against potential volatility.
Reflecting on an increasing incidence of skyrocketing stocks, Day draws comparison with the 2000 market crash “when obscure companies were doubling and tripling monthly,” he said in a phone interview. One day last week, shares of Fangdd, a smallish Chinese real-estate firm, shot up 13-fold in a vacuum of news, taking its market capitalization to $4 billion. In only a few days, that value has fallen back below $1 billion.
“If you’re very wealthy, what you want to have is some protection of your downside so you feel more comfortable with your risk assets,” Day said.
But just because day traders are a more frequent presence and don’t have professional training, doesn’t mean they’re wrong. So far, the lion’s share of their trades have been money makers and their favorites are handily beating those liked by hedge funds and mutual funds, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). And while expected earnings of their top picks may not always justify their surging stock prices, many retail investors are encouraged by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stimulus measures and economic bounce after the lockdowns were eased.
Still, Day warns that mom and pop traders are at risk of getting swept away by market volatility in some of the smaller names.
“That’s what makes it extremely vulnerable to extreme volatility, is that people going into those trades don’t have a lot of experience and now they’re going to start to think it’s easy and that’s a dangerous place to be,” he said. “The Robinhood names I think are almost all froth.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Blackstone, Bain Capital and Taisho Pharmaceutical are among the final bidders for Takeda Pharmaceutical's (T:4502) consumer drug business in Japan, a deal that could be worth up to 400 billion yen ($3.7 billion), three people familiar with the deal said.
Japan's Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co Ltd (T:4581) is the front runner for the deal, all three people said. CVC Capital Partners is also among the final bidders, they said. 
The sale of Takeda Consumer Healthcare Co, known for its Alinamin line of energy drinks, is part of Takeda's efforts to shed $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt following its $59 billion purchase of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP).
That deal amount might fall to around 340 billion yen because Blackstone Group (N:BX) and the private equity firms consider the price too high, said two of those people. Taisho could go as high as 400 billion yen, they said.
Blackstone, Takeda, Taisho and Bain declined to comment. CVC was not immediately available for comment.
The price Takeda is seeking for the over-the-counter business is about 20 times EBITDA, or earnings before taxes depreciation and amortisation, said the three people. The company will close the third, and likely final, bid on Monday, they said. 
The sources declined to be identified because the bidding process is private. 
Shortly before the Shire deal closed in 2019, Takeda Chief Executive Christophe Weber said it was unlikely the drugmaker would offload its over-the-counter (OTC) business. But as major divestitures slowed, reaching $7.7 billion through May, the company has focused on ridding itself of non-prescription drug products, with Weber saying ""we are not an OTC company.""
The Japan OTC deal is separate from the deals Takeda has struck for two other OTC units. On June 11, Takeda said it would sell OTC assets in the Asia Pacific region to South Korea's Celltrion (KS:068270) for $278 million. In April, it said it would offload European OTC and prescription products to Denmark-based Orifarm Group for about $670 million.
""We view the Japan consumer healthcare business in the same light as Takeda's ongoing divestiture of global OTC assets,"" said Morningstar analyst Jay Lee.
""It works towards the company's goal of paying down debt and also allows management to focus on Takeda's core business areas.""

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>",Discount grocers look to jump on home delivery bandwagon,"By Emma Thomasson and James Davey
BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl look poised to accelerate their push into home delivery to satisfy burgeoning demand for online grocery shopping in a shift expected to endure beyond the coronavirus crisis.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic the German duo had grown at breakneck speed, most notably in the United States and Britain. However, the rise in their market share has since stalled in Britain and slipped in Germany and France.
From the start of coronavirus lockdowns, they have been losing out to larger supermarkets as consumers make fewer shopping trips and opt for stores offering a wider choice and more branded goods, data from research companies Kantar and Nielsen shows. Home delivery and curbside pick-up services, meanwhile, are attracting many older customers for the first time.
That shift is prompting the discounters to focus their attention on previously tentative online efforts despite a long-held conviction that the high cost of delivering fresh food makes it incompatible with a business model reliant on low prices and minimal service.
""The coronavirus outbreak is likely to accelerate the digital transformation,"" said Maxime Delacour, analyst at retail research group IGD. 
""We’re expecting to see many more e-commerce developments from both retailers in the immediate future.""
The two family owned companies owe their success to the low prices they can offer because they keep running costs down by stocking a limited range of goods, boosting margins with a high proportion of own-label products and non-food special offers.
Aldi and Lidl have started to sell those higher-margin non-food ranges online in recent years, including the likes of garden furniture, clothing and even washing machines. But they have stopped short of delivering groceries themselves in most of their biggest markets.
SHOPPERS EXPECT
However, customers are starting to demand home delivery in countries such as Britain, where online penetration of the grocery market has almost doubled to 13% since the arrival of COVID-19, according to market researcher Nielsen.
""It would make my life much better if Aldi just started doing online shopping,"" said Shannon Read, who launched a petition to urge Aldi UK to start home delivery when she was struggling to get hold of baby formula during Britain's coronavirus lockdown.
Aldi last week said that it has extended a trial of home delivery in partnership with Deliveroo. If that goes well, industry insiders say the service could be rolled out more quickly than an in-house solution because Deliveroo is already well established.
The company has also said it will extend curbside pick-up to 600 of its 2,000 U.S. stores by the end of July. It already offers U.S. home delivery nationwide through Instacart.
""Our curbside grocery pick-up pilot was quickly embraced by our customers and demand for this service has continued to increase,"" Jason Hart, chief executive of Aldi in the United States, said in a statement.
Lidl, which opened its first U.S. stores in 2017, works with Shipt for home delivery there. It also signed up delivery partners in Spain and Ireland last year.
In Poland, Lidl has started testing a click-and-collect service at one of its stores, which should help customers to avoid social contact during the pandemic and limit waiting times, a spokeswoman said.
The cost of offering click-and-collect is lower than home delivery, while working with partners such as Deliveroo and Instacart helps the discounters to minimise investment in extra technology, logistics and transport.
The pandemic has also helped the economics of online grocery shopping. A broader customer base has reduced logistics costs because delivery vans can drop more orders in one area, while average orders have also jumped, almost doubling at Britain's Ocado (L:OCDO).
That sales boom looks likely to persist even after the crisis, given that e-commerce demand remains at elevated levels as lockdowns ease in the United States, Italy, France and Spain, according to data from analytics company IRI.
""It is a dilemma for discounters because the logistic costs are so high,"" said Robert Kecskes, retail expert at market research company GfK. ""But they will have to follow.""

For now, Aldi and Lidl representatives in Germany said only that the companies will continue to develop their online services. Lidl and Aldi Sued, which runs stores in the south of the country, declined to elaborate on any food delivery plans, while Aldi Nord, responsible for the north of the country, said it had no current plans to move into food.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Friday, with investors having to balance lingering concerns about a fresh spike of Covid-19 infections and growing hopes for a quick economic recovery.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
While hopes for more stimulus to boost the global economy and thus a reasonably quick rebound remain strong, worries about a second wave of the Covid-19 virus have prompted some investors to temper their optimism this week.
On Thursday around 400 workers at a slaughterhouse in northern Germany tested positive for the virus. At the same time, a number of the more populous U.S. states, including Texas, California and Florida, have recorded their largest daily increases and Beijing has struggled to cope with an outbreak which started at a popular food market over the weekend.
Attention now turns to a meeting of the EU leaders to discuss later Friday, via video conference, the European Commission's plan to borrow 750 billion euros against the EU budget, as well as a revised 1.1 trillion euro budget proposal.
There are major disagreements over the size of the recovery package, and whether two-thirds of it should be paid to member states in grants as the commission proposes.
U.K. retail sales jumped 12% in May, after slumping 18.1% the previous month, in a welcome sign that the British consumer may be returning. At the same time, German producer prices remained in negative territory in May, providing food for thought for the European Central Bank given its inflation mandate.
In corporate news, Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA) said it had promoted its chief risk officer Stephen van Rijswijk as its new chief executive. He'll succeed Ralph Hamers, who has moved to become CEO at UBS Group.
 Swiss Re  (SIX:SRENH) may be in focus after the reinsurer said Friday that it had appointed a new chief underwriting officer and it was streaming by disbanding its life capital business.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, helped by Iraq and Kazakhstan, two of the countries who have struggled to meet their target cuts, agreeing to compensate for their overproduction in May.
This would take extra barrels out of the global supply, if followed through, and allay concerns of oversupply in the market.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $39.25 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $41.99.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,737.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1210, up 0.1%.

Wirecard shares dropped by about 60% on Thursday as the company said the delay could cause billions in loans to be called in as soon as Friday. 
Auditor EY was unable to confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in cash balances on trust accounts, representing about a quarter of Wirecard's balance sheet, the payments company said on Thursday.
There was evidence of ""spurious balance confirmations"", it added. 
""At present it cannot be ruled out that Wirecard AG has become the aggrieved party in a case of fraud of considerable proportions,"" Wirecard Chief Executive Markus Braun said in a video statement released on Friday.
He said two banks with an investment grade rating from Moodys or S&P had taken over the management of the trust accounts in 2019.
""It is currently unclear why the two banks have stated to the auditor that the confirmations are spurious. The trustee has announced to Wirecard AG that he will clarify the facts of the matter with the two banks managing the trust accounts at short notice,"" Braun said.
In-house auditor EY had regularly approved Wirecard's accounts in recent years, and its refusal to sign off for 2019 confirms failings found in an external probe by KPMG in April.
The CEO said on Thursday the company was urgently seeking to clarify the balances in question.
Thursday's twist was a stark reversal of fortune for the Munich-based fintech, which was lauded as a homegrown success and entered Germany's blue-chip DAX index in 2018.
Wirecard has long been a target of short sellers who have questioned its financials.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",Main Street investors bank profits on rally that Wall Street doubted,"By Tom Westbrook and Cynthia Kim
SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Main Street investors who have reaped windfall gains from the steepest stock market rebound on record now seem to be making for safety, brokers say, just as Wall Street experts are advising clients to dip their toes into riskier assets again.
Over the past three months, the favourite stocks of ""mom-and-pop"" traders have run up even harder than the broader market's 40% rise.
But many of these novices, who began trading partly as entertainment and partly as plunging prices made stocks more attractive, now appear to be shifting strategy and cashing out of the frothiest sectors, or moving into safer-seeming bets.
Customers at Saxo Markets in Singapore have been reducing long positions at gathering pace this month. Asian investors with TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) are selling soaring tech companies for banks, while other brokers report demand for blue chips.
The moves flip the image of retail investors as ""moths,"" as they are called in Thailand for their reputation of being drawn to bright lights only to get burned, since small traders appear to have led rather than lagged professionals this time.
""Some of the pros on Wall Street might be pulling their hair out, saying that this fundamentally doesn't make sense,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at TD Ameritrade in Singapore.
""But I don't think they have anything to compare it with...whereas retail investors kind of go more with the money flow and sentiment of the markets.""
A basket of stocks popular with retail investors, including Tesla (O:TSLA),  Moderna  (O:MRNA) and  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), surged 61% from Wall Street's March low, compared with a 45% rise in a portfolio favoured by professionals, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
FORGET NUMBERS
Like other banks, Goldman analysts recommend clients avoid the energy sector, prefer utilities to financials and expect techs' hot run to continue. But Asian broker analysis suggests retail buyers are going their own way.
""Sometimes I think reports out of fancy brokerages are bullshit,"" said Lee Sang-hoon, a 37-year-old office worker in South Korea.
He has made a 44% return on his initial 140 million won ($115,740) investments since March, trading U.S. stocks in the Seoul night and relying on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends data to track investor mood.
""When Google says there's going to be more buyers, I buy. Forget numbers, if the sentiment is strong, the market goes up.""
Lee has exposure to volatile U.S. shale oil and gas, and does not plan to reduce his investments yet, but also holds local blue-chips to balance his portfolio.
TD Ameritrade said its Asia clients sold Apple (O:AAPL) and Tencent (HK:0700) last month, and bought Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and J.P. Morgan (N:JPM). Singapore's PhillipCapital said its customers, even in the 18-25 year-old bracket, were buying dividend-paying blue chips or cashing out. 
Australia's biggest retail broker, CommSec, reported a shift away from volatile stocks such as Treasury Wine Estates (AX:TWE) and into big banks and miners.
To be sure, retail traders are still placing incredibly risky bets, such as on bankrupt car-rental company Hertz (N:HTZ).
""I can't imagine that anyone who went to business school or works at an asset manager would buy shares in a bankrupt company,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio manager at mutual fund MFS in Boston.
""Historically, the retail investor is the last one at the party and they don't know the cops are on their way,"" he said.
But the fear of passing up a once in a lifetime chance is strong. 
""Retail investors had missed out on the long-term big rally since the 2008 global financial crisis,"" said Taye Shim, president director of Indonesia's Mirae Asset Sekuritas.
""I think they are more encouraged to not let this one pass,"" he said.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",Automakers see untapped market as Japanese 'paper drivers' ease onto the roads,"By Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ryota Kawamata hadn't driven for more than a decade, but as Japan's COVID-19 crisis worsened in May, his employer near Tokyo rented him a car so he wouldn't have to use public transport. 
The 32-year old engineer, a self-described ""poor driver"", now wants to buy his own car. 
""There are places where I can't go without a car,"" said Kawamata, who recently paid 30,000 yen ($280) for a five-hour refresher course to hone his driving skills.
As Japan emerges from its coronavirus lockdown, restaurants and offices are practicing social distancing, but public transport doesn't require it. People like Kawamata, known as ""paper drivers"" because they have a licence but don't own vehicles, are an untapped pool of potential car buyers. 
They could give Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and others a small but much-needed boost amid a global slump in car-buying.
Demand from lapsed drivers elsewhere, such as the United States, China and other countries where social distancing has become the norm, could also help soften the coronavirus blow for car makers. 
There are no statistics about the number of such drivers in Japan, but about 45 million people have gold-class driving licences, issued to people with no traffic violations for at least five years, according to Japan's National Police Agency. Many of those drivers have simply not been on the road.
Akitake Sawamura, who manages a driving school that offers refresher courses to inexperienced drivers, estimates that around two-thirds of gold licence holders are paper drivers, who have become more numerous over the years as more Japanese use public transit. 
Over the past three decades, car sales in Japan have fallen from a peak of 7.8 million vehicles in 1990 to 5.2 million last year.
""There's been a pick-up in people attending courses since the emergency was declared in April,"" Sawamura said. Recent students, he said, have included a healthcare worker treating COVID-19 cases and an office worker who moved out of Tokyo and bought a car to get around his new town after he began telecommuting. 
In a sign that the roads may be more crowded, demand for parking, particularly in central Tokyo, has increased during the coronavirus crisis, according to Akippa, a smartphone service that searches for parking spaces.
Demand for spaces more than doubled nationwide and jumped by five times in parts of Japan's capital during the state of emergency declared in April compared with February, before the coronavirus crisis took hold, according to Akippa spokeswoman Ayako Ishikawa.
""People are still commuting to work by car and they have been joined by others since the emergency ended,"" Ishikawa said.
The government has noticed the increase in drivers but says it is not concerned about congestion or other issues.
""The number of vehicles on the roads is currently less than it was before the coronavirus pandemic began. Going forward there will likely be some impact,"" said a roads bureau official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. ""We don't yet know what that balance will be between new drivers and those not travelling because of teleworking."" 
Among the people returning to the road is Kawamata's co-worker, Keisuke Kai, 25, who also drives a rented car to work. He enjoys the convenience, but says he is ""hesitant"" about buying a car because of the cost, including parking fees.
Dealerships in and around Tokyo hope paper drivers will eventually take that step.
""We would welcome any increase in the number of drivers on the road,"" a salesman at a Toyota dealership told Reuters.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.50% and the Shenzhen Component was up 1.07%.
Meanwhile, investors were also watching the simmering tensions between the U.S. and China after President Donald Trump did not exclude the possibility of a “complete decoupling from China” via a tweet earlier in the day. Trump’s tweet was in response to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s comment a day earlier that such a measure was not “a reasonable policy option.”
Trump's tweet comes a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Hawaii. The meeting showed that the two sides are eager to prevent a further souring of ties, but still need to work through their disagreement over several issues, including China's national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau."

The federal government said on Friday the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will monitor prices, costs and profits, as well as provide another avenue for complaints about anti-competitive conduct. 
""A key matter covered will be the level of capacity the airlines are putting on each route and whether this is occurring in a way that may damage competition,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement.
Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), which holds almost two thirds of the domestic aviation market, said earlier on Friday it would offer 10,000 one-way seats on low-cost arm Jetstar for A$19 ($13) to help support a tourism recovery as Australia unwinds coronavirus restrictions and state borders reopen. 
""We have a lot of aircraft on the ground with fixed costs attached to them, so if we can put some of them back in the air by offering special fares, it's a positive for us, for our people, for tourism and for consumers,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
Rival Virgin Australia entered voluntary administration in April, owing nearly A$7 billion to creditors. The airline is expected to emerge a smaller airline under a new owner, in a move that analysts have said could benefit Qantas. 
Binding bids for Virgin Australia from finalists Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners are due on Monday and a final deal would need to be approved at a creditor's meeting in August.

The ACCC will report at least quarterly on its findings, the government said.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value LP is close to having eight directors elected to the board of  GCP Applied Technologies Inc  (N:GCP) at the chemical company's annual meeting, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
While not all votes have been cast before Thursday's annual meeting and the result could change, preliminary figures indicate Starboard will see its entire slate elected by GCP shareholders, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified before an official announcement. GCP and Starboard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bloomberg reported the expected outcome first on Wednesday.
The vote will likely give Starboard control of the board and marks the first time one of the activist investor's proxy contests has ended in a vote since it made corporate governance history by unseating all 12 directors at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in 2014.
GCP and Starboard, which owns 9% of the company, have been locked in an increasingly bitter proxy battle since early April when the hedge fund nominated eight candidates, including Peter Feld, Starboard's director of research, to the board.
GCP currently has nine board members and will expand the size to 10 at the annual meeting on Thursday. GCP ran a slate of 10 director candidates.
Starboard won significant support for its campaign when Standard Industries, Inc and its affiliated entity 40 North Management LLC, which together own 24.4% of GCP's stock, backed the activist hedge fund.
With Starboard and 40 North controling nearly one third of the vote, it was a tough battle for the company to win.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Short selling tests China's zeal for market reform,"By Samuel Shen and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONGKONG (Reuters) - As the novel coronavirus swept the world this year, Chinese hedge fund manager Yuan Yuwei made lucrative short-selling bets against stocks such as New York-listed  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX),  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
At home, he barely bothered.
""Short-selling is too inefficient in China. Either there are no available stocks to borrow, or it takes too long,"" said Yuan, who runs a global macro fund for Olympus Hedge Fund Investments.
Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back when prices fall and pocketing the difference. Those such as Carson Block of Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) and Dan David of Wolfpack Research have made their name shorting Chinese stocks but, like Yuan, their bets have been against stocks in New York or Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen.
This could be about to change. Last Friday, regulators relaxed short-selling rules for Shenzhen's $1 trillion startup board, ChiNext, for domestic market participants. They are also considering letting foreigners borrow or lend mainland stocks to short.
Such reform could increase competitiveness and bring China's markets a step closer to more robust capital-raising centres such as New York and Tokyo.
Shares loaned for shorting in Shanghai and Shenzhen as of June 16 totalled $3.96 billion versus a stock market capitalisation of $8.9 trillion - a ratio of 0.044%, official data showed. 
While markets do not calculate short data in exactly the same way, figures from IHS Markit show short interest in the United States of $780 billion, or 2.4% of market cap, and 1.5% for Tokyo.
Due to reform, however, Broker TF Securities estimates short selling in China is likely to grow 10-fold this year and double next year.
Others point to myriad hurdles - both operational and cultural.
""In the short term, many obstacles are insurmountable,"" said Wang Li, chief executive of hedge fund Full Harvest and former BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) money manager. ""Little has changed after so many years, so I'm a bit disillusioned.""
REAL REFORM
Friday's changes mark a major shift since 2015, when regulators blamed ""malicious"" short sellers for illegally ""manipulating"" the futures market and triggering a crash.
Keen to attract international money, regulators said they are more receptive to shorting as a hedging tool used by long-term investors and as a means of profiting by betting against stocks deemed over-valued.
Regulators also hope it could act as a stabilising force if short sellers' bearish views help limit speculative bubbles.
Their ChiNext changes, likely effective from August, are part of reforms to the board's listing system.
Under these reforms, a wider group of domestic participants, including strategic investors, mutual fund managers, pension funds and insurers, will be allowed to lend stock.
Investors will also be able to short stock as soon as it debuts, compared with the main board's three-month lag.
While borrowers and lenders must still conduct transactions through China Securities Finance (CSF), both will be given greater scope to negotiate deal terms.
The next development participants are watching for is allowing foreigners to short - and lend - mainland shares.
""I'm optimistic that we can see more progress this year,"" said Lyndon Chao, head of equities and post trade at ASIFMA, which represents global asset managers and brokers in Asia, and regularly discusses market issues with mainland officials.
Foreigners seeking to hedge mainland exposure - which elsewhere would typically involve stock shorting - can currently only short index futures. 
FRICTION
While reform is welcomed, participants said implementation may not be straightforward. One problem is finding shares to borrow.
""Many Chinese institutions trade frequently for quick profit making them unlikely lenders,"" said Full Harvest's Wang.
Another issue is the cost of a centralised system, designed to ensure government oversight.
""When you have CSF as a middleman, you add friction. They also charge you another two percentage points,"" said Fang Ming, vice general manager of hedge fund house MingShi Investment.
Fang and others said allowing participants to set their own terms will help, but not solve, issues created by having an intermediary.
The cost of borrowing mainland-listed stock is more than 8% annually of its value, versus 0.9% to 1.2% in Hong Kong, according to brokerage data and people familiar with the markets.
ULTIMATE TEST
The reforms come as support for short sellers publicly calling out potential problem companies has grown following a series of accounting scandals, such as that involving  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK), the U.S.-listed Chinese coffee chain that in April said executives falsified last year's sales.
Luckin's sales growth had been questioned two months previously in an anonymous report publicised by Muddy Waters.
Olympus' Yuan said a more open short-selling mechanism can help root out problem companies.
""You need short sellers to shoot them down and kick them out. Otherwise, they harm investors.""
Chinese regulators have vowed ""zero tolerance"" toward listed company fraud. The ultimate test for their newfound acceptance of shorting will be whether they let short sellers fire those shots, rather than punishing them as in 2015.
""I could write articles criticising some listed companies, but I need to be very cautious, and the wording has to be gentle,"" Xin Chen, professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, told venture capitalists in a recent video seminar.
Wolfpack's David put it more simply: ""Without some form of freedom of speech, short selling cannot exist.""

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>","Ackman says hedge fund up 27% year to date, dumped Berkshire","BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's hedge fund is boasting double-digit gains at a time many portfolios have sunk along with the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, after the billionaire investor plowed cash into a number of companies he already owned and dumped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway among other stocks.
The public and private funds at Pershing Square Capital Management have gained between 22% and 27% this year, handily beating both the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the average hedge fund which are each off 7% since January, Ackman said.
Ackman, who began worrying about the health and market impact of the pandemic months ago, famously hedged his portfolio with a $27 million bet that turned into a $2.7 billion windfall that he reinvested in the stock market in late March, buying bigger stakes in companies he was already betting on.
""We like what we own and we still think these stocks are cheap,"" Ackman told investors on a conference call on Wednesday, adding that his portfolio contains companies whose businesses can withstand unpredictable events with severe consequences.
Positions in Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), Blackstone Group (N:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) were liquidated because the cash could be used more efficiently elsewhere, he said.
Money was used to buy more stock in Agilent Technologies (N:A), Starbucks (O:SBUX), Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT), he said, arguing these large companies have best-in-class technology to weather the pandemic.
This year's gains come on the heels of last year's 58.1% return, the single best year since Pershing Square's founding in 2004, and signal that Ackman is still having success with his back-to-basics strategy where in 2018, he took back control of making investments instead of being the firm's chief marketer.
Ackman was early in closing down his Manhattan office and sending staff to work from home. When millions of other Americans were told to stay away from the office, Ackman pounced on the beaten-down stock of Lowe's, arguing that the time for long-delayed home improvement projects is now.

""We bought Lowe's at $84 a share and it was the bargain of a lifetime,"" he said with the stock now at $127.62.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) will invest $2 million or more in 14 U.S. startups led by black founders and other underrepresented groups, the company said on Thursday, as part of its effort to fund more a more diverse array of entrepreneurs. 
The investments will be made through a subsidiary, SoftBank Investment Advisers, which will back the inaugural members of the Emerge accelerator program.
The first class of the Emerge program, co-created by SoftBank Investment Advisers and WeWork Labs that matches up minority founders with SoftBank professionals for eight weeks, pitched their companies to more than 100 investors in online video presentations on Thursday. 
SoftBank Vision Fund Chief Executive Rajeev Misra said the company is committed to fostering diversity and breaking down some of the hurdles that minority entrepreneurs face. 
""By significantly expanding the reach of our accelerator, we'll be able to partner more closely with even more exceptional founders and help them scale their start-ups,"" Misra said in a statement. 
The firm will invest at least $150,000 in each of the 14 businesses, a source familiar with the matter said. These companies include energy management platform SHYFT Power Solutions and water quality startup Aquagenuity. 
SHYFT Power Solutions lets consumers track electricity usage in homes and businesses. The company's co-founder and chief executive, Ugwem Eneyo, said the Emerge accelerator helped her find and collaborate with other founders. 
""At a time when people are having more conversations about systematic racism, biases and other forms of inequality, I was excited to see that Emerge had already committed to fostering an ecosystem and resources to support underrepresented founders,"" Eneyo said in a statement. 
SoftBank launched a separate $100 million Opportunity Growth Fund earlier this month to invest only in founders of color, marking an concerted effort to bankroll ideas from a more diverse group.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. Fed's balance sheet shrinks for first time since February,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's assets shrank this week for the first time since February, reflecting a sharp drop in currency swaps with foreign central banks and a continued slackening in demand for other emergency credit facilities.
The Fed's balance sheet - composed of assets ranging from U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to loans to banks and state governments - fell to $7.14 trillion on June 17 from $7.22 trillion a week earlier, Fed data released on Thursday showed.
It was the first decline since the end of February, just before the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and kicked a bevy of emergency credit facilities into overdrive to soften the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic and the recession it has since triggered.
The $74.2 billion decline, the largest weekly drop since 2009, was driven by a $92 billion drop in foreign exchange swaps with other central banks to $352.5 billion on Wednesday from $444.5 billion a week earlier. The total amount outstanding in the swap lines, designed to ease a surge in demand for U.S. currency in the participating banks' jurisdictions during the early weeks of the crisis, was the lowest since early April.
TD senior U.S. rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg said in a research note that the swap decrease may have been driven by banks making room for cheap loans known as TLTROs, or because they are able to fund elsewhere. The European Central Bank on Thursday announced record take-up of its new round of TLTROs, which stands for targeted longer-term refinancing operations.
Together with softening demand for a number of other emergency credit programs, that offset an increase in purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed's stash of Treasuries rose by nearly $19 billion to a record $4.17 trillion, while it added $83.1 billion in MBS, the most in five weeks, for a total of $1.92 trillion.
The data showed the Fed has not embarked on a massive corporate bond purchasing spree since tweaking its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to set up direct bond purchases in addition to shares of bond exchange traded funds. The facilities' assets rose by $1.5 billion to $38.9 billion from a week earlier. 
More than 80% of the assets in the SMCCF are the Treasury Department's seed money. It has acquired just over $7 billion of corporate bonds or bond ETF shares since it launched several weeks ago.

The company said certain selling stockholders are offering 65.8 million shares at an indicative price range of $18 to $20 per share. The grocery retailer will not receive any proceeds from the IPO. 
The upper end of the range would value the company at $11.61 billion, based on outstanding shares including certain convertible preferred stocks.
The IPO's underwriters have an option of buying an additional 9.9 million shares. Including this, the offering could fetch as much as $1.51 billion.
Albertsons, which operates namesake stores as well as U.S. supermarket chain Safeway and grocer Von, filed paperwork for an IPO in March, years after poor market conditions derailed its earlier attempt at going public.
Grocers, including Albertsons' 20 well-known banners, have benefited from panic buying and stockpiling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers rushed to supermarkets days before long lockdowns.
Albertsons is backed by Cerberus Capital Management LP, a buyout firm controlled by billionaire Stephen Feinberg. The listing would pave the road for Cerberus to exit the company.
Albertsons said on Thursday it would list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ACI"".

BofA Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the lead underwriters for the offering.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Top Pentagon official Wheelbarger resigns as critics accuse Trump of seeking 'loyalists',"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kathryn Wheelbarger, one of the Pentagon's most prominent and respected policy officials, is resigning after three years in the job at a time when critics have accused President Donald Trump of prioritizing perceived ""loyalists"" for top national security posts, sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Wheelbarger, who is highly regarded by national security experts in Trump's Republican Party and among Democrats, did not explain the reasoning for her departure in a copy of her resignation letter obtained by Reuters, which was first to report her decision.
She had been named by the White House on Feb. 13 to a senior intelligence position https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-appoint-individuals-key-administration-posts-30 but in a surprise move last week, the White House instead announced plans to nominate Bradley Hansell https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-appoint-individuals-key-administration-posts-42, a former special assistant to Trump, to become deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence. 
Both current and former U.S. officials accused the White House of passing over Wheelbarger because of her past work with the late Republican Senator John McCain, a fierce Trump critic and former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Wheelbarger handled the committee's intelligence portfolio and was well regarded by Congress.
""It looks like she failed the loyalty test somehow,"" said one former U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A congressional source said it was disappointing that the Trump administration did not recognize ""one of its greatest assets.""
""She was one of the few really thoughtful, compelling voices that people really seemed to respond to,"" the congressional source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In her letter, Wheelbarger said she trusted her colleagues would ""continue to be guided by the U.S. Constitution and the principles of our founding, which ensure both our security and our freedom."" The letter said her resignation would be effective from July 4.
Invoking the constitution has become a refrain increasingly used by Pentagon leaders as former top brass voice concerns that Trump is politicizing America's military, which is meant to be apolitical. 
Those concerns came to a head in the past month after Trump threatened to deploy active duty troops to quell civil unrest in U.S. cities over the killing of George Floyd, who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who split with Trump by publicly opposing an active duty deployments, issued a statement on Thursday praising Wheelbarger's ""wealth of experience"" and her ""utmost professionalism.""
Her departure will come as Trump attempts to overcome stiff Senate opposition among Democrats to his nomination for the Pentagon's most senior policy position of retired Army General Anthony Tata, a strong defender of Trump on Fox News.
Tata has misportrayed former President Barack Obama as a Muslim and falsely accused him of being a ""terrorist leader"" working to benefit Iran, according to now-deleted Twitter posts seen by Reuters. 
Democrats, including Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the chamber's Armed Services Committee, have signaled they would oppose Tata's nomination. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also on the committee, called Tata ""by far Trump's most unqualified & ill-suited senior defense nominee – a high bar.""
""An Islamophobic conspiracy theorist who called President Obama a 'terrorist leader' should not be #3 at the Pentagon,"" Warren said in a statement.
It's unclear if Hansell's nomination will face such resistance.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned Hansell's qualifications and said Wheelbarger appeared far more experienced for a Pentagon leadership post.
Hansell, a retired Army special forces officer, had worked as senior director for transnational threats on Trump's National Security Council staff. He is currently at the Boston Consulting Group.
Less than a month ago, the U.S. Senate confirmed Representative John Ratcliffe, a staunch Trump political ally, as director of national intelligence. Ratcliffe has far less intelligence experience than any previous director of National Intelligence.

1362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Total Piles Into North Sea Oil as OPEC+ Cuts and Demand Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s biggest oil refiner is making an unusual foray into the North Sea crude market as a recovery in the continent’s fuel demand gathers pace at a time when the number of cargoes available from nearby producer regions is increasingly becoming constrained.
Total SA (NYSE:TOT) this month snapped up 12 out of 14 cargoes that help to set the global Dated Brent benchmark published by S&P Global Platts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The purchases compare with zero in April and May in a market where the main buyers are typically large trading firms.
While Total’s reasons remain unclear, the deals come at a time when fuel demand is showing clear signs of improvement. That’s helping to further tighten a crude market in which global producers participating in an OPEC+ output pact are already doing everything possible to scale back supply to prop up oil prices. Exports from Russia and Nigeria, two important suppliers for Europe, have plunged by 30% and 15% respectively.
As of early June, France’s road fuel demand was just 10% to 15% lower than where it stood a year ago, a Total spokesman said by phone. That’s in stark contrast with a year-on-year drop of 70% to 85% during the strictest phase of the lockdown, and 30% when the measures were being eased. He declined to comment on the cargo purchases.
Totsa, Total’s trading arm, was active in the North Sea market again on Thursday. It bid for Forties, Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg crudes, all of which are benchmark grades.
Europe’s energy consumption is “going up quite quickly” and exceeding expectations after lockdowns across the continent were relaxed, Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a virtual roundtable discussion on Wednesday.
As well as being a big refiner, Total is also one of the largest equity holders of West African crude. Typically, more than 100,000 barrels a day from the region flow into its refining system. In the first half of June, tankers hauling the equivalent of just 66,000 barrels a day were showing French ports as their destinations, according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.
Flows from West Africa to China reached 1.7 million barrels a day in June, the highest level in a year, tracking data showed. With outright exports in decline because Angola and Nigeria are participating in OPEC+ production cuts, that may be diverting brrels away from Europe’s refineries.
Likewise, tumbling supplies have driven premiums for Russia’s benchmark Urals crude to the highest in years. The grade for delivery to the Dutch port of Rotterdam recently traded at a premium of about $2 a barrel to Dated Brent. That’s also about $1 higher than Forties, the main grade that Total is buying.
It’s very unusual for the North Sea crude to be cheaper than Urals because it contains less sulfur. Because the OPEC+ cuts have been centered on so-called medium sour crudes -- those with average density but relatively high sulfur content, grades such as Urals have been boosted, said Spencer Welch, vice president of oil markets and downstream consulting at IHS Markit.
The “Urals price is strong at present, relative to light-sweet crude because of reduced availability of medium-sour crudes because of the OPEC+ supply cuts,” he said. As such that’s making North Sea and West African grades more attractive to buyers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former fund manager Sara Tirschwell on Thursday appealed a New York state judge's dismissal of the bulk of her sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, asset manager TCW Group Inc.
Justice Robert Kalish of the Manhattan Supreme Court had on June 11 dismissed Tirschwell's claim that TCW fired her in retaliation for her complaints to its human resources department about her former boss Jess Ravich's alleged harassment.
The judge also said Tirschwell could not seek punitive damages, often a major component of employment cases.
TCW declined to comment. The Los Angeles-based company has denied Tirschwell's claims, and said it fired her for compliance violations. It recently had $217 billion of assets under management. 
A lawyer for Ravich did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Kalish said Tirschwell could pursue claims that TCW committed sex discrimination and had no contractual right to fire her, and could seek compensatory damages.
Steven Storch, a lawyer for Tirschwell, said in a statement a jury should hear all her claims, including for punitive damages, after ""reviewing the evidence supporting her claims of sexual harassment she endured.""
The appeal will be considered by New York state's Appellate Division, also in Manhattan.
Tirschwell, who specializes in distressed investing, joined TCW in 2016 to build a distressed debt fund.
In her January 2018 complaint, she accused Ravich of coercing her into having sex in return for advancing her career, and said she was ""fearful"" of resisting because of threats to deprive her of resources for her fund.
Tirschwell said that after reporting Ravich's behavior to human resources, TCW ""manufactured"" reasons to fire her.
Ravich has said he never had or sought to have sex with Tirschwell. He has since left TCW.

(Reuters) - Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) Inc said on Thursday it laid off 25% of its total workforce this month as the oil and gas producer grapples with plunging fuel demand and lower prices due to the COVID-19 crisis.
The company said it now has around 2,100 employees and contractors. 
Ovintiv, formerly known as Encana, completed a change of base from Calgary to Denver in January, which Chief Executive Officer Doug Suttles had reasoned would allow the company access to a deeper capital market.
However, that vision was shattered as the pandemic eroded oil demand, while prices tumbled further after Saudi Arabia and Russia in March threatened to flood the market with more oil.
Many shale producers have lately reduced their workforce, slashed budgets and cut dividends in efforts to save enough cash for survival as investors turn their backs on the industry.
Ovintiv's shares have more than halved in value so far this year, while U.S. oil prices have fallen about 38%. 
The company in May cut https:// its second-quarter planned capital spending by 60%, or $500 million, and estimated to have curtailed net volumes of about 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, and oilfield services providers Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co are some of the biggest names among many that have announced job cuts.
Ovintiv, once among Canada's largest companies, bought Texas-based Newfield Exploration Co for $5.5 billion last year to boost acreage in the United State, as it prepared to move away from Canada.
A company spokeswoman had earlier said the job cuts would be equally spread across its offices in Calgary, Denver and The Woodlands, Texas.

The ETFMG Treatments, Testing and Advancements ETF, which started trading Thursday under the ticker GERM, gives access to both established biotechnology companies and “unsung heroes,” the firm said in a statement. The fund tracks an index whose biggest holding is  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., a company that’s seen its stock price more than triple this year on news of its vaccine development progress.
As global coronavirus cases exceed 8.3 million, companies, health authorities, drug regulators and research institutes are working around the clock to come up with the world’s first effective vaccine for Covid-19. Concern over a second wave of the pandemic threatens recent efforts to relax restrictions and revive businesses after months of lockdowns.
“Everyone is thinking about treatments and vaccines,” said Sam Masucci, chief executive officer and founder of ETF Managers Group. “It touches them very personally. We tried to develop a product of all the companies at the forefront that will hopefully get us back to a more normalized life.”
The fund has a 0.68% expense ratio.
Earlier this year, Pacer Financial filed for a BioThreat ETF (VIRS), which is focused on companies combating biological threats to human health.
This kind of thematic fund is effectively “a trifecta bet” -- meaning the issuer has to get the theme, stocks and valuations right, according to Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Robinhood reviews options trading offering following suicide by customer,"By John McCrank and Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc said on Thursday it was reviewing its options trading offering following news that one of its customers took his own life after believing he had lost more than $730,000 using the free trading app.
Alex Kearns, 20, died last Friday, leaving behind a note to his family that said he incurred losses trading options on Robinhood and that he had no idea what he was doing when he made the trades, Bill Brewster, his cousin by marriage, told CNBC in an interview.
""He thought he was exposed. He thought that ending his life would protect his family from the exposure,"" said Brewster, who is an analyst at Sullimar Capital. 
Brewster did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
A spokeswoman for Robinhood said the company would not share any details on Kearns' account out of respect for privacy and confidentiality. 
""All of us at Robinhood are deeply saddened to hear this terrible news and we reached out to share our condolences with the family over the weekend,"" she said in a statement.
""We are committed to continuously improving our platform and are reviewing our options offering to determine if any changes may be appropriate.""
Robinhood was founded in 2013 and now has more than 10 million user accounts. Customers at the brokerage, which has been credited with helping usher in commission-free trading throughout the retail brokerage industry, have a median age of 31, the Menlo Park, California-based company said recently.
The company is one of the most valuable venture-backed financial technology startups. Last month it raised $280 million from investors at an $8.3 billion valuation. 
Despite its continued popularity, the company has suffered several outages over the last few months, most recently on Thursday.

investing.com -- Stocks were mixed Thursday, with the Dow down for the second day as investors studied sluggish jobs data and the possible economic effects of a second wave of cornonavirus that could force new lockdowns.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly, the NASDAQ Composite notched gains. The car rental giant  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (NYSE:HTZ)was a notable move, falling 10% during market hours and continuing to fall in afterhours trading. The company, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, canceled plans to offer fresh shares to the public.
On Friday, top officials from the Federal Reserve are expected to speak, and investors await the release of data that could provide insights on oil demand and imports and exports.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. How Many Oil Rigs Are Currently In Production? 
Expected U.S. Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count, which acts as a business barometer for the oil drilling industry. The data comes out at 1:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT). Last week it was 199. And the Baker Hughes total rig count last time was 279.
Oil prices have wobbled recently after notching multi-week gains because of government and industry data indicating crude inventories are climbing rather than falling. When oil builds up in storage, it means businesses might not be coming back online as quickly as investors would like.
2. Trade deficit numbers expected to improve slightly
Current account data, which measures the difference in value between imported and exported goods, services, and interest payments, is expected out on Friday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expected the first quarter number to be a deficit of 103 versus a deficit of 109 the previous quarter.
3. More Public Appearances by Fed Officials
Top Federal Reserve officials are slated to speak in public on Friday. At noon, Vice Chair Randal Quarles is set to appear virtually at a Women in Housing and Finance public policy event on the subject of stress testing. There will be a question and answer session after his speech. An hour later at 1 PM ET (16:00 GMT), Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to appear remotely at a discussion about building a resilient workforce during Covid-19. That event is sponsored by the Cleveland Fed and will not include a question and answer session.
Powell testified in Congress this week about the slow process of recovery from the Covid-related shutdowns."

The numbers from STR, whose data is widely used in the industry, showed urban hotels are still struggling with the collapse in business travel and city stays triggered by coronavirus lockdowns instituted in March. 
However, occupancy at freeway locations or those in small towns and suburban locations was between 44% and 46% for the week ended June 13, and with airlines beginning to fly more regularly, airport hotel rates reached 39%.
Overall, U.S. industry occupancy was 41.7%, down from about 74% a year ago but higher than the 21% in April. 
""The worst is behind us,"" Dom Dragisich, chief financial officer at Comfort Suites-owner Choice Hotels (N:CHH), told Reuters. 
The pandemic has forced major hotel operators including  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H), Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (N:H) to lay off or furlough thousands of employees as bookings plunged.
Analysts say the big chains are more exposed to the airport and urban segments of the hotel market, with interstate locations making up just 10% of Marriott's portfolio and 15% of Hilton's. 
Earlier this month, Marriott said it could take the company years to get back to last year's levels, when its global occupancy rate was 71%.
""The industry (has) clawed its way above 40% occupancy. That was still down substantially from the comparable week last year but an obvious improvement,"" said STR analyst Alison Hoyt. 
""The drive-to destinations with access to beaches, mountains and parks continue to lead the early leisure recovery. With more consistent demand, we're beginning to see more pricing confidence in those areas as well.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) wants to start building a large vehicle assembly plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year, the company told Texas officials in documents made public this week.
But the company is still pitting Texas and Oklahoma against each other in an effort to secure tax breaks, the documents show. The plant would build Tesla's electric pickup truck and Model Y SUV, according to reports.
Tesla told officials in Travis County, Texas, the automaker wants to invest about $1 billion to build a 4 million to 5 million square foot vehicle assembly plant employing 5,000 people on the grounds of what is now a cement operation near Austin. But it needs tax breaks to make the site competitive with an alternative location in Oklahoma, according to documents filed with Texas officials.
The Austin-American Statesman reported details of the company's filings.
Tesla officials could not immediately be reached for comment, but Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk previously hinted about a Texas plant, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott has spoken with Musk about the possibility.
Oklahoma's Secretary of Commerce Sean Kouplen said Tulsa remains in the hunt for the plant.
""We’ve pulled together a compelling, well-balanced and, more importantly, a responsible performance-based incentives package to attract Tesla to Oklahoma,"" he said in a Thursday statement. 
Tesla's sole U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, covers 5.3 million square feet - a large plant, but not large enough for the growing company. Tesla has had to build cars under a tent adjacent to the plant.

Musk clashed with California officials after Alameda county officials ordered the Fremont factory to halt production and comply with coronavirus stay-at-home orders that took effect in March. He threatened to move future operations to Texas or Nevada. The California plant has since reopened.

(Reuters) - Commercial insurers are scrutinizing building managers' efforts to avoid outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease as they re-open movie theaters, gyms, schools and offices that had been closed for months due to the coronavirus pandemic, industry sources told Reuters.
Legionnaires' disease is a severe, sometimes-lethal form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria that builds up in pipes. Environmental insurers, which collect roughly $2 billion in annual premiums, would be on the hook for damages if there are outbreaks at buildings they cover.
""Legionella could be the deadliest waterborne illness in the U.S. and another deadly consequence of COVID,"" said Veronica Benzinger, environmental service group leader for insurance broker Aon PLC (N:AON), referring to the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
The pandemic shutdown of businesses and schools has led to an unprecedented amount of stagnant water in dormant buildings. It becomes a breeding ground for Legionella bacteria, which can be spread from toilets, sinks, showers and air-conditioning systems.
Some insurers are intensifying Legionnaire's precautions before adding new clients or renewing coverage, insurers and brokers said. For instance, they may ask customers to document how they maintain plumbing and cooling systems.
Large commercial office buildings and manufacturing plants have professional maintenance staff who likely kept water flowing throughout the crisis. Smaller buildings that insurers cover are at higher risk, experts said.
To avoid contamination, they must flush and sanitize pipes and disinfect cooling towers that use water to lower air temperature, they said.
The bacteria and disease get their name from a deadly outbreak following a 1976 American Legion convention in a Philadelphia hotel. The bacteria was ultimately discovered in the cooling tower of the hotel's air conditioning system.
Nearly 50,000 people have been infected with Legionnaires' disease between 2000 and 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [L3N2CC376]
Allianz SE (DE:ALVG) has added Legionnaires' prevention to broader discussions with large industrial clients about the coronavirus pandemic, said Scott Steinmetz, global head of risk consulting within an Allianz specialty insurance.
Allianz has engineers helping customers prepare for reopening, he said. Allianz and AXA SA (PA:AXAF) are also sending bulletins to clients about water system maintenance.
Insurers might limit Legionnaire's coverage amounts or impose higher deductibles if building systems are outdated, brokers said.
Insurers were already worried about possible outbreaks, because of elevated lawsuits and claims. They are stepping up their scrutiny even more due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In April, Illinois agreed to pay $6.4 million to families of patients who died of Legionnaires' disease at a state-run veterans home. Other deaths have occurred in New York and Michigan.

Several U.S. states including Texas, Florida and Oklahoma reported a surge in new infections. However, President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday the United States would not close businesses again.
The Labor Department's report showed weekly jobless claims declining for the eleventh straight week, but the pace of declines has slowed as tepid demand and fractured supply chains have sparked a second wave of layoffs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House announced on Thursday that President Donald Trump intends to nominate Caroline Crenshaw to fill a Democratic vacancy at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Crenshaw, a senior SEC attorney, would fill a commissioner slot that has been vacant since February, when Rob Jackson, whom Crenshaw advised, left to return to his teaching post.
If confirmed by the Senate, Crenshaw would help balance out the top markets regulator, where there are currently two Republican commissioners and one Democratic commissioner, Allison Lee. The SEC is chaired by Jay Clayton, an independent who frequently votes with Republicans.
Reuters reported that Crenshaw was expected to be nominated for the post in January. She declined to comment on Thursday on the nomination.
Crenshaw has been employed at the SEC since 2013 and is a judge advocate in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. She previously worked under another Democratic commissioner at the SEC, Kara Stein, who left in January.
Her nomination will now be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is already considering the re-nomination of Hester Peirce, a Republican SEC commissioner, to serve a second term that expires in 2025.

""Crenshaw is smart, knowledgeable, incredibly hard-working, and dedicated to the cause of promoting investor protection and market integrity. Plus, she knows the agency inside and out.

Ford has borrowed more than $20 billion to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Profit from the new F-150 will be key to paying that money back.
Ford is not taking big risks with the exterior look of the new truck given its sales dominance, instead focusing on improving the interior, according to those who have seen it. Ford is scheduled to publicly show for the first time the new F-150 online on June 25.
""It's really about technology and productivity,"" Farley said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference on June 10.
One prominent feature will be the lay-flat passenger seat like those seen in first-class cabins on some planes, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. ""You can basically live in the truck,"" the person said.
Ford's nicer interior, including a larger display screen, follows a similar move by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) with its new Ram truck, which received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch display screen. 
""Ram taught everybody a little bit of a lesson,"" said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. ""The old 5-inch screen for your navigation and radio controls is gone. They're all going to be 10-, 12-, 15-inch screens. That was started by Tesla.""
The F-150's new electrical architecture will allow Ford to provide over-the-air updates to key modules controlling the vehicle, replacing trips to the dealership. 
The new truck's connectivity also will help Ford boost sales to commercial customers, and reduce warranty costs, Farley told investors. 
The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Sales of the current version have remained strong despite its age, and the new model could help Ford hold or even build its position in the segment, said Sandy Munro, chief executive of Michigan-based consulting firm Munro & Associates. 
""If they add the same stuff as what Ram did and if they can add more stuff like Tesla's doing, there'll be a gigantic gap between Ford, and Ram and Chevy,"" he said. 
The key for Ford will be to avoid the kinds of costly production problems that hobbled the launch of the new Explorer SUV last year. Ford acknowledged it erred in trying to launch the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator simultaneously while breaking in a new assembly line at its 95-year-old plant in Chicago.

Farley has been visiting the plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, that will build the new F-150. Despite delays related to the virus, he said the launch is in ""really good shape.""

Four ETFs that track companies using environmental, social and governance criteria started trading Thursday. Among the changes BlackRock’s chief outlined in his January letter was making sustainability integral to portfolio construction and risk management.
Fink pledged to double sustainable ETF offerings, push index providers to expand their environmental, social and governance benchmarks and drop thermal coal producers from BlackRock’s approximately $1.8 trillion in active strategies. Investor interest in value-based and sustainable strategies has surged amid protests against racism and a deadly outbreak that has infected more than 8.3 million people around the world.
“One thing that has emerged as a result of the virus and the lockdown is a renewed appreciation for the environment broadly speaking,” said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.
The new suite of BlackRock funds includes: the iShares ESG Aware Conservative Allocation ETF (EAOK); the iShares ESG Aware Moderate Allocation ETF (EAOM); the iShares ESG Aware Growth Allocation ETF (EAOR); and the iShares ESG Aware Aggressive Allocation ETF (EAOA). Each has a 0.18% expense ratio.
BlackRock is also planning to launch four ESG funds that provide exposure to companies with higher scores in that category while also screening for controversial activities such as fossil fuels, palm oil, for-profit prisons and weapons.
“This strong demand across our global wealth and institutional clients is driving more innovation in index and product development and portfolio solutions,” the firm said in a statement.
After taking in a record $4 billion in April, ETFs focused on ESG have seen $52 million in outflows so far this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three BlackRock products -- ESGU, ESGE, ESGD -- have lured $8.5 billion out of the total $13.1 billion inflows for the category this year.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Portugal pushes ahead with plans for state-owned development bank,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's government approved on Thursday plans to create a state-owned development bank to channel funds into certain companies and sectors to bolster the economy.
The plan comes as the country hopes to receive 26.5 billion euros ($29.73 billion) from the European Union's 750 billion euro coronavirus recovery fund, due to be debated by the European Commission on Friday, to help it through the coronavirus pandemic.
The government requires approval from the Bank of Portugal and the European Commission to proceed with the development bank, which would be created by merging three existing investment and mutual guarantee funds.
The bank will perform the typical functions of a national promotional bank, ""addressing market failures or situations in need of investment optimisation"", Secretary of State of the council of ministers Andre Caldas said at a press conference.
Its functions will include providing bank guarantees and long-term financing to companies in high-risk sectors, supporting exports and taking equity and shares in companies requiring investment.
Portugal is due to receive 15.5 billion euros in non-repayable grants and 10.9 billion in loans from the European Commission, if the recovery fund is approved, and that would be channelled through the bank, the council of ministers, or cabinet, said in a statement.
Economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira has long called for the creation of such a bank and talks about its creation have been stepped up as the coronavirus damaged the economy. At the beginning of June Siza Vieira said a development bank was ""indispensable to support not just this stabilisation phase but the restarting of the economy"".
Prime minister Antonio Costa said on June 4 that talks with the European Commission were ""very advanced"" and the bank should be created within months.

(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) stopped short of raising its annual forecasts on Thursday, saying a coronavirus-driven surge in demand for essential goods was fading as American households reconsider what they have on their shelves.
Demand for fresh produce, meat and soups surged in March and April, and wide-ranging stockpiling in the health crisis forced the grocer to put purchase limits on cold, flu and sanitary products, as well as beef and fresh pork at certain stores.
Reporting on a bumper first quarter, the supermarket group said that it now expected to beat earlier forecasts, which projected a rise of more than 2.25% in same-store sales and earnings of between $2.30 and $2.40 per share this year.
But it did not give a new forecast and said growth in second quarter earnings would be partially offset by investment and pressure on its fuel business after the collapse in oil prices. 
Its shares, up 13% this year, fell 5%. 
""Investors might be slightly jittery from Kroger not quantifying its FY20 outlook,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.
Digital sales skyrocketed 92% in the first quarter ended May 23, compared with the previous quarter's 22% increase, as more consumers opted for Kroger's delivery and pickup services. Overall same-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel prices, rose 19%.
Kroger said same-store sales growth was trending in the mid-teens range so far this quarter, as customers cook more at home.
""Customers are still stocking up, but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns ... We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses,"" said Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.

The results showed sales rose 11.5% to $41.55 billion, versus an average estimate of $40.72 billion. Excluding one-time items, Kroger earned $1.22 per share, beating market estimates of $1.09.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>",Coronavirus raises stakes as auto unions ready for a fight,"By Gilles Guillaume, Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis has forced carmakers to speed up layoffs that must be matched with hefty payouts and deft negotiation to retain the support of powerful trade unions vital if Europe's auto industry is to manage a shift to low-emission vehicles.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a broader economic slowdown, demand for light vehicles is expected to shrink by 36 million globally by the end of 2022, consultants AlixPartners found. 
For this year alone, this is equivalent to a market the size of Europe disappearing, AlixPartners said. 
The contraction increases an existing threat to jobs from electric cars, which are quicker and easier to build than those with combustion engines and which have German and French government backing as the countries strive for a green recovery.
""Once the consensus between labour leaders and management has broken down, it is extremely difficult to implement restructuring in Europe,"" Stefan Bratzel, a professor at the Centre of Automotive Management in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, said.
He cited the conflict between German labour leaders and General Motors (N:GM) that meant it took 10 years to close its Opel factory in Bochum, Germany, which was announced in 2013.
""The brand was weakened by this paralysis,"" he said.
A spat over the pace of restructuring has already led Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) labour representatives to flex their muscles, leading to the ouster of Chief Executive Herbert Diess as head of the company's core VW brand.
Labour representatives have half the seats on VW's board of directors, meaning they have sway over decisions on contracts and pay.
Joerg Koehlinger, head of German union IG Metall's central district, on Wednesday said the depth of the recession faced by the auto industry has heightened tensions. 
""I fear that this will soon lead to massive conflicts about employment, locations, wages and working conditions,"" he said adding that IG Metall will defend its workers.
The global pandemic has weakened demand for vehicles when carmakers were already struggling to retrain staff to make cleaner cars.
COLLECTIVE FAILURE 
Jean-Dominique Senard, chairman of France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said there had been a collective failure to prepare and retrain staff quickly enough. 
""I think we have made mistakes, collectively, in encouraging and keeping alive industrial structures that we knew did not have a great future,"" Senard said. 
""We should have anticipated more, that is to say, taken into account the people who work on these sites.""
At a plant in Rodez, France, where auto supplier Bosch makes spark plugs for diesel engines, local management is accelerating restructuring efforts. 
""We are more motivated than ever to work on diversification and have decided to further intensify the process,"" Patrick Meillaud, the plant's economic director, told Reuters. 
Bosch is trying to lower the retirement age and to diversify beyond manufacturing engine components into industrial services and fuel cells. Bosch on Thursday said it would stop making steering components at a plant in Bietigheim-Bissingen.
The risks of failure to adapt are high. 
In Germany Flabeg, a maker of high-tech digital rear-view mirrors, filed for insolvency, France's Novares, a specialist in automotive plastics, has filed for temporary receivership, and in Britain, Arlington Industries, which specialises in auto component sub-assembly, has called in the receivers. 
Spain's foreign minister said the country will ""do everything"" to try to reverse Nissan's (T:7201) decision to close its Barcelona plant.
France's PSA (PA:PEUP), the maker of  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) cars, was forced to modify a decision to import workers from a plant in Gliwice, Poland, to help a French plant in Hordain, restart production after lockdowns eased.
The number of Polish workers has been cut to 124, from the 500 originally expected to arrive in France.
French union CFDT in principle disagrees with pitting nationalities against each other, but said work had to be offered to French part-time staff first given the sensitive economic context.

""I think there should have been someone at PSA who understood it was a little bomb,"" Laurent Berger, head of the CFDT union, told French TV.

Deutsche agreed to pay a $1.25 million penalty to settle the allegations that two of the bank's traders engaged in numerous instances of a type of market manipulation called ""spoofing"" in Treasury futures and Eurodollar futures contracts on CME, the bank said in a statement.
The CFTC has been aggressively pursuing traders for the practice, a tactic designed to create a false appearance of demand. In 2018, the agency established a task force dedicated to rooting out this form of market manipulation.
Deutsche will also pay a $9 million penalty over separate civil charges for failures related to its business continuity and disaster plans and for violations of swap reporting requirements. 
The charges stem from an issue in 2016, when an unprecedented outage in the bank's swap reporting platform kept Deutsche unable to report data for multiple asset classes for five days, exacerbating existing report problems at the firm, the CFTC said. In 2015, Deutsche agreed to a CFTC order to improve its internal controls after being charged with failures in swaps reporting.
The penalty was substantially reduced because of Deutsche Bank's cooperation with CFTC staff, which included agreeing to have a court-appointed monitor, the agency said.

""As reflected in both the settlement orders, we have taken meaningful steps to enhance our controls and are pleased to put these matters behind us,"" Deutsche Bank spokesperson Dan Hunter said in an emailed statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL) on Thursday said it was working to review and evolve its Chinese toothpaste brand, Darlie, the latest in a string of brand reassessments amid a U.S. debate on racial inequality. 
Darlie is a popular Chinese brand owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner, Hawley & Hazel. Its package features a smiling man in a top hat. It used to be called Darkie and featured a man in blackface.
Its current Chinese name still translates to ""black person toothpaste."" 
The move comes as Corporate America reacts to weeks of protests over racial injustice and police brutality sparked by the death in May of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck. 
""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging. We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told Reuters in an email. 
Colgate's statement to Reuters followed news on Wednesday that PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) was dropping its Aunt Jemima logo, prompting peers to initiate reviews of other food brands featuring African American characters, including Uncle Ben's rice, Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and Cream of Wheat. 
Darlie controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 45% in Taiwan, according to Euromonitor International. 

Colgate paid $50 million in 1985 for 50 percent of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darkie. It announced changes to the logo and English name in 1989 following pressure from shareholders and other groups.

""Spain is reopening itself to tourism,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said while presenting the plan. ""We are a world leader and each step we take will be safe.""
Spain is the world's second-most visited country after France and normally receives more than 80 million tourists a year.
Most of the package, about 2.5 billion euros, is made up of credit guarantees offered by the government for tourism operators, Sanchez's office said in a statement.
The government will then help companies by suspending mortgage payments for up to 12 months and will grant a series of aid to pay for increased health safety measures and training for workers.
Tourism lobbyists such as Jose Luis Yzuel have said the government measures are insufficient for an industry that represents one job in every eight, and contributes more than 12% to Spain's 1.3 trillion euro gross domestic product.
Revenues from tourism about halved in the four months to April and no tourists travelled to Spain at all that month and the next because of one of Europe's strictest lockdowns.
Even though many countries in Southern Europe have already reopened their borders to tourists, Spain is still blocking foreign travellers and will lift restrictions for EU citizens only on June 22.

In a move to encourage air traffic and visitors to flock back to Spain as soon as restrictions are lifted, the aid package will include advertising campaigns and cash transfers to state-controlled airport operator Aena (MC:AENA) to cut landing fees and other charges.

MILAN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) has asked the European Commission to intervene in a political dispute over its motorway concession, accusing the Italian government of breaching EU law in an escalating two-year row.
The future of the concession held by Atlantia's motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia has been in doubt since the bridge operated by Autostrade collapsed in 2018, killing 43 people.
The government introduced legislation earlier this year to drastically cut the compensation it will have to pay Autostrade if it revoked its motorway concession following alleged company shortcomings.
Atlantia, controlled by the billionaire Benetton family, said in a letter to Brussels that the new legislation had unilaterally modified the concession contract, cutting Autostrade's value and damaging investors.
""This legislative initiative lacks any objective justification and appears to be merely for political ends,"" Atlantia said in the letter seen by Reuters.
Atlantia added it had learned from media reports that the government wanted to force it to sell a majority stake in Autostrade to state-backed entities at a reduced price. 
""We deem it of the utmost importance that the European Commission takes a prompt and firm initiative vis-à-vis the Italian authorities to tackle the reported breach of EU Law,"" it wrote.
Atlantia owns 88% of Autostrade, with Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) and China's Silk Road fund holding the rest. 
""A number of commissioner departments have received this letter. The commission services are now looking at the content. A reply will be sent in due course,"" European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said.
Since the bridge disaster, Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement has threatened to strip the company of its concession.
But its governing partners, the centre-left Democratic Party and centrist Italia Viva, worry revoking the concession would cost billions in compensation to Autostrade, potentially embroiling the state in a legal battle.
""A revocation of Autostrade's concession arbitrarily and in breach of the 2006 rules would indicate a lack of legal certainty in Italy and would frighten foreign investors,"" said Andrea Scauri, asset manager at Lemanik.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday that a proposal by Atlantia to settle the dispute was not good enough and the dossier must be closed quickly.

The BoE has encouraged insurers in particular to look at the risk posed by climate change, and has also warned banks of the dangers of lending to companies whose business models could prove unsustainable as environmental rules change.
Environmental campaigners have criticised the BoE itself for buying corporate bonds issued by companies that cause significant pollution.
Bailey said a BoE review showed the ""carbon intensity"" of its corporate bond holdings was in line with the market average, but that this level of pollution was not consistent with goals to limit climate change.
""This demonstrates the additional work needed to meet the UK's goal of net-zero emissions by 2050,"" he said in the foreword to a report on the BoE's environmental impact.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp's elevator division set for multi-billion euro debt issue: sources,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Christoph Steitz
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) elevator division is set to launch a multi-billion euro high-yield debt package in the coming weeks to help finance its acquisition by a private equity consortium, four sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Advent, Cinven and Germany's RAG foundation signed a 17.2 billion euro ($19.3 billion) deal to buy Thyssenkrupp's elevators division in late February, just as the coronavirus pandemic started to take hold in Europe.
A successful deal would help cement one of the biggest leveraged buyouts by private equity firms of the past decade. The deal is expected to close in July, the sources said.
With bond markets recovering fast from the COVID-19 hit thanks to unprecedented central bank support, a deal involving bonds and loans could be launched as early as next week, one of the sources said.
 Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and UBS (S:UBSG) are leading the process and have been sounding out investors in recent weeks, another source said.
Private equity firms often fund part or all of major acquisitions by getting the target company to raise debt that then sits on its balance sheet once the deal has gone through.
Leverage buyouts have been criticised for loading companies up with debt though private equity firms say the strategy often allows companies both to expand and improve profit margins.
A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp's elevator unit declined to comment. Advent, Cinven, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment while Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.
JUNK IS BACK
The spread of the new coronavirus wreaked havoc on global markets and hit the risky European junk bond market badly. 
But the European Central Bank's massive bond-buying programme and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to include corporate bonds in its purchases has since helped calm nerves. 
While neither of the central banks buys junk-rated corporate debt, bankers say the spillover effect from compressed yields for mainstream bonds has encouraged investors to dip back into Europe's high-yield market in a quest for higher returns.
Bankers say debt issued by Thyssenkrupp's elevator business is likely to be rated junk, just as its parent company is now.
""There is great appetite among investors for bonds from solid companies relatively unaffected by COVID offering a yield of around 6% to 7%,"" the second source said.
The source said no decision had been made on what yield debt issued by Thyssenkrupp's elevator division might offer. 
""It's a sizeable transaction that would announce that the high-yield market is back up and running,"" he said. 
The bonds the elevator division is looking to issue will be a mixture of maturities, a third source said, pointing to the approach used by Blackstone (N:BX) when it bought Refinitiv.
In October 2018, Refinitiv launched a landmark $13.5 billion debt package to finance its purchase by Blackstone that included several loan and bond tranches in both U.S. dollars and euros. 

German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is selling off its elevator division, which is the fourth biggest worldwide, to help pay to restructure its sprawling empire of companies and cut its debt.

LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) -  Prudential  (L:PRU) sold a minority stake in its U.S. business, Jackson, to Apollo Global-backed Athene Holding (N:ATH) for $500 million, the insurer said on Thursday, in the first phase of its plan to create an independent U.S. business.
The London-listed, Asia-focused insurer has been looking for ways to bring external capital into the U.S. annuity provider and said it would continue to evaluate options for the part of the business it still owned, including a minority initial public offering.
The end goal was to create an independent U.S. business, Prudential said, without giving details on how much of Jackson it still wanted to keep.
""This agreement is a key step forward in meeting our strategic objectives for Jackson,"" Chief Executive Mike Wells said in a statement. 
Athene's investment, which hands the retirement services company an 11.1% economic interest in Jackson's enlarged common equity, was expected to close in July, Prudential said.
The sale comes less than four months after U.S. hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) took a more than $2 billion stake and called on Prudential to split into two companies. 
Over the last months, Third Point, which is run by Daniel Loeb, has held discussions with Wells about how to proceed. 
Loeb applauded the sale on Thursday, calling it a great first step, a person familiar with his thinking said. 
""Third Point had suggested a blueprint for Prudential earlier in the year and Wells seems to be in sync with the hedge fund's ideas"", the person said.
Some analysts say there is little logic in Prudential holding onto Jackson, which has few synergies with its Asian arm - where profits and new business sales have historically been higher.
Prudential shares were trading 2.8% up at 1353 GMT.
""The deal is particularly welcome since there were concerns the current market conditions would make a disposal difficult,"" said Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""The inherently unpredictable nature of Jackson's large variable annuity portfolio isn’t exactly the reliable income model investors generally expect from a life insurer.""
In addition, Prudential said Athene - which counts Leon Black's Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) as its biggest shareholder- would fully reinsure $27.6 billion of Jackson's in-force fixed and fixed indexed annuity portfolio from June 1.

The combined effects of investment and reinsurance transactions are expected to raise Jackson's risk-based capital cover ratio by 80 percentage points, Prudential said.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>","Vans, not glamorous, but key as EU weighs autos mega-merger","By Giulio Piovaccari and Gilles Guillaume
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Their silhouettes don't stir dreams of adventure like a sports car or trendy SUV, but vans are a rare source of profit for European carmakers, which is why EU regulators are focused on them as they decide whether to back an industry mega-merger.
European competition regulators are worried that  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA's (PA:PEUP) proposed merger may harm competition in small vans.
With a total of 755,000 vans sold last year in Europe, the combined Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA would get a market share of around 34%, based on industry data, more than double that of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Ford (N:F), with shares around 16% each.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) follow with market shares of 12% and 10% respectively.
""Commercial vans are important for individuals, SMEs and large companies when it comes to delivering goods or providing services to customers,"" European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement, announcing an in-depth investigation into the proposed merger. 
""They are a growing market and increasingly important in a digital economy where private consumers rely more than ever on delivery services"".
Dario Duse, a managing director at consultancy firm AlixPartners, said demand for vans was not based on people's disposable income, as for cars, but rather on GDP and industrial trends, and in particular the logistics industry, where big players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) or DHL operate.
""Logistics is a business segment which is having a significant growth, for several reasons including e-commerce, where you need efficient and agile vans for interurban and city deliveries,"" he said.
""LCVs (light commercial vehicles) may recover faster than passengers cars in the post-COVID-19 phase."" 
Sales of vans up to 3.5 tonnes in Europe amounted to 2.2 millions vehicles last year, compared to 15.8 million for passenger cars, according to data provided by the European Auto Industry Association (ACEA). 
The light commercial vehicles (LCVs) market may be secondary in terms of volumes, but it remains highly profitable in an industry where margins are constantly under pressure.
Margins are generally higher than on passenger cars, up to 5-10 additional percentage points, AlixPartners says. 
""With LCVs you don't have to fulfil a series of consumer expectations that drive additional complexity and costs, such as for interiors. LCV customers are more rational and business driven,"" Duse said.
And while electrification in heavy trucks is complicated, it might come sooner for LCVs.
""If we look at the total cost of ownership, which is key for businesses, electric battery vans are already competitive with those with traditional engines,"" he added.
Prices in the van business are supported by a lower number of competitors and by the lifespan of a product marketed as a long-term investment for professionals.
Pricing is also supported by customised offers for vans. The Renault large van factory at Batilly, for example, offers no less than 350 versions of its Master model.

Profitability also comes from widely shared platforms: Renaults rolls out vehicles for brands including Fiat, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Opel and Daimler. FCA and PSA have been producing LCVs for decades through Sevel, a 50-50 joint venture, whose plant in Atessa, central Italy, is Europe's largest van assembly facility.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton has urged EU governments to be more active in setting global standards for ultralight battery metal lithium, key to many strategic industries and electric cars, or cede technological advantage to China.
Breton's warning underlines the European Commission's concern as China seeks to increase its influence in setting standards for a metal crucial to the bloc's electric car and green energy ambitions, involving major companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn).
His warning comes ahead of a June 24-25 vote by the International Organisation for Standardisation's (ISO) technical management board on a Chinese proposal to set up a committee on lithium standards. China has proposed itself as the secretariat.
The standards would cover lithium mining, extraction, testing, analysis and conversion to useful lithium compounds, such as for use in lithium-ion batteries.
""The EU's key trading partners are very active in developing international standards in key markets to protect and increase their competitive advantage,"" Breton said in a letter to industry ministers in the 27 EU countries and seen by Reuters.
""We need to be vigilant about such processes which can, without the right engagement, unintentionally harm our economic competitiveness and technological leadership,"" he said.
""It is in our interest to give European companies a competitive advantage by making sure that international standards are in line with ours – whether they are ready or in the making,"" Breton said.
France and Germany last month agreed jointly to invest up to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion) to make electric vehicle batteries, taking on the United States and China.
Breton said the Commission would ask the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) to monitor work on new lithium standards.
Acknowledged as the 21st century energy metal, lithium can be used in applications including glass, petrochemical, metallurgy and in the battery, energy, aerospace and nuclear industries.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets reversed losses at the opening to be narrowly mixed after early trading on Thursday, after the latest weekly data for U.S. jobless claims again underlined how long and arduous the road to economic recovery is likely to be. 
Initial jobless claims edged down only slightly to 1.51 million from an upwardly-revised 1.57 million the previous week, while continuing claims - which are reported with a one-week lag but which are considered a more accurate measure of labor market dynamics - stayed stuck above the 20 million mark, defying expectations that they would fall below it for the first time since April.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31 points or 0.1% at 26,086 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.2%.
""Despite all the hype about the strong initial rebound from depressed levels of activity, the labor market scars from the Global #Coronavirus Recession are becoming more apparent,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco via Twitter. 
Among individual stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) fell 4.1% after the grocery store chain pulled its guidance for the rest of the year, despite posting a 19% rise in underlying same-store sales for the three months through May 23. 
Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) fell 2.6% after the company completed its market debut in Hong Kong, a move that may gradually drain liquidity from the New York-listed ADRs.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was unable to add to the new all-time high it posted on Wednesday, against the backdrop of a looming clash between the U.S. and Europe over the taxing of tech giants. The U.S. withdrew from an international process to devise a new framework for taxing multinationals earlier in the week, something that may hasten the imposition of taxes on digital services by the big European economies. That in turn could threaten a response in the form of import tariffs from the U.S. side, President Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro has said. 
In other markets, U.S. crude futures rose 0.7% to $38.22 a barrel, regaining some momentum as a meeting to monitor compliance with the so-called 'OPEC+' alliance's deal on output restraint passed off without major incident, while executives from major trading companies Vitol and Trafigura told Bloomberg that global demand is picking up quickly.

(Reuters) - U.S. investors have ramped up investments in growth funds over the past few months on expectations of higher returns and safety, while they dumped value funds despite cheaper prices after this year's pandemic-linked selloff.
Data from Lipper showed U.S.-growth funds attracted $17.6 billion in April and May, while value funds witnessed outflows worth $16.9 billion.
(GRAPHIC - Monthly flows into US growth and value funds: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqjrgqpx/Monthly%20flows%20into%20US%20growth%20and%20value%20funds.jpg) 
""A strong argument for the growth side is that the largest companies like Apple, Amazon, Google etc, have grown their earnings power to the point where on an operational basis, they generate so much cash and can finance anything they want to do with their stock, or by borrowing,"" said Yale Bock, founder of YH & C Investments in Las Vegas.
""Investors only want to own those entities because they are all large, safe, and have a history of being able to generate high returns on capital along with strong top line growth.""
Growth funds invest in stocks with higher potential to outperform the broader market, while value funds put money in those with lower valuation ratios such as price-to-earnings.
A rally in tech stocks, especially those in the so-called FAANG group, has bolstered growth funds' outperformance over value funds this year. FAANG groups the five most popular, best-performing stocks:  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
On the other hand, financials and energy stocks, which have been hit by lower interest rates and a slump in oil prices, form a major chunk of U.S. value stocks.
The MSCI U.S growth index <.MIUS0000GPUS> has gained 10.25% this year, while the value index <.MIUS0000VPUS> lost 15.77% through Wednesday.

However, some analysts said the outperformance of growth stocks is unlikely to be sustained in the coming months.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",BP raises nearly $12 billion in first hybrid bonds issue,"By Ron Bousso and Kanishka Singh
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  Plc (L:BP) has raised nearly $12 billion in debt, taking advantage of low borrowing costs days after the oil and gas company wrote down 10% of its value as part of its shift towards cleaner energy.
BP on Wednesday raised $11.9 billion in multiple currencies, a spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement, tapping for the first time hybrid bonds which place less strain on the balance sheet as the principal is not required to be repaid.
BP raised $5 billion, 4.75 billion euros ($5.34 billion) and 1.25 billion pounds ($1.56 billion) in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom, respectively, according to data.
The fundraising comes after BP decided earlier this week to write off up to $17.5 billion from the value of its assets, betting the COVID-19 crisis would pressure energy demand and accelerate a shift away from fossil fuels.
The large writedown was set to sharply increase BP's debt-to-equity ratio, known as gearing, that stood at 36% at the of March, excluding leases, which exceeded BP's target of maintaining it in a range of 20% to 30%.
BP's debt stood at $78.5 billion at the end of March, according to Refinitiv data.
But due to the hybrid bond structure, the new debt will be considered for accounting purposes as BP equity, helping BP to reduce the gearing ratio to around 34% in the second quarter,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Thomas Adolff said in a note. 
Rivals including France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) have used hybrid bonds in the past.
""Overall, while more expensive than senior bonds, hybrids diversifies the long term capital structure, is supportive to credit metrics ... and further strengthens the liquidity position in what is admittedly still a highly uncertain macro backdrop,"" Adolff wrote.
It is unclear how the bond will influence BP's decision to maintain or reduce its dividend as it is set to take a big hit to its revenue from an unprecedented collapse in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. 

The company said earlier this month, it would cut about 15% of its workforce in response to the coronavirus crisis and as part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's plan to shift the oil and gas major to renewable energy.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU in advanced talks with Johnson & Johnson on COVID-19 vaccine deal - sources,"By Elvira Pollina and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is in advanced talks with pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to reserve or buy up-front doses of its COVID-19 vaccine under development, two officials familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The move would be the first arranged by the European Union executive since it was mandated by the 27 EU national governments to use an emergency fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to strike deals with up to six vaccine makers.
The Commission's deal with the U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson is ""in the pipeline"", a top health official from an EU member state said, asking to remain anonymous as these were confidential discussions about vaccines between the EU executive and EU governments. 
A second EU source said the Commission had a call with Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday about the possible agreement.
A Commission spokesman had no comment. Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment outside U.S. business hours. 
It was unclear whether any deal would involve an advance purchase of the vaccine in testing, or an option to buy it. 
Johnson & Johnson plans next month to start human clinical trials for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 8.36 million people worldwide, with 447,985 deaths.
Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said last week they had acquired 400 million potential vaccine doses, in principle available to all member states, from British drugmaker AstraZeneca (L:AZN), which is developing a COVID-19 shot in conjunction with Oxford University.
AstraZeneca signed a similar deal in May with the United States.
DEAL AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK?
The health official source said the EU deal with Johnson & Johnson could be announced as early as next week, but cautioned it might take a little longer to finalise, and there was a chance it might not be struck at all.
He said the EU was also seeking a deal with French vaccine-maker Sanofi (PA:SASY). A spokesman for Sanofi had no immediate comment.
EU decision-making procedures pose a potential sticking point, with member states still in talks over the establishment of a steering board for vaccine negotiations with drugmakers, officials told Reuters. 
They said that under a draft plan devised by the EU Commission, which is still to be approved by EU governments, a green light from just four member states would be enough to start formal EU talks with a drugmaker.
But, underlining the urgency of securing a vaccine for the EU's 450 million population, the Commission had already begun talks with Johnson & Johnson even before the steering board has been agreed.
The Netherlands has also been involved in these initial talks with Johnson & Johnson, as a representative of the alliance of the four EU countries that struck the AstraZeneca deal, officials told Reuters.
This alliance is expected to halt negotiations with drugmakers once the EU has appointed its negotiation team, to avoid competition among EU states, officials said.
""Johnson and Johnson's vaccine is one of the promising initiatives,"" a spokesman for the Dutch health ministry said, declining to comment on the talks underway.
By buying vaccines under development, the EU risks acquiring shots that may eventually prove unsuccessful against COVID-19.

But the risk is justified by the need to secure enough doses for the EU population in the global race for an effective vaccine, EU officials say.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Snow Park Capital Partners is urging Front Yard Residential (NYSE:RESI) Corporation's board to liquidate the real estate company, arguing this is the best plan following a scuttled merger deal that sent its shares tumbling last month.
""We urge the Board to divert from its value-destructive path and pivot to returning capital to long-suffering stockholders via an orderly liquidation of Front Yard's portfolio,"" Snow Park Managing Partner Jeffrey Pierce wrote to the board on Thursday. 
A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.
This would likely yield more than the $12.50 a share offered by rival Amherst Residential before the planned $2.3 billion merger was called off in May, Pierce wrote.
Front Yard's stock fell 1% to close at $8.36 on Wednesday, down 32% since January. In the last five years, it has lost about half its value and dramatically underperformed its peers which gained roughly 28%.
Pierce blames management and in his letter asked the board to remove Chief Executive George Ellison, who was put on administrative leave earlier in June by Front Yard's external manager, Altisource Asset Management Company.
A Front Yard representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The hedge fund, which owns roughly 1% of the $452 million company based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, also warned it would challenge the board by nominating a slate of directors if ""the necessary changes are not made this year.""
Snow Park ran a proxy contest last year to protest poor performance and management's high compensation, and settled for two board seats. ""We underestimated the extent to which insiders would revert to their old habits over the course of just a year's time,"" he wrote on Thursday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told two state-run telecoms firms to use locally-made rather than Chinese telecom equipment to upgrade their mobile networks to 4G, a senior government source said on Thursday.
New Delhi's move comes amid a backlash against companies from China after the killing this week of 20 Indian soldiers by Chinese forces in a Himalayan border dispute.
The instruction is aimed at Chinese telecom gear makers Huawei and ZTE, the source said, after India last year announced an almost $8 billion plan, some of which was earmarked for network upgrades, to help loss-making operators Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) and  Mahanagar Telephone Nigam  (MTNL) (NS:MTNL).
""Since that plan will be funded by public money they (BSNL, MTNL) should try to ensure they buy made in India equipment,"" the government source, who declined to be named as the order was not public, told Reuters.
India's department of telecoms did not respond to a request for comment. The head of BSNL and MTNL (NS:MTNL) did not answer calls or messages seeking comment.
Huawei [HWT.UL] declined to comment and ZTE (HK:0763), which potentially risks losing tens of millions of dollars in orders, did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chinese companies face a public backlash after the worst clash since 1967 between China and India, where anti-Chinese sentiment is already strong.
Beijing has also come under fire over the coronavirus outbreak, with social media campaigns urging Indians to boycott Chinese goods.
The effective ban on the use of Chinese network gear could extend to private telcos like  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI) and Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) which also use it in their networks.
""There will probably be some communication... may be not a cease and desist, but a plea to avoid using Chinese equipment in core networks,"" a telecom industry source, who has worked closely with Chinese telecom equipment makers, said.
Any ban could increase costs for Indian telcos, which would have to rely more on European firms like Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (ST:ERICb), as India has limited domestic expertise in telecom equipment manufacturing.

The Russsian state-controlled company has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has grounded most passenger planes around the globe and reduced demand for its products from planemakers.
""The shutdown is an extreme measure. And we are not going to take that extreme measure in August. We are now looking at September. The decision will depend on how many orders we actually get by early autumn,"" VSMPO quoted acting CEO Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Kuzyuk telling a recent meeting with the company's labour union.
The situation in its sector will remain very difficult this year, but the company still hopes that it will find enough orders to cover its costs and avoid the shutdown.
""The suspension is highly unlikely,"" VSMPO told Reuters on Thursday.
VSMPO in June held talks with planemakers, its main clients under long-term contracts, and they agreed to continue buying some amount of the titanium products.
""This will significantly support us,"" Kuzyuk, who became the acting CEO in May, was quoted as saying by VSMPO.
The company is also in talks to increase supplies to Russian planemakers as it is now less busy with orders from its main foreign customers. 
It also is considering supplies to sectors such as shipbuilding, which needs cheaper titanium of lower quality, Kuzyuk said.
VSMPO downgraded its 2020 production forecast by 32% to 26,500 tonnes in April, when the massive effect of the coronavirus on its sector became clear.
The company is currently producing 1,200-1,300 tonnes of titanium products a month, down from 2,700 tonnes a year ago. It hopes to raise its monthly output to 1,500-1,600 tonnes in 2021, Kuzyuk added.

The pound was trading 0.2% lower against the U.S. dollar, and the yield on 10-year bonds climbed, a sign that some market watchers were disappointed that policy makers were playing it safe by boosting its quantitative-easing program by 100 billion pounds ($125 billion), the amount forecast by economists.
The BOE also said the bond buying program will finish around the turn of the year, suggesting a slower pace of gilt purchases.
“It’s a bit less dovish than expected,” said John Wraith, head of U.K. and European rates strategy at UBS. “The speculation they would err on the side of doing more rather than less were clearly dashed.”
Investors have been pricing in more stimulus from the BOE to help ease financial conditions, and are betting on the prospect of negative interest rates in the next year. The policy efforts have helped sterling bounce back from a 35-year low versus the dollar in March, when the coronavirus forced lockdowns, but the outlook for the U.K. economy remains bleak.
Ten-year gilt yields climbed five basis points to 0.24%.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Hungary aims for quick decision on three-way bank merger,"By Gergely Szakacs
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary plans to decide ""very quickly"" on a proposed three-bank merger to create the country's second biggest lender, a government minister said, signalling strong political will to push ahead with the project before elections in spring 2022.
State-owned Budapest Bank said last month it would join in merger plans of MKB Bank and savings and loans group Takarek (MTB), creating a bank with assets worth 5.8 trillion forints ($18.93 billion) and offering scope for potential cost savings.
The merger, which would allow the trio to leapfrog over foreign rivals in Hungary in terms of size, fits Prime Minister Viktor Orban's agenda to boost the role of domestic players in key sectors of the economy such as finance, energy and the media. 
Hungary acquired Budapest Bank from GE Capital in 2015 and government officials said it would make be a good match for MKB, which is emerging from a European Union restructuring process.
Takarek, which has an extensive rural branch network, has been working to transform itself into a universal banking group to compete with rivals OTP (BU:OTPB), Austria's Erste Group (VI:ERST) or Belgium's KBC (BR:KBC).
""We need to move very quickly,"" Orban's minister in charge of state assets, Andrea Mager told Reuters in an interview when asked about the merger. ""We cannot have either one of these banks exposed to uncertainty regarding this option for long.""
Despite the political will, the project faces serious challenges, including the likelihood of recession due to the coronavirus pandemic, which could curb lending activity and trigger a rise in bad loans.
Some bankers have also privately expressed scepticism about the project given the complexity of merging banks with different business profiles and corporate cultures.
""You may have three well-functioning standalone banks, but that alone does not guarantee that their combination will also work,"" said a banking source with experience in M&A deals.
Mager declined to give a timeline, saying the group was hiring advisers currently to explore potential synergies.
""The goal is to have a strong second bank from this co-operation,"" she said. ""If they want to be an assertive competitor, they will need to reflect this in their pricing as well.""
However, she dismissed the notion that the project would be aimed at dominant player OTP.
OTP Bank is Hungary's banking market leader and central Europe's largest independent lender, which is present in a dozen countries and had total assets of 21.9 trillion forints at the end of the first quarter.
OTP's core Hungarian subsidiary alone is nearly twice the size of the post-merger trio with total assets of 10.5 trillion forints.
If the three-way merger goes ahead the group would have more than 900 branches, double the size of OTP's network, which would need streamlining to realise cost savings from the deal -- a politically painful prospect for 2021, a pre-election year.

1417,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Edge Lower Amid Virus Concerns,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open slightly lower Thursday after recent gains, amid concerns that a potential second coronavirus wave could stunt the economic recovery.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.4%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 8 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract fell 114 points, or 0.4%. 
The Dow snapped a three-day winning streak Wednesday, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq powered on, as a rise in infections in a number of states, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas, stoked fears that social distancing restrictions could be reimposed, dealing a fresh blow to the economy.
That said, these indices are still on course to post their fourth winning week out of the last five, helped by hefty amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus and nascent signs of an upturn.
The Bank of England added to this stimulus earlier Thursday, increasing its quantitative easing program by an additional 100 billion pounds, while the European Central Bank carried out what will be its largest ever injection of liquidity, dishing out 1.3 trillion euros in long-term loans at rates as low as -1.0%.
With this in mind, attention will turn to the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), the most up to date gauge of U.S. employment trends.
These claims are expected to be 1.3 million for the week ending June 13, down from 1.54 million reported the prior week, continuing a downward trend as the Covid-19 lockdowns continue to ease. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.8 million, compared with 20.9 million the prior week.
Additionally, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for June is expected to come in at a negative 23, which would be an improvement from the negative 43 recorded for May. The negative 56 recorded in April was the lowest level in 40 years.
In corporate news, tech giants-such as-Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are likely to be in focus after the United States administration decided to pull out of negotiations on a global solution to taxing digital services late Wednesday.
Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) stock dropped 9.5% after the car rental firm pulled its controversial $500 million share offering after security regulators vowed to review it.
T-Mobile  (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock gained 1.3% premarket after it predicted a healthy rise in customers this year after the closing bell on Wednesday. 
Oil prices rebounded Thursday, despite a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories and a downbeat report from OPEC on the world oil market.
U.S. crude prices rose 0.7% to $38.24 a barrel, while Brent Futures climbed 1.1% to $41.16.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,730.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1244, flat on the day.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Vanguard names names and backs some calls for climate steps,"By Ross Kerber and Sinead Cruise
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group, the world's largest mutual fund manager, backed shareholder resolutions for shippers  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc (O:JBHT) and oil driller Ovintiv Inc (N:OVV) to limit their climate-warming emissions, according to a top Vanguard executive and a company report being released on Thursday.
The details marked the first time the Pennsylvania-based firm has named names in describing such proxy votes at recent shareholder meetings.
In an interview with Reuters, Vanguard principal Glenn Booraem said the firm's views on climate and its proxy votes reflect a growing consensus among investors and companies that businesses should account for the risks of operating on a warmer planet. 
Climate change ""is getting increasing attention at every level of the market,"" he said.
Vanguard had raised climate concerns previously, without singling out companies by name or airing too much ""dirty laundry,"" as Booraem put it last year.
But with growing interest among investors about climate impacts, the new vote details are a way for Vanguard to show executives and its own clients how the firm puts its views into practice, Booraem said.
""We are on this climate journey and will continue to evolve, over time, at our own pace,"" he said.
As a top shareholder in nearly every major U.S. company, Vanguard’s voice is often dominant in boardroom decisions. Vanguard manages some $6 trillion under management for 30 million mom-and-pop investors.
Traditionally Vanguard and its main rival, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), have backed shareholder climate resolutions only about 10% of the time. Critics, including Vanguard's late founder, John Bogle, have long called for more transparency on how the asset managers vote.
Booraem declined to say what Vanguard's overall support rate will be for climate measures this year, which will make up a tiny slice of the votes it will cast at roughly 13,000 companies worldwide during the 12 months ended June 30. 
He declined to comment whether Vanguard would follow BlackRock in joining the Climate Action 100+ investor group seeking emissions cuts.
But Booraem said a report scheduled to be posted Thursday on Vanguard's website includes specific examples that are meant to be representative of the company's thinking on climate change. It aims to take a fiduciary approach and not an ideological one, he said, especially given the wide range of views among its clients.
The report shows that among nine shareholder resolutions voted on since April, Vanguard sided with management five times. For instance Vanguard voted against a proposal to have JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) report how it would use its lending to cut emissions, saying the bank has already taken adequate steps.
In four other examples Vanguard sided with shareholders sponsoring the resolutions. One was a call for UPS (N:UPS) to report on plans to reduce its climate-warming carbon emissions, saying UPS had failed to disclose how it would cut airplane fuel usage.
Vanguard also voted in favor of a proposal to have Ovintiv (N:OVV) set emission-reduction targets, saying they would help investors understand the company's strategy.
Vanguard's votes did not determine the outcomes of the two questions. Public securities filings show at UPS 30% of votes cast favored the measure, a figure that would include Vanguard's roughly 8% holding of Class B shares.
At Ovintiv 56% of votes favored the measure; Vanguard owns less than 1% of shares outstanding.
Representatives for UPS and Ovintiv declined to comment.
Vanguard did determine the outcome at J.B. Hunt (O:JBHT), where it holds about 10% of shares. A measure calling for the trucker's plans to cut emissions -- similar to what was asked of UPS -- won support from 54% of votes cast, filings show. 
A J.B. Hunt representative did not respond to requests for comment.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Online fashion stocks in vogue as coronavirus speeds ecommerce,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in online fashion retailers Zalando and ASOS (LON:ASOS) jumped on Thursday after the German company said it expects a big increase in second-quarter sales and operating profit as coronavirus lockdowns accelerate a shift to ecommerce.
The growth rate of online fashion looks set to triple this year to account for 23% of European sales in 2020, levels not expected before 2024 prior to the pandemic, analysts at Bernstein said, adding the market share could hit 37% by 2030.
""The sudden closure of all apparel retail stores across all major global markets has shaken up the channel mix in an unprecedented way this year,"" said Bernstein's Aneesha Sherman. ""(It's) five years' worth of growth achieved in about six months.""
Zalando, Europe's biggest online only fashion retailer, said late on Wednesday it expects to significantly beat market expectations for 16% second-quarter revenue growth and an adjusted operating profit of 104 million euros ($117 million).
Zalando's shares were up 5.65% by 0904 GMT, bringing their year-to-date gain to more than 40%. 
British rival ASOS was also up almost 5%, after shares in Boohoo soared on Wednesday when it said it would top market expectations this year after a 45% rise in first-quarter revenue.
Boohoo, which owns the Nasty Gal and prettylittlething brands, also said it was buying the online businesses of struggling British bricks-and-mortar brands Oasis and Warehouse after last year buying Karen Millen and Coast.
Zalando said it had been helped by its strategy of becoming a marketplace for brands, offering them marketing and logistics services, rather than just selling stock on its website.
Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the world's biggest fashion retailer, said last week it expects online sales to make up a quarter of its sales by 2022, compared to 14% now, after a 95% surge in lockdown conditions in April.
H&M reported on Monday its group sales halved in March-May and were down 30% in the first 13 days of June even as stores started to reopen. Online sales jumped 36% in March-May.
But there are still some bright spots in brick-and-mortar retailing. Discount fashion retailer Primark, owned by Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY), attracted long lines of shoppers on Monday as shops reopened in England.
Bernstein's Sherman notes that people still love shopping in stores as they can see and feel what they are buying, and they can seek out bargains at places like Primark that do not sell online.
""Stores will also offer a much-needed outlet for discretionary time, money, and social interaction this year. All the other usual alternatives will remain largely off the table for a little while longer,"" she wrote.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","Automakers rev up U.S. assembly lines, wary of outside risks to workers","By Ben Klayman and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers are speeding up U.S. assembly lines to meet recovering demand, increasingly confident coronavirus safety protocols are working to prevent outbreaks in their plants but wary of the challenges workers face outside. 
Screening workers for COVID-19 using temperature scans and questionnaires, the automakers have detected some people who reported for work despite being sick. Some plants have been briefly shut down for disinfection, but so far, there has not been a major outbreak within a U.S. auto plant since most reopened May 18, company and United Auto Workers union officials said. 
The risk of an infection picked up outside a plant spreading along assembly lines remains a prime concern, however. An outbreak could shut down a factory costing a manufacturer millions of dollars a day. The disruption caused by the pandemic is creating other challenges as well. 
At  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) F-series pickup truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, the company has given more than 1,000 workers leave related to COVID-19 concerns. It hired temporary workers to fill their jobs as the plant accelerates production of trucks critical to Ford's financial recovery.
Demand for pickup trucks helped boost U.S. auto sales in May, and contributed to stronger than expected overall U.S. retail sales for the month.
Officials of UAW Local 862, which represents workers at the Louisville plant, said a lack of child care was a significant issue for members. It had led many to stay away from the plant and collect increased unemployment benefits provided under the federal CARES coronavirus relief act.
Ford has now begun arranging subsidized child care for UAW workers, Gary Johnson, the automaker's head of manufacturing told Reuters.
""As we have rolled out this program in Kentucky and elsewhere, the number of people gone under the CARES Act has dropped,"" Johnson said.
On the job, auto workers are required to wear masks and face shields, sit or stand six feet (1.83 meters) apart and avoid touching, following protocols the major manufacturers and the UAW have jointly developed. But outside the plant, there is widespread flouting of mask and social distancing recommendations nationally, union and company officials said.
""People leave work and then they have their own protocols outside of the workplace,"" said Gerald Kariem, UAW vice president and director of the union's Ford department. ""But in terms of the workplace, the protocols are probably better than the protocols that you'll see out in the general public."" 
With COVID-19 cases rising in some states where it has factories, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) within the past week has redoubled efforts to tell employees at its U.S. plants that the safety protocols they observe on the job should be carried into their lives away from work. The company is adopting the slogan ""Safe Anywhere."" 
""Once people leave the plant and leave the gates, it becomes hit or miss,"" said Norm Bafunno, vice president of manufacturing for Toyota's North American operations. 
Toyota has identified 40 plant employees who came to work, reported symptoms or risk factors for coronavirus infection and turned out to have the virus, company spokeswoman Kelly McNeff said.
Managers and workers are trying to improve on the safety procedures instituted when factories reopened. A concern across the industry is how uncomfortable it can be to wear a mask on a fast-moving assembly line as heat and humidity rise.
Toyota workers are testing face screens that have small fans installed at the top, run from battery packs, Bafunno said.

At Ford, the company is producing enough masks on its own that it can now offer workers up to five a day.

The latest regulatory approval for a U.S. financial services company coincides with tension between Beijing and Washington, increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and China's move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong.
JPMorgan reportedly sought full control of its China futures joint venture last December as Beijing moved to scrap caps on foreign ownership. The futures industry in China is dominated by local players.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement posted on its website the approval would bring in more qualified foreign players.
JPMorgan had no immediate comment. 
China's central bank on Saturday gave the final nod to a network clearing licence for an  American Express  (N:AXP) joint venture, allowing it to be the first foreign credit card company to launch onshore operations in China.
The approval for JPMorgan to launch its futures business follows on from other licences the bank has received in the last six months to increase its shareholding in other financial services business in China.
Caps on the foreign ownership of futures companies were scrapped at the start of this year.
China is a ""critical market"" for clients globally, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in December when the bank received approval to establish a majority-owned securities joint venture, offering brokerage, investment advisory and underwriting services.

In April, the biggest bank in the U.S. said it would raise its stake in a Chinese mutual fund venture to 100%.

Investing.com -- The governance scandal at one of Europe’s most popular tech stocks took a dramatic turn for the worse on Thursday, as German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) was forced for a third time to delay the publication of its 2019 accounts on suspicion of fraud.
In a statement to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Wirecard said its auditors Ernst & Young had failed to find “sufficient audit evidence” for around 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in revenue for the year – around one quarter of the revenue the company was set to report.
Wirecard stock fell as much as 65% to a three-year low on the news, which leaves the company all-but unable to meet a crucial deadline. Lenders will be able to call in effectively all of the group’s 2 billion euros in debt if the accounts aren’t published by tomorrow. The stock rebounded modestly to trade down 50% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT). The benchmark DAX rose 0.2%.
“There are indications that spurious balance confirmations had been provided from the side of the trustee respectively of the trustee's account holding banks to the auditor in order to deceive the auditor and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances or the holding of the accounts for to the benefit of Wirecard group companies,” the company said, adding that it is “working intensively together with the auditor towards a clarification of the situation.”
According to Wirecard’s last quarterly statements, the company had 3.8 billion euros of cash and short-term investments and long-term debt of 1.7 billion.
The long-running allegations, which have accompanied Wirecard in one form or another for much of the last 10 years, have become a litmus test for the state of corporate governance and investor protection in Germany. The saga has pitted a loyal band of mainly domestic retail investors against largely U.K.-based short-sellers in an increasingly intense struggle. As of this week, some 28 million shares – over 22% of the outstanding total – were shorted.
The company had initially enjoyed the support of the German financial establishment, notably from regulator Bafin. Bafin had sympathized with the company’s complaints that it was being unfairly targeted by price-manipulating short-sellers, with the help of the Financial Times (the FT has always said it stands by its reporting).
But the tide appeared to be turning against it earlier this month when a criminal complaint filed by Bafin led to a police search of the company’s headquarters outside Munich.
That complaint referred to statements made by Wirecard’s management ahead of the publication of a special audit by KPMG in April. Management put an aggressively positive and selective spin on a report whose main conclusion was that certain sales over three years had been impossible to verify. 
In addition to its legal problems in Germany, the company is being sued in London by investors in a company acquired by Wirecard in 2015, and faces a separate criminal investigation in Singapore."

In contrast to major outbreaks seen in other big cities around the world, Hong Kong has reported a relatively small number of infections, recording 1,121 cases and four deaths. The border remains virtually shut but life is slowly returning to normal.
Dozens of visitors were seen queuing to get into the park on Thursday morning, many of them families with children.
""In the past few months I missed coming here so much,"" said annual pass holder Vicky Lam, 36, as she waved at staff wearing  Disney  character costumes. 
The park says its shopping and dining locations will have reduced capacity and that it will implement social distancing measures in any queues and throughout its facilities.
It will also carry out disinfection more frequently and make hand sanitisers available for visitors, who are required to go through temperature screening and wear a face mask.
Hong Kong's Disneyland resort, which reported losses for at least the past three years according to annual reports available on its website, is owned by a joint venture, Hongkong International Theme Parks Ltd, in which the local government has 53% stake and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co holds the rest.
Without tourists, business for Disneyland in Hong Kong is likely to remain subdued. It will have to rely on a domestic market that was struggling with recession after months of often-violent pro-democracy protests even before the coronavirus blow.
Ocean Park, the city's other theme park, reopened on Saturday after lawmakers approved a HK$5.4 billion ($697 million) bailout plan last month to keep it running for another year.

Shanghai's Disneyland, which is able to attract visitors from outside the city, re-opened in May.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded slightly lower Thursday, as concerns of a resurgence of Covid-19 infections outweighed optimism of improving economic activity, although trading was muted ahead of some important central bank events and the release of U.S. jobless claims later.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.4%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.3%. 
China reported 21 new cases in Beijing on Wednesday, ,a drop from Tuesday's level, bringing the total number of cases stemming from the weekend outbreak to over 150. 
At the same time a number of U.S. states, including Texas, Florida and Arizona, have reported a jump in infections, stoking fears that lawmakers may move to restrict economic reopenings.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that output and employment in America would remain well short of their pre-pandemic levels for a long time, particularly if the outbreak isn’t contained.
Attention will now switch to the Bank of England, and the central bank is expected to increase its quantitative easing program by at least another 100 billion pounds ($125 billion) at its meeting late Thursday.
The BoE is set to exhaust its current program within the next couple of months at the current rate of buying, and an increase would help avoid premature discussion about ending the policy or of tapering.
The market will also get the results of the European Central Bank’s TLTRO liquidity operation later Thursday, with this seen as an important measure in the region's crisis response to the pandemic.
In corporate news, Siemens  Gamesa  Renewable Energy (MC:SGREN) stock dropped 3.8% after the wind turbine maker’s CEO resigned with the company saying it would post an adjusted operating loss in the third quarter.

Oil prices stabilized Thursday, after the Energy Information Administration reported late Wednesday that stockpiles of U.S. oil rose 1.2 million barrels last week, adding to mounting evidence that it will take quite some time to reduce excess global stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.9 million-barrel build for the week ending June 12 on Tuesday.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Glass Lewis joins ISS in opposing Tesla chairwoman's re-election to board,"By Bhargav Acharya and Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Glass Lewis said on Thursday that it urged Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) investors to vote against re-electing Chairwoman Robyn Denholm to the company's board, making it the second proxy advisory firm to oppose her appointment.
The recommendation was based on corporate governance concerns due to an insurance arrangement with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after Tesla's decision to not renew its directors and officers' liability policy due to high premiums quoted by insurers, Glass Lewis said.
Musk had agreed to personally provide coverage to such a policy for a year, Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing in April.
""We are concerned that this D&O arrangement gives the company's independent directors a direct, personal financial dependency upon the CEO they are tasked with overseeing,"" Glass Lewis said.
Since Denholm heads the audit committee that permitted the insurance arrangement, it recommends voting against her, Glass Lewis said. 
The recommendation by Glass Lewis was first reported by Bloomberg News.
Earlier this week, another proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) opposed Denholm's re-election on concerns over her leadership, citing high compensation for directors and a steep rise in share pledging by certain Tesla directors and executives, during her stint.
Denholm, the company's director for nearly six years, has been Tesla's chairwoman since November 2018. She is also a member of the company's audit and compensation committee.
The company's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for July 7. 

Tesla did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Thursday as spiking coronavirus cases in some U.S. states and in China dented hopes of a quick global economic comeback from the pandemic.
S&P 500 mini futures  fell as much as 1.4% in early Asian trade and last traded down 0.7% while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) shed as much as 1% before paring losses to 0.15%.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) lost 1.3% while mainland China bucked the trend, with blue-chip CSI300 shares (CSI300) posting gains of 0.6%.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.36% on Wednesday but tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) added 0.15% due to hopes of increased demand for various online services due to the epidemic.
The daily count of infections hit a new high in California and Texas, the two most populous states in the country, while Florida, the third largest, also recorded its second-highest daily increase.
Several other U.S. states including Oklahoma, where President Donald Trump plans a campaign rally on Saturday, reported a surge in new infections. 
In China, Beijing cancelled scores of flights, shut schools and blocked off some neighbourhoods as it ramped up efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak that has fanned fears of wider contagion.
""It is a big shock to markets that China, which appears to have successfully quashed the disease, is seeing a second wave. And in the U.S. we see record cases in many states,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""All this suggests that the more you re-start the economy, the more infections you have. People have thought the economy will quickly recover in July-September after dismal April-June. But that is now becoming uncertain.""

Some investors also worried about further paralysis in Washington as Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton accused him of sweeping misdeeds that included explicitly seeking Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election.
Border tensions between North and South Korea, and between India and China, also helped sour sentiment for risky assets.
Investors rushed to the safety of bonds, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield (US10YT=RR) falling 2 basis points to 0.710%.
""In the near-term, we have had a lot of risk-off factors including Bolton and geopolitical tensions in Asia,"" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) in Tokyo.
""But on the other hand, risk assets are supported by ample liquidity from central banks. I don't see that changing yet and do not expect major sell-off in risk assets.""
In the currency market, the safe-haven yen rose about 0.2% to 106.81 per dollar  while the U.S. dollar also firmed against risk-sensitive currencies.
The euro was on back foot at $1.1250 (EUR=) ahead of a video conference between EU leaders on Friday, where they are expected to discuss a proposed 750 billion euro aid package to help countries deal with fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
The Australian dollar  fell 0.2% to $0.6867, hit by worse than expected employment data.
Australia's unemployment rate jumped to the highest in about two decades in May as nearly a quarter of a million people lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic-driven shutdowns.

Oil prices also dropped with U.S. crude futures  falling 1.9% to $37.49 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent (LCOc1) lost 1.4% to $40.14 a barrel.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Australia begins probe into Rio's destruction of Aboriginal site,"(Reuters) - Australia called for submissions on Thursday to an inquiry into how mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) legally blew up two sacred Aboriginal caves that showed human history stretching back at least 46,000 years.
Rio in late May destroyed the sacred caves in the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, having been granted state government approval in 2013.
The inquiry will examine how the destruction of the caves came about, the processes that failed to protect the site, the impacts on traditional owners, and the legislative changes required to prevent such incidents from recurring, according to a statement from the committee overseeing the inquiry.
""It is an opportunity for us to delve into how to get the balances right that seems to be what's not in sync at the moment and understand the best practices that companies have adopted in the past and why something went wrong on this occasion"", Pat Dodson, Senator for Western Australia state, said at a press conference.
""It's not a new issue but a very sensitive issue on all sides"", added Dodson, an Aboriginal from Broome on the north coast of Western Australia.
Rio Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques apologised last week for distress caused by the destruction of the caves and pledged full cooperation with the inquiry.
Australia's Senate agreed to begin the national inquiry into how the destruction of a cultural and historically significant site occurred, led by the Northern Australia Committee.
""The Committee wants to find out how this was allowed to happen and how we will prevent such occurrences in the future,"" Committee Chair Warren Entsch said in the statement.
BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) received approval to disturb culturally significant Aboriginal sites as part of a mine expansion, days after the incident.
Rio, Western Australian government, traditional owner groups, representative bodies, Minerals Council, Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and other representative bodies are likely to represent themselves during the inquiry. 

Other miners under scrutiny include Fortescue Metals, which lost an appeal bid in May against a court decision in an indigenous land case.

1433,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 02:09AM ET</span>","Liquidity Surge Seen as S&P, Russell Make Changes in Covid Era","(Bloomberg) -- Investors are bracing for a surge in trading volumes as trillions of dollars benchmarked to S&P and Russell indexes adjust their weightings when the U.S. gauges rebalance members in coming days.
In the Covid-19 era, the revisions will be even more closely watched. Not only have markets moved significantly in recent months, making some index changes more sizable than they might be in other years. S&P also delayed the quarterly rebalancing originally scheduled for March due to volatility, making for higher expected turnover this time around.
“It’s almost like two rebalances in one,” said Gerry O’Reilly, a portfolio manager at Vanguard Group. “The turnover for each of the different sectors in S&P, each of the different market caps, it’s a little larger than it has been in the past,” and about $54 billion in total trading around the event is expected, he said.
On June 26, it’s the Russell reconstitution, which Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has already said is likely to be a record-breaker. Net trading could be around $65 billion, most of which will take place in the final minutes of trading that day, Keefe Bruyette & Woods’s Melissa Roberts said in a note June 14.
Rebalances often fuel high-volume stock-trading days in the U.S., as investments that track the indexes buy and sell to mimic the benchmarks.
Because bigger companies are getting bigger and the declines in the values of small companies is steeper, the smallest components of the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes will have lower market capitalizations than previously, Catherine Yoshimoto of Russell Investments said.
The Russell 2000’s smallest component is under $100 million for the first time since 2009, she said in an interview on June 15. In terms of notable style changes, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO). is being classified entirely as Value from Growth, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. is being moved from 100% Growth to partially Value, she said.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>","Air maintenance firms, manufacturers plan for $60 billion in lost sales","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Maintenance firms and spare parts producers who keep airplanes running are bracing for a decline of up to 75% in sales this year - and more pain to follow - as airlines park or retire thousands of aircraft due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Worth about $80 billion in sales last year, the industry ranges from engine makers like  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L:RR) to systems companies like Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (N:RTX) and a host of smaller suppliers.
Jetliners on average cost $3 million a year to service and make up a significant portion of revenue for most of these firms. That is under threat as the crisis cripples air travel and reduces the number of hours planes spend in the air, pushing back overhauls.
""We foresee reduction in maintenance, repair and overhaul demand of 60% or more for commercial aero engines (in 2020). And production will fall 40-50%,"" said Kevin Michaels, managing director at aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.
""We will have an overhang of thousands and thousands of aircraft more than we require for years. To balance that out, you are going to have to retire thousands of aircraft.""
The decline of up to 75% in services revenue, which amounts to about $60 billion in lost sales, was estimated by analyst Richard Aboulafia at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.
Lower demand for new jets is also causing the industry to revisit projections for demand for services later on, as fewer jets come down the pipeline for future parts servicing. 
Thousands of layoffs are already planned or under way but some aerospace experts suggest the impact is likely to be deeper than originally thought and point to several years of hard choices, with the market properly recovering only in 2023. 
The International Air Transport Association said last week that airlines would lose $84 billion in 2020, with revenue down by half to $419 billion, the worst year in the sector’s history.
""This is going to be a very brutal time for companies dependent upon aftermarket revenues,"" Aboulafia said. 
""The job cuts and spending cuts have only begun,"" he added. ""Generally, they need to fall as closely in line with output as possible, and output - of aircraft and spare parts - has only begun to be cut too.""

HALT
Some 18,000 planes, or around 65% of the global fleet, were grounded throughout April and most of May and the industry is now planning for a global recession and a future where business travel is reduced and holidaymakers stay closer to home. 
Estimates collected by Reuters suggest the reduced demand will result in fewer than 20,000 planes in use in 2021 compared with an active fleet of about 27,000 planes in 2019.
All analysts with whom Reuters spoke said they did not expect maintenance spending to recover to 2019 levels until 2023. 
Numbers on the current age of fleets, together with indications given by some airlines, suggest between 1,500 and 2,600 aircraft could be retired over the next 12 months, more than three times as many as in a typical year.
At $3 million a plane, that adds up to $7.8 billion in lost aftermarket revenue. But planes over 10 years old also tend to demand more work. They make up around 48% of the current fleet, but account for more than half the maintenance, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman. So lost revenue is likely to rise.
""As aircraft are retired, aircraft operators will extract parts (used serviceable material) from retired aircraft rather than purchase parts from aftermarket suppliers,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn said.
Costs per plane also vary drastically. A young Boeing (N:BA) 737 may cost less than $1.5 million to maintain, while a widebody 777 or 787 four times as much. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), in one example, is cutting 18 Boeing 777 planes which one analyst told Reuters cost $7.3 million each on average to maintain per year. 
Timothy Kuder from consultancy Frost & Sullivan said airlines are likely to make ""significant"" job cuts once a moratorium on new layoffs under the government's bailout runs out in September. 
""What that means for the companies reliant on aftermarket revenue ... (is) there is going to be less business out there than (parts suppliers) are able to sustain with their workforce.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector have deteriorated markedly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Swiss National Bank said on Thursday, but big banks UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) are favourably placed to manage challenges.
""The simultaneous deterioration in the economic situation in all regions of the world, together with the unusually high level of uncertainty, poses significant challenges for the two globally active Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and UBS,"" the central bank said in its 2020 financial stability report.
""However...both of the globally active Swiss banks are well placed to face the challenges posed by the current difficult
environment and support the real economy. This favourable
situation is attributable to risk reduction and, in particular,
to the build-up of capital buffers over recent years,"" it said, adding these development fell in line with 'too big to fail' regulations.
UBS and Credit Suisse had until the end of 2019 to prepare so-called resolution plans that would prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out in the event of a crisis.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB), which helps oversee the stability of the country's financial system, said thanks to capital build-up, the two banks would be able to cope with significantly worse economic developments than assumed under its baseline scenario.

It said it expected a number of domestically focused banks to incur losses as their profitability fell from an already low level, adding a longer and deeper downturn would have a more negative impact on the quality of domestically focused lenders' loan portfolios.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:19AM ET</span>","FAA chief acknowledges agency, Boeing made mistakes on 737 MAX","By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, acknowledged on Wednesday that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and the U.S. air safety agency both made mistakes on the 737 MAX jet, but rejected senators' accusations the FAA was ""stonewalling"" probes after two fatal crashes.
Boeing's 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people, triggering multiple investigations into how the plane was certified as safe.
In a particularly tense exchange at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aircraft certification, Senator Ted Cruz accused Dickson of speaking in the passive voice as a way of ""avoiding responsibility"" after Dickson told him, ""Mistakes were made.""
""So unknown somebodies made unspecified mistakes for which there were no repercussions,"" Cruz said. ""What mistakes were made and who made them?""
After a pause, Dickson said, ""The manufacturer made mistakes and the FAA made mistakes in its oversight."" Dickson then referred to Boeing's development of a flight control system that repeatedly pushed down the jet's nose in both crashes as pilots battled to gain control. ""The full implications of the flight control system were not understood as design changes were made,"" he said.
One senator at the hearing said the agency was like ""a dog watching TV"" when it came to policing Boeing's work, and another said the agency was ""stonewalling"" the committee's investigation into the 737 MAX's development.
""Your team at the FAA has attempted deliberately to keep us in the dark,"" Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican committee chairman, told Dickson. 
Dickson told Wicker he was ""totally committed to the oversight process.""
""I believe it is inaccurate to portray the agency as unresponsive,"" Dickson said, pointing to its cooperation in multiple investigations. ""There is still ongoing work.""
After the hearing, an FAA official said the agency has provided ""more than 7,400 pages of responsive materials"" to the committee and that some material was restricted by international rules on crash investigations.
Boeing declined to comment. 
The hearing came a day after Wicker and Senator Maria Cantwell, the ranking Democrat on the committee, introduced bipartisan legislation that would strengthen FAA oversight of Boeing's designs.
The crashes and Boeing's long-delayed efforts to win regulatory approval to return the 737 MAX to commercial service plunged the Chicago-based company into its worst-ever crisis, since compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Aircraft Safety and Certification Reform Act of 2020, introduced on Tuesday, would give the FAA new authority to hire or remove Boeing employees conducting FAA certification tasks, and grant new whistleblower protections to employees. 
Dickson told Cantwell he did not think it would improve safety if the FAA appointed the certification employees, but agreed to look at the Senate proposal.
He also told lawmakers there were many items in the legislation ""that are exactly on point,"" including a provision that would authorize $150 million over 10 years for new FAA training and to hire specialized personnel.
Michael Stumo, whose daughter died in the Ethiopia crash, which came five months after the crash in Indonesia, applauded such reforms but told lawmakers the bill did not go far enough. Stumo demanded that manufacturers be subjected to a tougher certification process when they introduce an aircraft derived from models certified years before. The 737 MAX, for example, was derived from a plane first developed in the 1960s.

""The first crash should not have happened,"" Stumo said. ""The second crash is inexcusable.""

Investing.com – Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com (HK:9618) was the latest HKSE entrant to receive a warm welcome to the HKSE.
JD shares jumped 5.8% on their first day of trading, opening at HK$239 ($30.8375) each. The shares, priced at HK$226 each earlier in the week, raised $3.9 billion for the company in the Hong Kong share sale.
The debut concludes a successful outing for JD.com, the latest major Chinese firm to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong after the U.S. tightened scrutiny on foreign firms listed in the U.S. which could lead to some de-listings. JD listed on the Nasdaq board in 2014.
Other Chinese companies who have also completed secondary listings in Hong Kong include JD rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in 2019, and internet giant NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) the week before. NetEase saw its shares soar up to 10% in its debut.
The company said in a statement that it will use the funds to “invest in key supply chain based technology initiatives to further enhance customer experience while improving operating efficiency...the supply chain-based technologies can be applied to the Company’s key business operations including retail, logistics, and customer engagement.”"

September contracts on the S&P 500 fell 1.2% as of 11:27 a.m. in Tokyo, while futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1% and 1.4%, respectively. Beijing announced 21 new cases Thursday, presenting the biggest challenge yet in China’s efforts to prevent a second wave of infections. U.S. states including Texas, Florida and Arizona reported a jump in infections. The won weakened for a second day against the dollar as South Korea warned the North against further provocations.
“With Covid-19 filling the airwaves and geopolitical angst dotting the Korean landscape, the market is taking a decidedly defensive posture,” Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp Ltd., wrote in a note.
The underlying S&P 500 Index swung between gains and losses for most of Wednesday before turning red late, with the energy, real estate and financial sectors leading the declines.

1440,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 11:04PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Down With Mounting Concern Over Increasing COVID-19 Cases,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Thursday morning, with the recent global rally continuing to slow down amid mounting fears over the uptick in COVID-19 cases in China and the U.S.
China reported 21 new cases in Beijing on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases stemming from the weekend outbreak at the city’s Xinfadi market to over 150. Authorities have escalated measures to curb the spread of the virus, which include closing schools, upping the emergency status to level two, and cancelling flights out of Beijing.
Elsewhere, hospitalizations in Texas jumped to 11% on Wednesday, and Brazil reported a record 34,918 new cases.
""It is a big shock to markets that China, which appears to have successfully quashed the disease, is seeing a second wave. And in the U.S. we see record cases in many states...all this suggests that the more you re-start the economy, the more infections you have. People have thought the economy will quickly recover in July-September after dismal April-June. But that is now becoming uncertain,"" Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities, told Reuters.
The global number of cases is fast approaching 8.5 million, alongside almost 450,000 deaths as of June 18, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Down Under, the ASX 200 slid 1.32% by 10:57 PM ET (2:57 AM GMT) after the Bureau of Statistics released data earlier in the day showing a rise in unemployment to 7.1%, almost a percentage point higher than the 6.4% predicted in April. The rate is Australia’s highest since October 2001.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.36% while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.28%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.17% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.58%.
Investor enthusiasm for a quick recovery as central banks around the world launched unprecedented stimulus projects, and as encouraging data emerged after lockdowns were loosened, is fast waning.
“The narrative around policy stimulus and better economic data seems to be losing its sway,” Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, told Bloomberg.
But some investors were optimistic that the Beijing outbreak could be brought under control quicker that the initial outbreak in Wuhan earlier in the year.
Tapas Strickland, director of economics at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), said in a note that Chinese authorities are “taking aggressive action”, with the measures taken toward containing the virus’ spread in Beijing “more targeted” compared to lockdown measures that were imposed in Wuhan."

The Chinese online retailer, which already has stock listed in the U.S., opened at HK$239 after raising $3.9 billion in its Hong Kong share sale. That’s after its shares changed hands in gray markets at a roughly 5% premium to its HK$226 listing price in the days prior.
JD debuts as tensions between Washington and Beijing threaten to curtail Chinese companies’ access to U.S. capital markets, particularly after once high-flying  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) Inc. crashed amid an accounting scandal. It’s a victory for Hong Kong, coming on the heels of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s $13 billion share sale and the passing of a national security law that critics fear could jeopardize its status as a financial hub. Fellow internet giant NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. gained 6% in its own Hong Kong coming-out party last week.
“We hope investors from China and Asia can better understand JD’s concept, service and future development,” JD Retail Chief Executive Officer Xu Lei told Bloomberg Television. “Hong Kong is one of the freest economies in the world. We hope to have many mature institutional and individual investors share JD’s growth.”

JD and its rivals will now put China’s nascent consumer spending recovery to the test when they wrap up the country’s biggest online shopping gala of the post-pandemic era. China’s largest retailers are hoping the “6.18” or June 18 extravaganza that began this month unleashed pent-up demand, making up for lost sales during a coronavirus-stricken March quarter.
Global brands and smaller merchants alike stocked up on goods for months in anticipation of the summer event, a bargains buffet surpassed only by the Nov. 11 Singles’ Day in scale. JD and Alibaba are expected to release final results of their haul after midnight.
Longer term, the company will use the proceeds of the stock sale to continue building its logistics and delivery network, a key advantage during the pandemic because JD could better control shipping.
“The process to build up a supply chain is very time consuming and cost consuming, but we want to make it better,” Xu said. “When we have better supply chain, it would bring in a better user experience.”

1442,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Australian Unemployment Jumps to 7.1% in May, Currency Declines","(Bloomberg) -- Australian unemployment surged in May and another swathe of jobs were lost as ongoing restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus kept large parts of the economy shuttered.
The jobless rate advanced to 7.1% from a revised 6.4% in April vs economists’ median estimate of 6.9%, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday. Employment plunged by 227,700 in May after falling an upwardly revised 607,400 in April. The participation rate fell to 62.9%. Economists had penciled in 63.6%.
The Australian dollar slumped on the data and was trading at 68.42 U.S. cents at 11:41 a.m. in Sydney.
The result comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia highlights the potential for the economic downturn to be “shallower than earlier expected” as lockdown restrictions are relaxed and a staged reopening of the economy unfolds. The key question looming is how many workers will be kept employed when the government subsidy keeping workers tied to firms expires in September.
The central bank said this month that while job losses and fewer hours for those still in work had reduced income, government support had provided a considerable offset.
“Households that were already receiving welfare payments had received additional payments, and the JobKeeper program and increased JobSeeker payments had supported incomes for others,” the RBA said in minutes of its June policy meeting released Tuesday.
Yet there is a lot of slack in the labor force to absorb in the months ahead. Qantas Airways Ltd. in March furloughed most of its 30,000-strong workforce and rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. stood down 80% of its workforce. Star Entertainment Group Ltd. furloughed 90% of its 9,000 employees.
The initial closure of swathes of the economy had a dramatic impact on consumer and business confidence, with both plummeting. Sentiment among firms has regained some ground in the subsequent months, while that of households is almost back to pre-Covid levels.
Part of the improved outlook is the authorities’ success in flattening the curve of new infections that’s allowing it to relax lockdown restrictions early. The government is aiming to reopen the much of economy by next month, while international borders will remain closed.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",S&P closes lower as new COVID-19 cases surge,"By Stephen Culp (NYSE:CULP)
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday as news of spiking pandemic data and the prospect of a new round of economic lockdowns dampened investor optimism over signs of economic recovery.
The S&P 500 and the Dow reversed earlier gains to snap a three-day winning streak. Tech shares led the Nasdaq to a modest gain.
Worries over a resurgence in the pandemic's spread persisted, as new coronavirus cases hit a record in Oklahoma just days before President Donald Trump's expected campaign rally in Tulsa.
The numbers of new cases are rising sharply in about six U.S. states, according to a Reuters analysis, and authorities in Beijing have ramped up mobility restrictions in their efforts to contain a new COVID-19 outbreak. 
""There are periodic points of news flow where the positive news will carry the market and negative news will pressure the market,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""It's a return of health concerns versus economic optimism."" 
""There's a tug of war with headlines,"" Sroka added. 
Indeed, the indexes were up earlier in the session on news than an inexpensive, common steroid called dexamethasone can help save critically ill COVID-19 patients, according to a clinical trial in Britain, a development that prompted the World Health Organization to update its treatment guidelines.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell wrapped up two days of congressional testimony, during which he pledged the central bank will use its ""full range of tools"" to help that recovery along. But Powell added, ""It would be a concern if Congress were to pull back on the support that it's providing, too quickly.""
On the economic front, while housing starts increased at a slower-than-expected pace in May, building permits saw a more robust rebound and applications for loans to purchase homes surged last week to a near 11-1/2-year high last week, according to separate reports from the U.S. Commerce Department and the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 170.37 points, or 0.65%, to 26,119.61, the S&P 500 lost 11.25 points, or 0.36%, to 3,113.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.67 points, or 0.15%, to 9,910.53.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight ended the session in the red, with energy and financials suffering the largest percentage losses.
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) dropped 5.6% after reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly revenues as lockdowns led its clients to delay purchases.
Cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd extended the suspension of its voyages through September, sending its stock down 8.4%. 
Peers Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd dropped 6.5% and 7.2%, respectively.
Bankrupt car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) announced it would suspend its plan to sell $500 million in new shares after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission raised objections to the sale.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and six new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.40 billion shares, compared with the 12.93 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The sale of 31 million shares at A$5.98 each, a 4% discount to Pendal's last closing share price, completes Westpac's exit after the bank sold the first portion of its then 29% stake in 2017. (https://reut.rs/2UOogIv)
""The success of the offer has delivered a good result for Westpac and is aligned with our strategy of simplifying our operations and focusing on banking in Australia and New Zealand,"" acting Chief Financial Officer Gary Thursby said.
Westpac said the deal settlement on June 22 will add about 2 basis points to its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and provide a post-tax accounting gain of A$32 million in the second half of the year.
Westpac will also likely withdraw A$1.08 billion worth of funds from Pendal in two tranches by the end of 2021, it said on Wednesday when announcing the planned shares sale.
Pendal, previously known as  BT Investment Management , last month reported a 14% decline in funds under management in the first half, led by A$2 billion worth of outflows from the Westpac book.
Swiss investment bank UBS is underwriter and bookrunner for the share sale.

""We will still have some flights scheduled across the Tasman in the coming months with the expected travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand,"" the airline said in a statement, referring to the Tasman Sea between the countries.
""Should travel between Australia and other countries open up and demand return, we can add more flights back into our schedule,"" it added.
Australia is unlikely to reopen its border to international travellers until next year but will look to relax entry rules for students and other long-term visitors, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Wednesday.
It is in talks with New Zealand about forming a quarantine-free ""travel bubble"" given the low number of cases in both countries. 
New Zealand has indicated September could be a realistic date for the resumption of regular flights between the nations.

Qantas this month announced plans to triple domestic capacity to 15% of normal levels by the end of the month as state border restrictions ease.

Lopez Obrador said he had information that showed Iberdrola was organizing opposition to his government, which has given the state more influence over the electricity industry. He did not provide any evidence to back up his allegations.
""I have information that they're the ones who are pursuing this campaign, it's just hidden,"" Lopez Obrador told a morning news conference, referring to Iberdrola.
A representative for Iberdrola in Mexico said the company had no comment on the matter.
Critics have blasted government efforts to prevent dozens of mostly wind and solar power plants run by private firms including Iberdrola from connecting to the grid owned by state-run electricity company, Comision Federal de Electricidad, or CFE.
They say CFE is unfairly targeting renewable energy projects to preserve its fossil-fuel power generation, including plants that burn highly polluting fuel oil.
""This has to do with Spanish companies that see Mexico as a land to be conquered,"" Lopez Obrador, alleging that power contracts were won due to ""influence peddling."" He did not give details of the alleged wrongdoing.
In recent months, Mexico's government has sought to stop the renewable projects from connecting to the grid, accusing them of not paying enough toward baseload power or transmission costs.
Lopez Obrador widened his criticism on Wednesday to other unnamed Spanish power firms, which for years have had a significant presence in Mexican private power generation.

The president added that he was open to dialogue with the private firms, noting that reaching an agreement would be the best outcome.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer representing a former  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) diversity officer who is suing the bank over racial discrimination said on Wednesday the bank cut her client's budget for promoting diversity and financial education by 71% from the time she started in wealth management to 2019. 
Marilyn Booker, who filed a lawsuit against the bank on Tuesday after she was let go in December, said on CNBC that she believes the bank did improve diversity during the 17 years she worked in diversity, human resources policy and recruiting. In 2011, the firm asked Booker to lead the urban markets group, a job she held until the bank eliminated her position on Dec. 9. 
Booker said she filed the lawsuit because she believes she was terminated for repeatedly pushing senior management to hear a proposal on increasing diversity and addressing bias against black financial advisers at the firm. https://reut.rs/2CeQHZZ
""It's not that I wanted to sue. I was fired,"" Booker said, adding that she thinks her experience is common across Wall Street. ""I think it's important that I talk ... because my story is not unique to me."" 
Morgan Stanley did not provide a comment on the 71 percent figure, but it has refuted Booker's allegations and said that she was let go along with 1,500 other employees last December.
""We strongly reject the allegations made in this claim and intend to vigorously defend ourselves,"" Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney said. ""We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the diversity of our employees and have made steady progress – while recognizing that we have further progress to make. We will continue to advance our high priority efforts to achieve a more diverse and inclusive firm.""
Booker and her lawyer Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP said the bank's extremely low numbers of black employees at the firm show the bank has not made diversity a priority. Just 2.2% of Morgan Stanley's senior executives were black last year, up from 1.9% in 2016
""This is not rocket science. It's pretty simple. You hire black people ... and then you pay them,"" Booker said. ""It's just not that difficult.""

The department said Copa (N:CPA) violated a May 2019 order that barred U.S. and foreign air carriers from transporting passengers between the United States and Venezuela. 
It said Copa sold more than 5,000 tickets for air travel between the United States and Venezuela and transported more than 15,000 passengers after the order took effect.
Copa told officials it understands the seriousness of the matter and took considerable steps to avoid future violations, the transportation department said. Copa later reiterated that in a statement.

In it, the airline said its position was that any breach of restrictions ""that may have occurred would not have been willful"" and that it relied in part on contacts with Panamanian and other U.S. officials to understand those curbs.

The airline last month warned of an annual loss after it reported a slew of impairment charges it would take on its planes and a 30% cut in its workforce.
The COVID-19 outbreak has wiped out almost all commercial traffic, forcing carriers around the world to layoff employees and call for government aid to survive.
Air New Zealand said last week it was aiming to return to ""healthy profits"" by 2022 under a plan that includes flying fewer passengers and routes and possibly cutting more jobs.

(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) said on Wednesday it will change the name and brand image of its Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup, dropping a mascot that has been criticized for a racist history, amid a national debate over racial inequality in the United States.
The logo of the more than 130-year-old brand features an African-American woman named after a character from 19th-century minstrel shows. The offensive caricature is rooted in a stereotype of a friendly black woman working as a servant or nanny for a white family.
Following PepsiCo's move, ConAgra Brands Inc (N:CAG) announced a full review of its Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, whose package is meant to evoke a ""loving grandmother."" Rice brand Uncle Ben's said it was also considering updating its brand, which features a white-haired African-American man named after a Texas rice farmer.
The moves are part of Corporate America's reckoning with the treatment of African Americans amid weeks of protests over racism and police brutality after the death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.
Aunt Jemima had been called out in recent days on social media. A TikTok video called ""How To Make A Non Racist Breakfast"" by user @singkirbysing, in which a woman pours the pancake mix down the sink, got over 109,000 views on Instagram since Tuesday when it was posted. 
""We recognize Aunt Jemima's origins are based on a racial stereotype,"" Kristin Kroepfl, vice president and chief marketing officer of PepsiCo-owned Quaker Foods North America, said in a statement. 
Quaker did not announce a brand name or logo, but said packages without the Aunt Jemima image would appear in the fourth quarter of this year.
ConAgra said its packaging could be interpreted ""in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values"" and that it has ""begun a complete brand and packaging review on Mrs. Butterworth's"".
Mars said it had ""a responsibility to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices"" and that ""one way we can do this is by evolving the Uncle Ben’s brand, including its visual brand identity."" 
""We don’t yet know what the exact changes or timing will be, but we are evaluating all possibilities,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.
Some observers lauded the moves, but said they were slow to come.
""Brands built on racist imagery have been living on borrowed time,"" said James O’Rourke, management professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. ""This move by Quaker Oats, while welcome, is decades late in coming."" 

PepsiCo on Tuesday announced a set of initiatives worth more than $400 million over five years to support black communities and boost black representation at PepsiCo.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Wednesday announced a new hiring goal and security policy to address racial issues at its offices, as protests over police brutality against African Americans have carried into discussions about corporate culture.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said that by 2025, the company aims to have 30% more of its leaders be from underrepresented groups. About 96% of Google's U.S. leaders are white or Asian, and 73% globally are men.
Pichai said all leadership openings now will be shared externally. Silicon Valley companies have often hired for top positions using secretive recruiting firms or internal promotions, making it difficult for people not connected to an employee to know of opportunities.
In addition, Pichai said Google would strive to be more inclusive, with steps such as eliminating an office security procedure that may have led to racial profiling.
Google and other tech companies have long instructed employees to ask for identification from ""tailgaters,"" or people who sneak through secure doors behind employees who just unlocked them. 
But black employees had raised concerns about being unfairly checked, and Pichai acknowledged the system was ""susceptible to bias.""
""We will end the practice of Googlers badge-checking each other and rely on our already robust security infrastructure,"" he said.
Pichai also announced $150 million in funding for black business owners and an internal task force to work on projects that ""help black users in the moments that matter most."" 
For years, civil rights groups have pressured Silicon Valley companies such as Google to recruit more racial minorities, contending greater diversity would lead to products that do not perpetuate racial and gender stereotypes.

Google is still pursuing a goal announced in 2018 to increase overall U.S. workforce diversity by this year to match what it describes as ""market supply.""

1454,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 04:22PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for June 18,"By Liz Moyer
investing.com -- U.S. markets eased back on Wednesday ending a three-day winning streak as the rally in technology stocks lost steam and airline, cruise ship and retail stocks fell.
Investors are weighing the good signs of an economic rebound against data that show rising numbers of new Covid-19 infections across the country in what could be a much-feared setback to recovery.
The energy sector also took a hit on fresh concerns about demand for oil, which would signal that businesses are coming back on line. Instead, inventories rose, according to the latest data.
On Thursday, another round of jobs data is expected, along with a reading on manufacturing activity and earnings from grocery chain Kroger.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Seen Falling Again But Unemployment Still High
Initial jobless claims are expected to be 1.3 million for the week ending June 13, down from 1.5 million reported the prior week, continuing a downward trend as the Covid-19 lockdowns continue to ease. The report is due out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
But millions of Americans are still out of work. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.9 million, compared to 20.9 million the prior week.
2. Philly Fed Manufacturing Index a Glimpse of Economic Activity
The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for June is expected to come in at a negative 23, which would be an improvement from the negative 43 recorded for May. The index is only a reading of activity in the Philadelphia region, but it is likely significant for those who are looking for any signs of economic improvement after weeks of Covid-19 shutdowns. A level above zero indicates improving conditions, while a reading below zero indicates worsening conditions. The negative 56 recorded in April was the lowest level in 40 years.
3. Grocery Chain Earnings and Outlook Expected to Boost Stock
Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) reports first quarter earnings on Thursday, and analysts expect a big number because of Covid-19 food buying. Earnings per share are expected to be $1.07 on revenue of $40 billion, according to estimates by analysts tracked by Investing.com.
Analysts are also expecting Kroger to raise its guidance for the second quarter, which is already looking for EPS in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, according to Briefing.com."

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a three-day winning streak Wednesday as investor optimism over the path of an economic recovery was kept in check by a rise in Covid-19 infections across parts of the U.S.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.65%, or 170 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.15%.
A rise in infections in some states, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas, stoked fears that lawmakers may move to roll back the relaxation of some restrictions, leading some to rein in some of the bullish bets on stocks tied to progress of the economic reopening.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL),  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) were among the worst hit.
Energy, which has ridden the wave of reopening optimism in recent weeks, led the broader market lower as concerns about crude demand were exacerbated by a surprise build in weekly crude supplies.
Weekly U.S. crude supplies climbed 1.2 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a draw of 152,000 barrels.
In tech, meanwhile, social media companies came under fire on reports that the Department of Justice was looking into reforms that aim to weaken a legal protection that shields them from liability over content posted on their platforms.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) turned negative after paring gains, but Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was up more than 3%.
On the monetary policy front, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, said that the Fed will move away from buying exchange traded funds (ETFs) invested in bonds and instead purchase mostly individual corporate bonds.
""Over time we’ll gradually move away from ETFs and move to buying bonds,' Powell said, according to CNBC. ""It’s a better tool for supporting liquidity and market functioning.""
Powell also stressed that Fed's corporate bond-buying will be at the ""bottom end"" of the possible range because markets are functioning well."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.65%, or 172 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat.

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Wednesday said every vehicle on its ride-hailing and rental car platform will be electric by 2030, but it would not provide direct financial support to drivers for switching from gas-powered cars.
Instead, the company plans to push competitors, lawmakers and automakers to make it easier for drivers to switch to electric vehicles by creating financial incentives, Lyft executives said during a call.
John Zimmer, Lyft's co-founder and president, said the company has reached a scale to impact policy change.
Lyft, whose vehicle fleet is currently made up of less than 1% electric cars, in a statement said it would aggressively promote and help drivers access incentive funds.
""If policymakers do their part in the next few years, EVs should reach cost parity with gasoline vehicles by mid-decade,"" the company said.
Environmental activists have called on Lyft and larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) to electrify their fleets. A February study found ride-hail services create around 50% more carbon emissions than private car trips.
Uber has not made a blanket commitment to electrification, but is partially subsidizing drivers' electric vehicle purchases in London.
Electric vehicles are currently more expensive than gasoline ones, but the comparable cost of operating and maintaining them over time is lower.
Lyft said the price for ride-hail trips in battery-powered cars might even decline in the future.
In the past, Lyft has said that 80% of its drivers have full or part-time jobs and offer rides to supplement their income.
Many ride-hail drivers also use leasing companies to rent a vehicle and are concerned about the wear and tear to their cars.
Lyft offers rental services for drivers and consumers through its own platform and said it would buy electric vehicles for that fleet, but declined to say how many.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","Several U.S. banks to close branches, offices early for Juneteenth","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. banks are closing branches and offices early on Friday to observe the Juneteenth holiday, which commemorates the day in 1865 when the last group of enslaved African Americans learned slavery was abolished.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and U.S. Bank will both close branches at 1 p.m. local time on June 19.  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), Fifth Third Bancorp (O:FITB) and PNC Financial Services Group (N:PNC) will close branches at 2 p.m. local time.
The banks will remain open part of the day because the holiday falls on a Friday, when many people get paid and need in-person banking services. 
Juneteenth is an annual U.S. holiday that is receiving greater attention this year following nationwide protests over police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans. 
The date marks the 155th anniversary of the de facto end of slavery, roughly two years after the end of the U.S. Civil War, and is celebrated as African Americans' Independence Day. https://reut.rs/3eagbWi
Many companies and organizations, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the National Football League, are closing offices or asking employees not to hold unnecessary meetings as a way to commemorate June 19th and the country's history of racism. https://reut.rs/3fhTgsd
JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, will also allow staff at offices to take the afternoon off, in addition to closing its roughly 5,000 branches. U.S. Bank, which has 2,700 branches in 26 states, is allowing employees to do the same.

 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said on Tuesday its staff can use paid time off to observe Juneteenth.

An Adidas spokeswoman said it strongly rebuffed statements made in a letter by 83 employees, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, asking the supervisory board to investigate Karen Parkin's approach to racial issues in the workplace.
The spokeswoman said Parkin had apologised for the comments in a statement issued to staff and was working with a coalition on the company's global diversity and inclusion commitments.
""Our black employees have led the response that we will continue to implement together and that we have committed to as a company,"" the spokeswoman said.
In Parkin's statement, the HR boss admitted she had not made clear the company's stance against discrimination at a meeting at the Reebok brand in Boston last year when she made a comment about concern about racism being ""noise"".
""I should have chosen a better word...Should I have offended anyone, I apologise,"" she said.
Parkin, who holds joint British and U.S. citizenship, was appointed to the Adidas executive board in 2017, the first woman to join the company's top leadership since 1993.
The employee letter cited by the Journal also asked Adidas to create a public platform where people can make anonymous complaints about racism.
Adidas said it had long had a hotline where employees could submit such reports. It said last week it would engage a third-party investigator to oversee a zero-tolerance policy on racism and set up a council to ensure action on the issue.
After close consultation with black employees, Adidas last week pledged to invest $20 million in the black community in the United States and make sure that at least 30% of all new U.S. jobs are filled with black and Latino people.

Companies around the world have pledged to fund racial and social justice causes amid worldwide protests over the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Bank of England tells insurers to check capital to cope with COVID,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's insurers should use findings from an emergency stress test in April to check if they can meet business interruption claims from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of England said on Wednesday.
""Our analysis showed that the sector was robust to downside stresses, with the highest uncertainty centred on certain general insurers’ liabilities – particularly those arising from business interruption claims,"" the letter from the BoE to insurance chiefs said.
The BoE was publishing findings from its annual stress test of insurers for 2019 that was supplemented by further testing in April after markets fell sharply in response to lockdowns.
It said the 20 largest insurers, 15 large syndicates and Lloyd's of London insurance market that were tested should closely monitor risks presented by COVID-19 and update their capital assessments.
""We expect boards to assess whether the findings apply to their firm and present an action plan to their supervisors to address them,"" the letter said.
Life insurers would be able to manage the severe stresses tested for, but general insurers face uncertainty over their ability to pay claims from companies that shut during the lockdown.
Companies are challenging insurers that refuse to pay such claims.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority is going to court in July to seek legal clarity on whether the wording in a sample of policies mean that compensation claims are valid.
""We support this initiative and will work with the FCA and firms to understand the potential financial impact of the court case,"" the BoE said.
Last year's test also included an ""exploratory"" scenario on insurers' ability to measure the impact of climate change on their business. It found ""significant gaps"" that must be addressed before more detailed findings can be shared.
The next regular annual stress test has been delayed to 2022 to give firms more time to focus on dealing with COVID-19.

Having shut its London ""underwriting room"" in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic -- the first closure of physical trading in the commercial insurance market's 330-year history -- Lloyd's confirmed on Wednesday its doors would re-open on a new-look environment.
Staff capacity will shrink to 45% to ensure social distancing, there will be regular deep cleans, queueing and one-way systems -- all designed to limit the potential spread of the deadly virus, Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal said.
Lloyd's, which started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688 and has remained a face-to-face market ever since, is now turbo-charging a planned switch to electronic trading. 
It plans to establish a ""virtual room"" and is testing a number of digital platforms to allow brokers and underwriters to connect, Neal said. 
There will be a help desk, or ""connectivity bar"" on the ground floor, digital booths with souped-up WiFi and digital screens in the cafe and other areas for confidential meetings and network connectivity has also been enhanced. 
Lloyd's' 90-plus syndicate members, separately-run firms under the market's umbrella, underwrite many of the world's largest commercial insurance deals, from oil rigs to pop concerts.
Brokers and insurers have long met in the underwriting room of Lloyd's City of London tower to agree deals, which are sealed with company stamps and ink signatures. 
But since its closure, industry players have been surprised at how smoothly the technology has worked. Videocalls are replacing hours on planes going to meetings to places such as North America, Lloyd's' biggest market.

Figures from PPL (NYSE:PPL), an existing electronic trading platform which will form the basis for one of two electronic exchanges Lloyd's plans to launch next year, showed the number of deals completed nearly doubled in the week ending June 8 compared with four months earlier, to 3,040.

The move comes after Mexican broadcaster Televisa this month launched its own mobile phone service in a bid to challenge billionaire Carlos Slim's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), which has long dominated the country's telecommunications market.
Walmex is paying Mexican telecommunications firm Rocketel to host the service, according to Rocketel's website. The service uses space on Mexico's wholesale telecom network, operated by Altan Redes, Rocketel said.

""It just speaks to evidence that a global recovery seems to be at play, given that European equities seemed to have underperformed U.S. equities recently,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. 
""What everyone is hoping for is that you get a return to growth which is driven by more confident consumer behaviour but if you have another (virus) outbreak, even if there is no lockdown, it starts to weigh on people's minds.""
Focus will now turn to the European Council, which will meet at the end of the week to discuss a recovery proposal by the bloc's executive to raise 750 billion euros worth of debt to top up spending from joint coffers to be worth 1.1 trillion euros in 2021-27. 
Meanwhile, Beijing cancelled scores of domestic flights as it attempted to contain the fresh coronavirus outbreak.
""A lockdown of Beijing would be a Wuhan on steroids, being a government and commercial centre,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
British renewable power generator and network operator SSE Plc (L:SSE) jumped 9.1% to the top of STOXX 600 after it confirmed its full-year dividend and posted a better-than-expected annual pre-tax profit.
 Boohoo  (L:BOOH) gained 6.6% after the online fashion group forecast annual results ahead of market expectations on increasing demand during lockdowns.
Dutch postal and parcel services provider  PostNL  (AS:PTNL) jumped 18% with its full-year normalised operating profit seen ""strongly"" above previous guidance.

Healthcare stocks (SXDP) remained in focus after trial results on Tuesday showed that a cheap and widely used steroid called dexamethasone became the first drug shown to be able to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 12:49PM ET</span>","United Airlines sweetens exit deal for flight attendants, others","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) sweetened on Tuesday a voluntary exit package for frontline employees like flight attendants and gate agents, saying it needed ""a lot more people to sign up"" to avoid involuntary layoffs in October, according to a staff email seen by Reuters.
The email, sent 48 hours before a June 18 deadline, said that although ""thousands"" have signed up for the voluntary exit package so far, the number is not enough. United extended the deadline to July 8.
U.S. airlines cannot force any furloughs or layoffs before Oct. 1 under the terms of a government stimulus package that awarded money for employee payroll through September.
But many, including United, are trying to induce staff to depart sooner, warning that airlines must shrink in the fall.
""While we're seeing some glimmers of hope in the number of customers traveling, we know that we are still a very long way from returning to where demand was at the end of 2019,"" United said in the email, adding that a quick recovery was unlikely.
Under the new deal, frontline employees would receive a $1,500 health credit - to pay for health care, including prescriptions - for every year worked, up to $45,000. The credits would be in addition to other medical, retirement and travel benefits already offered.
United declined to comment.
The company has offered a number of exit packages to union employees based on factors like seniority, age and workgroup, as well as to management and administrative staff, which it is aiming to reduce by 30%.
Last month, United told employees that it only needed about 3,000 of its about 25,000 flight attendants in June given its reduced flying schedule, Reuters reported.

Like other airlines, United is only operating a fraction of the flights it did last year.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Cargill's chief executive in Brazil, Paulo Sousa, said on Wednesday that insults by Brazilian government officials aimed at the country's main trading partner, China, are detrimental to the South American nation's business interests.
Aggressive stances taken sometimes on China by members of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's government is ""a great cause for concern,"" Sousa said in an interview with a local newspaper posted on social media.
Cargill was Brazil's largest shipper of soybeans and corn in the five months through May, according to data from maritime agencies. The U.S.-headquartered grain trader exported 8.1 million tonnes of the oilseeds out of Brazil, and almost 342,000 tonnes of corn through May, maritime agency data show.
""We have the role of providing food to the world regardless of color, race, creed or political preference of a country,"" Sousa said. ""So it's not fitting for Brazilian government officials to insult our biggest client. I'd say it's not even very smart.""
The Brazilian government did not have an immediate comment. 
Sousa, who took over as president of Cargill's Brazil operation last December, said he does not see any immediate risk of an interruption in Brazil's trade with China.
Brazilian soybean exports, of which China is the biggest buyer, were above expectations in the first months of the year, the executive said. 
Even thought it has hit Brazil very hard, the COVID-19 pandemic has not disrupted the country's ability to export agricultural commodities like grains and meat, he said. 
""It is good to stop talking. It is good to stop being aggressive,"" Sousa said.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Who's in charge at Nissan? COO's allies push to give him shared CEO role – sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY)'s chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta helped engineer the troubled automaker's latest turnaround plan. Now his allies are pressing the board to promote him to co-CEO to drive the new strategy, said four people with direct knowledge.
Thus far, Nissan Motor Co's 12-member board has no plan to change the roles of Chief Executive Makoto Uchida or his No. 2 Gupta, the sources told Reuters. But the behind-the-scenes campaign, involving at least half a dozen current and former executives, points to continued tensions at the top of the Japanese automaker, which has had four CEOs in four years.
The sources, all of whom have ties to Nissan's leadership team, declined to be identified because they aren't authorised to speak to reporters and because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Nissan responded in a statement to Reuters there are ""no plans or consideration for any change in the management structure at Nissan, and no change to the close collaborative working relationship between Mr. Uchida and Mr. Gupta in their current roles."" Speculation to the contrary is baseless and misleading, the statement went on.
Lobbying to promote Gupta, 49, has intensified, the sources said, since Nissan unveiled a four-year recovery plan on May 28 to slash costs and strengthen its global alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi. Indian-born Gupta, an industry veteran, was instrumental in drawing up the plan. His allies now want him to implement it.
According to the people with knowledge of the matter, Gupta's supporters are proposing that he either share the CEO role with Uchida, or replace his boss, with Uchida becoming chairman. One of the sources, a Nissan executive, told Reuters: ""We're clear enough in telling the board what our expectations are. But we don't want to push the issue too hard. We want this to happen in a natural way.""
The uncertainty threatens to increase instability at Nissan that stretches back to late 2018, when long-time leader Carlos Ghosn was arrested and fired because of alleged financial misconduct, which he denies. Ghosn was Nissan's CEO through April 2017, when he stepped aside, remaining as chairman. Since Ghosn, Nissan has had three CEOs. The discussion about Gupta's role is also a distraction as Nissan wrestles with an array of problems, from its own financial woes to the industry-wide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that is hurting sales.
The sources said Gupta's allies have become emboldened in recent weeks because of growing doubts among rank-and-file employees about Uchida's ability to lead Nissan back from its first annual loss in 11 years.
Two of the sources cited Uchida's performance during a news conference on May 28 at which he presented the plan to cut Nissan's production capacity and model range, and put new emphasis on sharing costs and investment with Nissan partners Renault and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF). Uchida emphasized that ""the main focus of the plan is not restructuring."" Its purpose, he said, is ""to build a financial foundation that will lead to sustained future growth. For that future growth, we plan to continue to invest in (product and technology) development.""
The sources said Uchida's comments displayed a lack of urgency at a critical moment.
""The Nissan plan is a restructuring plan, no matter how you slice it,"" said Tokyo-based SBI Securities analyst Koji Endo. ""But Uchida fell short of clearly defining this as a restructuring plan. I think it would've served him better if Uchida had said honestly what this is, in order to instill the urgency of the plan and to stress people need to scramble.""
LEADERSHIP Gupta is already taking on much of the leadership of Nissan, said the four people with direct knowledge. Uchida, they said, is less engaged. Another source, a mid-ranking global product distribution strategy manager, said Gupta has hosted all recent meetings attended by this manager and his colleagues at head office in Yokohama to discuss recovery in key markets like China and the United States.
""He's doing all the heavy lifting in formulating the plan, and we are not getting any guidance from Uchida,"" the manager said.
Nissan said in its statement to Reuters that the management is ""focused and united on the delivery of the transformation program, led by chief executive officer Makoto Uchida. Ashwani Gupta, as chief operating officer, is working intensively in partnership with Mr. Uchida on executing the program.""
Nissan's recovery plan draws on ideas previously employed by Gupta to reinvigorate the commercial vehicle businesses of Renault and Nissan. After joining Renault in India in 2006, Gupta became vice president in charge of Renault's global commercial vehicle business, a job he held until April 2019, when he was named COO of Mitsubishi.
In drawing up Nissan's latest turnaround strategy, Gupta worked closely with Renault's chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard. As a consequence, Gupta and Senard, who sits on the Nissan board, have developed a close relationship, the sources said.
According to two of the sources, this might persuade Senard to support making Gupta co-CEO. If Gupta were to be promoted, the sources said, it would be positive for the Nissan-Renault alliance because Uchida and Senard have yet to develop a solid relationship.

A spokesperson for Renault said the company wouldn't comment on speculation, adding that the relationship between the current leaders of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is ""excellent."" Mitsubishi declined to comment for this article.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has drafted a support plan for Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) where the government and state bank VTB (MM:VTBR) would buy into a new share issue by the country's biggest airline, which has been hit by the coronavirus crisis, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters. 
The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) may take part in that share issue along with the state and VTB, one of the sources said, adding that under the plan, Aeroflot would be issuing new shares worth 80 billion roubles ($1.15 billion).
Russia is following the example of Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), where the German government will take a 20% stake as a part of a 9-billion-euro bailout, the source added.
The state plans to buy shares worth 50 billion roubles, with VTB and RDIF buying shares worth 15 billion roubles each, he added. The second source said that the new share issue was expected to be ""significant."" 
An RDIF spokesman told Reuters that the fund, along with some international partners, was considering investing in Aeroflot, without providing details. 
""We don't have such information,"" Aeroflot said in emailed reply to a Reuters request for comment. A government spokesman and VTB did not reply to requests for comment. 
Both sources said that VTB planned to sell its stake in Aeroflot later. They did not give a shareholding breakdown after the planned new share issue, or say when the bank may sell out of Aeroflot. 
Aeroflot, 51.2% state-owned, was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, as countries shut down borders, while Russians were in lockdown for two months from late March.
In March alone, the carrier’s passenger traffic slumped more than a third from a year ago and was down 12.3% for the quarter, based on Aeroflot data published in April.

Aeroflot Group, which includes Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as well as Rossiya, Aurora and low-cost airline Pobeda, has a Russian market share of almost 50% based on 2019 data.

MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) has made an agreed A$828 million ($569 million) bid for Australian wind and solar firm  Infigen Energy  (AX:IFN), topping an offer from Philippine conglomerate  Ayala Corp  (PS:AC).
Iberdrola's bid comes as it looks to invest a record 10 billion euros ($11 billion) this year through acquisitions and wind farm projects, including in France and the United States.
""The acquisition of Infigen is a unique opportunity for the Iberdrola group to consolidate its presence in the attractive Australian renewable energy market through a friendly transaction,"" Iberdrola said in a statement.
Iberdrola is already building a 320 megawatt renewable energy project in South Australia.
Infigen accepted Iberdrola's offer and urged shareholders to reject an earlier bid from UAC Energy, a joint venture of Ayala's AC Energy (PS:ACEPH) and Hong Kong-based UPC Renewables Group, as the Spanish bid was 7.5% higher with fewer conditions.
""The offer from Iberdrola follows an extended period of engagement with Infigen regarding potential cooperation or a control transaction,"" Infigen said.
Infigen said its top shareholder, British activist investor TCI Fund Management, has agreed to sell 20% of Infigen securities, most of its holding, to Iberdrola, if no higher bid emerges.
Iberdrola and UAC pounced on Infigen after its share price slumped due to falling power prices in Australia and challenges facing wind and solar firms hooking up projects to a shaky grid.
Iberdrola, advised by Nomura, will pay A$0.86 a share for Infigen, 46% more than Infigen's closing price on June 2, the day before UAC landed its unexpected bid.
""It's not a knockout blow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst James Bullen, who has an 89 cent target price on Infigen.
Infigen shares jumped 8.5% to a three-year high of 89 cents, suggesting investors expect a bidding war.
Analysts had expected counterbids for Infigen, as it is attractive for its seven wind farms and a large pipeline of projects which it recently put on hold to save money.
UAC is considering its position, a spokeswoman said.
Other companies looking to expand in renewables in Australia include France's  Total  Eren (PA:TOTF) and  Neoen  (PA:NEOEN).

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Bad loans hitting Eastern Europe's banks may last beyond 2021: report,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Central, Eastern and Southeastern European banks are set to be hit by a tide of bad loans that may last beyond 2021, a report from the Vienna Initiative grouping of lenders and policymakers said on Wednesday.
Banks were better prepared than during the prior financial crisis in 2008 to deal with the flow of non-performing loans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report found.
But it said that how lenders responded in the coming months to pre-empt and prevent a rise in the number of distressed borrowers would be defining.
Created in 2009 after the global financial crisis to prevent large withdrawals by Western banks from emerging Europe, the Vienna Initiative is a coordinated effort by banks, international financial institutions and policymakers credited with averting banking crises in the region after 2008.
A survey carried out by the European Union's lending arm, the European Investment Bank during March, showed nearly 65% of banks polled expected non-performing loans (NPLs) to increase in the coming months, and for 'visibly' fewer new loans to be approved.
The temporary nature of the social restriction measures means the effects of the current crisis might be more short-lived than during the 2008-09 meltdown, the Vienna Initiative's latest half-yearly report said.
But the initiative said three waves of bad loans could be anticipated, starting with an immediate spike in the fourth quarter as the measures to control the pandemic expire and the frailer borrowers begin defaulting.
A second, slower and more spread-out wave may follow in the first half of 2021, with the intensity of business failures and employment losses highly dependent on how much the economy or markets recovered.
Finally, a third wave may hit, resulting from the knock-on effects of failures in different parts of the economy and supply chains. That is likely to start emerging towards the end of 2021 and beyond, it said.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",FCA moves closer to state guarantee for $7.1 billion loan: source,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury has taken a further step towards approving a state guarantee for a 6.3 billion euro ($7.1 billion) loan for  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) Italian unit, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.
The request for state support on such a large loan sparked controversy in Italy as Fiat Chrysler (FCA) is legally headquartered in the Netherlands. It is also due to pay its shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend as part of a planned merger with French automaker PSA (PA:PEUP).
FCA has said it asked for state support to help its domestic unit weather the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Italy's state auditor has approved the guarantee, but it still needs to be signed off by Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri and given the green light by the country's accounting court, the source told Reuters, asking not to be named.
Both the Treasury and FCA declined to comment.
The loan has been already approved by Italy's largest commercial bank Intesa San Paolo (MI:ISP), which will fund it, and by export credit agency SACE, through which the guarantee will be provided.
The loan is part of more than 400 billion euros Rome hopes to make available this year to support Italian companies, hit by one of the world's deadliest coronavirus outbreaks.
Italian firms tapping state guarantees must refrain from paying dividends this year, while the Treasury reserves the right to ask for additional requirements.
Gualtieri said earlier this month that FCA would have to meet commitments on investments and jobs and would face sanctions if it failed to achieve them.
The source declined to say whether the Treasury will impose conditions affecting FCA's extraordinary dividend.

As things stand, the state-backed loan should not legally bar FCA from distributing the extraordinary dividend, as the payment is not due until 2021 and would be made by its parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in the Netherlands.

By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 51 points or 0.2%, at 26,385 points, while the S&P 500 was effectively flat. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed slightly, rising 0.5%.
The Dow and S&P both suffered from weakness in the travel sector, with cruise line stocks falling sharply after Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) extended the suspension of sailings by most of its brands through September. Norwegian stock fell 8.3% in early trade, dragging rivals Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) over 7% lower in the process.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock also underperformed after the software company posted weaker-than-expected results for the three months through May after the bell on Tuesday. Oracle was a rare underperformer in the tech space, which profited from moves out of cyclicals as their rally flagged. So-called ""stay-at-home"" stocks were back in fashion, with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rising 2.3%, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock rising 1.8% and games maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock rising 1.5%.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the U.S.'s top doctor Anthony Fauci warned that the pandemic is not over in the U.S., pointing to rising numbers of infections in major states such as Texas, Florida and California. Fauci's comments appeared to contradict more or less directly an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday by Vice President Mike Pence, who argued that there would be no second wave and warned against ""overblown"" panics. 
The Chinese capital Beijing meanwhile has greatly expanded its lockdown measures to stop a second wave of Covid-19 cases that has been traced to a local fruit and vegetable market. The city has ordered schools, universities and entertainment venues to be closed, while the neighboring region of Heilonjiang has also imposed a three-week quarantine period. Over 1,000 flights to or from Beijing  have been cancelled, but factories and stores have remained open so far.
Oil and gas stocks weakened as the virus news again revived fears for the path of oil demand. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 3.7% while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 1.8%, as crude prices gave up some of their recent gains, fearing an unexpected build in U.S. inventories.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Petrobras to keep half its office staff at home permanently,"By Sabrina Valle and Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras has decided to keep half its administrative staff working from home permanently, the company told Reuters, in a dramatic example of how the novel coronavirus has major companies rethinking their use of office real estate.
The oil company has sent as much as 90% of its 21,000 administrative staff home since March due to the pandemic. The experience has revealed new opportunities to save costs with office space, Petrobras said in a response to questions. 
The state-controlled firm, known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), is the first oil major to plan a widespread and permanent shift to remote work.
Producers including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  BP  Plc (L:BP) have extended their work-from-home periods for most office staff into the foreseeable future but have not made any permanent decisions.
Technology companies such as  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) have been taking the lead on a permanent shift that is gaining traction in other industries as firms seek cost reductions, employee convenience - or both.
The shift to permanent work-from-home arrangements will be an opt-in process at Petrobras, according to press officers, but requests from workers so far suggest demand will be high, with more than 10,000 expected to participate.
The new policy will not immediately affect operational personnel working outside of administrative offices, such as refinery technicians and platform workers, who are part of a 46,000-strong workforce at Petrobras, excluding subsidiaries.
The permanent shift to more remote work is also under consideration for the company's logistics subsidiary Transpetro, or Petrobras Transporte SA.
Petrobras has not set a date to increase staffing in offices and will keep in-site workforce to a minimum for now to reduce health risks during the pandemic, the company said.
Workers from at least two departments are discussing a possible rotation system, in which employees would spend one week in the office and one week at home. Petrobras said that is an option under consideration, with no final decision. 
Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has been on a crusade to cut costs since he took office in January last year. He announced a $8.1 billion cost-reduction plan through 2023, including dismissal programs and office space reductions. 
Since then, he has decided to cut back overseas offices to five from 18, shutting locations in New York, Mexico City, Libya, Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania, Iran and Tokyo. 
Petrobras has been also vacating entire buildings in Rio and Sao Paulo that it does not own. The company decided last year to concentrate employees at its iconic headquarters in downtown Rio, where the cost per desk is cheaper than in rented corporate buildings nearby.

Petrobras was one of the first oil majors to cut oil output as the coronavirus pandemic battered global demand. It also booked multibillion-dollar writedowns on assets to reflect lower long-term oil price forecasts, in a move followed by BP on Monday.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Three employees of Acacia Mining, a former Barrick Gold (TO:ABX) unit, have been released from jail in Tanzania after paying 1.5 billion Tanzanian shillings ($649,632) in compensation for tax evasion, a prosecutor told Reuters on Wednesday.
Deodatus Mwanyika, Alex Lugendo, and Assa Mwaipopo had been imprisoned since October 2018 when Tanzanian authorities charged three of Acacia's local subsidiaries with dozens of offences including money laundering and tax evasion.
The three pleaded guilty to tax evasion. All other charges were dropped, said state prosecutor Wankyo Simon, who worked on the case at Kisutu Resident Magistrates' Court in Dar es Salaam.
Under a plea bargain deal, they paid a total of 1.5 billion Tanzanian shillings in compensation, and an additional fine of 1.5 million Tanzanian shillings each to avoid a further four months' jail time.
""We are proud that the three have paid compensation to the government,"" Simon said. ""We encourage all people in the country to keep on paying tax instead of evading.""
Barrick, which bought out Acacia Mining last year, declined to comment when asked about the release, which took place on Tuesday.
In May, Barrick resumed exporting gold for the first time since a ban on shipments in 2017 and paid an initial $100 million to settle the dispute.
The disagreement between Acacia and the government escalated three years ago when the miner was accused of overstating how much gold it was exporting and operating illegally in the country. It has denied any wrongdoing.

When Wang Zhenhua was arrested last July, shares in the company and its listed units nosedived. At the time, Seazen Group was China's eighth-largest property developer by sales; it has since slipped to 13th place.
The Putuo District People's Court in Shanghai issued the verdict after a two-day closed-door hearing, according to a statement published on its official WeChat account. Five years is the maximum jail term for child molestation. 
Reuters was not able to reach Wang or Seazen Group for comment. 
Wang's son, non-executive director Wang Xiaosong, was appointed chairman of Seazen Group's board after his father's arrest last year. Seazen Group's subsidiaries include Seazen Holdings Co Ltd (SS:601155) and property management unit S-Enjoy Service Group Co Ltd (HK:1755).
However, Wang Zhenhua continues to hold about 70% of Seazen Group. The 2020 Hurun Global Rich List in March estimated Wang and his son's net worth at around $6.1 billion. 

Seazen sold some of its land parcels shortly after Wang's arrest to improve its cash flow amid lenders' worries.

Qatar Airways has ordered tens of billions of dollars of aircraft from the world's two biggest planemakers. But after a plunge in demand for air travel, it says it has no room for new aircraft and will instead shrink its fleet of around 200 jets.
""Quite a lot of (deliveries) will be deferred. We have already notified both Boeing and Airbus that we will not be taking any aeroplanes this year or next year,"" al-Baker said in an interview on Britain's Sky News.
""All the other aircraft that we have on order that were supposed to be delivered to us within the next two or three years, will now be pushed back to as long as nearly eight to 10 years.""
Al-Baker repeated a warning to the planemakers that a refusal to comply with the airline's request could jeopardise future business between them.
""If they don't oblige to our requirements, (then) we will have to review our long term business relationships with them,"" he said, adding the airline no longer needed the 30 firm orders for Boeing's 737 MAX it had placed. 
""We have already informed Boeing that we will have to replace them with some other type of aeroplanes ... we will not require anymore of the 737 MAXs.""
Al-Baker also said Qatar Airways would continue to support British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) after increasing its stake in the airlines group in February.
""It is a strategic investment. We will continue to be an investor in IAG,"" he said. ""If it is necessary, yes, we will inject equity into IAG.""

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:47AM ET</span>",EU puts up barricade plan for state-backed foreign buyers,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - State-backed foreign firms will have a harder time buying European Union companies under a proposal by the bloc's executive, which is pursuing more protectionist policies as the global pandemic tips the region into a steep recession.
New measures were needed because the existing foreign direct investment screening rules and trade defence measures were not enough to ward off a potential post-coronavirus buying spree of cheap assets, the European Commission said.
The EU fears foreign subsidies may be used to grow market share or underbid European rivals to gain access to strategically important markets or critical infrastructure.
The EU executive cited a ""growing number of instances"" in which foreign subsidies had allowed the acquisition of EU firms or distorted investment decisions or bidding in public procurement ""to the detriment of non-subsidised companies"".
""These tools are for everyone, there are no specific countries we are thinking of,"" EU antitrust chief Margrete Vestager told a news conference.
Britain will be scouring the plans for their implications, said Oliver Bretz, a partner at Euclid Law, adding:
""Although this initiative seems to be aimed primarily at Chinese investment, there may be other collateral damage ... UK negotiators are probably looking at this very closely in the context of Brexit, as State aid is one of their red lines.""
Foreign firms seeking to buy a stake of more than 35% in an EU company with a turnover of more than 100 million euros ($112 million) would have to inform the Commission if they have received more than 10 million euros in state aid.
Failure to do so could lead to fines or a veto of the deal, and the buyers could have to sell assets to make up for any unfair advantage gained.
Companies already present in the 27-country bloc could be forced to report foreign subsidies to the Commission if these exceed more than 200,000 euros over three years.

Such companies may also have to sell assets, reduce market share or capacity, or make payments to rebalance any distortions under the proposals, which are open for consultation to Sept. 23 after which the Commission will decide on legislation.

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Lessons From the Brink: How $4 Trillion of ETFs Bounced Back,"(Bloomberg) -- The pipeline for new passive products is thriving. The world’s biggest credit ETF is hitting records. Even a notorious oil fund is rising from the near-dead.
As inflows soar and market dislocations vanish, America’s exchange-traded fund market is back to the boom times -- consigning to history two major disruptions of the pandemic crash.
The question is whether the lessons are being forgotten as fast, from the risks of marketing commodity products to retail investors to the price-discovery dangers in fixed income.
It’s been just two months since negative oil prices roiled commodity funds, and three since a historic schism opened up between bond ETFs and their underlying assets. Yet both are distant memories.
As Gary Stringer, chief investment officer at Stringer Asset Management, puts it: “It’s largely business back to normal” for the $4.3 trillion industry.
Less than a week ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), ticker USO, to issue 1 billion new shares, paving the way for inflows to the world’s largest oil ETF after a nearly two-month freeze.
It’s a milestone moment for the fund that may help draw a line under its near-implosion, even as many of the questions raised by the episode remain unanswered.
The extraordinary steps taken by the ETF to protect itself from sub-zero crude prices in April shone a light on the risks posed by all funds investing in futures contracts, rather than in the assets underpinning those agreements. They also highlighted the danger of a huge fund like USO, with $5 billion in assets, operating in a relatively small market.
Read more: ETFs and the Danger of an Illiquidity Doom Loop
While the fund recorded outflows in its first trading days since the freeze ended, it has hardly been a torrent. Some $100 million has left the ETF, whose shares are up about 60% since their April low thanks to a recovery in crude.
“People’s memories are very short,” said David Pursell, the CEO of Core Alternative. “Greed is a driving force for all of this. If they see something moving quickly, they are apt to jump in.”
At a time when the surge of new retail investors is the talk of Wall Street, the worry is that history could repeat.
Right before the fund crashed, mom-and-pop investors had piled into USO to try to surf any oil price recovery. Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are said to have opened probes into whether the risks of the fund were properly disclosed.
For many pros, the lesson of USO is simply buyer beware. Some argue it shows certain assets shouldn’t be in an ETF wrapper, while others tout the proposed re-naming of fund types being pursued by a group including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., which they argue would help investors realize the varying risks.
“Not all exchange-traded funds are created equal,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc. “Other non-ETF exchange-traded products or commodity-based ETFs proved to be challenged in a number of regards, and I think it’s time to take a long, hard look at the ways in which risks associated with them can be better highlighted.”
The drama wasn’t limited to oil funds, however. The USO crisis came on the heels of a pronounced bout of turmoil in the bond market, when a rush to liquidate spurred the widest gap between fixed-income ETFs and their underlying assets in a decade.
As debt markets convulsed, the shares of the funds -- which were more liquid -- slumped, leaving them at deep discounts to the value of the bonds they invested in.
It was a moment many naysayers had been waiting for. Their argument had long been that the liquidity mismatch between ETFs and bonds would exacerbate a selloff and destabilize the wider market.
Some niche hedge funds positioned for precisely this type of dislocation, and their bets paid off as the funds tumbled. In their eyes, the plunge in ETF share prices was evidence that fixed-income funds give merely an illusion of liquidity.
It’s a view not shared by the bulk of industry practitioners. The way they see it, when the bond market froze the ETFs didn’t, meaning the funds actually became the best available vehicle of price discovery.
“You saw this huge fall-off in market liquidity, while the ETF market for fixed-income has picked up some of the slack,” said Dan Suzuki, the deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors.
This takeaway -- that bond ETFs are now a vital liquidity tool rather than a threat -- alongside the Fed’s actions have made the funds more appealing than ever.
Fixed-income ETFs took in a record almost $30 billion in May, Bloomberg data show. The largest credit fund, BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, hit an all-time high on Monday after the Fed confirmed its plans to buy more bonds.

All of this has fed into the pipeline for new products. In the second quarter through Monday, 55 new U.S.-listed ETFs were introduced, compared with 45 in the first three months of the year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Debuts all-but stalled in March amid the worst of the coronavirus-driven selloff.
“That the ETF market functioned very well in a period of extreme stress if anything will only further accelerate adoption,” Johnson said.

""Over the coming months, we will invest in early-stage companies with the potential to transform the food and agriculture industries,"" Chief Executive Ian McIntosh said in a statement on Wednesday.
The venture capital initiative, called LDC Innovations, will be part of LDC's innovation and downstream division. The group said it was too early to comment on the potential budget of the unit.
Dreyfus is the ""D"" of the so-called 'ABCD' quartet of global commodity traders that includes Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM),  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL).
Like its peers, it has been looking further down the food chain in response to declining profits in trading and shipping crops. It is also considering bringing outside investors into the family-controlled group.
LDC Innovations will be led by Max Clegg, who has held business development and innovation roles at the group in North America since 2012.
The overall innovation and downstream business will be headed by Thomas Couteaudier, who will assume the role in addition to his existing responsibilities as Head of South & Southeast Asia Region, LDC said.
The company later confirmed that its current innovation chief Kristen Eshak Weldon is to leave the group at the end of this month.
Weldon had joined LDC in January 2019 to take up the newly created innovation role after previously working at private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX).

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:33AM ET</span>",Trade war? U.S. battle over kitchen cabinets really a domestic dispute,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - The anti-China trade mood has reached U.S. kitchens, where a battle is being waged over competing visions of where and how cabinets should be made. 
On one side are America's traditional cabinet companies, employing an estimated 100,000 people in factories across the country, often in small towns close to forests supplying the wood. On the other is a new breed of ""ready-to-assemble"" firms that grabbed a hefty slice of the business over the last five years by importing disassembled cabinets from China in flat boxes and selling them at unbeatable prices. 
In March, the International Trade Commission ruled unanimously in favor of a coalition of 50 U.S. firms fighting to stop the influx. The ITC concluded the imports charged unfairly low prices and slapped on big anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties that will last five years. 
""We did this for the American worker,"" said Mark Trexler, chief operating officer of Cabinetworks Group, the nation's second-largest cabinet maker and a member of the coalition.
While cast as a Chinese cabinet invasion, the ready-to-assemble rise was driven largely by domestic companies, including some of the biggest U.S. players who invented the niche and went to China to source products. Chinese companies have jumped into the business, to be sure, but ready-to-assemble was an American idea. The upshot for Americans from the trade case is likely to be higher cabinet prices. 
And Trexler's assertion notwithstanding, jobs are not coming back to U.S. shores because of tariffs. Even as the case was being fought, ready-to-assemble firms like CNC Cabinetry, a privately held company in South Plainfield, New Jersey, were getting out of China - by shifting work to other low-cost countries.
Robert Hunter, CNC's chief operating officer, said no domestic companies will make the disassembled product for him to replace the Chinese supplies - at least not at a competitive price. So he shifted sourcing to Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia and is hunting for a low-cost option in Eastern Europe to have many options for sourcing at a time of spreading trade battles.
SPEED IS ESSENTIAL 
CNC was founded in 1992 as a traditional cabinetmaker but shifted to ready-to-assemble after the 2007-2009 recession. At a sprawling facility just outside New York City, rather than making cabinets from scratch, most of the space is devoted to shelves of flat boxes. The key is to have a ready supply of a limited range of sizes and styles, Hunter said. 
When a customer calls, Hunter can ship the boxes containing all the parts needed for a cabinet immediately or have his small staff of 50 craftsmen assemble it so the cabinets are ready to install when delivered. The New Jersey facility also makes countertops, which aren't imported, to finish off a kitchen package. 
""If you call me today in the morning, I'm shipping tomorrow night,"" said Hunter.
CNC sells mostly to builders outfitting multiple kitchens and house flippers looking for low prices. Traditional cabinet companies can take weeks or longer to deliver cabinets.
Ready-to-assemble's rapid growth sparked the trade case, say manufacturers, importers and trade attorneys for both sides interviewed by Reuters. The U.S. cabinet industry sells about $10 billion worth of goods a year, and while the two sides dispute how big ready-to-assemble has grown, the ITC noted Chinese imports of cabinets, vanities, and cabinet parts totaled about $4.4 billion in 2018. 
Many domestic firms feared they were following the path of America's furniture industry, which began selectively importing Chinese products in the 1990s and was eventually swamped by direct competition from Chinese producers entering the U.S. market. Parts of North Carolina are still dotted with empty furniture factories as a result. 
Ready-to-assemble cabinets were depressing prices for everyone, according to domestic firms. They were also coming equipped with features for which U.S. producers had always charged extra, like self-closing drawers.
""History shows the Chinese aren't satisfied until they have the whole industry,"" said Stephen Wellborn, co-owner of Wellborn Cabinet Inc in Ashland (NYSE:ASH), Alabama. He said the political climate was favorable, given President Donald Trump's commitment to helping domestic manufacturing, but he said they would have brought the trade case anyway.
One irony is that the largest U.S. cabinetmaker,  Fortune Brands Home & Security  Inc's (N:FBHS) Masterbrand Cabinet unit, helped develop the ready-to-assemble business in China before deciding it posed a risk to its much larger domestic operations. Masterbrand's U.S. sales were $2.5 billion last year, and it has 10,000 U.S. employees in 20 factories fed mostly by U.S. suppliers.
Masterbrand said it stopped buying from China after the case was filed. But it did not bring those jobs home either. The company now obtains ready-to-assemble cabinets from Vietnam. Cabinets made in Vietnam are 30-40% pricier than China, according to industry sources.
Back at CNC, Hunter said he was also anticipating more trade issues. If shipments grow too much from another country, such as Vietnam, the United States could crack down with duties on those imports as well, he said.

""That's why I want to find sources in five countries, minimum,"" said Hunter, ""because you don't know what comes next.""

The move is the first major departure at ABB since former  Sandvik  (ST:SAND) Chief Executive Rosengren took charge in March.

(Reuters) - Record upside surprises in U.S. economic data are bolstering the case for a “V” shaped recovery from the COVID-19 recession and boosting investor confidence in a stock rally that has already delivered hefty gains in recent months. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Economic Surprise Index <.CESIUSD>, which tracks economic data relative to economists' expectations, hit a record high this month, reflecting recent turnarounds in key areas such as unemployment that have helped extend the S&P 500's gain to 40% since late March. The stock index jumped 1.9% on Tuesday, helped by a record surge in May retail sales.
(GRAPHIC - Could it be a 'V'?: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpggkrqpq/Pasted%20image%201592323348223.png) 
The improving data, along with signals that the Federal Reserve remains ready to backstop the U.S. economy, have eased concerns that the stocks rally has ignored the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic and resulting lockdowns.
“The safety-net (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell has put in place is not going away any time soon,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. “While we will see the economy struggle, you won’t likely see a sustained pullback in equities because of all the stimulus that has been thrown at the market.” 
Many investors doubt the market's rebound can run much further. A recent surge of COVID-19 cases in some U.S. states and a new cluster of cases in China have raised concerns over a coronavirus resurgence, while subdued demand for commodities such as oil signal a potentially slow comeback in global growth. 
Influential U.S. investors, including David Tepper and Stanley Druckenmiller, in May described markets as over-valued and with terrible risk-reward, with Druckenmiller dismissing V-recovery hopes as “a fantasy.""
Still, the ranks of doubters have thinned lately, while bullish sentiment has grown. The percentage of fund managers who believe the bounce is a bear market rally that will eventually reverse fell to just over half in June, from more than two-thirds last month, a survey from BofA Global Research showed. 
“Positive sentiment begets positive sentiment,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities. “People are starting to think that this is not a bear market rally, that this is more permanent.”
The market’s gains also appear to be attracting inflows of cash from the sidelines. Cash levels among fund managers in BofA's survey registered their biggest drop in more than a decade in June, and net equity exposure among hedge funds soared to 52% from 34% in May. 
Investors poured a net $20.4 billion into equity-focused mutual funds in the week ending June 10, the largest one-week inflow since 2007, Lipper data showed.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. Domestic Stock Fund Flows: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovakendva/n6Jru-u-s-domestic-stock-fund-flows-nbsp-%20(1).png) 
The rally has exacerbated some investor concerns, including those over stock valuations. The S&P 500's forward price/earnings ratio, a closely followed valuation metric, now stands at 22, a level that was last seen 20 years ago, during the dot-com boom.
For many investors, “it's still love/hate,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. ""If you're a fund manager, you have to be in the market because you have to beat your benchmark, so a lot of managers have to get in there and performance chase.""

At the same time, gains in the prices of oil and some other commodities have slowed in recent weeks, raising concerns that weak demand for raw materials may indicate a lackluster worldwide recovery. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast the global economy could contract by 7.6% if the world sees a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak. 

Still, there are signs that investors remain bullish despite the market's recent gains. The proportion of investors buying S&P 500 bullish call options versus bearish put options rose sharply last week, suggesting some traders are betting the market will continue rising.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has fined the London branch of Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) 37.8 million pounds ($47.3 million) for failing to have proper controls to prevent money laundering, the UK's financial watchdog said on Wednesday.
Banks have to check the background of clients and by March 1, 2017, Commerzbank's checks were overdue on 1,772 customers, the Financial Conduct Authority said.
Many of the customers were allowed to continue to conduct business with the London branch of the bank under an ""exceptions process"" that became ""out of control"" by the end of 2016, the FCA added.
""Commerzbank London was aware of these weaknesses and failed to take reasonable and effective steps to fix them despite the FCA raising specific concerns about them in 2012, 2015 and 2017,"" the FCA said in a statement.
At the time, the FCA was publishing guidance on steps banks could take to reduce the risk of financial crime, and was enforcing action against several firms in relation to anti-money laundering controls, the watchdog said.
""Despite these clear warnings, the failures continued.""
Commerzbank said it takes the FCA's findings very seriously, and has cooperated fully in an investigation that found no actual financial crime.
""Commerzbank London has therefore undertaken a significant remediation exercise,"" the Frankfurt-based bank said in a statement.
The FCA said external people have tested the effectiveness of these enhancements and their work is now complete.
In mid-2016 Commerzbank's financial crime team in London had just three full-time staff, but this was increased to 42 within two years.

Commerzbank would have been fined 54 million pounds if it had not agreed to an early settlement.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned on Wednesday that it might need to apply for protection from creditors if its state-backed bailout deal failed to win sufficient support at a shareholder vote on June 25.
Its statement came after German billionaire Heinz Hermann Thiele criticised the 9 billion euro ($10.1 billion) bailout, saying he had raised his stake in Lufthansa to over 15% and hoped alternative options could be explored.
In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper, Lufthansa's biggest shareholder said he was not satisfied with the deal that gives the German government a 20% stake in Lufthansa and two seats on its supervisory board.
Like the rest of the airline sector, Lufthansa has been hard hit by what is expected to be a protracted travel slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, forcing it to seek the bailout.
Lufthansa said its executive board expected the attendance at its June 25 virtual general meeting to vote on the deal to be under 50%, which would mean two-thirds of those present would need to vote in favour.
""The board considers it possible that the stabilisation package could fail to achieve the two-thirds majority of votes cast,"" it said. 
Lufthansa said it might possibly have to apply for protective shield proceedings under insolvency law a few days after the meeting if no other solution is found immediately.
Under German protective shield proceedings, a company's management remains in charge and gets up to three months to come up with a survival plan.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said after Thiele's comments that he was not worried the deal could collapse and he was ""very pleased"" with the agreement, urging shareholders to approve it.
Thiele, who is honorary chairman of Knorr-Bremse (DE:KBX), declined to comment on Lufthansa's statement, a spokeswoman for the German brake manufacturer said.
Lufthansa shares were up 1.3% at 1115 GMT after it was disclosed that Thiele now had a 15.5% stake.
'COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE'
""The German government has taken a high-risk bet. Its wish for the government to take a direct stake in Lufthansa is putting the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Lufthansa employees at risk. It's completely irresponsible,"" said Michael Theurer, a senior member of the opposition Free Democrats (FDP). 
Vanessa Golz, who covers Lufthansa for investment fund Deka, which owns 0.9% of the airline, said there was no question it needed a bailout and time was pressing.
""If the position of the shareholders can be improved, this is to be welcomed, but with a sense of proportion. The task now is to draw up a future concept for a 'new Lufthansa' as quickly as possible. Otherwise there are only losers: Lufthansa employees, the taxpayer and the shareholders,"" she said.
Lufthansa shareholders must register to attend the virtual shareholder meeting by June 20 and if more than 50% attend, a simple majority would suffice, the airline said.
As of June 4, 85% of Lufthansa's shareholders were based in Germany.
Thiele, who declined to tell FAZ whether he would vote against the deal, said an indirect government participation via German state-owned development bank KfW could be an alternative to an outright stake.
Under the deal, the government could raise its stake to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt and the airline must transfer up to 24 takeoff and landing slots in Frankfurt and Munich to rivals.

Ross, in an interview on Fox Business Network, said the rule released by the department on Tuesday would help create uniformity, but that the United States was still concerned about the potential for spying and opposed the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks.
""The change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei. What we're doing is something to make it easier for global standards to be symmetrical,"" he said.
""This is to help make sure we have ubiquity in 5G,"" Ross added.
The rule, scheduled to be formally published on Thursday, amends the Huawei ""entity listing"" that restricts sales of U.S. goods and technology to the company to allow the release of certain technology to Huawei and its affiliates if it contributes ""to the revision or development of a 'standard' in a 'standards organization.'"" 
The United States had placed Huawei on the entity list in May 2019, citing national security concerns, and Ross on Wednesday said those concerns remain especially over 5G.

""The spying is very real issue,"" Ross told the television network.

The company's assessment is based on current cash and short-term investments of $13.9 billion and an expected average daily cash burn of about $20 million in June.
""The company has continued to experience a modest improvement in passenger demand and bookings in June 2020—primarily leisure-driven demand,"" Southwest said.
In the second quarter, Southwest said it expects average daily core cash spending of between $30 million and $35 million. The airline had earlier forecast a capacity decline of up to 60% from a year ago.
Last week, American Airlines (O:AAL) said it expects to halt its daily cash burn by the end of 2020, thanks to cost-cutting measures and an improvement in travel demand.

Southwest shares were trading marginally higher at $36.67 before the bell.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday on continued confidence in a prompt economic recovery, but gains are likely to be limited given worries about a coronavirus resurgence.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures up 56 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract rose 174 points, or 0.7%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Tuesday 2% higher, the S&P 500 gained 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.8%. These indices are on three-day win streaks, while the Nasdaq has posted gains for seven of the last eight sessions. 
Retail sales surged 17.7% in May, rebounding from a record slump in April, suggesting that consumer spending is on the mend.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also touted signs of a recovery in his virtual testimony to the Senate, which he continues later Wednesday, although he stressed that the outlook remains uncertain amid a lack of visibility about the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus.
There has been a new wave of infections in Beijing, which has forced the Chinese government to impose stricter measures to curb the outbreak, including cancelling around half of all inbound flights to the capital. Additionally, a number of the more populous U.S. states have reported a surge in daily infections.
This comes as researchers in the U.K. released clinical data showing that steroid, Dexamethasone, had reduced deaths among the sickest Covid-19 patients. 
Economic data due for release Wednesday centers around housing starts, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with analysts expecting a recovery to 1.095 million for the month of May, up from 890,000 for April.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after a report suggesting that its sales in California fell 37% in April and May.
Additionally, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) announced late Tuesday that it was extending the suspension of sailings by some of its biggest brands through September.
Oil prices slipped Wednesday, after the American Petroleum Institute predicted late Tuesday a 3.9 million-barrel build for the week ending June 12.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Main Street's boldest take on Wall Street in bankruptcy stock frenzy,"By Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Bryan Quevedo received his U.S. government stimulus check last month, he invested $1,000 in the stock of bankrupt car rental company  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ).
The 22-year-old Los Angeles delivery driver made the trade on Robinhood, an app that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy and sell shares. A marketing graduate who has struggled to find an office job amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Quevedo analyzed Hertz's share price movements to predict that the stock had hit bottom. After four days, he had doubled his investment.
It is a trade that goes against Wall Street norms and is not for the faint-hearted. Hertz has warned that its bankruptcy process could render its shares worthless. Investors are betting on how high they can push the shares and are risking big losses if they can't quickly flip them to someone else.
""I'm just waiting for the price to go higher or break even so I don't lose any capital,"" said Quevedo, who has since invested another $450 in Hertz' stock. He posted a screenshot of his profits in his Robinhood account on social media and recommended the trade to several friends. 
Hertz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Quevedo is one of tens of thousands of traders who sent Hertz's shares rallying a few days after it filed for bankruptcy protection on May 22, many of them on the Robinhood app. Other shares of bankrupt companies, such as J. C. Penney Company Inc (PK:JCPNQ) and  Whiting Petroleum Corp  (N:WLL), have seen similar rallies. Shares in some obscure penny stocks have soared.
Pundits have struggled to explain the frenzy of speculation. Record savings, low interest rates and even lockdown boredom in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak have all been cited as possible explanations for the extraordinary market moves.
Robinhood did not respond to a request for comment on the surge of trading of bankruptcy stocks on its platform. 
A Reuters review of social media posts identified a bustling community of amateur traders who are defying warnings from finance experts and are betting they can outsmart Wall Street. Many say they vying for quick profits and hope not to be the ones left holding the bag if the shares they invest in suddenly collapse.
""I see a lot of people missed the boat to get rid of Hertz's stock. I like that gamble. That's what I do with my bar money,"" said Joseph Madison, an urban planner in Atlanta, Georgia. A cryptocurrency investment veteran in his early 40s, Madison said he scored a return of 174% by investing ""a few hundred bucks"" in Hertz's stock over the past few weeks. 
Hertz itself has noticed. It launched an effort this week to sell $500 million worth of its stock in the open market, a remarkable move for a company in bankruptcy.
This has still not put off some investors. Hertz's stock is up 388% from the low it hit after it filed for bankruptcy. It remains among the most popular stocks traded on Robinhood. 
A few investors say they will hold onto their Hertz stock, despite the risk of being wiped out. Sherrie Hardy, a 33-year-old airport security worker in Muskegon, Michigan, said she used her and her fiancée's stimulus checks to invest in Hertz and have no plans to sell.
""I invested not only in a sense of capitalizing, but actually want to be a supporter of Hertz. I've always had good business with them and their community efforts. So it's something that I would like to see to stay around for the years to come,"" Hardy said.

""We all know, when we get into the stock market, it is a gamble of some sort.""

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","As Canada reopens, the search for PPE consumes company resources","By Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian companies are scouring the globe, often at great expense, to secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and customers as businesses reopen and coronavirus restrictions are eased.
While larger companies, such as Canadian National Railway Co, are tapping their own global networks to located PPE, smaller companies are battling higher costs to stock up.
""We're worried ... every week or two there's a new need,"" Greg Moreau, chief executive of Chatters Ltd, an Alberta-based hair salon and hair product distributer.
Moreau, whose company has 115 salons across Canada and employs roughly 1,700 people, estimates the additional gear, some of which has been sourced using the supply chain of companies like L'Oreal, is currently costing Chatters about C$4-C$4.50 per individual appointment. 
""The cost is probably 10 times what we were paying for any of this,"" he said.
The Canadian government announced last week it was launching an online supply hub to help connect businesses looking for masks, shields and gloves with suppliers. 
United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), an agricultural cooperative that runs farm and ranch stores, has failed to secure a supply of N95 masks from 3M (NYSE:MMM) for months, Scott Bolton, the president and CEO, said.
Farmers ""need masks in particular when they're working with livestock and or in dusty areas, say grain handling,"" he said, adding the cooperative has turned to Asian suppliers for Chinese-made KN95 masks.
""Frankly, it was scouring the globe, really, trying to find the technical requirements and the quality requirements,"" Bolton said.
UFA has secured roughly 20,000 KN95 masks and will source more as required. ""I think we're exiting the crisis at the moment,"" he added.
CN Railway, Canada's largest railway, has relied on its staff in China and Singapore to manage PPE supplies since making it mandatory for its 25,000 staff to wear a mask while on company premises last month.
""They've been very helpful to us to secure these masks,"" Sean Finn, a CN executive vice president, told Reuters last month. 
CN had initially sourced enough disposable masks to last until August, but has now transitioned to using reusable masks.
Chatters is also working on a three-month cycle and has four staff working full-time to procure hairdressing capes, plastic shields and masks.

""We thought masks were going to be the issue, then it was gloves, right now it's barbicide (a cleaning solution),"" Moreau said. ""It's sort of a moving target and we're just trying to stay ahead of it.""

1506,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",Boohoo Thrives Under Lockdown With Shares and Sales Both Soaring,"(Bloomberg) --  Boohoo  Group Plc’s (LON:BOOH) latest trading update shows the online fashion retailer has been a big winner during coronavirus lockdowns that closed the U.K.’s shopping streets.
A 45% sales increase in the three months to May 31 crushed the consensus analyst estimate for 15% growth, while the stock rose as much as 11% to an all-time high, extending its year-to-date gain to 43%.
The update showed that even when non-essential stores are forced to shut, people still want to update their wardrobes, particularly those among the younger audience targeted by Boohoo. The company predicts that sales will grow about 25% for the current financial year at a time when many brick-and-mortar rivals are seeing their business slump.
“What pandemic?” Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman asked in a note. A 60 basis-point improvement in gross margin during the quarter was unique to the sector, she said, citing “lower markdowns than usual, with good demand and a highly responsive supply chain.”
For Boohoo, the struggles of many retailers in recent months have become an opportunity. The company on Wednesday announced the purchase of the online businesses and all associated intellectual property of the Oasis and Warehouse brands for 5.25 million pounds ($6.6 million).
“The deal adds two very well-known mid-market brands to Boohoo’s growing platform,” wrote Jefferies analyst Andrew Wade, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. The acquisition is “a low risk and likely high returning opportunity, one that provides further evidence of the long-term potential in Boohoo’s multi-brand platform.”
Not everyone is so enthusiastic. According to RBC Capital analyst Sherri Malek, further investment is required to enhance the company’s service proposition, “which lags peers, particularly internationally.” The stock’s valuation “also prevents us from being more constructive,” wrote Malek, who has a sector perform rating on the stock.z

For London’s biggest homebuilder, the cost of Brexit is starting to become clear.
European buyers are shunning rental investments in the city, although demand from other parts of the world remains strong, according to Rob Perrins, chief executive officer of Berkeley Group (OTC:BKGFY) Holdings Plc.
“The real trend is a real reduction in European buyers,” Perrins said by telephone Wednesday. “It used to be about 4% to 5% for us and it has dropped down to 1%. Brexit effectively has meant that London is not seen as a place where Europeans want to invest at the moment.”
The company has seen an uptick in interest from Hong Kong, where China’s clampdown is encouraging more investors to look abroad, Perrins said.
Brexit’s potential impact on house prices was a contentious issue during the 2016 European referendum campaign. While the uncertainty unleashed by the vote has weighed on transaction volumes in the four years since, there’s little evidence that prices have suffered significantly.
The U.K. remains in a transition period following its departure from the EU in January. This expires at the end of the year, meaning the true impact of the vote is yet to become clear.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","HSBC revives 35,000 job cut plan after pandemic pause","By Lawrence White and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is resuming plans to cut around 35,000 jobs which it put on ice after the coronavirus outbreak, as Europe's biggest bank grapples with the impact on its already falling profits.
It will also maintain a freeze on almost all external hiring, Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in a memo sent to HSBC's 235,000 staff worldwide on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 
""We could not pause the job losses indefinitely - it was always a question of 'not if, but when',"" Quinn said, adding that the measures first announced in February were ""even more necessary today"".
An HSBC spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.
HSBC (L:HSBA) had postponed the job cuts, part of a wider restructuring to cut $4.5 billion in costs, in March saying the extraordinary circumstances meant it would be wrong to push staff out.
However, Quinn said it now had to resume the programme as profits fall and economic forecasts point to a challenging time ahead, adding that he had asked senior executives to look at ways to cut more costs in the second half of 2020.
The bulk of the job cuts are likely in the back office at Global Banking and Markets (GBM), which houses HSBC's investment banking and trading, a senior executive familiar with the plans said.
The cuts will also affect senior bankers in Britain who work in GBM and HSBC's head office, as well as support staff in its businesses around the world, the executive added.
While HSBC expects natural attrition of up to 25,000 roles each year, redeploying all affected staff would be unrealistic, the executive said.
WIDER WOES
The resumption of job cuts is unlikely to affect the timing or size of dividends HSBC may pay in the future, the executive said, with that decision likely to be based more around the economic outlook for next year and beyond, assuming regulators approve shareholder payouts once more. 
HSBC's move is a foretaste of wider cuts in the sector as banks confront a harsh operating environment, analysts said.
""It is only a matter of time before substantial further cost-trimming plans are announced,"" analyst John Cronin at Dublin-based broker Goodbody said.
Shares in HSBC have fallen 27% since the start of March, with the pandemic prompting it to set aside $3 billion in bad loan provisions in its first quarter earnings.
Under the initial plan, HSBC said it would merge its private banking and wealth business, pare back its European equity business and reduce its U.S. retail network. 
Shares in HSBC, which has come under fire from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic for its support for a new security law in Hong Kong, rose by 1% in London.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) has completed its purchase of a 70% stake in petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries (SE:2010) for $69.1 billion and extended the payment period by three years to 2028, providing a cushion against weak oil prices.
The deal values Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) at 123.39 riyals ($32.90) per share, 27.5% above the company's share price of 89.40 riyals, as the coronavirus outbreak has hurt demand for petrochemicals products and dented SABIC's shares.
""It is a significant leap forward, which accelerates Aramco's downstream strategy and transforms our company into one of the major global petrochemicals players,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. 
SABIC is the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company.
Aramco and the Saudi state Public Investment Fund (PIF) amended the payment structure for deal, Aramco said in a bourse filing on Wednesday.
Following a seller loan provided by the PIF, Aramco will pay instalments and loan charges until 2028, extending a previous 2025 deadline.
The first $7 billion payment is due on or before Aug. 2, 2020, with the last instalment, a loan charge of $1 billion, on or before April 7, 2028.
The transaction was funded through promissory notes issued to the PIF at the deal's close on Tuesday, Aramco said.
Under a previous agreement, 36% of the purchase price - roughly $25 billion - would have been paid in cash on completion.
A source familiar with the deal, asking not to be named, said the extended payment schedule aimed to enable Aramco to pay dividends to the government.
Some analysts have voiced concerns the oil slump would make it difficult for Aramco to pay the government this year, although its first-quarter dividend was in line with a plan for a $75 billion 2020 payout. 
""The entire Aramco-SABIC deal is about managing cash flow, duplicated costs and access to debt markets within the same group,"" Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer, said.
He said a guaranteed dividend stream would give short-term protection to Aramco and some minority shareholders, but raised the question of whether the share price reflected long-term risk to the oil price.
The deal will inject billions of dollars into the PIF that can finance plans to diversify the largest Arab economy beyond oil exports, including tourism projects and a mega business zone.

Royal Bank of Canada said the new terms, reflecting the weaker macro environment, were clearly an improvement for the buyer, adding that was ""not surprising given recent deal renegotiations in the energy space"".

Some 93.35% of votes cast at Casino's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday approved a resolution appointing Fimalac deputy CEO Thomas Piquemal to the board.
Fimalac, which has a 2.6% stake in Casino, agreed in March to provide new financing facilities for  Rallye  (PA:GENC), the parent company of Casino, which has been under pressure to cut its debts.
By bringing in new financing from Fimalac, Casino ended a previous arrangement with Czech businessman Daniel Kretinsky, who had initially been offered a Casino board seat.
VESA Equity Investment, controlled by Kretinsky, had raised its stake in Casino to 6.88% of the capital and 5.17% of the voting rights in March.
But in April, VESA lowered its stake in Casino to 4.99% of the voting rights through the sale of Casino shares.

Firms in Asia excluding Japan are primed to benefit after earnings and economic growth bottom out globally this quarter, Min Lan Tan, head of the Asia-Pacific chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a call with reporters on Wednesday.
In a report, UBS said it sees 0.5% earnings growth this year and 16.8% next year for Asia ex-Japan stocks, which combined with “undemanding valuations” will give stocks “strong support.” Tan said some companies will gain greater clout because of stronger balance sheets and market consolidation.
Equities have “room to move higher” with potential market upside of over 20% over the next six quarters, Tan said. Positive vaccine developments and stimulus measures will allow a sustainable reopening of economies without a second wave of infections “overwhelming” health care systems, she said.
Asian stocks have recovered most of their losses this year as the reopening of economies globally gathers pace, with trillions of dollars in stimulus measures supporting the rebound. Now, strategists are emphasizing the importance of stock selection and balance sheet strength in picking out companies that are able to weather the drop in economic activity and risks of a second wave of infections.

Tan expects economic growth globally to normalize in the first half of 2021. Within Asian equities, which is among its most preferred globally, UBS favors stocks in Singapore, China and India.
The bank continues to back Asian credit. It’s also adding income to portfolios through exposure to U.S. high-yield and investment-grade credit as well as emerging-market dollar sovereign bonds as the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates through 2022, Tan said.

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boohoo Hits New All-Time High With Vulture Capitalism Embrace,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --  Boohoo .com plc (LON:BOOH) has flourished by exploiting the cash-strapped teenager’s eye for a bargain, but now it’s eyeing bargains of its own.
The online-only fast-fashion group gave notice on Wednesday of its intention to make full use of the liquidation sale that it expects in fashion as a result of the pandemic, starting with the acquisition of the intellectual property rights of Oasis and Warehouse, two high-street brands that had gone into administration in April.
Boohoo is paying a mere 5.25 million pounds ($6.6 million) for the online rights to those brands, which had sales of 47 million pounds in their last financial year, suggesting the deal should be highly accretive.
In its statement to the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, Boohoo noted that two other brands that it bought out of insolvency last year, Karen Millen and Coast, have “continued to trade strongly”, which will ease any concerns about integrating new acquisitions as it scales up.
Boohoo’s move is a classic illustration of the trend that investors have bet on in force since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted. Already-struggling high-street names collapse, and online rivals swoop in to scavenge the best parts of the carcass. If Boohoo were a bank, those who can afford to pay more than 15 pounds for a dress would be calling it a vulture capitalist.  There is nothing in today’s deal that will be of any comfort to the 1,800 Oasis and Warehouse staff who haven’t worked since April. 
That doesn’t change the fact that vultures are an essential part of the ecosystem. And the description would in any case be unfair to a company that has shown itself to be more than equal to the challenges of a notoriously tough industry. Even in the year of Covid-19, it expects sales to grow 25%, and a net margin of 10% or just below.
Those figures represent a clear slowdown from the explosive growth it showed from a lower base, but are still more than decent in the current circumstances. Moreover, the company appears to have successfully addressed one of its key strategic weaknesses by growing beyond the challenged U.K. market. The U.K. accounted for less than half of total revenue in the three months to May 31,  as sales grew 66% in the rest of Europe and 79% in the U.S., thanks largely to the success of Nasty Gal, another successfully integrated acquisition.
The market reacted to Wednesday’s news by pushing the stock up as much as 10% to a new record high of 433.50 pence. By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), it had retraced slightly to be up only 9.2%. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.7%, while the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.6%."

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Europe's shares added to their best gains in almost a month as safety plays lost their lustre on Wednesday, with hopes of a rapid economic recovery standing firm against a resurgence of global coronavirus cases.
Data showed U.S. retail sales bounced back sharply in May, but new infections have hit record highs in six U.S. states and China cut flights and closed schools to contain a fresh outbreak in Beijing.
The theme of a strong global economic rebound ""will need to be balanced against the 2nd wave COVID risks which are more difficult to assess, and we would argue investors have assumed to be perhaps more modest than in reality,"" said MUFG's Head of Research Derek Halpenny.
Politics also lurked as a worry with India reporting 20 of its soldiers had been killed in clashes with Chinese troops at a disputed border site, while North Korea rejected a South Korean offer to send special envoys and said it would redeploy troops at the border.
That was enough to inject a tinge of caution into trading.

Two-thirds of the more than 70 firms which transferred part or all of their defined benefit pension schemes to an insurer since 2007 saw a share price lift afterwards, the report by consultants Mercer said.
Pension payments in a defined benefit scheme are based on an employee's final salary before retirement.
The share price rise ranged from 0.25-3% and tended to increase over the six-month period, the report showed.
""Defined benefit plans in some cases can be a drag on a company, to remove some of those elements is probably a positive,"" said David Ellis, UK head of bulk pensions insurance at Mercer.
The deals surveyed by Mercer totalled 90 billion pounds ($114 billion) and 48 were for companies in the FTSE 100 (FTSE) index.
Two-thirds of Britain's company pension schemes are in deficit, following years of low interest rates which have slashed their investment income.
So-called bulk annuity deals enable companies to rid their balance sheets of the pension funds, which can be a deterrent to merger activity, but many companies cannot afford them.
Bulk annuity deals hit a record volume of 44 billion pounds last year, though 2020 is expected to be slower.
 Legal & General  (L:LGEN), one of the biggest players in the market, said on Tuesday it expected to have completed 3.4 billion pounds in deals by the end of June and was quoting on a pipeline totalling a further 25 billion pounds.

At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
European stock markets posted hefty gains Tuesday, along with Wall Street, as a strong rebound in U.S. retail sales in May boosted the impression that the American economy, the world’s largest, is recovering quickly, despite another sobering performance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.
News out of Europe was encouraging as well, after the German ZEW confidence indices suggested “the euro economy has already moved into upswing territory,” said Danske Bank, in a note to clients.
However, doubts still exist about how solid a base this recovery is built upon, with Powell cautioning that output and employment in America would remain well short of their pre-pandemic levels for a long time.
The Covid-19 virus is also proving hard to get rid of, with infections hitting record highs in six U.S. states and Beijing struggling to contain a fresh outbreak. The Chinese capital closed its schools on Wednesday, saying that a cluster of new cases discovered at the weekend was ""extremely severe"". 
Adding to the mixed picture, Japan’s exports fell 28.3% in May from a year, their biggest decline since the 2008 global crisis.

Investing.com – HSBC has responded to the criticism it has received over its support of China’s national security laws for Hong Kong.
The National People’s Congress unanimously approved the drafting and the enactment of the laws in Hong Kong and Macau in late May. After an initial silence, HSBC’s Asia-Pacific CEO Peter Wong signed a petition in support of the laws earlier in the month.
The bank’s co-head of global banking and markets Greg Guyett said in an internal memo, “China and the West will continue to have deep economic and trade relationships - and Hong Kong will remain an important conduit given its robust markets and business framework.”
The memo reiterated HSBC’s support for the laws. “We respect and support laws and regulations that will enable Hong Kong to recover and rebuild the economy and, at the same time, maintain the principle of one country, two systems.”
U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was the latest politician to issue a warning to the bank during a daily news briefing on Monday. His U.S. counterpart Michael Pompeo criticized “corporate kowtows” in response to the laws during the previous week.

1522,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:54PM ET</span>",Why Goldman Is Siding With China on This Huawei Play,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Seoul to Taipei, large-cap companies are treated with reverence, boasting almost uniform buy recommendations from brokerage analysts. But in Hong Kong, a Chinese semiconductor foundry, which has gained over $7 billion in market cap this year, is stirring up controversy and splitting Wall Street titans. 
I’m talking about Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which counts Huawei Technologies Co. as its largest client. Of the 33 sell-side analysts tracked by Bloomberg, only 14 have a buy rating, with the rest an outright sell or hold, which in the analyst world amounts to a polite no. 
The negative sentiment is easy to justify. Shortly after May 15, when the U.S. placed further restrictions on Huawei,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG promptly downgraded SMIC. The new rules require that any chip supplier using American technology get a license before selling to Huawei. So unless that’s granted, or this policy is withdrawn, foundries from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to SMIC will have to stop doing business with the tech giant, the bank noted. Last year, Huawei accounted for 19% of sales at SMIC, and 14% at TSMC. The Taiwanese company has already halted new orders from Huawei, according to some reports. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). disagrees. In a research note published this week, the bank reaffirmed its conviction, adding fuel to SMIC’s already meteoric run. The stock closed 11.9% higher Tuesday, bringing this year’s gain to a whopping 78.8%. 
SMIC has become expensive by all traditional metrics. It’s now trading at 53 times 2021 earnings, versus TSMC’s 17.7 times. It’s cheaper on a price-to-book basis, but its return-on-equity is only 4.6%, well below the very profitable TSMC’s 23.4%. So what does Goldman see in SMIC? 
China’s vast domestic demand. SMIC’s advanced-processing-nodes unit has the potential to mass produce at least three times as many smartphone chips as Huawei by 2025, the bank estimates. As long as SMIC gets some new business at home, U.S. sanctions on Huawei won’t move the needle.
This is a seductive narrative. SMIC fits nicely into President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 initiative, which aims to produce 70% of chips domestically, versus about 20% currently. Tsinghua Unigroup’s Unisoc, China’s second largest mobile chip designer after Huawei’s HiSilicon, could start using SMIC for mass production, Goldman mused. Both are backed by the state-owned China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, simply known as the Big Fund. As of 2019 year-end, the Big Fund owned close to 20% of SMIC. 
On the financing front, SMIC sure behaves like a national champion already. Last year, it received $293 million in government funding, an 87% jump from 2018; subsidies accounted for a quarter of its Ebitda. On May 15, the day Huawei got slapped with further sanctions, SMIC said the Big Fund and a Shanghai municipal fund would invest about $2.5 billion into one of its wafer plants. It’s also on a fast track to raise at least 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) on the mainland’s Nasdaq-style Star market. 
To be sure, the technology gap between SMIC and market leader TSMC will persist, which explains why the Taiwan rival is so much more profitable. But as long as SMIC is seen as a national champion — it’s China’s most advanced semiconductor foundry — cheap state money will keep rolling in and will help close the gap. The company’s return-on-equity could improve to 14% by 2025, says Goldman. 
Mainland investors are certainly big believers. Last week, they bought a net $148 million worth of SMIC stock, the most hotly sought company on the southbound trade of the Hong Kong Stock Connect. Buying remains brisk this week.
Just like the rest of its economy, Hong Kong’s $4.8 trillion stock market is a busy battleground for cultural clashes, with U.S. fund managers’ dominance gradually giving way to aggressive mainland investors. While foreigners may see SMIC as collateral damage to Huawei’s sanctions, all the Chinese see is state support. This disconnect is being played out in analyst ratings. Goldman is just taking the Chinese view.

(Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad service Amtrak, which has been reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, will run many of its long-distance routes less frequently and cut the frequency of trains in its busy Northeast Corridor, the rail operator said on Tuesday.
Amtrak also said it is looking to pare its workforce via a voluntary offer to employees, and expects the workforce could be reduced by up to 20%.
""Due to the long-term impact of COVID-19 on ridership, Amtrak has made the decision to operate with reduced capacity through FY21,"" an Amtrak spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
The company said that beginning Oct. 1, it plans to reduce most long-distance trains to three days per week instead of daily.
Amtrak said in May it needed a further $1.5 billion bailout and disclosed plans to cut its workforce by up to 20% in the coming budget year.
The company, which has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, in April received $1 billion in emergency funding from the U.S. Congress.
The passenger railroad service said it also plans to enter fiscal year 2021 with reduced train frequencies in the Northeast Corridor, which operates between Washington, D.C., and Boston and is the busiest in its network, and on its state-funded routes.
""We are planning 32% fewer frequencies on the NEC, 24% fewer for our state-supported service"", the spokeswoman told Reuters.

""Our goal is to restore daily service on these routes as demand warrants, potentially by the summer of 2021,"" the statement said.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",U.S. posts rule allowing U.S. companies to work with Huawei on 5G and other standards,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce on Tuesday posted a new rule that allows U.S. companies to work with China's Huawei to develop standards for 5G and other cutting-edge technologies, despite restrictions on doing business with the telecommunications equipment maker.
Reuters reported on Monday that the rule had been approved and sent to the Federal Register, the official U.S. publication for rules. It was posted for public inspection on the Federal Register's website on Tuesday and is scheduled to be formally published on Thursday.
The rule amends the Huawei ""entity listing,"" which restricts sales of U.S. goods and technology to the company. The United States placed Huawei on the list in May 2019, citing national security concerns. 
The amendment authorizes the release of certain technology to Huawei and its affiliates if it contributes ""to the revision or development of a 'standard' in a 'standards organization.'""
Industry and government officials have said the entity listing backfired in standards settings. With U.S. companies uncertain what technology they could share, some U.S. engineers did not engage, and Huawei gained a stronger voice, they said.
Huawei and 114 of its foreign affiliates on the Entity List ""continue to participate in many important international standards organizations in which U.S. companies also participate,"" the new rule says. 
""As international standards serve as the building blocks for product development and help ensure functionality, interoperability and safety of the products,"" it noted, ""it is important to U.S. technological leadership that U.S. companies be able to work in these bodies in order to ensure that U.S. standards proposals are fully considered.""
Naomi Wilson of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents tech companies, said the rule was a ""long-awaited step to clarify that U.S. companies can participate in international standards bodies – even where certain listed entities are present.""
Boston lawyer Andy Updegrove, who has represented over 150 standards organizations, said he found one catch: Not all standards consortiums may meet the requirements in the rule.
To do so, he said, some may change the way they work, but other foreign ones may not. ""Overall, it’s a big improvement, but it’s not going to help U.S. companies in every case,"" Updegrove said.

Huawei said in a statement it wants to continue standards discussions with counterparts, including those in the United States, and that ""inclusiveness and productive dialogue will better promote"" their formulation and encourage development.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits fell by 69.6% to $18.5 billion in the first quarter of 2020 from the year prior as banks felt the economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to data from a banking regulator.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that ""deteriorating economic activity"" caused lenders to write off delinquent debt and set aside billions of dollars to guard against future losses. Over half of all banks reported a profit decline, and 7.3% of lenders were unprofitable.
The new report, the first government survey of the industry since the pandemic shut down large parts of the economy, shows banks set aside $38.8 billion to cover potential loan losses in the future, up nearly 280% from the year prior. The amount of loans banks charged off as delinquent was up nearly 15%, driven by an 87% increase in charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans.
The amount of non-current loans rose 7.3% from the previous quarter, the biggest increase since 2010.
Despite the setbacks, FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said banks had been able to effectively serve clients in the downturn, and were a ""source of strength for the economy.""
""The FDIC was born out of a crisis, and we now find ourselves in the midst of another unprecedented period,"" she told reporters.
As many investors cashed out of the stock market, banks saw a $1.2 trillion, or 8.5%, spike in deposits from the previous quarter.
Loan balances also jumped as companies tapped credit lines with banks, led by a 15.4% increase in commercial and industrial loans.

The total number of ""problem banks"" monitored by the FDIC increased for the first time since 2011, growing from 51 to 54 firms in the first quarter.

The prospects of fresh support from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan also supported global equity markets.
""It was a trifecta of positives today,"" said Jeffrey Carbone, a partner at North Carolina-based Cornerstone Wealth, referring to the U.S. data, drug trials and central bank promises.
The upbeat sentiment weighed of U.S. Treasuries and supported demand for lower-rated southern European debt. Not everyone was in the mood for risk, however, with safe-have gold pushed higher on news of a fresh coronavirus outbreak in China.[GOL/]
""We got potentially more positive news in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But while COVID is in most people's minds, in the stock market's view it is all about reopening and the strong data suggest the recovery is happening and faster than most expected."" 
At the beginning of his two-day testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said a full recovery was unlikely until the public is confident the disease had been contained.
In Asia, Australian S&P/ASX 200 futures were up 0.5%, while {{178|Japan's NiNikkei 225 futures were up 0.2% but down 0.6% from the underlying index's Tuesday close.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures were down 0.3%.
U.S. retail sales jumped a record 17.7% in May, blowing past the 8% increase analysts expected and supporting views the U.S. recession might be drawing to an end.
Also cheering investors were trial results showing dexamethasone, a cheap and widely used steroid, reduced death rates by about one-third among the most severely ill COVID-19 patients.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.0%, the S&P 500 gained 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.8%. That followed a broad 3% rally in major European bourses.
The MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 2.2%.
News elsewhere contributed to the bullish sentiment. 
Germany's monthly ZEW investor sentiment survey showed investors are confident that Europe's largest economy will be over the worst of the coronavirus impact by the end of the European summer.
The dollar was mostly stronger, with the euro down 0.55% to $1.126 and the Japanese yen up 0.01% at 107.32.
The British pound rose on unemployment numbers that were not as bad as feared and friendlier Brexit talks.[GBP/]
The BOJ increased its lending packages for cash-strapped firms to $1 trillion from about $700 billion, while keeping rates steady, sticking to its view that the Japanese economy will gradually recover from the pandemic. 
The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 4.7 basis points to 0.7495%.

German, French, Dutch and other core yields also rose. Riskier Italian yields fell to their lowest level since the end of March, and the iTraxx European crossover index, which reflects the cost of insuring against junk-rated corporate bond defaults, fell to its lowest level in six days. [GVD/EUR]

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday said a former Green Beret and his son, wanted by Japan for helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co boss Carlos Ghosn flee the country, were advancing a ""flawed"" interpretation of Japanese law to fight their extradition.
Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, were arrested in Massachusetts last month at Japan's request for allegedly smuggling Ghosn out of the country on Dec. 29, 2019, in a box while he was out on bail awaiting trial on financial charges. 
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, after being charged with engaging in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.
Lawyers for the Taylors in a motion last week asked a federal judge in Boston to quash the provisional warrants issued in May for their arrests, arguing that ""bail jumping"" is not a crime in Japan.
Defense lawyers argued that helping someone jump bail was also not a crime. While Japan issued arrest warrants for the Taylors in January, the lawyers said the crime stated in the warrants is an immigration offense and a non-extraditable misdemeanor.
But U.S. prosecutors in a brief filed on Tuesday said it would be ""unprecedented"" for the extradition case at this junction to be tossed based on a ""flawed interpretation of Japanese law and a mischaracterization of the facts.""
While Japan has not yet formally sought their extradition, the country has confirmed that Taylors' conduct constitutes a felony, U.S. prosecutors said.
""The purported loophole through which the Taylors seek to evade justice simply does not exist,"" U.S. prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors added that neither Taylor, including Michael, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and private security specialist, should be released from jail as they are flight risks.

Abbe Lowell, the Taylors' lawyer, said he was reviewing the filing.

The German-based company is moving to save cash as it wages an expensive legal battle to fight allegations that another product, its glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup, causes cancer. Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) denies the claims.
The company said it is halting work on a new dicamba plant in Luling, Louisiana, because global overcapacity for producing the chemical made the investment less attractive. Instead, Bayer will continue to buy dicamba and produce its XtendiMax herbicide at another plant in Iowa, according to a statement.
""Stopping construction enables us to preserve cash and prioritize our investments in new innovation for farmers,"" Bayer said.
A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on June 3 that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency substantially understated the risks related to the use of dicamba, which is sprayed on soybeans and cotton that Bayer genetically engineered to resist the chemical. The herbicides are known to drift away and damage other crops that are not resistant.
The EPA subsequently said farmers can use existing supplies of dicamba-based herbicides, which are also sold by rivals BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) and  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc, until July 31.
""While the timing of the court's ruling is coincidental and unfortunate, it was not a factor in our reassessment of the Luling plant,"" Bayer said, adding that it still supports dicamba.

 Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which Bayer bought for $63 billion two years ago, in 2015 announced preliminary plans to spend more than $1 billion over the next three to five years at its Luling site to produce dicamba. Bayer also inherited the legal dispute over glyphosate from the takeover.

Tesla and Panasonic have been reported to be in talks to expand the battery joint venture's capacity.
Panasonic hinted in May that it was working to develop new batteries with Tesla, possibly with higher capacity.
Tesla said the deal, signed last week and effective April 1, 2020, sets the terms for production capacity commitments by Panasonic and purchase volume commitments by Tesla over the first two years of the agreement.
Tesla also amended the general terms and conditions of its partnership with Panasonic, modifying the term to expire 10 years after Panasonic achieves certain manufacturing milestones.
Panasonic is no longer Tesla's exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla's electric cars soar.

Last month, Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","South African Airways rescue would be costly, plan shows","By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African government would need to find at least 10 billion rand ($580 million) in new bailout funds if it wants to rescue South African Airways (SAA) with most of its routes intact, a long-delayed rescue plan showed.
State-owned SAA's longstanding frailties have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed even previously profitable airlines into financial distress. 
SAA suspended commercial passenger flights in March, when the government imposed one of Africa's strictest coronavirus lockdowns.
Rescue efforts have been the subject of fierce wrangling between the government, which wants SAA retained as a national asset, and the administrators who took over the airline in December after almost a decade of financial losses.
The administrators' restructuring plan on Tuesday proposed the government fund or raise funding for a working capital injection of around 2.8 billion rand, 2.2 billion rand for layoffs, 3 billion rand for unflown tickets, 600 million rand for general concurrent creditors and 1.7 billion rand for lessors.
The Public Enterprises Ministry said in a statement that it would assess the plan and that it wanted to see ""a competitive, viable and sustainable national airline"". The Finance Ministry, which has authority over funding, did not respond to a request for comment on a public holiday.
The funding envisioned under the restructuring plan is on top of the 16.4 billion rand the government already set aside to repay SAA's guaranteed debt and debt-service costs, as well as the cost of supporting the restructured SAA until it becomes profitable.
A projected income statement showed SAA making losses of more than 6 billion rand over the next three years.
The plan was based on SAA keeping almost all its African destinations, three of four domestic routes and roughly half its intercontinental destinations.
It envisages drastically scaling back the airline's staff and fleet. Until the end of August, while many travel restrictions are expected to remain in place, SAA would need only some 1,000 staff and six planes, compared with roughly 5,000 staff and 44 planes when it entered administration. 
It would ramp up operations slowly, with staff numbers rising to 2,900 and a fleet of 26 planes. Such a dramatic staff reduction could lead to a confrontation with trade unions.
The administrators said they need the government's support and a commitment on funding by July 15.

Social distancing on planes, along with other safety measures, are helping airlines to restore confidence in air travel after the coronavirus outbreak.
Southwest also said customers would be allowed to pick their seat, and the airline will not block or direct seating.
Other U.S. carriers have been following similar moves to maintain social distancing norms in the air.
Bigger rival Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) earlier this month said it planned to limit seating capacity on its flights through September, block the selection of middle seats and put a cap on seating in every cabin.
JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) has also extended social distancing measures on its flight through early July.

While middle-seat policies differ for major U.S. airlines, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings. Passengers who refuse to wear masks could have their flying privileges revoked under tougher enforcement policies imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors who lived through this year's historic market sell-off only to see stocks bounce higher say they are most frightened of another drop and have become more wary of alternatives like hedge funds, a new report released on Tuesday shows.
Nearly one third of investors or 31% listed a market downturn as their biggest concern in May, up from 27% in January, according to a survey conducted by human resources consulting firm Mercer and conference organizer Context Summits. 
The groups polled investors in January and again in May after the U.S. economy was largely shut down to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, sending unemployment to historic highs and leading economists to forecast a deep recession ahead.
Respondents cooled on hedge funds, with only 52% saying they are optimistic about the asset class in 2020, compared with 64% who called themselves optimistic last year and 70% who were optimistic in 2018. Hedge funds on average gained 11% last year and lost 5% in the first five months of 2020, data from Hedge Fund Research show. 
In May, 13% investors said they were ""very optimistic"" about hedge funds, up from 7% in January. At the same time, 15% said they were either ""pessimistic"" or ""very pessimistic"", roughly double the 8% that listed themselves in those categories in January.
Investors are paying more attention to environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) with those viewing it as ""extremely favorable"" registering at 12% in 2020, up from 9% in 2019. The ""extreme negative"" sentiment shrunk to 34% in 2020, down from 42% last year.
""Allocators hold increasingly diverging views on public markets due to the COVID-19 crisis, with many seeing opportunities in certain sectors such as e-commerce and transformational technologies, as well as emerging market and credit investments,"" said Gregg Sommer, a partner at Mercer.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) expects to book a charge to earnings of up to $1.4 billion for an accelerated restructuring and new job cuts, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said at a energy conference on Tuesday.
Le Peuch said the restructuring will include cuts in the company's product lines and focus the company's operations on five key oil basins. It is expected to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs.
The restructuring comes as oil prices have collapsed to under $40 a barrel as the COVID-19 pandemic hurt fuel demand. Le Peuch, who was appointed CEO a year ago, was already reshaping Schlumberger before the pandemic by side-lining hydraulic fracturing equipment and beefing up its focus on technology. 
Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Energy, Power and Renewables conference Le Peuch told investors the decline in oilfield activity had been ""sharper than expected"", especially in U.S. land operations, which saw a drop-off of around 60%. 
One-time charges associated with the restructuring and headcount reductions will be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. There may be additional costs incurred from a ""rationalization"" of the company's assets, the CEO said.
Le Peuch also outlined to investors plans for its New Energy group, which will focus on marketing low-carbon or carbon-neutral technology. That group has begun working with startup Celsius Energy in France to develop geothermal as a building heating and cooling source, and is launching a second venture, called Genvia, to produce hydrogen fuel from water. 
He also emphasized the growing importance of digital technology, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The recent crisis accelerated customer acceptance of remote drilling operations,"" he said, noting that Schlumberger had seen a 30% increase in that area over the first quarter. 
The company was able to reduce headcount by 25% when operating remotely, and will reach a 50% reduction on some wellsites, he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric pleaded guilty on Tuesday to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in Northern California touched off by the utility company's power lines.
The guilty plea, part of an agreement with prosecutors in Butte County, is intended to end all criminal proceedings against PG&E from the Camp Fire, which broke out on Nov. 8, 2018, and destroyed much of the town of Paradise.
Bill Johnson, the company's chief executive officer, entered the plea during a hearing in Butte County Superior Court.
""I am here today on behalf of the 23,000 men and women of PG&E, to accept responsibility for the fire here that took so many lives and changed these communities forever,"" Johnson said in a written statement.
The Camp Fire killed at least 84 people and destroyed some 18,000 buildings. It is considered the most destructive wildfire in California history. 
PG&E's plea deal was reached in March, ending a major roadblock for the utility to emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It came after the utility accepted tighter oversight and pledged billions of dollars to improve safety and help wildfire victims under an agreement with California Governor Gavin Newsom. 
Under the agreement, PG&E would pay a maximum $3.5 million fine plus $500,000 in costs, and up to $15 million to provide water to residents after the fire destroyed the utility’s Miocene Canal.
Some fire victims are expected to receive payouts under PG&E’s bankruptcy reorganization plan.
PG&E and its utility unit filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing more than $30 billion in potential liabilities from California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. 
The company previously reached $25.5 billion of settlements related to wildfires in 2015, 2017 and 2018, including $13.5 billion for victims and $12 billion for insurers, cities, counties and other public entities. 

Under the settlement with Newsom, PG&E agreed to pay no shareholder dividends for three years, saving about $4 billion, and pursue a “rate-neutral” $7.5 billion financing package that would benefit rate payers.

Hopes of an effective coronavirus treatment were given a boost, meanwhile, after researchers in the U.K. released clinical data showing that steroid, Dexamethasone, had reduced deaths among the sickest Covid-19 patients.  Dexamethasone reduced the death rate of patients on a ventilator by 35%, and by 20% for patients who needed oxygen but were not ventilated, according to the study.

The sale is the most significant attempt by a Greek bank to clean up its balance sheet since the coronavirus crisis forced lenders to put transaction plans on hold. 
If successful, the deal could revive disposals of non-performing loans (NPLs) across Southern Europe where Greek and Italian lenders have sought bidders for billions of euros of bad debts.
Alpha aims to sign a deal by the end of the year, the first source said. The process is expected to gain momentum after the summer and close in the fourth quarter.
National Bank of Greece (AT:NBGr) is likely to follow suit with the sale of its Frontier portfolio while Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) is preparing two NPL securitisations totalling 7 billion euros, the sources said.
A source close to Piraeus said the bank planned to take advantage of the government's Hercules bad debt reduction scheme to smooth the sale of two portfolios, known as project Vega and project Phoenix, with loans worth 5 billion and 2 billion euros, respectively.

Alpha Bank is looking to apply this year for the Hercules scheme, which provides state guarantees on the senior tranches of the securitisation, after finalising the Galaxy disposal, the first source said.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>",Appeals court sides with exchanges in U.S. SEC fee row,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot force stock exchanges to conduct a costly experiment to see how the fees they charge and the incentives they offer affect brokers' trading habits.
The SEC's ""Transaction Fee Pilot"" aimed to shed light on how lucrative rebate payments from exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influence the brokers' behavior.
Critics of the practice, including institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars, said the payments create conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to send customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest rebates rather than to those that would get the best results for their end clients.
Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) Inc sued the SEC over the plan, arguing that rebates are needed to compensate brokers for providing liquidity and that the SEC has not shown they harm the market. 
Eliminating rebates would also lead to wider bid-ask spreads, making it more costly to trade, they said.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plan ""clearly exceeded the SEC's authority under the Exchange Act."" 
""The Pilot Program emanates from an aimless 'one-off' regulation, i.e., a rule that imposes significant, costly, and disparate regulatory requirements on affected parties merely to allow the Commission to collect data to determine whether there might be a problem worthy of regulation,"" the court said.
The pilot program, which was recommended by an SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as the U.S. Treasury, would have tested banning rebates for certain stocks and lowering exchange transaction fees for others.

""We accept the decision of the D.C. Circuit and appreciate the guidance it provides,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.

Investing.com - Wall Street gave up some gains Tuesday, but remained supported as investors cheered signs the economic recovery is underway even as Covid-19 infections in some parts of the U.S. continued to climb.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.52%, or 649 points, the S&P 500 gained 2.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2%.
Retail sales surged 17.7% in May, rebounding from a record slump in April. The better-than-expected data suggested that consumer spending is on the mend, though some on Wall Street remain wary over whether the momentum would continue.
""The comeback was much faster than expected, and looks like a beginning of a v-shaped recovery in consumer spending. That's assuming the positive momentum is sustained, something we remain skeptical about,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Retailers including Macy’s (NYSE:M), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) surged on the back of the strong retail sales report.
Monetary policy was also in focus as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell cooled some hopes that the central bank's corporate bond-buying program, which kicked off today, would be aggressive.
Powell also touted signs of a recovery, though continued to stress that the outlook remains uncertain amid a lack of visibility about the trajectory of the disease. ""Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.""
The remarks from Powell come in the wake of growing infections in some parts of the U.S. after restrictions were lifted.
Virus hospitalizations in Texas rose 8.3% overnight to hit a record. Florida’s Department of Health on Tuesday reported that daily infections rose 2,783 overnight to a record high in the state.
Energy led the broader market gains, underpinned by a rise in oil prices after the International Energy Agency lifted its oil demand forecast for 2020.  
The IEA upgraded its estimate on oil demand to 91.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020, 500,000 bpd higher than its previous forecast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers and policymakers should be wary of China's moves to target vulnerable U.S. assets and expand its market share in the wake of the global economic crisis triggered by the novel coronavirus, according to a study prepared for a U.S. trade group and released on Tuesday.
The Horizon Advisory report for the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) said the Chinese Communist Party viewed the crisis as ""a chance to expand its position in U.S. markets, supply chains and critical infrastructure.""
The consultancy said Beijing used the 2008-2009 global financial crisis to accelerate its ""Go Out"" industrial offensive in the United States, and was positioning to benefit from a likely spike in U.S. infrastructure spending.
""It's a very sophisticated strategy,"" AAM President Scott Paul said in an interview. ""There's a very legitimate debate that needs to occur about the appropriate role of Beijing in the U.S. economy, and there are reasons to be wary of including Chinese state-owned enterprises in our recovery effort.""
Paul said his lobby group was working with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to strengthen and expand provisions that earmark government funds for U.S. companies, and ensure they do not wind up in the hands of Chinese state-owned firms or investors.
The group was formed in 2007 by U.S. companies and the United Steelworkers to push for policies to expand U.S. manufacturing.
U.S. President Donald Trump has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas, but the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a government-wide push to move U.S. production and supply chain dependency away from China.
Paul said the report showed China had identified ""friendly"" public officials and states including Kentucky, home of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, which has attracted increased Chinese investment in recent years.

Chinese acquisitions have come under greater U.S. scrutiny to determine their effect on national security, but takeovers could increase if the crisis left many distressed assets, as expected, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Six asset managers including M&G (L:MNG) and  Legal & General  (L:LGEN) said they were keeping property funds totalling more than $7.5 billion in assets frozen as valuers continue to struggle to assess real estate due to the coronavirus crisis.
M&G froze its $3.2 billion UK Property Portfolio in December, as uncertainty over Brexit and weakness in Britain's retail commercial property sector prompted redemption requests.
Most other UK property funds also halted redemptions in March, as valuers said there was ""material uncertainty"" about property values at the end of the first quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic.
As the second quarter draws to a close, M&G said its valuers were still applying a material uncertainty clause due to the lack of property deals. However, it said its clause did not apply to the industrial and logistics property sectors where there had been transactions.
Legal & General said there was no change to the lock-up of its 2.9 billion pound ($3.7 billion) fund.
 Standard Life  (L:SLA) said two funds totalling about 500 million pounds remained frozen due to valuation difficulties, while  Aviva  (L:AV), Columbia Threadneedle and Janus Henderson (N:JHG) said the material uncertainty clause still applied to their 120 million, one billion and 500 million pound funds respectively.
The funds are expected to remain frozen till at least September due to the valuation challenges, and some of those which usually offer daily redemptions may need to change structure to survive, industry sources say.
The M&G fund has 181 million pounds in real estate assets under offer or for sale and the sale of all of the asset would bring cash levels up to 16.1%, M&G said in a statement.
""Reopening the fund for dealing will depend on cash levels but will also be contingent on the material uncertainty clause being lifted,"" it said.

Other frozen property funds include those managed by Kames and Royal London. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Air Canada  (TO:AC) is seeing improved domestic bookings, but expects international flights to only pick up if governments relax travel restrictions introduced to curb the spread of coronavirus, the airline's chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 
""I think you’re seeing across the industry improvements in bookings and certainly at Air Canada we're seeing that as well,"" CFO Michael Rousseau told a National Bank event for analysts and investors. ""But that's focused primarily on domestic business, point to point within Canada.""
Canada's largest carrier, along with tourism groups, have asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government to relax restrictions, like requirements for a 14-day quarantine.
Trudeau said on Tuesday, the non-essential travel ban between Canada and the United States has been extended to July 21, confirming a Reuters story from last week.
Rousseau says he expects it will take at least three years to return to 2019 traffic levels before the pandemic even as the carrier accelerates retirements of older E190s, B767s and A319s. 
Nevertheless, he sees green shoots among domestic leisure flights, which are coming back first. He hopes business travel returns after the summer as corporate clients return to their offices.
Air Canada shares were up 4.2% by the afternoon, while the benchmark Canadian share index was up 1.2%.
Rousseau said the desire to meet clients face-to-face, combined with Air Canada's loyalty program, will help drive demand for business travel, despite companies' current practice of working from home.
Asked about United Airlines (O:UAL) pledging its frequent flyer program for a new loan to buffer its liquidity, and whether such an option would be available to Air Canada, Rousseau said he thinks any airline is going to keep ""every door open.""

Rousseau declined to comment on its planned C$720 million ($532.39 million) purchase of tour operator Transat AT (TO:TRZ), which is awaiting regulatory approval in Canada and Europe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve's planned launch on Tuesday of a bond-buying facility could help ease the potential stigma for companies of asking for help and create an important framework for what the central bank steps in to purchase, analysts and investors said. 
The Federal Reserve said that, starting Tuesday, it would buy corporate bonds directly through its secondary market corporate credit facility (SMCCF), one of several emergency programs recently instituted by the central bank to improve market functioning in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
""They are creating a plan, a framework for what they're going to do,"" said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds for Janus Henderson. ""I'd be more concerned if they didn't have a framework and they just started buying bonds blindly."" 
The Fed's pledged backstop of corporate bonds has allowed companies to continue borrowing money from credit markets despite the toll of the coronavirus on corporate earnings. 
The Fed will buy a portfolio of individual bonds in an index that replicates the broad credit market, focused primarily on high-quality names. The program, which also included buying exchange-traded funds, had previously been announced but required companies to apply for direct bond purchases. On Monday, the Fed removed the need for that certification. 
Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said eliminating the need for an application was critical. ""Most don't want to be seen as asking the Fed for help, unless things go really wrong. So the change eliminates an important hurdle,"" Markowska said.
The change comes after markets were roiled last week following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's bleak outlook on the U.S. economy and fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections.
John Roberts, U.S. rates strategist at NatWest Markets, said it will now ""presumably not be discernible which corporates certified for the program and which did not,"" removing a potential stigma. 
The Fed declined to comment.
The Fed has also pledged to buy corporate bonds directly from issuers through its Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which has yet to launch. 
According to Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), there are 8,181 investment-grade issues eligible for inclusion in a high-grade U.S. corporate bond index.
The announcement sent the credit market soaring on Monday, with the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond index (P:LQD) hitting an all-time high of $134.83. U.S. stocks also rallied on the news. On Tuesday morning, the iShares iBoxx investment grade ETF hit a fresh all-time high of $134.9, while the iShares iBoxx high yield ETF (P:HYG) rose as high as $84.33, last at $83.47.
Creating its own index also allows the Fed to avoid potential issues with buying ETFs. The central bank has bought modest portions of ETFs under the aegis of the SMCCF in recent weeks, which has driven the products to trade at a premium to the value of their underlying bonds. 

Supporting the market through the Fed's own index ""gives them a straighter shot to buy, to buy in size and to not be accused of overpaying,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist and head of global bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Fines, short jail terms for four ex-ICBC Spain employees in laundering case","By Jesús Aguado and Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - Four ex-employees and executives of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Madrid branch reached a plea deal with Spanish prosecutors in a money-laundering case and accepted prison terms of between three and five months.
The prosecutor's office said on Tuesday the accused also agreed to pay a fine totaling 22.7 million euros ($25.55 million) as part of the deal to settle the case.
In 2016 Spain's judiciary began investigating the European management of ICBC (SS:601398) as part of an inquiry into the alleged laundering of hundreds of millions of euros through the Madrid branch of the Chinese banking giant.
""The defendants have accepted the qualification (of the crime as money-laundering) and the sentences, which has allowed the prosecutor and the defence to ask the Court to ratify the agreement in a verdict,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. Without naming the accused, it said that Spain's High Court held a hearing on the case on Monday. 
A spokesman for the court said that the judge would have to ratify the agreement, which was considered a formality.
Under Spanish law, a prison sentence of less than two years does not usually lead to serving any time behind bars unless there are previous criminal records.
In 2017 a Reuters investigation, based on confidential case submissions and interviews with investigators and former ICBC employees, showed how a long-running Spanish inquest into alleged Chinese organised crime networks eventually led police to raid ICBC's Madrid branch in early 2016.
Spanish judicial officials told Reuters that between 2011 and 2013, ICBC's Madrid branch transferred about 225 million euros (£202.98 million) to China, most of it for suspected criminal networks. 

ICBC said at the time that it was a ""law-abiding company"" and cooperating with Spanish authorities.

1564,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Beyond the Surge in Retail Sales Lurks a Growing Consumer Divide,"(Bloomberg) -- Despite the unexpected jump in U.S. retail sales in May, the pandemic is changing consumer behavior in a way that threatens to widen the inequality gap, according to a report this month from the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute.
The institute’s analysis -- which relies on about 450 million monthly credit card transactions made by a rolling sample of 11 million customer accounts -- showed that Covid-19-related lockdowns increased consumer spending at non-local retailers.
“This is good news for consumers, who can get a larger variety of goods and services at lower cost,” said Marvin Ward Jr., the institute’s local commerce research lead. “However, it’s most likely to benefit those with higher-incomes, and local retail remains a lifeline for lower-income consumers.”
In May, national retail sales soared 17.7% from the prior month, the biggest jump on record and double forecasts. That followed a 14.7% drop in April, the largest monthly decline in nearly three decades of record-keeping, and an 8.3% decline in March, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday.
Thousands of stores and restaurants reopened after lock-downs were lifted last month. Federal stimulus checks and tax refunds fueled a burst of spending.
Sales at clothing stores, gas stations, restaurants and bars were off from the comparable month a year ago. Meanwhile, online sales now take in more than 1 in every 6 dollars spent as dollars leave local economies.
“The longevity of these spending changes associated with the Covid-19 pandemic will determine how different communities and consumers fare in the new retail landscape,” said Ward. “The economic hardship we are currently experiencing will likely have a long tail because so many people have lost their jobs and so many businesses will not survive the fallout of the past few months.”

1566,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Saudi Oil Exports to U.S. Plunge Toward Lowest Level in 35 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- After flooding the U.S. with crude earlier this year, Saudi Arabia has all but cut off the taps to the American oil market.
The kingdom has exported just one cargo to the U.S. so far in June, equivalent to about 133,000 barrels a day, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s about one-tenth of the 1.3 million barrels a day it shipped in April, when Riyadh flooded the global market during a brief price war against Russia.
If the low pace of exports is sustained in the second half of the month, U.S. imports of Saudi crude could drop to the lowest level in 35 years, helping the American crude market re-balance, according to traders and analysts.
“Saudi oil arrivals will fall just as domestic refiners will start raising runs and domestic production continues to decline,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. “U.S. refiners will have to import from elsewhere and run down stocks,” she added.
To be sure, several Saudi tankers haven’t yet indicated their final destinations, so the final tally into the U.S. could be a tad higher. Yet, the trend so far in June is unmistakable: the deluge of Saudi oil that threatened to overwhelm American refiners is dwindling. The April flood prompted U.S. politicians to complain loudly, with Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, tweeting in late April: “My message to the Saudis: TURN THE TANKERS THE HELL AROUND.”
Saudi oil industry officials, speaking privately, say the kingdom is unlikely to boost shipments into the U.S. in the second half of the month and into July. By slashing U.S. crude exports, the Saudis can influence the most highly visible oil market in the world as American customs data allow for near real-time monitoring of shipments. Less Saudi petroleum is likely to reduce the closely watched American crude stockpiles, amplifying the price impact.
April Flood
The recent inundation of Saudi crude in the U.S. is largely the lingering effect of a price war earlier this year. For much of 2019 and early 2020, Saudi Arabia shipped relatively little crude into America, with average arrivals running at about 475,000 barrels a day, according to U.S. government data. But that changed in April, when Riyadh opened the taps after failing to reach an agreement with its OPEC+ partners to cut production.
Saudi crude takes about 45 days to reach the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. West Coast, so the impact of the April export flood wasn’t felt until late May and early June, when U.S. imports of Saudi crude jumped to about 1.5 million barrels a day. As the Saudi tankers unloaded their cargo, U.S. crude stocks climbed to a record high, putting pressure on oil benchmarks.
In early April, once the devastation wrought by the coronavirus on oil demand became evident, the OPEC+ alliance set aside its differences, embarking on record output cuts. Riyadh cut oil shipments to the U.S. to 645,000 barrels a day in May, tanker-tracking data show. That drop would become apparent in the second half of June and early July as the vessels arrive on U.S. coasts.
The further export drop in the first half of June would become apparent in the second half of July. As of June 10, the U.S. had received almost 10 million barrels of Saudi crude, compared with 16.9 million barrels for all of June last year, according to U.S. Customs data compiled by Bloomberg and figures from the Energy Information Administration.
In addition to slashing U.S. shipments, the kingdom this month has curbed exports to China to about 1.3 million barrels a day through June 15, compared with almost 2 million on average in May. Exports to India and Japan have increased so far this month, however.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",SUVs more deadly to pedestrians than cars: U.S. insurance study,"(Reuters) - SUVs are more likely than passenger cars to injure or kill pedestrians, according to a new U.S. insurance industry study which recommended design changes to improve safety.
Sport utility vehicles ""seem to be more deadly to pedestrians than cars are,"" said Sam Monfort, lead author of a study released Tuesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
In a crash with a traditional SUV, ""the grille strikes the pedestrian's pelvis or chest,"" transferring more energy to the pedestrian's body, said the study of 79 crashes in three Michigan cities which did not address vehicle handling.
""More research will be required to see whether all of the findings hold up in a larger study,"" the industry-funded group said, noting the relatively small sample size.
Truck-based SUVs and car-based crossover utility vehicles (CUVs) are generally larger and heavier than passenger cars, stand taller with blunter front ends, and are increasing in number and share of total vehicles on North American roads.
In the study, SUVs caused more serious injuries than cars in impacts at speeds greater than 19 miles per hour, with a higher percentage of fatalities.
Annual U.S. production of SUVs has remained relatively constant over the past 10 years, at about 1 million, according to AutoForecast Solutions. But crossover vehicle production has tripled over the same period, to more than 6 million in 2019, AFS said.

""CUVs and SUVs sit higher"" than passenger cars, and have a higher center of gravity, ""which can make handling less stable than in a traditional sedan,"" said Sam Fiorani, AFS vice president, he said by email.

Milan prosecutors had already asked a judge to drop the case against the three men, saying they had followed the regulators' accounting guidelines. However, the judge had rejected the request and sent them to trial in April 2018.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",European airlines face longer haul to recovery,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - A patchwork of national restrictions and a reluctance among travellers to cross borders mean European airlines face a bumpier return to the skies from coronavirus lockdowns than U.S. and Asian rivals. 
After almost three months of bleeding cash as air travel was brought to a virtual halt, airlines are returning to service or announcing more flights. 
But while U.S. and Chinese domestic markets are starting to recover, the prospects in Europe look shakier. 
""In comparison to every other part of the world, it's lagging,"" aviation analyst John Grant said of Europe during a recent presentation by industry data and analytics firm OAG.
Wariness of foreign travel weighs more heavily on European airlines, whose domestic markets are smaller and less profitable than U.S. and Asian rivals', and more exposed to rail and road competition.
They must also contend with a variety of European restrictions, including Britain's 14-day quarantine, which has prolonged the slump on contested health grounds.
That contrasts with larger unified markets in Asia and the Americas. In Brazil and India, domestic operations are picking up despite COVID-19 rates still growing faster than Europe's.
Even shorter European trips put you in ""a different country, with a different language and where you don't know how the health system works,"" said Joao Pita, head of airline business at Sao Paulo's Guarulhos airport. ""That's different from domestic Brazil or domestic China.""
EasyJet (L:EZJ) and Lufthansa-owned (DE:LHAG) Brussels Airlines restarted operations this week as European internal borders reopened. Others including Air France (PA:AIRF), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) are increasing frequencies.
""We're focusing on the performance of the flights and to make sure that we have flights where the Belgians want to fly,"" Brussels Airlines CEO Dieter Vranckx said.
The problem is, many Belgians don't want to fly anywhere much.
Among the 63% of Belgians still planning a 2020 holiday, the new top destination is Belgium, according to a survey reported by travel newsletter Pagtour. Runners-up France and the Netherlands are accessible by road or rail.
CANCELLED FLIGHTS
Despite the pared-down food service and mandatory masks on board, avoiding planes may not be the main concern.
Consumers in France are more interested in flying nine hours to the country's Caribbean territory of Martinique than in a short hop to Spain or Italy, according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search data described to Reuters by an airline sales manager.
""Their thinking goes, 'At least if I'm in a French overseas territory the government will have some obligation to look after me. I can turn up to a hospital and be served as if I'm in Paris,'"" the manager said.
That spells bad news for all but a handful of European departures operated by the likes of Air Caraibes or Air France.
For European carriers forecast to lose $21.5 billion this year, a return to service promises no swift return to profit, with many flights expected to run below two-thirds full. The hope is to burn less cash in the air than on the ground.
The European sector is on course for a negative 14.3% return on invested capital this year, compared with projected deficits of 12.7% for Asia and 10.5% for North America, according to global airline body IATA.
Behind the relaunch publicity, airlines are still making schedule cuts that go deeper in Europe, experts say. Undersold flights are cancelled at least two weeks before departure, when passengers gain compensation rights.
Global schedules for this week have been reduced by 28.5 million seats to 40 million since late May, according to OAG. Western European capacity was slashed from 17.8 million seats to 3.9 million as rebound hopes receded.
""We're keen to publish capacity because our messaging to the market is that none of us are blinking,"" said one executive at a major European airline.
""We don't want rivals to think they can add more capacity in our key markets,"" he added. ""Everyone's playing that game at the moment - then we cancel if we see very poor bookings.""
Competitive pressure on fares may bring more pain as pent-up demand for travel thwarted by lockdowns is exhausted. Ryanair (I:RYA) CEO Michael O'Leary expects a price war, and many analysts agree.
Fares for July-September are down 7% year-on-year from Britain, 8% from France, 10% from Italy and 12% from Germany, according to Airbus-owned (PA:AIR) Skytra, which offers pricing data and risk management to airlines.

""Countries that are further along with the lifting of restrictions actually have the cheaper pricing,"" the firm's strategy chief Matthew Tringham said. ""Probably because they're trying to stimulate demand.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's largest domestic airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), said on Tuesday in a regulatory filing that it will ""probably"" receive a warning from its independent auditors saying there is doubt whether the company will survive the coronavirus crisis. 
The so-called ""going concern"" warnings are used by independent auditors when, in their view, there is substantial risk that a company many not exist a year from now. 
Gol did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Gol rivals Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) and LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) have already received ""going concern"" warnings from their independent auditors. Avianca and LATAM, the region's two largest airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States last month. 
That auditors would say three of Latin America's top airlines run a significant risk of disappearing underscores how the coronavirus crisis has hit carriers in the region harder than anywhere else in the world.
To be sure, the region's airlines were already weaker than their peers before the crisis hit. But the United States and some European nations have moved to bail out their airlines while Latin American governments have been reluctant to do the same. 
Brazil's government has shown willingness to lend money, but airlines including Gol have balked at the conditions. Gol and state bank BNDES have been negotiating a loan for months now. 
Gol also said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that auditors had raised issues with ""the effectiveness"" of Gol's ""internal control over financial reporting,"" although it did not elaborate. 

Gol added it will not be able to file its 2019 annual report with the SEC for 15 days as it resolves these issues with its auditors.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Chile says copper miners complying with sanitary measures amid outbreak,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean regulator on Tuesday dismissed the concerns voiced by union workers that mining companies were failing to enforce sanitary measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus, calling mine adherence to the restrictions ""adequate.""
Unions had urged the government to re-assess the operating plans of the country´s sprawling mines on Sunday, citing an ""alarming"" increase in infections among workers.
But Chile´s Geology and Mining Service (Sernageomin) told Reuters in an emailed statement it had carried out 4,299 inspections at various mining sites throughout the world´s top copper producer since the outbreak began in mid-March.
""We have verified on the ground an adequate implementation by the industry and its workers of ... the respective protocols,"" the agency said in the statement.
Chile, unlike neighboring Peru, has yet to require mines to limit operations, even as the number of cases nationwide has soared. South America has in recent weeks become the epicenter of the global outbreak, with Peru, Chile and Brazil especially hard hit.
Chile has seen an explosive increase in infections since May, averaging more than 5,000 new cases daily. The country has now logged 180,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,300 deaths due to Covid-19.
Most mining companies in the country´s vast northern desert have nonetheless maintained operational continuity. Chile said in May its copper industry ranked among the least affected globally by the pandemic, anticipating just a 1% reduction in output.
International giants like the state-owned Codelco, BHP (AX:BHP),  Anglo American  (L:AAL),  Glencore  (L:GLEN),  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) and Freeport McMoRan (N:FCX) operate in Chile.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Moscow Exchange to offer U.S. blue chip trading by the end-August,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Moscow Exchange said it will offer access to shares from the U.S. S&P 500 index in the coming months in a break-through for its long-awaited project, which was slowed by Western sanctions.
Russia's largest bourse, which had planned to offer trading access to around 50 U.S. companies in the third quarter of 2018, is now ready to offer up to 30 stocks by the end of August, its stock department director Boris Blokhin said on Tuesday.
It will add more later this year, bringing the overall number to 50, Blokhin said, adding that the stocks will be traded on the Moscow Exchange in Russian roubles, while dividends will be paid in U.S. dollars.
Russia's central bank, which has previously said access to foreign stocks would deprived the country of investment capital, supported the project this time, Igor Marich, managing director of money and derivatives market at the Moscow Exchange, said.
The Saint Petersburg Exchange, Moscow's closest rival, began trading U.S. stocks in the S&P 500 index in 2014.
The Moscow Exchange also said it will extend trading hours for its 25 most liquid stocks from June 22, a service likely to see demand from both retail clients and foreign investors.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has slammed demand for trucks, forcing Volvo and its rivals to cut costs, with

""The corona epidemic and the global measures taken to fight it has led to a market situation impacting our industry severely,"" Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt said in a statement.
""The effects are expected to be lower demand going forward and we need to continue to adjust our organization accordingly."" 
Volvo said around 15% of the expected reductions were consultants, adding that about 1,250 positions were expected to be cut in Sweden.

The Gothenburg-based company, which employs some 104,000 staff, said late in April that net order intake of its trucks had dropped by 75% in March versus February and been net negative since then.

1594,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Surges at Open After Retail Sales Rebound,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened sharply higher on Tuesday after a big rebound in retail sales in May revived optimism in a rapid, 'V-shaped' recovery for the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The optimism was only slightly tempered by news that industrial production rebounded less in May from its collapse in April than economists had expected.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 761 points or 3.0% at 26,524 points, while the S&P 500 was up 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.3%.
Retail sales surged a record 17.7% in a month in which most states began to lift their lockdown measures, while core retail sales rose by an equally impressive 12.4%. Both figures were well ahead of consensus forecasts, albeit sales were still over 8% below pre-pandemic levels, Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco said via Twitter.
U.S. factories were less buoyant than consumers in May, however, with industrial production rising only 1.4% instead of the 2.9% expected. Moreover, data for April were revised lower to show an even sharper decline in industrial and manufacturing production than first thought. 
That wasn't enough to scare off buyers who had already been encouraged by signs of fresh stimulus from the Federal Reserve on Monday. The Fed will start buying the bonds of individual companies, fleshing out its support for the corporate credit market that it had outlined in March. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to start his semi-annual Congressional testimony at 10 AM ET.
Pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shone with a 12% increase on the back of clinical trial data suggesting its breast cancer drug could find broader applications.
Cyclical and travel stocks again received most of the uplift from the data. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock rose 8.6% and rival Carnival's (NYSE:CCL) stock rose 8.4%. Both companies recently undertook capital increases to stave off short-term debt concerns. Airline stocks were also back in fashion, with Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) stock rising 8.9%, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rising 6.5% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) rising 6.3%. 
Tech stocks, which have kept their valuations better than old-economy stocks during the pandemic, also rose, though not as sharply. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 1.7% to within touching distance of a new all-time high, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.8%, shrugging off news of two new EU antitrust investigations against it.  
Oil and gas stocks also rose on hopes that the recovery will be strong enough to underpin a sustained rebound in U.S. demand. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 9.1%, while U.S. Crude futures rose 5.0% to $38.97 after the International Energy Agency raised its demand forecasts for 2020 and 2021.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",More senior executives leave Embraer as dust settles over failed Boeing deal,"By Marcelo Rochabrun, Allison Lampert and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Four senior executives are leaving Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), in addition to its commercial aviation chief, in the wake of a failed deal with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and as a new chief executive reassess the jet maker's path forward, three sources said. 
The executives include Nelson Salgado, current Chief Operations Officer who previously worked as Chief Financial Officer and has worked at Embraer for more than 30 years. 
Also out is Antonio Campello, who headed the company's innovation arm known as EmbraerX, whose best-known project is a vertical take-off and landing vehicle being developed in cooperation with Uber (N:UBER). 
The aircraft project is personally supported by Embraer's CEO Francisco Gomes Neto, who considers it a high-risk, high-reward project. 
Embraer named Gomes Neto, an outsider, as CEO last year, when it seemed like a done deal that the planemaker would sell its commercial aviation unit to Boeing for $4.2 billion and refocus its business on smaller executive jets and defense. 
Instead, Gomes Neto had to scramble to find a plan B for the company when the Boeing deal collapsed in April. Two sources said the departures were part of Gomes Neto's effort to chart a future without Boeing. 
Gomes Neto has also cut down capital spending to minimum levels due to the coronavirus crisis. 
Embraer said on Monday that John Slattery, who was one of the company's most visible faces and headed the commercial aviation unit, was leaving the company for a bigger job to head engine-maker GE Aviation (N:GE). 
Slattery had championed the Boeing-Embraer deal and was ready to become a senior Boeing executive as head of the Embraer partnership. 
Two other executives who were supposed to join Boeing once the deal closed, Helio Bambini and Mauro Kern, respectively vice presidents for operations and engineering, are also now slated to leave Embraer, the three sources said. 
Embraer confirmed in a statement that it was undertaking ""organizational changes"" including ""consolidating"" vice presidents in engineering and strategy and leadership shifts in operations and EmbraerX, without specifying names.
It said the personnel changes would be effective as of the end of June and that they would not affect an agreement for a $600-million loan partly backed by Brazil's government that requires that the planemaker not reduce its workforce levels. The loan agreement was announced on Monday.

""I'm convinced that we have many opportunities to make Embraer a more agile organization, as well as more simple and competitive, making it more efficient in all areas,"" Gomes Neto said in a statement.

OSLO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and SAS (ST:SAS) are adding more flights to their schedules from July onwards as demand begins to recover following the COVID-19 pandemic, the two Nordic carriers said on Tuesday.
SAS will use 40 of its aircraft in July, up from 30 in June, as it adds flights from the Nordics to Spain, Italy and Portugal among others. That is still only around 30% of last year's level. 
""As restrictions and inbound travel rules are relaxed, we are seeing a rise in demand for travel,"" SAS said in a statement.
Norwegian will resume flights between Copenhagen and the Danish city of Aalborg from July 1, making it the airline's first route outside Norway since the lockdown began.
""Norwegian has for several years been the market leader on this route,"" the airline said as it announced it would fly three daily round trips between Denmark's largest and fourth largest cities.
""Many customers have wanted to know when these flights would resume,"" Norwegian said.
The budget airline is currently operating just seven aircraft on domestic routes in Norway and has furloughed or terminated the employment of some 7,300 staff, or about 90% of its staff, following the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Norwegian completed a financial restructuring last month, handing control of the firm to its creditors, and said at the time it could potentially wait until 2021 before resuming flights beyond Norway's borders.
The airline that brought Europe's low-cost business model to the transatlantic market has said it plans to reinvent itself in a scaled-down version with 110-120 aircraft, against almost 150 before the pandemic.

Rivals such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Ryanair (I:RYA) have also begun to ramp up their schedules.

The seven-day poll that ended on June 11 -- just as the S&P 500 had its worst drop since the March turmoil -- indicated that fund managers slashed their cash positions by the most since August 2009 to 4.7% in order to use their dry powder to chase the rally. With global equity benchmarks up more than 30% from this year’s lows, hedge funds increased their exposure to stocks to 52%, the highest level since 2018, the survey shows.
At the same time, only 18% of “moody bulls” expect a V-shaped, or sharp economic recovery compared with 64% who think it’ll be U- or W-shaped, or more gradual, according to BofA. A whopping 78% of surveyed investors, the largest number since 1998, believe the stock market is overvalued, with 53% calling it a bear market rally. As lockdowns ended in some major economies, investors raised their global growth bets but said they don’t expect global manufacturing to show expansion before October.
The survey “shows growth expectations jumping, cash levels collapsing, risk appetites surging,” strategists led by Michael Hartnett said in a note published on Tuesday. “Wall Street past ‘peak pessimism’; but June optimism fragile, neurotic, nowhere near dangerously bullish.”
The BofA poll comes at a time of elevated uncertainty for many market players after the S&P 500 Index plunged last week over concerns about the second wave of Covid-19 infections and worries that an economic recovery won’t be as fast as expected.
Among investors that deployed their cash, institutional money managers, such as pension funds, showed the biggest plunge in cash holdings, whereas retail or mutual funds still have cash to deploy, according to BofA.
June also brought an investor “dash to trash” with the buying of less popular and more risky equities, such as small-cap, value, euro-zone and emerging-market stocks, the strategists said. Allocation to euro-zone stocks surged to a net 7% overweight, the biggest increase of any region, while exposure to U.S. equities declined to a net 22% overweight, according to the poll.
BofA surveyed 190 fund managers with $560 billion in assets as part of the global poll.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health insurers may balk at covering tests that look for coronavirus antibodies in some cases, arguing that employers or the government should foot a bill expected to run into billions of dollars.
Health insurers have largely escaped the economic pain wrought by the pandemic. Their profits increased as many Americans delayed more routine and expensive medical care during the recent lockdown period, while the total cost of covering COVID-19 patients has been less than expected in many regions with low case numbers.
Now the industry is tallying up the potential cost of expanding both diagnostic and antibody testing, seen as a critically important component of safely reopening businesses across the country. Diagnostic tests determine if someone is currently infected and contagious, while the antibody, or serology, tests show whether someone was previously infected and possibly immune. 
Wall Street firm Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) & Co estimates a need for hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the next 18 months, accounting for about one-quarter of an anticipated $15 billion in U.S. COVID-19 test spending through the end of 2021.
In pushing back, health insurers draw lines between what they deem as medically necessary tests, and those done for research or return-to-work purposes.
Businesses may require repeat testing of employees, and they note that private health insurance covers only about half of Americans. The government needs to provide guidance on the role of insurers, employers and public health officials, insurers say.
""It is also critical that these strategies consider related funding in that context,” Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans said in a statement. AHIP estimates antibody testing will cost the United States as much as $19 billion a year.
The biggest national insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)'s Aetna (NYSE:AET) unit and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) have policies to cover the tests, which cost around $50, and related appointment fees, when doctors say they are medically necessary. Others, such as Blue Cross of Idaho, say they will not cover the tests to help determine the prevalence of the disease in a community, which officials see as necessary for controlling subsequent outbreaks. 
Doctors’ groups and diagnostics makers say broad serology testing is an important component of understanding COVID-19 and the level and length of immunity prior infection confers.
AdvaMedDX, a trade group that represents test makers including Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), expects about 94 million laboratory-based tests to be shipped by the end of June. It has sent letters to Blue Cross of Idaho and Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mississippi telling them their policies do not align with the law. Neither company responded to a request for comment.
“Clinicians really need at their disposal the full range of COVID-19 testing,” said Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDX.
The U.S. Congress passed legislation calling for health insurance coverage for COVID-19 testing to cope with a pandemic that has killed more than 115,000 people and infected over 2 million nationwide. The federal government set aside $26 billion at the beginning of May for coronavirus testing, much of which was earmarked for government health agencies, states and research and development.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since instructed Americans not to assume a positive antibody test means they are immune from future infection, and to continue physical distancing and use of masks until there is more evidence around immunity.
LIMITING USE
Covering only tests insurers see as medically necessary could limit them to people who either have symptoms of COVID-19 or been in close contact with someone who has. They may also cover testing for recovered COVID-19 patients who want to donate antibody-rich plasma for treatment of others or for children with a rare coronavirus-related complication. 
The uncertainty around coverage of tests for other purposes is slowing a return to business for Andrew Matta, who runs the North American Dental Group.
The group has 200 affiliated locations in about 15 states, including New York, Georgia and Texas, with more than 1 million patients. It is working with a physician’s group that orders both a diagnostic and serology test ahead of dental procedures. The patient then has a blood draw at the dentist's office, and returns three days later for the procedure.
Dental patients are starting to return with basic safety protocols in place, but Matta expects testing to help reassure customers more wary of coronavirus exposure.
Insurers have been noncommittal about whether they will cover the cost of that testing, or whether patients will end up being billed by the testing lab, he said.
“If we knew these would be covered for pre-procedures, we would be scaling it rapidly right now,” Matta said. 
Sabrina Corlette, a health policy professor at Georgetown University, had been advocating for private insurers to pay for these tests broadly. She now says there should be a separate government-run fund for testing to make sure patients – insured or uninsured - can easily get the tests they need.

“If people fear they are going to face hundreds of dollars in bills, they are not going to get tested,"" Corlette said, ""and it's a risk not just to them, but to everybody around them.”

1604,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher as Market Eyes More Fed Stimulus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, continuing Monday’s late bounce amid hopes U.S. authorities will continue to offer stimulus to support the economy.
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 39 points, or 1.3%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 115 points, or 1.2%. The Dow Futures contract rose 478 points, or 1.9%. 
The U.S. central bank said late Monday it will soon start purchasing individual corporate debt, in another effort to support the credit market as part of its emergency facilities introduced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
This helped Wall Street close higher, reversing hefty earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.6%, or 157 points, after falling more than 300 points at the open. The S&P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.4%.
Adding additional support Tuesday is a report that the Trump administration is preparing a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure proposal in order to support the world’s largest economy.
This news has outweighed worries of a second wave of the Covid-19 virus, with several states including Texas and California reporting a resurgence of new cases.
Focus will soon turn to Fed chair Jerome Powell as he  testifies in front of the Senate on his economic outlook and recent monetary policy decisions, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged near zero and said the central bank would do anything needed to support the economy as it struggles to recover from Covid-19 business shutdowns. 
Ahead of Powell’s appearance there will be the release of the April retail sales numbers, at 8:30 AM ET. These are expected to show a strong rebound, up 8%, after a decline of 16.4% in the prior month.
The retail sales data will be followed by industrial production and manufacturing output figures at 9:15 AM.
In corporate news, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is out with earnings after the market close. The tech giant is one of the first to report a full quarter that was nearly all consumed by Covid-19 business shutdowns.
Also in the spotlight is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). EU antitrust authorities have launched two probes into whether it violated competition laws through its Apple Pay service and its App Store for software that runs on its mobile devices.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the International Energy Agency's upward revision to its forecasts for global oil demand this year and next. The IEA still expects demand to contract on average by over 8 million barrels a day this year, however.
U.S. crude prices rose 1.6% to $37.70 a barrel, while Brent Futures climbed 1.7% to $40.40.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,736.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1319, down 0.1%.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Stocks are 'overvalued', but investors scream buy: BofA","By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A whopping 98% of investors surveyed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) believe markets are ""overvalued"" after world stocks bounced back from March lows at a record pace driven by government stimulus measures.
World stocks surged 38% from March's multi-year lows, fuelled by trillions of dollars in stimulus and gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdowns.
The euphoria led to investor cash levels dropping to 4.7% in June from 5.7% last month, the biggest monthly drop since August 2009, BofA's survey of 212 fund managers with $598 billion in assets under management showed.
The drawdown was also partly supported by easing worries about a longer economic hit -- a net 46% of participants in the survey expected a prolonged recession versus 93% in April.
BofA, however, said the recent optimism in markets was ""fragile"" as investors still see a second wave of novel coronavirus infections as the ""biggest tail risk"".
Indeed, stocks and oil briefly came under pressure on Monday after several districts of Beijing closed schools and ordered people to be tested after an unexpected rise in infections.
But those fears haven't stopped investors from joining the rally. The survey showed hedge fund net equity exposure jumping to 52% from 34%, the highest since September 2018.
A recent rally in value stocks, firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their share price, was driven by investors ""violently"" covering tactical short positions, BofA said.
U.S. tech and growth stocks remained the ""most crowded trade"" for a second straight month.

Cerberus did not spell out what those paths might be in the letter to the bank's supervisory board chairman dated Monday.
One possibility is for the investor to invoke an extraordinary general meeting and ask other shareholders to back its demand for ""substantial change"" in the bank's leadership. 
Commerzbank last week rebuffed Cerberus' demands for two seats on the bank's supervisory board. The letter to the supervisory board was Cerberus' response to that rejection.
""We stay committed to achieving substantial change to the leadership of Commerzbank and to the bank's operational and strategic paths for the benefit of all of Commerzbank's stakeholders,"" Cerberus said in the letter. 
In Europe's banking sector, shareholder disagreements usually remain behind closed doors. 
Commerzbank's shares have fallen about 60% since Cerberus bought a 5% stake in 2017, when it became the bank's second-largest shareholder after the German government. 
Commerzbank, which last year announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, is currently in the process of identifying more cost cuts and will announce plans when it releases second quarter earnings in August.
Cerberus said the supervisory board bore responsibility for the bank's ""dire situation"".
""Unfortunately, it is a matter of fact that Commerzbank has not yet embraced or executed on any of our suggested actions,"" Cerberus wrote. 

A spokeswoman for Commerzbank declined to comment.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Australia redeploys federal staff to manage wave of foreign investment,"By Scott Murdoch and Byron Kaye
HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is pulling staff out of federal departments to help its foreign investment regulator manage a deluge of work since announcing tougher policing of cross-border transactions in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Treasury department told Reuters.
The Australian Treasury department and Australian Taxation Office (ATO) supply the staff of the country's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which makes recommendations about whether to approve overseas buyouts of Australian interests.
Since the government ordered a shutdown of most public activity to contain the coronavirus in March, a host of Australian businesses have hired administrators or seen their shares tumble. That has led to more offers by foreign investors for troubled Australian assets.
The government has responded by removing most thresholds required to need FIRB approval, increasing the number of approvals required. Exactly how many more are needed is not clear.
""Treasury and the ATO have each redeployed internal staff or brought in additional staff to manage the workload associated with the substantial increase in applications since the zero dollar threshold was announced on 29 March 2020,"" a Treasury spokeswoman said in an email on Tuesday.
The spokeswoman did not say how many additional staff were being moved into FIRB. The oversight body was run by 55 Treasury staff and 67 ATO staff in 2019, according to its last annual report.
The changes to the threshold mean the waiting time for applications to be approved has slowed from an average of six weeks to at least eight to ten weeks, according to one corporate lawyer in Sydney.
The lawyer could not be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.
Under FIRB's new oversight regime, all foreign investors face greater scrutiny when bidding for sensitive assets, regardless of the size of the deal and whether the buyer is private or state-owned.
The Treasurer also gets the power to change or impose conditions on a deal or force a sale after the deal has been approved by FIRB.
The federal government said when it unveiled the changes that it would spend an additional A$50 million to enforce the rules, which are expected to take effect in 2021.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",Huawei CFO raises new argument to fight U.S. extradition in Canada court,"By Tessa Vikander and Karen Freifeld
VANCOUVER/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is raising a new argument in a Canadian court in a bid to fight extradition to the United States on bank fraud charges, court documents released on Monday showed.
Meng's lawyers claim the case that the United States submitted to Canada is ""so replete with intentional and reckless error"" that it violates her rights.
Meng, 48, was detained in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran.
Meng, the daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
The arrest has strained China's relations with both the United States and Canada.
A PowerPoint presentation that Meng gave to a HSBC banker in Hong Kong in 2013 has been cited as key evidence against her. 
In that presentation, Meng said that Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a firm that operated in Iran - was ""a business partner of Huawei,"" while the United States has described it as an unofficial subsidiary.
Meng's lawyers argued the prosecutors omitted key disclosures Meng made in the presentation regarding Huawei's ongoing business operations in Iran and that Skycom worked with Huawei in sales and service in Iran.
Without those disclosures, the lawyers said, the U.S. summary of the PowerPoint was ""materially misleading.""
Meng's lawyers also pointed out that the case said only ""junior"" HSBC employees knew of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. Meng's lawyers said it is implausible that HSBC senior management was unaware of the relationship, given Huawei was one of HSBC's biggest clients.
The lawyers also said that a $900 million credit facility that the United States said HSBC had extended to Huawei did not exist. Rather Huawei was in a $1.6 billion credit arrangement with 26 banks, and HSBC's total contribution was limited to $80 million, they argued. 
In addition, the lawyers said, the credit facility was never drawn on by Huawei and was canceled in June 2017.
Assistant Chief Justice Heather Holmes of British Columbia Supreme Court said in a case conference on Monday that she wanted to be fully apprised of the U.S. case before turning to Meng's claims that her rights were violated when she was arrested. 
A spokesman for U.S. prosecutors declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Canadian Justice minister declined to comment as the case remains before the courts.
""We are not a party to this case, so it is not appropriate for us to comment on any particular evidence,"" said HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman.

Last month, a Canadian judge allowed the extradition case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Societe Generale 's (PA:SOGN) Australian securities business faces restrictions on new customers if it does not comply with new licensing conditions related to client money laws, Australia's corporate regulator said on Monday.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) imposed the new conditions on the financial services licence of the Societe Generale business after charging it with criminal offences in March over alleged failure to separate clients' money in authorised bank accounts.
If Societe Generale Securities Australia does not comply with the new conditions, the unit would need to refrain from charging brokerage fees for futures transactions involving client money and would have to stop taking on new customers if it involved receipt of client money, the watchdog said on Monday.
ASIC said the Australian business must appoint an independent expert to assess its processes, identify deficiencies and plan remedial action, with attestations from a qualified senior executive and board member confirming adoption and implementation of any recommended remedial action.
The regulator did not say when the French investment bank had to meet the conditions and therefore when the restrictions might apply.
In a statement, Societe Generale Securities Australia Pty Ltd said it had agreed to the new conditions.
However, a SocGen spokesman based in Hong Kong said the business was operating normally.
""Our operations in Australia are running as usual and there is no impact on Societe Generale's operations or on the level of service to its clients,"" he said.
During 2017 and 2018, the securities unit self-reported that it had deposited client money in unauthorised bank accounts between December 2014 and September 2018, which the regulator at the time described as ""serious"" and at risk of ""undermining investor confidence"".

The regulations require client money to be deposited with an Australian bank or in an account prescribed under specific client money laws. This is aimed at limiting use of client funds and the circumstances in which they can be withdrawn.

1612,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 05:48AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Kinnevik Decides to Pare Its Bet on Zalando,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For one investor at least, it’s time to take a bit of profit on the long-term trends that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated.
Swedish venture capitalist Kinnevik sold a 4.4% stake in German online fashion house Zalando (DE:ZALG) on Tuesday, realizing 645 million euros ($729 million).  
The sale, which was upsized moderately due to strong demand in the accelerated bookbuilding process, means that Kinnevik has now got back all of the 902 million euros it invested in the startup, and still has a 21.3% stake to play with – worth another 3.1 billion at Monday’s closing price. 
Kinnevik has more than enough scope to take profit after a 50% run up in the last three months that has left the stock look a little over-extended. At only 1.5 times trailing 12-month sales, the valuation is far from being the most demanding in the tech universe (U.K. rival Boohoo.com, which reports its quarterly earnings later this week, trades at over 3.5 times), but the current price is an eye-catching 600 times last year’s earnings.
The stock may also suffer from concern about the remaining ‘overhang’ and potential future sales by the Swedish group, now that it has reduced its stake below 25% and no longer has any pretensions to being a strategic shareholder. All the same, there's no sign that Kinnevik is preparing to take the money and run. CEO Georgi Ganev said it only sold because the stock's appreciation had unbalanced its overall portfolio.
As such, it’s hard to see the 5.1% drop in Zalando’s share price on Tuesday as anything other than a decent entry point for a stock with a simple and convincing growth story. Cash flows that would have taken 10 years to materialize may now take half that in an optimistic scenario. Last month, the company reported 50 new third-party sellers through its Partner Program in a mere three weeks, including American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) and Vaude.
This is promising to end the company’s habitual struggle for profitability. It now expects to be “clearly profitable” this year, forecasting up to 20% growth in revenue and gross merchandise value this year, along with up to 200 million euros in underlying operating profit. With clothing being the one of the most popular categories of item for online purchases in Europe (even a majority of over-50s in Europe has bought apparel online), it’s about time.
If one accepts that the shift to online shopping is irreversible, then Zalando has at least some downside protection from the secular trend. The big question for the stock is whether the market will always put the same high premium on growth that it has done in the last few weeks."
1613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Best-Laid Brexit Plans Thrown in Disarray by Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- Giant U.S. banks still have to deliver a Brexit plan to get staff across the English Channel, before a potential second wave of Covid-19 forces Europe’s doors shut again.JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have lost precious months during the pandemic lockdowns in moving employees to European Union financial hubs. With Brexit talks deadlocked and time running out before the year-end deadline, firms are finally reactivating long-held plans to shift staff from London -- only to find they can’t move fast enough.“Relocating staff during a second spike is a concern,” said Peter Bevan, a partner at the law firm Linklaters. “During lockdowns, a small number of people have been caught in the wrong place and regulators understand that, but if you are talking about an entire team stuck in the location regulators want them to move from, that will make for a tougher conversation.”
Foreign banks oversee almost half of all banking assets in the U.K., according to 2015 figures from the Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority. Yet the exodus from London to the continent has been far smaller than some expected after the Brexit vote, with firms moving about 1,000 people by last September, out of a total of 7,000 moves predicted by consultancy EY.
Representatives for JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman declined to comment.
German financial regulator BaFin told Bloomberg that little had changed since February, when Chairman Felix Hufeld said banks had done far more than 80% of the work needed to deal with Brexit from a legal and technical standpoint. But when it comes to moving client business to their EU hubs, the banks are, on average, less than a third of the way there, he said.
European Hubs
Some European banks have advantages over their American peers when it comes to Brexit planning. UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) decided to merge its U.K. entity with its EU entity that has passporting rights last year, giving the bank flexibility to move staff around the region. Now, its traders, risk and back office teams sit in Frankfurt where UBS already had a large presence in wealth management.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG joined UBS in planning for a hard Brexit from the beginning. It moved some staff to bolster the bank’s services in Spain, Germany and Luxembourg. “London will remain a key part of the bank’s strategy and footprint after the U.K.’s exit from the EU,” a spokesman said.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB), which has said it is moving hundreds of staff to adapt to Brexit, declared client migration was “materially complete” in its earnings last September. Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) continues to expect to transfer several hundred jobs from London to Frankfurt once the Brexit transition period concludes, a person familiar with the matter said.
To be sure, the U.S. banks have made progress on their longer term post-Brexit plans. Earlier this month, Goldman signed a 12-year lease in Paris’s 16th arrondissement where it operates one of its broker-dealers servicing European clients, allowing it to double its headcount in the French capital from late next year. JPMorgan bought a seven-floor office building in the historic 1st arrondissement in January with capacity for as many as 450 people -- although that was an estimate made before social distancing became the new normal.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which also has its Brexit hub in Paris, has gone further by committing to a fully fledged sales and trading business on the continent. It has had about 450 staff in Paris since last year and won’t need to add any more in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., which already has about 60% of its European staff outside the U.K., is creating 150-200 new roles primarily in Frankfurt as part of its Brexit response.
Some finance employees who are earmarked to work from Brexit subsidiaries in Europe are still physically in London while operating under European employment contracts as the virus interrupts their plans to move, people with knowledge of the banks’ plans said.
It’s not the first time banks have grappled with the prospect of a hard Brexit. European regulators have already said they’ll require French and German asset managers to do business through EU banking entities unless a deal is agreed. Regulators have previously put pressure on banks to move staff promptly, although some banks are now expecting a change in stance in light of the pandemic, people with knowledge of the matter said.
“We have seen a lot of dialog in recent weeks from the ECB and home regulators asking banks to push these things forward,” said Bevan.
Dormant Hubs
Many JPMorgan and Citigroup clients are still funneling business through London, rather than the banks’ EU offices, some of the people familiar said. The liquidity is still better and it’s cheaper to do business there, the people said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Bevan at Linklaters said that while the re-papering exercise has been completed to switch EU clients onto new Europe facing entities, hundreds of asset managers have yet to review the new terms and push the button to activate trading. The scale of the outstanding work could take months to complete, he said.
Stephen Jones, the CEO of trade body UK Finance, expects more bankers to follow the thousands that have already moved from London to European hubs. “But it’s not going to happen overnight, and I hope regulators in the EU will be pragmatic about all this.”

Greggs will reopen around 800 shops to takeaway customers on Thursday, while Cineworld plans to lift the shutters on cinemas across some territories during the last week of June, with all theaters set to be open over the course of July. Both companies are implementing social distancing and other measures to counter the spread of coronavirus as part of their plans.
Greggs (LON:GRG) shares rose as much as 5.5% on Tuesday, the biggest advancer in the FTSE 350 Food & Drug Retailers Index, while Cineworld (LON:CINE) climbed as much as 11%, outpacing Europe’s Stoxx 600 Travel & Leisure Index. Even after Tuesday’s gains, the stocks are still down 25% and 62%, respectively, in the year to date.
The bakery chain said it isn’t able to predict the impact of social distancing on its ability to trade or on customer demand, and that capacity to operate will be restricted by shop size. The company warned of the need to expect that sales may be lower than normal for some time.
“Social distancing will clearly impact trading,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Andrew Wade wrote in a note, while keeping his buy recommendation on the stock. “Despite the challenges facing the food-to-go sector in the near term, Greggs is better positioned than much of its competition.”
Meanwhile, Cineworld’s reopening announcement comes after it scrapped plans to acquire Canada’s Cineplex Inc., which would have created the biggest operator of movie theaters in North America. The company said it has updated its booking system to ensure social distancing within and throughout auditoriums, adapted daily movie schedules to manage queues and avoid a build-up of crowds in lobbies, and enhanced cleanliness and sanitation procedures across all sites.
The reopenings are part of a broader trend as governments ease restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus. Shoppers in England returned to stores on Monday for the first time since March, with many customers lining up outside popular retailers in and around London.
“People are definitely ready to shop again,” Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman wrote in a note. “Even if you assume a dampening of the initial pent-up demand effect, this is very good news for store-based retail.”

The focus will soon turn to Thursday’s monetary policy meeting of the Bank of England, particularly after Tuesday’s unemployment data emphasised the country’s difficult economic circumstances.
Additionally, European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta urged the European Union to urgently decide on a package of fiscal measures to help the bloc through its pandemic-induced economic crisis.
The EU proposed a 750 billion euro package last month, including 500 billion in grants, but resistance from a handful of fiscally conservative nations has threatened to delay the deal and no agreement in June is now expected.
Global equities had fallen sharply due to worries about the U.S. economy and confirmation of a new coronavirus cluster in China.
However, the Fed's move and data showing the outbreak in Beijing was being tamed--27 new coronavirus cases reported on Monday, down from 36 new cases the previous day--helped equities head higher.
German consumer price inflation remained in negative territory in May, which will concern the European Central Bank with its inflation-based mandate.
In corporate news, travel stocks including cruise-ship operator Carnival (LON:CCL) and International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) posted strong gains. 
One outlier was German online fashion house Zalando, which fell 5.1% after strategic shareholder Kinnevik said it would sell a 4.2% stake through an accelerated bookbuilding process.
Oil prices have edged higher, helped by the renewed enthusiasm in the equity markets, but gains are tentative.
At 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $37.14 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $39.88.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,735.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1325, up 0.1%.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tencent aims to become biggest shareholder of video streaming rival iQIYI - sources,"By Zhang Yan and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) aims to become the biggest shareholder in video streaming rival iQIYI Inc (O:iQ), said two people familiar with the matter, to lower costs and counter competition in a sector boosted by stay-at-home virus policies.
The Chinese social media and gaming leader has approached iQIYI's 56.2% owner Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) to buy a stake of as-yet undetermined size, one of the people said. It was not immediately clear whether Tencent has approached iQIYI or what the full nature of any cooperation would entail.
""A tie-up would improve their bargaining power when producing and purchasing content, and lower marketing costs that would otherwise be spent on grabbing users from each other,"" the person said.
Plans are at an early stage and subject to change, said the people on condition of anonymity as the information was private.
Nasdaq-listed iQIYI, popularly considered China's equivalent to Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), has a market capitalisation of $14 billion. Shareholder voting power is 92.7% controlled by Baidu.
Search engine firm Baidu, iQIYI and Tencent declined to comment.
The potential deal - reported here for the first time - would join two of China's biggest media forces, with each boasting over 110 million paid subscribers at March-end.
A deal would also take Tencent a step closer to becoming China's dominant online entertainment provider, at a time when cinemas are struggling with a drop in punters since the COVID-19 outbreak while studios are turning online to sell their content.
Both Tencent and iQIYI have seen content expenses increase as they compete with each other as well as operators of user-generated video sharing sites such as  Bilibili Inc  (O:BILI) and Bytedance, owner of TikTok and domestic version Douyin. 
Taken together, China's online video market is set for 2020 revenue of 156.6 billion yuan ($22.1 billion), according to iResearch http://www.iresearchchina.com/content/details7_52897.html.
Tencent Video and iQIYI as well as smaller rival Youku, owned by  Alibaba  Holding Group Ltd (N:BABA), offer movies, drama series and reality shows - both own-made and bought from content producers.
Tencent Video has made several hit series such as the ""The Untamed"" and owns the broadcasting rights of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"", while iQIYI original variety shows ""The Rap of China"" and ""The Big Band"" have been major topics on social media.
iQIYI booked an 11% rise in content costs in January-March versus the same period a year earlier, while revenue growth slowed to 9% from 43%. The firm, which has yet to break even in its 10-year life, recorded a net loss of $406 million.
By comparison, Bilibili, which targets a younger demographic with videos of gameplay and anime, enjoyed a 69% revenue rise.
Should there be a need to raise capital to finance growth, iQIYI believes deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations would deter investors, including main backer Baidu, one of the people said.
iQIYI Chief Executive Gong Yu in December said U.S. investors made up of 70% the company's total.
Baidu itself is considering delisting from Nasdaq amid the diplomatic tension and moving to an exchange closer to home to boost its valuation, sources told Reuters last month.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>","U.S. companies can work with Huawei on 5G, other standards: Commerce Department","By Karen Freifeld and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The United States on Monday confirmed a Reuters report that it will amend its prohibitions on U.S. companies doing business with China's Huawei to allow them to work together on setting standards for next-generation 5G networks.
The U.S. Commerce Department and other agencies signed off on the rule change, which is awaiting publication in the Federal Register, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The rule was sent to the Federal Register on Friday and is set to be published as early as Tuesday.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed the action in a statement to Reuters.
""The United States will not cede leadership in global innovation,"" Ross said. ""The department is committed to protecting U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by encouraging U.S. industry to fully engage and advocate for U.S. technologies to become international standards.""
The Commerce Department publicly announced the move later on Monday. It noted that U.S. participation in standards-setting ""influences the future of 5G, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies."" 
In the telecommunications industry, 5G, or fifth-generation wireless networks are expected to power everything from high-speed video transmissions to self-driving cars. 
A Huawei spokeswoman, Michelle Zhou, had no immediate comment. 
Last year, the United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called entity list, which restricted sales of U.S. goods and technology to the company, citing national security. 
Industry and government officials said the rule change should not be viewed as a sign of weakening U.S. resolve against Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. They said the Huawei entity listing put the United States at a disadvantage in standards settings, where companies develop specifications to allow equipment from different companies to function together. 
With U.S. companies uncertain what technology or information they were allowed to share, engineers from some U.S. firms reduced their participation, giving Huawei a stronger voice.
The new rule came in response to concerns from U.S. companies and lawmakers, a person briefed on the matter said.
""Confusion stemming from the May 2019 entity list update had inadvertently sidelined U.S. companies from some technical standards conversations, putting them at a strategic disadvantage,"" said Naomi Wilson, senior director of policy for Asia at the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). 
""This much-needed clarification will allow companies to once again compete and lead in these foundational activities that help enable the rollout of advanced technologies, such as 5G and AI, across markets,"" she said. ""We look forward to reviewing the rule once posted and working with the administration on implementation.""
Reuters exclusively reported last month that the amendment had been drafted and was awaiting approval.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet with Chinese officials in Hawaii this week amid increased tensions between the two countries, according to another person familiar with the matter.

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares rallied and the dollar fell on Tuesday as risk appetite was bolstered by the formal start of the Federal Reserve's corporate bond buying programme, and earlier worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections eased.
Improving sentiment also pushed up Wall Street futures with e-Minis for the S&P 500 rising 1.6% following a late U.S. stocks rally on Monday. Treasury yields rose and the yield curve steepened. 
The Fed said it will start purchasing corporate bonds on Tuesday in the secondary market, one of several emergency facilities launched in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
A flood of liquidity in the form of fiscal and economic stimulus, along with uneven but steady re-openings of state and local economies, sparked a sharp rally in the stock market since its late-March trough.
""Equities were overbought and corrected lower, but the S&P 500 has bounced off support because of the Fed,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors in Sydney.
""The markets will continue to go higher as long as economies continue to reopen and as long as the number of coronavirus cases is not large enough to stop the reopening.""
The investor sentiment was also boosted by a Bloomberg News report that the Trump administration is preparing a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure proposal as part of its push to spur the world's largest economy back to life.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 3.2%, its biggest one-day gain since March 25. Australian stocks rose 4.4%, while shares in China rose 1.2%.
European markets were also set for a strong opening with pan-region EuroSTOXX 50 futures rising nearly 3.0%, German DAX futures gaining 3.1% and FTSE futures trading up 2.6% by 0534 GMT.
Sentiment in Asia was also helped by data showing there were 27 new coronavirus cases in Beijing, down from 36 new cases the previous day. Beijing banned high-risk people from leaving the capital to stop the spread of a fresh outbreak.
Japan's Nikkei stock index closed up 4.9%, its biggest daily gain since March 25, while shares in South Korea were up 4.8%.
But some analysts were not convinced about the strength of the gaining momentum. 
""With pricing across the risk spectrum now rich, we expect further gains to be more selective, differentiated and volatile...on fears of a COVID-19 second wave and concerns about their extended valuations,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar eased 0.1% to 96.44, almost 1% below Monday's high of 97.396. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar sits more than 2% above a two-week low hit on Monday, and rose 0.6% to $0.6968 on Tuesday.
The yen was little changed at 107.33 per dollar. The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady on Tuesday and stuck to its view that the economy will gradually recover from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Fed on Monday also announced eagerly-awaited details of its programme to lend funds directly to companies.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields notes edged up to 0.7363%, while the spread between two-year and 10-year yields widened to 54 basis points in a sign of improving risk appetite.
Oil prices were steady on Tuesday as lingering concerns over the threat to fuel demand from the resurgence of new coronavirus infections around the world were cushioned by hopes for further cuts in crude supplies. [O/R]

U.S. crude was trading up 0.2% at $37.18 a barrel, after having fallen 1.2% earlier, while Brent crude also rose 0.2% to $39.78 per barrel.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>","As virus upends Japan's economy, activist investors ease off on pushing firms to return cash","By Tomo Uetake
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Shareholder activists in Japan are taming calls for their targets to return their cash piles to investors, ceding ground to the view such corporate hoards are assets rather than a drain on returns amid the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic.
The change in stance comes as Japan - the second-biggest market for activists after the United States - enters peak season for company annual general meetings (AGMs), where proposals for measures such as dividend increases and share buybacks would normally be presented.
Fifty-four companies have so far received shareholder proposals for this year's AGMs in June as of Tuesday, matching the record set last year, according to data compiled by Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Trust.
""The vast majority of activist demands made last year were related to right-sizing balance sheets. But asking for buybacks amid corona-chaos seems a stretch,"" said Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA.
New York-based Fir Tree Partners has this year dropped its 2019 call for a share buyback at Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) (T:9142) in favour of nominating three board directors.
""Due to the impact of COVID-19, JR Kyushu now desperately needs to use its excess cash to maintain business operations at a time when profits have declined,"" said Tim Laurie, investment analyst at Fir Tree.
""Now more than ever, there is a clear need for additional oversight and independent directors on the board,"" he added.
JR Kyshu is opposed to the proposals, saying it already has a diverse board with more than a half from outside. It declined to comment on changes in Fir Tree's proposals.
Many broad institutional investors are pushing for companies to make their board more diverse. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management has said it would vote against directors if the board has no women.
Seth Fischer, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oasis Management, another well-known activist, said his fund made ""deliberately modest proposals"" to Fujitec (T:6406) in light of COVID-19.
The fund initially planned to propose a share buyback, but instead has called for Fujitec to cancel treasury shares - shares held by the company, usually after buybacks - saying the action would improve corporate value at no cost to the company.
Fujitec disagrees, saying they can be used for future financing.
Japanese institutional investors, who have increasingly joined activists in pressuring boards to improve returns, have also eased up in their demands.
Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management last month relaxed the minimum it expected of its investees for return on equity and dividend payout ratios during the 2020 voting season, citing the pandemic.
But CLSA's Smith also added the reduced focus on higher shareholder return could prove temporary.

""Companies are likely to be in need of a comfort blanket, worrying about the 'second wave.' That cash is probably not going anywhere,"" Smith said. ""So the presents are still under the Christmas tree. We're just going to have to wait a little longer to open them.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to post strong gains at the open Tuesday, helped by fresh moves by the Federal Reserve to support the U.S. economy, and by hope that the new surge in reported Covid-19 cases was under control.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.1% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 1.9%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 1.6%.

However, the Fed's move and data showing the outbreak in Beijing was being tamed--27 new coronavirus cases reported on Monday, down from 36 new cases the previous day--helped equities head higher.
New clusters of coronavirus are ""always a concern"", said Mike Ryan, the WHO's emergencies program head. ""But what we do like to see is an immediate response to that and a comprehensive set of measures."" 
Adding to the positive tone was the news that the Bank of Japan, after a policy meeting, had increased the nominal size of its lending packages for cash-strapped firms to $1 trillion from about $700 billion announced last month.
Back in Europe, there are a number of economic releases due Tuesday. 
The U.K. unemployment rate remained at 3.9% in April, better than expected with the country’s job retention schemes helping to limit the coronavirus-related damage. However, the claimant count in May was higher than expected, at 529,000.
German consumer price inflation remained in negative territory in May, which will concern the European Central Bank with its inflation-based mandate, and eyes will now be on the release of the key ZEW economic sentiment survey at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
Oil prices have edged higher, helped by the renewed enthusiasm in the equity markets, but gains are tentative.

HSBC’s Asia-Pacific CEO Peter Wong signed a petition in support of the laws earlier in June.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said during a daily news briefing on Monday, “In relation to HSBC, ultimately businesses will make their own judgement calls...but let me just put it this way, we will not sacrifice the people of Hong Kong over the altar of banker bonuses.”
Raab is the latest senior politician from both the U.K. and the U.S. to chastise the bank’s support for the laws. The U.K government has been vocal about its opposition to the laws since the National People’s Congress passed a motion to draft and enact the laws in late May.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 11:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chesapeake Energy to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week - sources,"By David French and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) is preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week, said three people familiar with the matter, becoming the largest oil and gas producer to unravel after an energy market rout caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
The Oklahoma City-based company, co-founded by the late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon, is in the final stages of negotiating a roughly $900 million debtor-in-possession loan to support its operations while under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, two of the sources said. 
The company is also in talks with creditors to ""roll up"" some of its existing debt and make it part of the bankruptcy loan, bringing the total debtor-in-possession financing closer to $2 billion, the sources added. The company is reeling under a mountain of debt totaling more than $9 billion.
Chesapeake is also attempting to negotiate an equity infusion from creditors to help it emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, one of the sources said.
Chesapeake plans to complete its negotiations with its creditors and file for bankruptcy as soon as Thursday, the three sources said. The timing could slip to next week depending on the progress the company makes in these discussions, the sources added.
If the company manages to emerge from bankruptcy, creditors that include Franklin Resources Inc (N:BEN), will take over Chesapeake in exchange for eliminating more than $7 billion of its debt under the outlines of a plan being negotiated, one of the sources said. Franklin is among Chesapeake's most significant creditors, holding large portions of its debt. 
The sources requested anonymity because the bankruptcy preparations are confidential. Chesapeake and Franklin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chesapeake, which employed about 2,300 people as of the end of last year, skipped an interest payment on debt due on Monday, two of the sources said. Another obligation looms on July 1.
In May, the company warned it might seek bankruptcy protection, and added that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Reuters in April reported Chesapeake was preparing a potential bankruptcy filing.
Chesapeake helped pioneer the extraction of oil and gas reserves from shale rock formations, an environmentally controversial process called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.
McClendon and Oklahoma businessman Tom Ward founded Chesapeake with a small investment in 1989. McClendon became the company's chairman and chief executive. The company was named for his love of the Chesapeake Bay region around Maryland and Virginia.
Over time, the company snapped up land across the United States and became a dominant player in fracking, with McClendon believing that natural gas could eventually supplant oil and coal for energy needs. By 2005, Chesapeake was the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer behind only  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM).
McClendon helped create tens of thousands of jobs for the Oklahoma City area and became a well-known community philanthropist while running Chesapeake. He was a part owner of the Oklahoma City Thunder professional basketball team, which he helped bring to town. The team still plays in the Chesapeake Energy Arena.
A natural gas glut reversed Chesapeake's fortunes, and prices fell over the past decade. McClendon relinquished his chairmanship and stepped down as chief executive in 2013, as investigations swirled into possible antitrust violations and whether he blurred lines between his personal dealings and those of the company.
A federal indictment in March 2016 charged McClendon with conspiring to suppress land prices by rigging bids for leases while he led Chesapeake. At the time, he disputed the charge and vowed to prove his innocence.
McClendon died in a single-car crash the following day, which a state medical examiner later determined to be an accident.
Chesapeake last year started reworking its balance sheet and pushed out some debt maturities while attempting to pivot away from gas toward a greater emphasis on oil production.

But the coronavirus outbreak, which resulted in a sharp travel downturn, and a Saudi-Russian oil price war upended the company's plans.

(Reuters) - Two former Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) employees who left the image-sharing company in late May publicly alleged in tweets on Monday that they had experienced racial discrimination in the workplace. 
Ifeoma Ozoma, who was Pinterest's public policy and social impact manager, called the company's recent solidarity with the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement ""a joke.""
Companies have rushed to publish statements of solidarity with the black community following global protests over racism and injustice after George Floyd, a black man, died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
""As a Black woman, seeing @Pinterest's middle of the night 'Black employees matter' statement made me scratch my head after I just fought for over a full year to be paid and leveled fairly…"" Ozoma said in one tweet. 
Pinterest did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A public note from its CEO on June 2 said the company was committed to taking action and improving its diversity. 
Aerica Shimizu Banks, who worked with Ozoma in the same small policy team, said on Twitter that it was a ""racist & sexist workplace"" and that she had faced disparaging comments about her ethnicity from her manager. 
Ozoma also said she was chastised for not presenting the pros and cons for a policy change that restricted Pinterest's promotion of former Southern slave plantations as wedding venues and for a recommendation on contractor pay.
Civil rights organization Color of Change, which worked with Ozoma and Shimizu Banks in their former roles, said in a statement that Pinterest at minimum owed the women an apology and due compensation.

""Like so many tech companies that are posting messages of solidarity with Black Lives Matter, Pinterest’s actions undermine the company's own words,"" said Color of Change's campaign director Jade Magnus Ogunnaike.

A preliminary version of the proposal being prepared by the Department of Transportation would reserve most of the money for traditional infrastructure work, like roads and bridges, but would also set aside funds for 5G wireless infrastructure and rural broadband, the people said.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss rural broadband access at a White House event on Thursday.
An existing U.S. infrastructure funding law is up for renewal by Sept. 30, and the administration sees that as a possible vehicle to push through a broader package, the people said. They asked not to be identified because the Trump proposal isn’t final and hasn’t been announced.
The plan is emerging as lawmakers from both parties and Trump debate the timing and scope of more stimulus for a U.S. economy plunged into recession by nationwide lock-downs needed to halt the spread of coronavirus. It’s the latest sign of momentum in Washington for some kind of infrastructure spending blitz ahead of the election.
House Democrats have offered their own $500 billion proposal to renew infrastructure funding over five years. It’s unclear how long the administration’s draft would authorize spending or how it would pay for the programs.
Trump is pushing to rev up the U.S. economy -- which four months ago was the centerpiece of his argument for a second term -- as he trails Democrat Joe Biden in most national polls. The White House explored ways to shift the next round of federal virus aid from personal financial support to growth-fostering initiatives, such as infrastructure spending.
The White House declined to comment specifically on the administration’s plans.
“Since he took office, President Trump has been serious about a bipartisan infrastructure package that rebuilds our crumbling roads and bridges, invests in future industries, and promotes permitting efficiency,” White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in a statement.
It’s still possible that the infrastructure measures could be rolled into the next round of pandemic relief. The House passed $3 trillion in additional stimulus in May, but the Republican-led Senate spurned that bill and will instead weigh its options next month.
The Democratic bill to reauthorize the current infrastructure program was unveiled this month. It includes investments in roads and bridges, funding to make certain projects more resilient to climate change, and funding for public transit and Amtrak, among other priorities. The House Transportation committee is set to take up the measure on Wednesday.
The existing surface transportation authorization law, known as the FAST Act, authorizes $305 billion over five years and expires on Sept. 30. Lawmakers will either extend it or come up with a long-term replacement. It’s not yet clear how closely the administration’s plan will align with the Democrats’ proposal -- or with what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might do.
Infrastructure spending has long held appeal for lawmakers as a way to spur growth, and the pandemic is renewing calls to fast-track roads and other projects. Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, called for public-works spending on infrastructure, including projects that could help low-income people.
“We need to focus on investments that leverage the talent of everyone and contribute to the economy’s long-term growth prospects,” Daly said in a speech Monday. She cited health, education and digital infrastructure, such as internet access.
One major question facing lawmakers will be how to pay for the measures, a hurdle that has stopped previous moves on infrastructure. Increasing the federal gas tax to support a massive round of new spending is unlikely though, as Trump cheers low gas prices and calls for other measures, including a payroll tax cut, to put cash in Americans’ pockets as the country copes with fallout from the virus.
Congress has shown little concern about the more than $2 trillion allocated to curb the pandemic’s economic damage, though some conservatives have begun to urge Trump to turn off the taps. But interest rates are near zero, making additional government spending more palatable, Daly said.
“Now is an especially good time to take on this type of debt,” Daly said. “Even before the crisis, we were in an environment of low interest rates – and that is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This makes public spending relatively cheap and easy to finance.”

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 10:35PM ET</span>",Six former eBay employees charged with cyberstalking Massachusetts couple,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Six former eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) employees have been criminally charged with cyberstalking a Massachusetts couple who published an online newsletter viewed as critical of the e-commerce company, federal prosecutors in Boston said on Monday.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said the defendants engaged in a ""determined, systematic effort"" to emotionally ""terrorize"" the couple with anonymous email threats, and deliveries such as live cockroaches, a bloody Halloween pig mask, a funeral wreath, and a book on surviving the loss of a spouse.
The defendants include eBay's former senior director of safety and security, James Baugh, 45, of San Jose, California, and former director of global resiliency David Harville, 48, of New York.
Prosecutors charged all six defendants with conspiring to commit cyberstalking and tamper with witnesses.
EBay terminated the defendants' employment last September, cooperated with prosecutors, and apologized to the couple.
Lawyers for Baugh and Harville did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other defendants, including three former managers, live near eBay's San Jose headquarters.
The alleged victims lived in Natick, Massachusetts, and were the editor and publisher of an online newsletter covering e-commerce companies such as eBay.
Prosecutors said that in one instance, the husband was told by email last Aug. 10 to expect the delivery of a pig fetus, and that after receiving the pig mask his wife got a follow-up email asking: ""DO I HAVE UR ATTENTION NOW????""
At a news conference, Lelling called the alleged harassment an attempt from ""pretty high up the chain"" to ""weaponize the internet"" to protect eBay's brand.
""This case struck us as something unique,"" he said.
EBay said its own probe found that while former Chief Executive Devin Wenig, who stepped down last September, had made ""inappropriate"" communications, there was no evidence he had advance knowledge of or authorized actions against the couple.

Efforts to reach Wenig for comment were unsuccessful. He told the Financial Times he had known nothing about the alleged harassment.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Tuesday morning, riding on the wave of an overnight surge in U.S. markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced additional measures to support the U.S. economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus.
The Fed said on Monday that the range of eligible assets for its bond buying program will now include all U.S. corporate bonds meeting certain criteria, and investors are waiting to see what Chair Jerome Powell’s semiannual policy report to Congress, to be delivered on Wednesday, will say.
“The size and the pace of Fed balance sheet expansion is something that will put a floor under global equity markets,” Stephen Gallo, BMO Capital Markets head of European FX strategy, told Bloomberg.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 3.42% by 10:16 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan due to announce its policy decision later in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI soared 4.25% and Down Under, the ASX 200 jumped 3.49%.

Meanwhile, investors were trading with some caution after new COVID-19 outbreaks in both China and an increasing number of U.S. states were reported over the weekend. There are over 8 million cases globally as of June 16, according to Johns Hopkins University.
But some investors remained positive despite the numbers.

(Reuters) - The United States and China will each allow four weekly flights between the two countries, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday, easing a standoff on travel restrictions in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. government still hopes China will agree to restore full U.S. flight rights under their bilateral aviation agreement, the Transportation Department said Monday in its revised order on China flights.
""As the Chinese government allows more flights by U.S. carriers, we will reciprocate,"" it said. 
The United States had threatened to bar Chinese passenger flights on June 16 due to Beijing's curbs on U.S. airlines amid simmering tensions between the world's two largest economies, and has raised concerns about the number of charter flights Chinese carriers want to fly.
Among U.S. airlines, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) had each sought to restart daily passenger flights to China in June but changed their plans in the absence of government approval.
Following China's agreement to allow four U.S. flights total, Delta said it would operate two flights to Shanghai from Seattle next week and once weekly flights from Seattle and Detroit beginning in July, all via Seoul.
United said it was aiming to re-launch service to China in the weeks ahead.

Chinese authorities have already agreed to some changes on requirements for U.S. carriers, including allowing temperature checks to be done before flights take off for China, rather than mid-flight as previously discussed, a person briefed on the matter said.

1633,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Chinese LNG Buyer Pauses Contract Talks in Cheaper Spot Fuel Bet,"(Bloomberg) -- One of China’s biggest private liquefied natural gas importers is betting it will be cheaper to meet rebounding demand by boosting purchases on the spot market.
ENN Energy Holdings Ltd., one of the few non-state-owned firms to operate an LNG import terminal in the country, has stopped negotiating long-term supply contracts and plans to rely on cheap spot imports for at least the rest of the year, President Zhang Yuying said in an interview Monday. That comes after the benchmark Japan-Korea spot LNG marker dropped more than 60% this year to a record-low.
The company has about 1.1 million tons of LNG a year in long-term contracts, and space for more at its Zhoushan terminal. The company was in talks with exporters for additional term volumes, and had applied for exemptions to tariffs on U.S. imports, Zhang said. Those discussions are now on hold for at least the rest of the year.
In the second half of the year, two key developments will allow the company to take advantage of low spot prices and boost imports, Zhang said. The first is the opening of a sub-sea pipeline to Zhejiang province from its terminal on Zhoushan island. Currently all imports are transported by tanker truck across bridges and are subject to traffic bottlenecks.
The other is the emergence of the China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp., which the government created to take pipeline and terminal assets from the country’s three state-owned giants in order to allow more third-party access to them. Zhang said he believes PipeChina will begin operating LNG terminals by the fourth quarter and give companies like his more chances to bid on import slots.
ENN expects its June gas sales to be 15% higher than the previous year, in line with its 2019 growth, as demand from industrial and power sectors has recovered from virus impacts, Zhang said.
Demand will continue to be bolstered by government efforts to clear air pollution by forcing companies to switch from coal-fired to gas boilers in the major demand centers of Guangdong and Hebei provinces.
The company also sees growth potential from its integrated energy projects, where it supples gas, power and energy services to customers, Zhang said. The company already has 150,000 industrial clients it can pitch the service to, and the sector will likely contribute as much as 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in revenue this year.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>","For Nomura's shoe-leather sales force, an uncertain future after coronavirus","By Takashi Umekawa and Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - For years Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) has relied on an army of retail salespeople to peddle stocks and bonds to investors sitting on one of the world's largest pool of household savings, generating revenue even in the bleakest of markets.
But since the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to in-person sales calls, Japan's biggest brokerage has lost a key advantage and its 7,000-strong sales force now faces an uncertain future. 
The crisis has only deepened concerns about the viability of Nomura's business model, which is more reliant on retail broking than rivals. It's also being squeezed as online brokerages draw younger investors.
For the last several years, Yorio Sawamoto, a 69-year-old small business owner in Osaka, has been trading with Nomura. Now he's trading less frequently and refuses to place large orders over the phone.
""As an amateur investor, it's really tough to take the plunge and spend the money if you don't meet with the salesperson,"" Sawamoto told Reuters. ""When it's just on the phone, for some reason you get wary. You end up wondering, 'Is what this person is telling me really true?'""
Investors like Sawamoto can mean big business. Japanese households hold a staggering 1,903 trillion yen ($17.8 trillion) in assets, around half of which is in cash or in bank savings.
The shift to telephone sales has made it harder to establish a connection with customers, said one Nomura salesman who has been with the firm for around 20 years, adding that last month he made just 60% of his monthly sales target.
""We were like actors in front of customers, but now we are like radio DJs,"" said the salesman, who, like other current and former Nomura employees, spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It's really hard to sell products with only our voices.""
Japan lifted a state of emergency last month but the salesman said he was still largely stuck at his office because customers don't want to meet.
Nomura declined to comment.
10 MILLION YEN DISNEY PEN
Meeting face-to-face helps put customers at ease, one Nomura saleswoman said.
""One time my customer noticed I was using a pen with a Disney character on it. The customer also turned out to be a big fan, and we got caught up in a Disney conversation,"" she said.
""Stuff like that seems trivial but it's hugely important.""
The customer eventually bought 10 million yen ($93,000) in bonds and investment trusts, she said.
Another salesman said telephone calls made it awkward to deal with customers who had lost money on the market. In such cases, he finds it impossible to convey enough sincerity when apologising over the phone, leaving him to fear he might lose customers.
Despite a global reputation for investment banking, Nomura is better known in Japan as a brokerage, and its clout overshadows rivals such as Daiwa Securities Group (T:8601).
Retail on average accounted for 39% of its pre-tax profit over the last five years, compared to 28% of recurring profit at Daiwa and 22% of recurring profit at smaller Mizuho Securities Co Ltd, according to Reuters calculations from filings.
Nomura's strength comes from a ""shoe-leather"" culture that stressed going out to meet customers and was instilled with an almost military discipline, according to one former employee. 
The former employee recalled being told there were only two acceptable answers to requests from superiors - ""yes or yes"". 
ONLINE THREAT
Even before the coronavirus, the face-to-face retail model was under pressure from online brokerages, said Chizuru Tateno, a director at S&P Global Ratings.
Therefore, it's even more crucial that Nomura and other brokerages adapt to change after the pandemic, she said.
 SBI Holdings Inc  (T:8473), Japan's largest online brokerage, surpassed Nomura in number of accounts for the first time in March, as more people appear to be trading from home.
Nomura's retail revenue in April was down around 20% from the average of the first three months of this year. May was similar to April, CEO Kentaro Okuda told Reuters last month. 
Nomura and other brokerages may need to reduce their sales staff or cut salaries if the trend continues, said Yusuke Maeyama of NLI Research Institute, a think tank. 
Michihiro Yamashita, a 48-year-old owner of an izakaya pub, has had an online account at Nomura for more than 10 years and has never used in-person sales.
""Not only are transaction fees much cheaper for online trading, but you can now get a lot of information yourself online,"" he said.
""Who needs a salesperson?""

""We're cautiously optimistic"" about U.S. new vehicle demand, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said at a virtual press event hosted by the Automotive Press Association. ""We're hopeful that we'll have a recovery because that's good for everybody.""
After two months of lost production as automakers shuttered plants to halt the spread of COVID-19, U.S. new vehicle dealers are running low on inventory, especially in the high-margin pickup truck segment that is dominated by GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU). 
Barra said she expects GM will be ""running full out"" at plants that make those popular vehicles ""in the near term.""
Consultancy AlixPartners has predicted that major automakers face a ""profit desert"" as they invest heavily in developing electric vehicles despite consumers' ongoing preference for gas-guzzling cars, especially in the U.S. market.
When asked about that prediction, Barra said, ""We are very excited with the portfolio of EVs we have coming.""
""We are going to continue on that path,"" she said. ""We have a strong future ahead and I don't see that desert.""
Industry data last week showed that China's auto sales in May rose 14.5% from the same month a year earlier, the second consecutive monthly increase as the world's biggest vehicle market recovers from lows hit during coronavirus lockdowns. 
Barra said that GM's lineup of vehicles, including its upcoming EV models, position the automaker for growth in China.
""I think we're going to be in a sweet spot where there is a growth opportunity in that market,"" she said. ""We're looking for profit and volume growth in China.""

The firm expressed concerns over Denholm's leadership, citing consecutive years of high compensation for directors, without a reasonable rationale, and a steep rise in share pledging by certain Tesla directors and executives, during her time.
Denholm, a company director for nearly six years, has been the chairwoman since November 2018. She is also a member of Tesla's audit and compensation committee.
""The significant number of pledged shares raises concerns regarding the audit committee's ability to effectively oversee risk at the company,"" ISS said.

""The percentage of outstanding shares that is pledged raise significant concerns, which are exacerbated by the high degree of volatility in Tesla's share price,"" ISS said.

(Reuters) - U.S. airline passengers who refuse to wear facial coverings could have their flying privileges revoked, the industry's main lobby group said on Monday.
As of now, major U.S. airlines may prevent anyone not wearing a mask from boarding and provide the coverings to passengers who have none. Once on board, however, flight attendants have little power to enforce the policy if passengers remove their masks.
Carriers implementing the new policy include Alaska Airlines (N:ALK), American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU), Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and United Airlines (O:UAL), Airlines for America said in a statement.
The airlines will clearly inform passengers about their individual policies on face coverings before flying, followed by an announcement with specific details onboard, it said.
Each carrier will determine the appropriate consequences for passengers who fail to comply with their policy, up to and including being put on that airline's no-fly list.
Some airlines offer certain exemptions for young children or people with medical conditions or disabilities, and when people are eating or drinking.
The measures are expected to remain in place throughout the COVID-19 public health crisis, the lobby said.
Some airlines and unions have called for a federal mandate on safety measures including aircraft cleaning, face coverings and the number of seats that should be sold on each flight.
""Now is not the time to have airlines competing with each other when it comes to safety,"" the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines' pilots, said on Monday.

U.S. airlines have drastically scaled back their flying schedules and are burning through billions of dollars in cash every month as the coronavirus pandemic crushes the travel industry, but have lately pointed to some signs that demand is improving.

1639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>",Japan to End Longest IPO Drought Since 2009 With Three Listings,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s longest drought in initial public offerings since the financial crisis will end later this month when three companies list on the same day.
Locoguide Inc., Ficha Inc. and Copa Corp. are expected to list on the bourse’s Mothers market on June 24, marking a 78 day gap since Matsuya R&D Co. went public on April 6. Locoguide seeks to raise about $44 million, the largest of the three deals. Three more Japanese companies plan to list before the end of June, and five have announced IPOs for July so far.
Global IPOs slowed to a trickle this year after the spread of the coronavirus outbreak from January, as market slumps and volatility caused issuers to stay on the sidelines. New offerings have jumped back to life with planned deals announced this month totaling over $12 billion, mainly for Chinese and U.S. companies.
The IPO dry spell caused by the coronavirus rivals eclipses the one that followed the 2011 earthquake, when there were no listings in Japan for 77 days between March and June. Listings also came to a standstill during the global financial crisis for 82 days between December 2008 and March 2009, and 81 days during April to June 2009.
“Unlike the 2011 earthquake disaster and the financial crisis, the pandemic hasn’t destroyed physical production facilities or collapsed the financial system,” said Katsumi Udagawa, manager of research at Ichiyoshi Securities Co. “Once firms get a grip on the right timing to list, the IPO schedule should get on track to recovery.”
March tends to be a heavy month for Japanese startup IPOs, ahead of the new fiscal year that begins on April 1, while also avoiding the busy earnings season in late April to mid-May. A total of 43 companies had planned to go public in March and April, but only 25 listed on schedule. Of those, only eight managed to close their first day of trading above the offer price.
Several of the companies scheduled to list soon are displaying confident outlooks as Japan’s economy reopens following virus-related restrictions. Locoguide forecasts a 48% increase in operating profit for the year ending March 2021. Ficha expects to report a profit after a loss last year. Goodpatch Inc., which plans to list on June 30, predicts a whopping 174% year-on-year profit gain for its fiscal year ending August.
“Taking into consideration tailwinds to our business after the virus outbreak, our enterprise value hasn’t dropped, so we feel no need to adjust our tentative price range,” said a spokesperson for Locoguide. The company, which provides online local information and retail services, expects an offer price of 1,800 yen to 2,000 yen.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co’s (N:DIS) ABC News has placed on leave one of its top executives, Barbara Fedida, while it investigates press reports that she made racist comments, among other inappropriate behavior, according to the network. 
On Saturday HuffPost published an article https://www.huffpost.com/entry/abc-news-toxicity-thrives_n_5ee3db80c5b684a0c4f2e297 alleging that Fedida, the network’s senior vice president for talent, editorial strategy and business affairs, has a long history of making insensitive comments and has been the subject of more than a dozen human resources complaints. Fedida denied the allegations, which she described as ""incredibly misleading.""
In one incident, the article described a 2018 discussion about news anchor Robin Roberts’ contract negotiations. Fedida allegedly said of Roberts, who is black, that it was not as if the company was asking her to “pick cotton.”
Sources told HuffPost that as a result of Fedida’s alleged misconduct, ABC News has spent millions of dollars in confidential settlements with former talent and staff, including at least one settlement related to allegations of racial discrimination.

Investing.com - Homebuilder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) reported fiscal second-quarter results that topped estimates as demand for first homes in the wake of the pandemic bolstered sales.
Lennar was up nearly 3% in after-hours trade.
Lennar reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $1.65 a share, up from $1.30 a share a year earlier, on revenue of $5.3 billion, down 5%. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.24 on revenues of $5.2 billion.
Deliveries were largely flat at 12,672 homes, while new orders were down 10%, to 13,015 homes 
Customers moved from rental apartments and from densely populated areas to purchase homes, and home sales grew steadily, as record-low interest rates and low inventory levels drove a favorable rebound in the homebuilding industry.
The company said the strong rebound seen in May, had continued into the current into the first two weeks of June. ""Business rebounded significantly in May, and by quarter's end, our total new orders declined by only 10%, and deliveries ended flat year-over-year. In sync with the market rebound, we resumed starts and land spend to match the improving market conditions, and this rebound has continued into the first two weeks of June.""
Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company sees new orders in a range of 12,800-to-13,000, deliveries of 13,200-to-13,400, and average sales price of $380,000-to-$385,000. 
""While many parts of the economy are still waiting to open and rebound, the housing market has proven to be resilient in the current environment. We expect this trend to continue and for housing to be a significant driver of employment and rebound for the broader economy. In this context, we are re-instituting guidance for fiscal year 2020 and now expect our deliveries to be in the range of 50,500 – 51,000 homes with a gross margin on home sales of approximately 21.5% and a net margin on home sales of approximately 13.0%. A breakdown of our third and fourth quarters is included later in this release,"" Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Lennar, said."

Investing.com - The Dow staged a strong rebound from lows on Monday, as investors weighed further efforts by the Federal Reserve to support credit markets against a jump in Covid-19 infections across U.S. and other parts of the world that threatens to disrupt the pace of the economic reopening.    
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.62%, or 157 points, after falling more than 300 points at the open. the S&P 500 gained 0.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.43%.
Just a month after the Federal Reserve began buying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in corporate bonds, the central bank announced on Monday that it would buy, on the secondary market, individual corporate bonds with remaining maturities of five years or less.  
On May 12, the Fed began buying corporate bond ETFs under its the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), to steady corporate debt markets following record outflows on concerns about companies defaulting on their debt.   
The announcement came as investors assessed an uptick in Covid-19 infections that threatened to slow the process of reopening the economy.
Reports of a jump in coronavirus cases across the U.S., China, and parts of Europe raised fears a second wave of the virus could be on the horizon that could potentially lead to fresh lockdowns.
Leaders in New York and Texas threatened to renew lockdowns.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that he would reimpose shutdowns if businesses failed to comply with current restrictions and people didn’t socially distance, according to Bloomberg.
Still, some on Wall Street continue to downplay the prospect of lasting damage on corporate earnings.
""But, the combination of incremental data improvement and extraordinary policy support has been sufficient to assure the forward-looking market that the earnings damage resulting from the virus will ultimately be short-lived,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Travel and tourism, sectors sensitive to the pace of reopenings, pared some of their losses and helped the broader market bounce from session lows.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) ended flat, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was up 1%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) slipped 2.3% after the airline detailed plans to sell up to 28 million shares.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) rose 8.3% after the e-commerce platform announced a new partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that will open the latter's Marketplace to Shopify’s small business sellers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 6% following reports that the electric carmaker is exploring the viability of installing a new assembly plant near Austin, Tx.
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 7.4% after on reports Israel was buying the company's coronavirus vaccine.
Energy, meanwhile, also retracted losses as oil prices turned positive, shrugging off concerns about weakness in crude demand."

LISBON (Reuters) - How quickly more than 40 airports run by French group Vinci (SGEF.PA) can recover from the coronavirus crisis depends on whether passengers feel safe enough to travel, the head of the company's airports business Nicolas Notebaert said on Monday.
""It is just the start,"" Notebaert, who is president of Vinci Airports, told reporters after taking the first post-lockdown flight from Nantes to Lisbon operated by budget airline Transavia. ""The speed of recovery will depend on the confidence we create for our passengers.""
Vinci runs 45 airports in 12 countries, making it the second largest airport operator in the world, behind Spain's Aena (MC:AENA). 
""They (passengers) can come back to our airports, which are clean, safe and health measures are in place in order to welcome them,"" Notebaert said. 
Though passengers might slowly return, the outbreak is set to leave long-lasting scars on the aviation industry. 
Last week, the International Air Transport Association said the coronavirus crisis will lead the airline industry into record annual losses of $84 billion as 2020 goes down as the ""worst year in the history of aviation.""
Airline passenger traffic is expected to rise 55% in 2021 from a low level this year, while remaining 29% below its 2019 level, IATA said. 

In April, Vinci said its revenues would fall sharply in the months ahead, after sales remained stable year-on-year in the first quarter, boosted by the acquisition of a majority stake in Gatwick airport.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks regained ground on Monday after their steep losses last week after the Federal Reserve on Monday announced it would buy individual corporate debt to keep the juices flowing in the economy.
Fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections weighed on global stocks earlier in the day, but investors were able to shrug off fears about the progress of reopening businesses.
On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify to Congress about his economic outlook. Retail sales figures for April will also be released, and tech giant Oracle will report fiscal fourth quarter earnings.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Federal Reserve Chairman to Testify About Economic Outlook
Powell is set to testify at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) Tuesday to the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Economic Committee on Tuesday on his economic outlook and recent monetary policy decisions.
Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged near zero and said the central bank would do anything needed to support the economy as it struggles to recover from Covid-19 business shutdowns. On Friday, the Fed said small businesses were particularly vulnerable.
On Monday, the Fed said it would buy individual corporate bonds in addition to exchange traded funds in an effort to boost liquidity in the market.
2. Retail Sales for April Expected to Fall Again
Retail sales numbers are due out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) Tuesday. Monthly sales in April are expected to be down 8%. That compares to a decline of 21.6% in the prior month.
Core retail sales, which excludes automobiles, for May are expected to be 5.4% compared to a decline of 17.2% the prior month.
3. Tech Giant Oracle Due to Report Fourth Quarter
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is out with earnings on Tuesday after the market close, with a phone call and webcast scheduled for after that. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $10.7 billion.
The tech giant is one of the first to report a full quarter that was nearly all consumed by Covid-19 business shutdowns, so analysts will be listening for what the company says about its outlook and the progress of shifting to a cloud-based subscription sales model, which already makes up nearly three-quarters of revenue."
1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>","Tesla negotiating incentives for possible Texas vehicle assembly plant, report says","(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is negotiating possible incentives with a Texas county that could bring a new auto assembly plant to the area near Austin, the state capital, the Austin American-Statesman reported on Monday.
Travis County Commissioners Court is scheduled to discuss terms of the deal on Tuesday, the paper reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation. A vote is expected in the coming weeks.
The paper said it was unclear whether negotiations with Travis County show that Tesla has picked the Austin region as the site for the plant, which would build the company's electric pickup truck and Model Y SUV and employ thousands of people, or if the company is also negotiating with officials in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tesla officials could not immediately be reached to comment. The company's chief executive, Elon Musk, has tweeted previously about the possibility of bringing a plant to Texas. Oklahoma also has been mentioned as a possible site.
Travis County officials declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Texas governor's office did not immediately comment. 
Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he had spoken with Musk about a potential plant.
Abbott's comments came three days after Musk had threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future operations to Texas or Nevada after officials in California's Alameda County, where Tesla's only U.S. vehicle assembly plant is located, said the plant could not yet reopen because of coronavirus lockdown measures. The plant has since reopened.

Officials with the United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at General Motors Co's (N:GM) assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, said they believe a Tuesday county meeting will include talks about the possible deal. The union, which has unsuccessfully tried organizing Tesla's Fremont, California, plant, called on Texas officials to obtain assurances from Tesla about any potential jobs.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value LP managing member Peter Feld stepped down from AECOM's (N:ACM) board in protest over the selection of a new chief executive that sidestepped a search process that he oversaw, the U.S. engineering company disclosed on Monday.
Feld quit AECOM's board after it held a meeting without a previously disclosed agenda to vote on the promotion of chief financial officer Troy Rudd to CEO, according to Feld's resignation letter dated June 12 that the company published on Monday. 
Members of a CEO search committee of AECOM's board were still engaging with ""highly qualified candidates"" and could have concluded their search within weeks, when the company's board decided to pick Rudd to succeed CEO Michael Burke in October, the letter stated.
""Since I cannot, and will not, support the board practices that culminated in this selection, I am resigning from the board with immediate effect,"" Feld, who chaired the CEO search committee, wrote in the letter. 
Feld and two other directors who joined AECOM's board as part of a settlement in November that averted a proxy contest voted against Rudd's appointment. They were defeated in the vote by six AECOM directors, including Burke, who backed Rudd.
Starboard, an activist investor, was open to Jacqueline Hinman, the former CEO of engineering firm CH2M HILL Companies who joined AECOM's board as part of the settlement, becoming AECOM's new CEO, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Hinman, however, dropped her candidacy after failing to get enough backing on AECOM's board, the sources said.
A strong external candidate that the CEO search committee was considering withdrew because of a professional conflict, according to Feld's letter. The identify of that candidate was not disclosed.
Rudd removed his name from consideration for the CEO role earlier in the process, the letter said. The search committee wanted the new CEO to have experience leading a large business, a qualification that Rudd did not meet based on his finance background, according to the letter.
Rudd rejoined the CEO search process six weeks ago, one of the sources said. His promotion was seen by the majority of AECOM's board as providing certainty to the market and helping retain talent, including the head of AECOM's European business, Lara Poloni, who was considering leaving for another company, according to the sources.
Starboard hinted at a new board challenge against AECOM when directors are up for re-election next year. ""Starboard remains a large shareholder of AECOM, and we reserve our rights to take any action we deem necessary to continue to represent the best interests of all shareholders,"" Feld wrote.
AECOM and Starboard declined to comment.

On Saturday the airline was labelled a ""national disgrace"" by parliament's Transport Select Committee, who said IAG were trying to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to cut 12,000 jobs and downgrade the terms and conditions of other employees.
Walsh defended the company in a letter to the committee, rejecting the lawmakers' findings and saying their report was not based on facts.
""British Airways is fighting for its survival, in the face of overwhelming and unprecedented challenges, while respecting the fundamental British value of the rule of law. This is not a disgrace,"" he wrote.
BA is engaged in a battle with unions and in legal action against the government over a quarantine policy which requires all international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days.
Walsh, one of the most experienced airline bosses in the world, said it was clear that the government had no plans to help the sector restart and recover, and criticised the quarantine.
The airline is burning through 20 million pounds ($25.2 million) a day and has no revenues. It is preparing for what most airlines and travel experts expect to be a smaller travel market after the coronavirus pandemic.

""We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened national and global economy,"" Walsh wrote.

""BaFin has reasonable grounds to suspect that shares of Infineon Technologies AG are being publicly offered in Germany by an unknown source without an approved prospectus having been published,"" the regulator said on its Web site on Monday.
Failing to issue a prospectus can be penalised with a fine of up to 5 million euros ($5.66 million), BaFin said.
Infineon said share offers had been made without the company's consent. 
“In the course of last week Infineon received various requests from retail investors asking for guidance regarding an offer made by certain companies, unknown to Infineon, to purchase Infineon shares,"" the chip maker said.
These offers used the Infineon logo, were made in the name of Infineon as the seller and asked for a purchase price which was significantly lower than the actual market price, Infineon said.
""These offers were made without Infineon’s knowledge and/or consent or authorisation,"" the company said in a statement. ""Infineon therefore suspects fraudulent activities by unknown parties. Infineon notified BaFin about these activities and was informed by BaFin today of similar activities concerning the shares of other issuers."" 
Infineon currently has no plans to issue or sell further shares or other equity instruments.

Investing.com - Wall Street turned positive after clawing back losses on Monday as the Federal Reserve said it will buy individual corporate bonds just a month after it launched its corporate bond exchange-traded funds program.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1%, or 250 points, after falling more than 300 points at the open. the S&P 500 gained 1.18%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.69%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street jumped on Monday following an announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding its corporate bond purchasing program that boosted investor confidence, which had been wavering amid a spike in new COVID-19 cases.
All three major U.S. stock indexes abruptly reversed earlier losses in afternoon trading, following the Fed's decision to apply an indexing approach to its secondary market corporate credit facility to create a more diversified portfolio.
""It makes sense that we'd rally (following the Fed announcement),"" said Oliver Pursche, president and CIO of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""But the market is probably overshot, considering what the reaction should be.""
""To a large extent it was expected,"" Pursche added.
A flood of liquidity in the form of fiscal and economic stimulus, along with uneven but steady re-openings of state and local economies, sparked a remarkable rally in the stock market since its late-March trough.
But surging new cases of COVID-19 in China, where the pandemic originated, prompted the reintroduction of containment measures, and record hospitalizations in several U.S. states dampened investor risk appetite.
On the flipside, an uptick in China's factory output and a much better-than-expected Empire State manufacturing report gave evidence that the pandemic-hobbled global economy was on the road to recovery.
Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it had opened registration for its Main Street Lending program to help businesses weather the storm of mandated lockdowns.
Last week, the Fed provided its first pandemic era outlook, and market participants will be closely following Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress for details on the central bank's somber economic projections.
""You've gone through an enormous amount of pain and the healing will take some time,"" Pursche added. ""The patient got very sick and is on the road to recovery but it's a long road.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 243.16 points, or 0.95%, to 25,848.7, the S&P 500 gained 35.27 points, or 1.16%, to 3,076.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 161.76 points, or 1.69%, to 9,750.57.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were trading higher, with industrials and financials enjoying the largest percentage gains.
Drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc gained 6.0% following a report that Israel is in advanced talks to buy its coronavirus vaccine.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.89-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ruling against environmentalists, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday decided that the federal government has the authority to allow a proposed $7.5 billion natural gas pipeline to cross under the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia.
The 7-2 ruling was a victory for Dominion Energy Inc and President Donald Trump's administration, both of which appealed a lower court ruling that halted construction of the 600-mile (965-km) Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would run from West Virginia to North Carolina. 
The decision, written by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, removes one of several obstacles facing the project. Two liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented.
""Today's decision is an affirmation for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and communities across our region that are depending on it for jobs, economic growth and clean energy. We look forward to resolving the remaining project permits,"" Dominion said in a statement.
Environmental groups including the Sierra Club and Southern Environmental Law Center had sued to stop the pipeline after the U.S. Forest Service gave the green light for the project to run through the George Washington National Forest. Dominion Energy leads a consortium of companies in the project that also includes  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK).
After a protracted application process involving multiple federal agencies, the Forest Service granted the consortium a right of way under the trail in 2018. 
The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in 2018 that the Forest Service lacked the authority to grant a right of way for the pipeline where it crosses the Appalachian Trail in the national forest land because the trail was overseen by the National Park Service. 
In Monday's ruling, the Supreme Court agreed with the Trump administration that the Forest Service retained the authority to approve rights of way across the trail.
The park service's authority over the trail ""did not transform the land over which the trail passes into land within the National Park System,"" Thomas wrote.
Kelly Martin, who heads the Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign, vowed to contest the remaining permit applications.
""Nothing in today's ruling changes the fact that the fracked gas Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a dirty, dangerous threat to our health, climate and communities, and nothing about the ruling changes our intention to fight it,"" Martin added.
The proposed pipeline would be 600 feet (180 meters) below a section of the 2,200-mile (3,500 km) trail, which stretches from Maine to Georgia. 
The Supreme Court's ruling will also affect the proposed 300-mile (480-km) Mountain Valley Pipeline, which would run from West Virginia to southern Virginia and crosses the trail in the Jefferson National Forest. The pipeline is almost finished but construction was halted as a result of the ruling in the Atlantic Coast pipeline case before the crossing under the trail was completed.

(Reuters) - European shares closed lower on Monday on concerns of a second wave of coronavirus infections after Beijing reported a record number of new cases.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3%, slipping further from its 5.7% fall last week but losses moderated towards the close, with analysts pointing to investors booking some profits after a recent rally.
""The sharp decline in equities on Monday would suggest that investors are fearful of similar outbreaks around the world as countries start to ease lockdown restrictions,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
Major European indexes had touched three-month highs earlier in the month after monetary support from the European Central Bank and optimism over the gradual reopening of economies from coronavirus-led lockdown.
Global stock markets also began the week on downbeat note as the outbreak in Beijing, which has been traced to a wholesale food market, revived fears of the economic damage from the health crisis. [MKTS/GLOB]
""It has served as a reminder that the optimism driving markets in recent weeks can very quickly dissipate if hopes for a V-shaped recovery are overridden by fears of a second lockdown,"" said Marco Stoeckle, head of corporate credit research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Reuters reported BlackRock (N:BLK) has pumped about 16 billion euros ($18 billion) into 810 European companies since the end of January, more than half of them in distress due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Miners (SXPP) as well as travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) were among the worst performers of the day. 
 BP  (L:BP) fell 2.2% as it said it would incur an up to $17.5 billion writedown in the value of its assets after lowering its long-term oil and gas price outlook in expectation of an accelerated transition away from fossil fuels.
Swiss sensor maker  Sensirion  (S:SENSI) jumped 22.7% after lifting its 2020 outlook as sales of gas sensors for medical ventilators needed to treat COVID-19 patients surged.
H&M (ST:HMb) reported a sharp but slightly smaller-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales as measures to slow the COVID-19 pandemic hit retailers. Shares of the world's second-biggest fashion retailer edged 0.4% higher.

Meanwhile, European countries eased some border controls on Monday after coronavirus lockdowns, although Spain kept its borders shut.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Factbox: Spain's $4.2 billion aid plan to support the auto industry,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced a 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) aid package for the hard-hit auto industry to promote the production and sale of cleaner cars.
The funds will be disbursed by 2022 and will include cash from European recovery funds. 
Here are some details of the package, unveiled on Monday:
AID TO PURCHASE NEW LOW-EMISSION CARS
The Spanish government will spend 250 million euros on cash-for-clunker schemes to encourage drivers to buy new low-emission and electric cars in 2020.
Drivers will get up to 4,500 euros to buy a new, cleaner car when they scrap a 20-year-old car. Dealerships will give up to 1,000 euros in additional discounts. 
Spain will spend another 100 million euros upgrading official vehicles and will let regional authorities spend 100 million euros of their budget surpluses to upgrade their own fleets. 
INDUSTRY LOANS AND TAX BREAKS
Spain will grant 2.6 billion euros in cheap loans and loan guarantees to the industry by 2022, including loans to modernize plants and for companies to renew their fleets. 
The government will also approve tax breaks for the industry.
ADDITIONAL GRANTS 
The industry will receive up to 415 million euros in grants for research and development and 95 million euros for worker training programmes. 
The auto industry represents around 10% of Spanish gross domestic product (GDP) and 19% of exports. It employs 650,000 people directly and as many as 2 million indirectly.
Most factories were idled during Spain´s lockdown as demand for new cars plummeted and supply chains were disrupted. 
Japanese car maker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motors (T:7201) announced last month it would shut down its large plant in Barcelona, leaving as many as 3000 workers unemployed.

(MC:SAN), said on Monday it would close its offices and branches at noon on June 19, to commemorate 'Juneteenth', or the end of slavery in the United States. 
June 19 commemorates the U.S. abolition of slavery by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which was belatedly announced in the state of Texas on June 19, 1865, after the end of the Civil War.
""This year, Juneteenth is especially moving as our nation wrestles with inequities and injustices that have persisted throughout its history, with renewed urgency,"" Santander Holdings Chief Executive Officer Tim Wennes said in a statement.
Santander joins others in corporate America such as Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), Jack Dorsey-owned  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and  Square Inc  (N:SQ) in recognizing Juneteenth.
The death of African American George Floyd in police custody late last month has triggered widespread protests against racism and police brutality, while also reigniting the debate on diversity and inclusion among corporate companies.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 12:47PM ET</span>",Primark the star attraction as England's stores reopen after lockdown,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Long queues of shoppers snaked around stores in England on Monday, with discount fashion retailer Primark proving a particular draw as shops reopened their doors after 83 days of lockdown.
Queues formed from early morning outside several branches of Primark, which does not sell online so has not made a penny in the UK for months.
The chain reopened some of its stores early, including its biggest in Birmingham, to avoid overcrowding as hundreds of people lined up outside. At its Leeds store, the estimated afternoon wait time to get in was up to an hour.
There was also a big queue outside the  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) Town store on London's Oxford Street, the capital's busiest shopping street, with many shoppers ignoring social distancing rules.
Department stores, clothing retailers, electrical outlets, bookshops and other non-essential stores have been closed since March 23 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus. 
The reopening only applies to England, with stores in Scotland and Wales waiting for guidance from their devolved administrations on when they can resume trading. Non-essential stores in Northern Ireland reopened on Friday.
The UK government is encouraging people to go out and spend to help boost the economy, which shrank by a quarter over March and April.
The British Retail Consortium reckons the lockdown has cost non-food stores 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) a week in lost revenues. 
""The government's priorities have always been lives first, but clearly restoring livelihoods, protecting jobs, making sure our economy can motor and recover again is really important,"" business minister Paul Scully told Sky News.
STORES LOOKING DIFFERENT
Retail footfall across England's retail destinations had increased by 41.7% up to 1100 GMT in comparison to last Monday, researcher Springboard said.
Stores look very different, though, as they must observe social distancing regulations. As well as having to queue outside as numbers inside are restricted, shoppers are greeted with hand sanitisers and there are limits on touching and trying out products.
Some chains are reopening all their English stores, while others are taking a phased approach.
Primark, owned by Associated British Foods (L:ABF), reopened all its 153 stores, while Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), which has traded online and kept its food halls open, reopened the majority of its clothing space.
Rival  Next  (L:NXT) reopened 64 stores, having already reopened 64 homeware stores during the lockdown. John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] reopened just two outlets.
Many small independent stores, where it is difficult to implement safe social distancing practices, remained closed.
Sofie Willmott, an analyst at GlobalData, said that while the queues on high streets might look promising for retailers, there were tough times ahead.

""Footfall and spending will take a long time to return to pre-COVID levels,"" she added.

The board of directors has started a process to find a replacement and will look both internally and outside the company, it said in a statement, adding that Poulsen would stay on until Jan. 31 at the latest.
Additionally, Poulsen was nominated for a seat on Orsted's board, which will be on the agenda at the company's next annual general meeting in March, 2021.
Poulsen said he had not made any decisions about his future yet, but said his sole focus would be on leaving his role as chief executive ""in an orderly fashion and without missing a beat"".
""I'll find other challenges where I can make a contribution. Time will show where, when, and what type of role,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (N:BLK) has pumped about 16 billion euros ($18 billion) into 810 European companies since the end of January, more than half of them in distress due to the coronavirus pandemic, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Companies across the world have looked to banks and asset managers to help provide emergency funding since the pandemic spurred most leading economies to lock down citizens in an effort to stop its spread, crippling many businesses.
Since the end of January, BlackRock had provided around 3 billion euros in equity and 13 billion euros in credit to new and existing investee companies, the source said, with just over half of the firms raising money after a big hit from the virus.
Of the capital deployed, around half went to companies in Britain, Europe's biggest equity market. 
Among the companies to receive fresh capital were cinema owner Everyman Media (L:EMANE), with BlackRock buying 3.4 million shares in April to become its second biggest investor, according to regulatory filings and Refinitiv data.
Others included SSP Group (L:SSPG), where BlackRock acquired 21 million shares in March to take its stake to 12.65%. 
The share prices of many companies had risen since the capital injection, to the benefit of BlackRock's clients, as liquidity fears eased, the source said.
""The positive impact of those investments in society and in local and national economies – in terms of supporting jobs, R&D, technology innovation and infrastructure rollout – is very significant,"" said Rachel Lord, Head of EMEA at BlackRock.
BlackRock, which managed around $6.5 trillion in assets at the end of March for both retail and institutional clients, is a major investor in most of Europe's leading stock markets, and the region's biggest money manager by assets under management. 
More than 100 firms had contacted BlackRock to sound out its willingness to take part in fundraisings, while more than 100 more had received pre-emptive calls from the asset manager to let them know the terms of potential support, the source said.
As lockdowns are lifted and companies get a better sense of changes in consumer spending, a second wave of equity fundraisings could come in the fourth quarter, the source added. 
While companies often raise equity over several months, the emergency nature of many fundraisings meant many firms went to their biggest investors for help and completed deals quickly.
In Britain, this was helped by a rule change in March that enabled firms to raise up to 20% of their share capital in quick-fire share sales.

While investors including  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and Merian flagged their willingness to support such fundraisings, others criticised their dilutive impact on earnings per share.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's largest asset manager Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) has accepted the resignation of its president and group chief executive, effective immediately, it said in a statement on Monday.
The announcement came after several local media outlets reported at the weekend that Jalil Rasheed was leaving the government-linked firm, which has over 300 billion ringgit ($70.15 billion) of funds under management, after just nine months. 
""The Board has also approved the appointment of a successor and an announcement will be made upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals,"" the statement said.
In a good-bye letter sent to staff via email and seen by Reuters, Jalil said he had been harassed, receiving what he described as hate calls from unknown numbers while his corporate email account and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile had been hacked.
""This made me increasingly worry for the wellbeing of my family. In the end, I decided that it would be unfair to my family should matters escalate,"" he said in the note, without giving further details. 
Jalil returned from Singapore to head PNB in October last year after a change in the country's government led to a series of corporate leadership changes at state-linked firms.
Further changes have followed Muhyiddin Yassin's appointment as Prime Minister in February, including at national oil company Petronas.
Jalil said that he never wavered in his principles in performing his duties at PNB and told staff to ""always stay the course, never waver in integrity and always be guided by principles"".
PNB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the contents of Jalil's letter outside of regular office hours.

Irishman John Slattery, 51, succeeds influential veteran David Joyce, retiring after 40 years with the U.S. conglomerate.
The appointment comes weeks after the collapse of a planned aerospace alliance between Embraer and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which Slattery had defended, and marks what one observer referred to as a shift of culture as the industry faces its worst crisis.
GE’s once-high-flying Aviation unit has been hit by the drop in air travel, adding to the toll from hundreds of grounded Boeing 737 MAX jetliners. 
GE said last month it planned to cut the global workforce of its aviation unit this year by as much as 25%.
Slattery will become president and CEO of GE Aviation on Sept. 1. Joyce will then be non-executive chairman of GE Aviation through December 31.
GE shares were down 2.7% in early trading, underperforming a weaker market.
Industry sources had predicted Slattery would quit Embraer if the alliance with Boeing, for which he lobbied amid scepticism from European Union regulators, did not materialise.
Boeing terminated the deal in April, sparking an arbitration battle between the two companies.
Despite that spat, industry sources said Slattery has forged close relations with Boeing's management. The arrival of a European at the helm of the world's largest engine maker could also help reset relations between GE and Airbus (PA:AIR), whose biggest jets are powered by UK rival Rolls-Royce (L:RR).
Together with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), GE co-owns engine maker CFM International which supplies all engines for Boeing 737s and powers about half of the medium-haul Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s.
Embraer's Arjan Meijer will succeed former lessor Slattery, who was named commercial CEO in 2016 as Embraer prepared its new E2 jets. In February, when many executives shunned the Singapore Air Show at the pandemic's outset, Slattery was seen aggressively marketing the E2 to airline bosses.

But sales have lagged against the Canadian-developed Airbus A220 amid uncertainty over the Boeing deal, leaving Embraer under pressure to consider an alternative partner.

The European Commission, which oversees trade policy in the 27 EU countries, said in a report published on Monday that the companies had received preferential lending, artificially cheap land and electricity and various grants and tax breaks.
The companies include two Egyptian subsidiaries of state-owned China National Building Materials Group Corp (CNBM) [CNMGC.UL], marking the EU's first look into whether Chinese aid is unfairly helping Chinese companies based abroad. It normally only considers subsidies from the host government.
Combined with related anti-dumping duties, the EU will apply tariffs of 30.0% to 99.7%, the higher rates applying to China-based companies and the lower rates to the operations in Egypt, the EU official journal said. The tariffs are backdated to Jan. 22. The commission found the market share of the producers in China and Egypt rose to 31% in 2018 from 23% in 2015, while their average sales price fell by 14%.
Glass fibre fabrics have a wide range of applications, such as in wind turbine blades, boats, trucks and sports equipment. 
EU producers include Belgium's European Owens CorningFiberglas, France's Chomarat Textiles Industries, Germany'sSaertex and Finland's Ahlstrom-Munkzjo Glassfibre (HE:AHM1). 
The commission is also looking into alleged unfair subsidies received by CNBM subsidiary Jushi in Egypt regarding glass fibre reinforcements. It set provisional duties of 8.7% in that case. Final findings are due in July.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) will not offer concessions to EU antitrust regulators reviewing its $27 billion bid for data and analytics company Refinitiv, two people familiar with the matter said, a move which will likely trigger a four-month probe.
The EU's antitrust authority is expected to open a full-scale investigation into the takeover, the sources said, with LSE and Refinitiv's overlapping activities in areas such as fixed income trading likely to be in focus as well as the impact of the deal on the price of financial data.
LSE declined to comment. It has previously said it aims to close the deal this year. The EC also declined to comment. A spokesman for Refinitiv wasn't immediately available for comment. 
Data, whether financial or technology or industrial, is a key concern for the European Commission (EC) because of the power it can give a few players to dominate and lock out new rivals.
Possible early concessions the LSE could have made to the EU would have included hiving off its MTS government bond platform or agreeing to sell Refinitiv's stake in Tradeweb, a bond trading platform, analysts have said.
Monday is the deadline for the LSE to propose concessions to address competition concerns raised during the EU regulators' preliminary inquiry, which ends on June 22.
The companies should get a decision from the EU on whether it will launch an in-depth probe, known as a Phase 2 examination, next week.
""Most investors, including ourselves, expect it would move to Phase 2. That was our base case scenario from the start,"" said Mike Werner, research analyst at UBS investment bank.
Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which owns Reuters News.
The EU competition enforcer has in recent weeks sent more than a dozen questionnaires to market participants, customers and rivals of the two companies, three other people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The focus has spanned the two companies' businesses from clearing platforms and foreign exchange markets to over-the-counter trades and European government bond trading as well as data generated by the platforms for themselves and other activities, they said.
A lengthy EU investigation will not derail the deal, said a source close to the deal.
""Every indication we get is that this deal will close. The market wants a viable competitor to Bloomberg and market participants are in favour of this deal. They've told the regulators that they want this deal to go ahead,"" the person said.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 10:52AM ET</span>",Meatpacking workers often absent after Trump order to reopen,"By Tom Polansek and Andy Sullivan
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] is missing about a third of its employees at a South Dakota pork plant because they are quarantined or afraid to return to work after a severe coronavirus outbreak, according to the workers' union.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) was forced to briefly close its Storm Lake, Iowa plant - a month after U.S. President Donald Trump's April 28 order telling meatpackers to stay open - as worker absences hobbled its slaughter operations. 
Nationwide, 30% to 50% of meatpacking employees were absent last week, said Mark Lauritsen, a vice president at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).
More than a dozen meatpacking workers, union leaders and advocates told Reuters that many employees still fear getting sick after losing confidence in management during coronavirus outbreaks in April and May. Absenteeism varies by plant, and exact data is not available, but some workers' unwillingness to return poses a challenge to an industry still struggling to restore normal meat output.
Daily pork production was down by as much as 45% in late April as some 20 plants closed because of outbreaks. Production has rebounded since plants reopened last month in response to Trump's order, but remains down from before the pandemic. The UFCW union, which represents about 80% of U.S. pork and beef production, told Reuters that major pork plants are running at about 75% capacity.
Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that processors slaughtered about 438,000 hogs on Friday, down 12% from the peak before the pandemic.
The USDA and the White House declined to comment for this story. Tyson, Smithfield and other meatpackers say they have taken extensive safety measures, at great cost, to protect workers.
Meat companies have prevented the pace of slaughter from falling further by bolstering kill lines with employees from other operations that require more labor, such as butchering and deboning. As a result, meatpackers are producing fewer products that require extra work - such as boneless hams - and throwing away items like offal that otherwise would be sold, Lauritsen said.
The cure for absenteeism is a safe job at a decent wage, Lauritsen said. 
""Right now"" he said, ""there are employees that don't see the safe job part.""
FIGHTING INFECTION, FEAR
Plants became hotbeds of infection because they house thousands of employees working in close quarters. Outbreaks tightened meat supplies and contributed to a 40.4% surge in prices in May.
The world's biggest meat companies have spent tens of millions of dollars to protect workers by erecting physical barriers, taking workers' temperatures, providing protective gear and staggering break times. They have not been able to eliminate infections, however.
""They have changed a lot of things that I think are great,"" said Alejandro Murgioa-Ortiz, a community organizer who works with meatpacking workers in Iowa and Nebraska. But workers remain wary, he said, because ""there's still so many risks.""
Infections have risen steadily in rural counties that are home to large meatpacking plants since Trump ordered them to stay open. At least 15 meatpacking counties now report a higher infection rate, on a per capita basis, than New York City, the virus's epicenter – though that is likely a reflection of the extensive testing of workers and local residents along with elevated infection rates.
In Kansas, 2,896 meat workers have tested positive, accounting for nearly one third of all cases in the state, according to the state health department.
EXPOSED AGAIN
At the Smithfield pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, about 1,200 employees - about a third of the workforce - were absent as of June 1, including some who quit, said BJ Motley, president of the UFCW local. The plant closed from about April 15 to May 7 as more than 850 workers tested positive for the virus.
Smithfield, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), said it has implemented aggressive measures to protect employees.
""Absenteeism remains a challenge, but we are managing,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. Smithfield declined to disclose its levels of absenteeism.
Sandra Sibert - a 47-year old who works on the plant's ham bone table and caught the virus - said it is not easy to stay six feet apart in the locker room and cafeteria. Sibert said she grew worried after the plant reopened when a female employee with an infected husband was allowed to work while awaiting her test results.
""I worry about everybody,"" Sibert said. 
ABSENCES SHUT PLANT
Tyson's Columbus Junction, Iowa plant closed on April 6, when surrounding Louisa County had just six known cases and no deaths. When it reopened on April 21, the county had recorded 215 cases and 2 deaths. As of May 29, there were 352 known cases and 11 deaths.
Tyson, the top U.S. meat supplier, declined to say how many employees are missing work, but said absenteeism had declined to its lowest percentage since before the pandemic at its Columbus Junction plant and another Iowa plant, in Waterloo. 
Tyson had to halt operations at its pork plant in Storm Lake, Iowa in late May - a month after the president's order to reopen - partly because of ""team member absences related to quarantine and other factors,"" the company said in a statement. The plant restarted limited operations on June 3.
The company said that 591 workers, or 26% of its workforce, had tested positive. Surrounding Buena Vista county, where many workers live, has one of the nation's highest infection rates, with 1,257 cases, a fivefold increase over the past two weeks.
Tyson warned in an earnings report last month that worker shortages were expected to contribute to more production slowdowns and plant shutdowns. The company said in a statement that it is continually working to improve safety and social-distancing protocols.
In Kansas, more than 2,900 workers were absent in late April and early May from five plants run by Tyson, Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and National Beef Packing Company [NBEEF.UL], according to reports by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
National Beef said it has focused on protecting its employees while running plants to produce meat for consumers.

Worker-safety measures still sometimes came up short, according to CDC officials. They noted in a report, for instance, that ""many people"" at a National Beef plant in Dodge City, Kansas, were not wearing masks that covered their noses, and that some only wore face shields that would do little to slow the spread of the disease.

Orban said Audi was key to the Hungarian economy's recovery from the adverse impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. 
""We have to fight for the Audi plant as well,"" state news agency MTI cited Orban as saying. 
MTI said Audi's engine and car manufacturing plant in the western Hungarian city of Gyor returned to normal operation with three shifts on Monday after weeks of disruption caused by the pandemic.
""We can protect jobs with agreements,"" MTI cited Orban as saying. The prime minister did not elaborate on the specifics of support for Audi, which employed 12,807 people at the end of 2019 and is one of Hungary's top exporters and revenue earners.
A spokeswoman for Audi declined to comment.
The Gyor plant manufactured 1.97 million engines and 164,817 cars last year, including the Q3 Sportback, the RS Q3 and RS Q3 Sportback, after investments worth over 11.5 billion euros since Audi entered Hungary.
Orban said it could take up to two years for major manufacturers in Hungary to draw up plans exceeding those from before the pandemic, signalling a potentially long recovery for the local car sector, a mainstay of the Hungarian economy.

MTI cited Audi Hungaria's Chairman of the Board, Alfons Dintner, as saying that the Hungarian factory was still well off pre-crisis output levels, adding that customer demand was ""moderate"".

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>","For shrinking stock markets, corona crisis looks like a turning point","By Sujata Rao and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis is likely to reverse a decade-long trend of shrinking equity supply that helped to power the longest bull market in history as cash-strapped companies are forced to raise equity instead of buying back their shares.
A surge in share listings this year by companies to bolster finances contrasts with the past few years when buybacks, mergers and de-listings - often funded with cheap debt - drained the supply of equity and boosted valuations.
Companies are now turning away from buybacks as political pressure grows to avoid rewarding shareholders while laying off workers or benefiting from state aid.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said 2019 was the first time net supply of shares -- share issuance adjusted for de-listings and buybacks -- materially rose since 2015. 
He has calculated, based on a global share count proxy, that net equity supply rose by $500 billion last year, the highest since 2010. He said this year will at least match that tally, noting a $200 billion increase in equity supply in the first five months of 2020.
(GRAPHIC - Global net equity issuance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/oakpeqkqzpr/eikon.png)
""The virus situation is creating a backlog of pending equity issuance. There is a need to raise equity, and the equity market rally suggests that there is likely to be more appetite from the private sector to inject capital,"" he said. 
In contrast, Panigirtzoglou predicts that global share buybacks this year may amount to $450 billion, halving from 2019 levels. 
Up until now, the popularity of buybacks among U.S. companies helped to cut the share count on the S&P 500 index by around 25 billion between mid-2011 and end-2019, based on data from the Yardeni Research consultancy. 
(GRAPHIC - Dwindling equity supply: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgvobgwbpd/eikon.png)
This year though, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts that U.S. buybacks will halve from 2019 levels to around $370 billion. And the record $60 billion raised on U.S. equity markets last month, shows companies are on a share-selling spree.
The turnaround has only just begun, said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS in Boston.
""Markets are under-estimating the reversal of what we saw in the past 10 years,"" Almeida said. ""The capability of businesses to leverage balance sheets further and buy back stocks in an environment where they have furloughed employees is going to be pretty low.""
(GRAPHIC - S&P 500 buybacks and dividends: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmorqgvr/buybacks.PNG)
PERFORMANCE
Years of shrinking equity supply -- dubbed de-equitisation -- meant more money was chasing each share, which helped to drive the equity market boom. Almeida said S&P 500-listed corporations purchased more than $4 trillion of stock since 2010, making them the biggest equity buyer by a factor of two.
Many analysts believe a shift towards increased equity supply will be a drag on markets and increase volatility if companies no longer buy shares when their stocks tumble. 
Buybacks also helped to boost earnings. Richard Saldanha, a portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, estimates they contributed roughly 2% a year to earnings-per-share growth at S&P 500 companies. But he sees the shift as a longer-term positive if it means an increase in capital expenditure.
""As the buyback component gets reduced, companies can deploy capital into supply chains, automation, R&D ... This will be one of the lasting consequences from this crisis,"" Saldanha predicted.
In 2018, companies' capex grew a meagre 2% worldwide, after almost a decade of central bank stimulus, S&P Global said. The proportion of cash used for capex versus dividends, buybacks, acquisitions and R&D was at its lowest in more than a decade.
But the shift away from buybacks has not yet upset stock markets, which have several other sources of support. For one, companies are far less capital-intensive than in the past so will not need to issue huge amounts of equity.
And equities will look attractive as an asset class given that equity risk premia -- essentially stocks' excess future return over bonds -- are well above long-term averages.
JPM's Panigirtzoglou highlighted ""a structural change in the liquidity and interest rate environment"" that will favour equities. 
BACK TO BUYBACKS?
Buybacks may come back into fashion but in the aftermath of the crisis companies will find it tough to justify borrowing money to buy their own shares or pay dividends.
BofA's latest fund manager survey found just 7% of investors favour buybacks, while 73% preferred to see a reduction in debt.
Instead, investors say they will focus more on the cash and debt levels on corporate balance sheets, as well as paying more attention to employee working conditions and environmental impact.
Matthew Jennings, investment director at Fidelity International, said Fidelity fund managers were avoiding companies that were ""over-distributing"" even before the crisis because these would be more likely to cut dividends suddenly or tap shareholders for emergency cash.
""Shareholders will look for companies to fund dividends and buybacks through profits rather than debt,"" Jennings added. ""Many companies will have to rebuild balance sheets and deleverage before they can do that.""

U.S.- and TSX-listed shares of Shopify, which have doubled in value this year and briefly made the company the most valuable Canadian company in May, were up about 7% in morning trading on Monday.
Online sales at retailers, from cosmetics makers to pizza chains, have boomed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced customers to stay indoors.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Monday it is pledging its MileagePlus frequent flyer program for a new $5 billion loan aimed at further buffering its liquidity, even as its cash burn rate slows thanks to a steady improvement in demand.
So far, United continues to book more new tickets than cancellations for the second and third quarters but said it still expects annual demand to be down on Oct. 1, when government payroll aid for airline employees runs out.
Its shares lost 7% in early trading on the Nasdaq.
The company would have $17 billion in total liquidity on Sept. 30 if it decides to tap a $4.5 billion government loan, which it said could be backed by slots, gates and routes.
That would be enough to carry it through a potential second or third wave of COVID-19, senior executives said.
Airlines have been scrambling to raise cash and cut costs as the coronavirus pandemic hits air travel. 
Chicago-based United said it only expects to fly about 25% of its normal schedule in July, when it sees ticketed passenger revenue down by 82% to 88% from a year ago, though up considerably from June.
Its cash burn could near break-even by the end of the year, similar to what rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) have forecast, depending on how demand evolves, executives said.
For the third quarter, United sees its daily cash burn rate slowing to about $30 million per day from roughly $40 million in the second quarter.
United said it will retain control over its $20 billion loyalty program, with over 100 million members and $5.3 billion in cash flow from sales in 2019, under the deal structured by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Senior Funding.

American Airlines has said it could use its loyalty program as collateral for a government loan.

Law firm Mishcon de Reya is representing the group of small business policyholders known as the Hiscox Action Group. The law firm has written to Hiscox to trigger arbitration clauses in nearly 350 contracts, the action group said in a statement.
Lloyd's of London insurer Hiscox said it welcomed ""all proposals to expedite resolution of any dispute.""
Britain's coronavirus lockdown has triggered insurance claims from companies seeking compensation for having to shut down their activities.
Hiscox and other insurers have said that most contracts do not cover the pandemic but they aim to pay valid claims quickly.
Industry regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is in the process of seeking clarity from the courts on whether the wording of some insurance policies should provide cover during the pandemic.
The arbitration claim by the Hiscox Action Group will take place alongside the FCA's test case against eight insurers, including Hiscox, the group said.
Small businesses in France and the United States are also fighting insurers over policies which did not pay out following government lockdowns due to the virus.

Like rival auto firms, PSA is gradually cranking up its manufacturing capacity again following a shutdown caused by the coronavirus crisis. 
But an initial plan to transfer salaried PSA workers from one of its Opel factories in Poland to work in France, rather than take on local temporary staff, who often pitch in at the plant, sparked criticism from unions and the French government. 
PSA now planned to have a team of 2,000 in place at the Hordain factory made up of local workers, including temporary ones, while 5% of the total staff would be employees from other sites, including Poland, the carmaker said. 
The CGT union put the number of Polish workers at 124, down from the 500 originally due to arrive for a stint in France. 

France's economy is expected to shrink 11% this year, with big job losses following the pandemic and ensuing lockdown, heightening sensitivity over labour wrangling.

1690,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",Wall Street Is Prepping for Fresh Waves of Market Volatility,"(Bloomberg) -- Right on cue, fresh waves of selling are hitting Wall Street trading desks as signs emerge of a second virus outbreak.
Infection cases from America, China and Turkey are giving traders renewed ammo to bet against V-shaped recovery hopes that have helped send the investing world from depression to euphoria in less than 100 days.
In a revival of the market panic last week, the S&P 500 is trading below the 3,000 level, 10-year Treasury yields are sinking below 0.7%, while oil futures in New York are falling near $35 a barrel.
Here are signs of traders are prepping for dangers ahead across the world’s largest debt, equity and volatility markets:
Relentless demand for the safety of U.S. bonds continues anew with hedge funds and other large speculators flipping to long U.S. 10-year Treasury futures for the first time since 2017, according to the latest CFTC data.
All this is putting the prospect of two-year Treasury yields falling to 0% back in the spotlight.
A fresh bout of sharp stock moves may do it -- something traders are currently positioning for. The futures curve for the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has moved back to a downward-sloping state. Known as backwardation, this shows investors are fretting the near-term outlook equity outlook, after the S&P 500’s more than 40% surge in little more than two months.
All told the threat of outsized stock swings -- the volatility of volatility -- is looming over the rally that added $21 trillion to global indexes.
The jump in the Cboe VVIX Index, which represents the expected volatility of 30-day forward prices for the VIX Index, shows no sign of abating even as the fear gauge retreats from levels last seen in April.
Another worrisome sign: Hedges on the dollar rallying again are rising, a prospect that would tighten international financial conditions in its wake.
Options contracts that pay out if the greenback strengthens over the next month are the most expensive in three weeks. The fact that the price is rising in tandem with currency volatility across tenors shows just how much havens are back in demand.
Over in credit land, European investors are nervous again. The iShares Core EUR Corp Bond UCITS ETF, the region’s largest exchange-based credit fund, saw three straight days of outflows to Friday, for the first time since late March. Investors pulled out more than 300 million euros ($337 million) from the product.
Similarly, the cost of insuring against a default by a European company rose last week by 11 basis points, the most in more than two months.
Their peers lower down in the capital structure are dialing back any optimism that the consumption and investment cycle will stage a spirited rebound.
Dividend futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 have plunged again over the past week -- falling far more than the underlying benchmark -- in a sign of returning anxiety that companies will cut payouts in the continued economic crash.

1695,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 09:37AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Sharply Lower on Virus 2nd Wave Fears,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Monday, with investors dumping cyclical stocks in particular after a brief and heady run of outperformance in the latter half of May. 
Reports of fresh outbreaks of Covid-19 in Beijing and Tokyo further inflamed nerves at a time when a number of U.S. states have also witnessed rising numbers of new cases. The drip-feed of such news has raised fears of a second wave of infections. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 654 points, or 2.6%, at 24,951 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4%, regaining its more familiar role as the best performing of the three indices as investors sought safety in those companies with the most reliable growth prospects in the post-Coronavirus world.
Such stocks included children's media company Genius Brands (NASDAQ:GNUS), whose stock rose 7.9% after the company announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger, the star of the Terminator series of movies and subsequently Governor of California, had agreed to become a significant investor. Schwarzenegger will accept warrants on Genius Brands stock in return for his role starring in and producing the company's cartoons.
They also included biotech company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock, which rose 5.1% after it announced a strategic partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) under which the big box retailer will add some 1,200 of Shopify's sellers to its own e-commerce marketplace. Shopify stock has now roughly doubled this year.
By contrast, the sharpest losses came among more traditional companies whose business models had been rocked by the coronavirus pandemic, travel stocks above all. 
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock led the rest of the airline sector lower, after the company warned that it expects to burn an average of $40 million a day in the current quarter, narrowing to only $30 million in the third quarter. The update was a reminder of how slow and gradual the improvement in airlines' fortunes is likely to be, even if the U.S. economy can continue its reopening without fresh setbacks.
Likewise Hertz Global stock (NYSE:HTZ) fell nearly 10% after filing to issue up to $500 million in stock, even though it warned in the filing that the shares could be worthless. The car rental company is currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeedings, meaning that the proceeds of any stock sale are likely to go more or less directly to its creditors. According to Investing.com data, Hertz had over $18 billion in debt at the end of March and only $3 billion of cash and receivables.
Elsewhere, BP ADRs (NYSE:BP) fell 5.2% after the company said it expected to write down its assets by as much as $17.5 billion in the second quarter due to lower long-term expectations for oil prices. U.S. Crude futures, which had rallied strongly in anticipation of a rebalancing of the global oil market in recent weeks, fell 3.3% to $35.08 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 1.6% to $38.11.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",China halts European salmon imports over suspected link to virus outbreak,"By Nerijus Adomaitis and Kate Kelland
OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - China has halted imports from European salmon suppliers amid fears they might be linked to a coronavirus outbreak at a Beijing market, although experts say the fish itself is unlikely to carry the disease.
State-run newspapers reported the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at Beijing's Xinfadi market, the source of a cluster of infections that has sparked fears of a second wave of the pandemic in China. 
The reports prompted major supermarkets in Beijing to remove salmon from their shelves.
""We can't send any salmon to China now, the market is closed,"" Regin Jacobsen, CEO of Oslo-listed salmon supplier Bakkafrost, told Reuters.
""We have stopped all sales to China and are waiting for the situation to be clarified,"" said Stein Martinsen, head of sales and marketing at Norway Royal Salmon.
Genetic traces of the virus from the Beijing market outbreak suggested it could have come from Europe.
Keith Neal, an emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain's University of Nottingham, said any link to salmon was likely the result of cross contamination.
""Markets can be crowded places, so like in Wuhan, (they) help fuel spread,"" he said, referring to the Chinese city where the virus originated. 
Neal said finding a link to Europe was not surprising, given the global spread of the virus.
""China gave the world this virus and it was always very likely to give it back to them. Finding a strain prevalent in Europe probably reflects people returning to China after travelling to Europe,"" he said.
Norway's Food Safety Authority said there was no evidence fish could be infected.
Shares in Norway Royal Salmon, Faroe Islands-based Bakkafrost (OL:BAKKA) and Norway's Mowi (OL:MOWI) and Salmar (OL:SALM) were down 3-5% at 1225 GMT.
Both Bakkafrost and Norway Royal Salmon said employees had been tested for the virus, and none had tested positive.
China accounts for about 5% of global salmon demand, according to Bakkafrost.

Order cancellations were limited to China and had not affected other markets, said the Norwegian Seafood Council, a marketing firm.
